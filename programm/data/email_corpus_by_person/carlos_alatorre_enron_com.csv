anyone in the biz can become a member of the exchange the rates are assessed by a panel consisting of brokers ONLY a total of different brokerage firms that more or less look at the tanker market activity for the day and average what has been reported as done The tanker market for the most part is very transparent in Norway in France in the US in London As you can see it is more popular in London This relates to the exact same concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight market The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T route MT loads Puerto La Cruz PLC and discharges Corpus Christi described as caribs to USG The flat rate ws published by WorldScale ws for the year actual voyage PLC to corpus is pmt As u can see by the

making points on the pmt flat which pmt x mt cargo USD vice versa if you bought at ws The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London trades T North Sea to Cont We have a trading department here that should have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it pertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight In addition we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul crude market particularly with recent purchases of Columbian stems of the chartering for this market is done in the States and of the international owners have commercial representation in the States Route T has the volatility to swing from ws to ws over a months time contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any market when broken down For example SupplyDemand Scenarios assume there are stems in a month and only boats that can make the different dates and if only of those boats are acceptable by the majors or anyone else that is worried about spill liability sanctions combined with a herd mentality that trades on a last done philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC Mexico where day turnaround voyages can increase to days MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the bbl market Basic API gravity conversion for crude is bbls pmt hence x mt bbls This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market caribs to usg where the refineries are because they are the biggest boats you can get into most of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft LOA etc This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in but allows the traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider range of buyers When the big boats VLCCs very large crude carriers usually million bbl plus boats come to the USG from the Persian Gulf West Africa North Sea etc they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered or off loaded to mt boats to then bring the crude in I apologize if this is remedial for any readers In any event when the USG sees a surge in big ships coming west to the states the mt boats get sucked up by the lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to get tight which means rates will swing hard Currently it is a weak market at the x ws level On average there are approximately physical cargos pmonth for the caribs or the T route For the most part the breakdown is as follows Mexico Cayo Arcas Pajaritos Mayan Isthmus Olmeca crude mainly dominated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they deliver them cpp from the USG Citgo has a few as does Valero who will probably have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining Orion Coastal Fina Conoco Koch Chevron etc Venezuela Puerto la Cruz Amuay Puerto Miranda la Salina Bajo grande etc players are PDV Lyondell BP ExxonMob Conoco Orion Coastal etc Columbia same players We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns Why would this work here in the States With the recent surge in volatility a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their asss handed to them Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading Some of the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such as contact of affreightments COAs For example Lyondell has a COA with different owners to provide ships per month that totals moves pmo for years The freight rates are settled off a to point formula off Mardata Lloyds register which they in turn can hedge with Online Owners who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish if have an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash flows Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it to the market unfortunately for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to deal with on physical vessel trading In addition the freight people are not going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line that trading Department Heads might have In house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced much more activity in then what we have seen thus far in A combined result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rates which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well as limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any supply contracts here in Houston as when we had jet stems gas oil stems and mogas stems pmonth with the vens In addition we had more spot biz with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast SAmerica Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off we would once again be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far in ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets The US broker MJLF particularly Bob Flynn has been trying to get this off the ground now for over years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Citibank Reason being Citibank wasnt calling the market but was interested in it from a commission standpoint as was the case with mjlf but setting up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership FIynn presently has a seller for voyages pmonth starting in July The pricing would be the first days and last days of each month at ws he has a bid of so theres a lot of middle ground to get this done This is always the case and is why in the States there have only been about deals concluded overall Flynn whose motivation is commissions can be viewed as either a competitor of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment For it would be in his best interest for there to be high activity and as he is the only one presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be easy to manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel If this was to take off to the level that Enron has taken other markets whereby futures rates are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are being done off of different pricing scenarios ie months average specific day closes first halfnd half etc if it became so big that sellers werent just owners and bids werent just charterers but more of a global book balancing tool who knows what can be done The last time we tried to get this going was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the group who was coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen I believe it lost momentum with legal Since London has been able to get it going under the direction of Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here Scott advises me that he has the supportinfrastructure that enables him to still cover the physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as well as the global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we both follow now I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to pursue this and get it on the website I am by no means trying to pass the buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the freight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a explaining worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in London

with the vens In addition we had more spot biz with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast SAmerica Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off we would once again be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far in ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets The US broker MJLF particularly Bob Flynn has been trying to get this off the ground now for over years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Citibank Reason being Citibank wasnt calling the market but was interested in it from a commission standpoint as was the case with mjlf but setting up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership FIynn presently has a seller for voyages pmonth starting in July The pricing would be the first days and last days of each month at ws he has a bid of so theres a lot of middle ground to get this done This is always the case and is why in the States there have only been about deals concluded overall Flynn whose motivation is commissions can be viewed as either a competitor of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment For it would be in his best interest for there to be high activity and as he is the only one presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be easy to manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel If this was to take off to the level that Enron has taken other markets whereby futures rates are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are being done off of different pricing scenarios ie months average specific day closes first halfnd half etc if it became so big that sellers werent just owners and bids werent just charterers but more of a global book balancing tool who knows what can be done The last time we tried to get this going was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the group who was coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen I believe it lost momentum with legal Since London has been able to get it going under the direction of Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here Scott advises me that he has the supportinfrastructure that enables him to still cover the physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as well as the global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we both follow now I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to pursue this and get it on the website I am by no means trying to pass the buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the freight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a explaining worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in London
