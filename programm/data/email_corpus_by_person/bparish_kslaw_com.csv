<8920201.1075861742369.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bparish@kslaw.com,2001-10-09 12:39:35,RE Ft Pierce and MidwayKay please note the following responses to Stuart Zismans email of to you Correct The Option states that Optionee is permitted to disclose the terms of the agreement to Optionees accountants attorneys prospective lenders investment bankers underwriters rating agencies partners consultants and other advisors in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Option collectively Representatives to the extent that such Representatives reasonably need to know such information and data to assist and perform services on behalf of Optionee It may be a stretch but I might argue that potential bidders may be considered prospective lenders or partners in connection with the option and that they reasonably need to know such information Perhaps Enron should seek a waiver of this obligation from Optionors Furthermore it is correct that the option was not exercised based on the materials A Notice of Option to Purchase Real Estate dated May was submitted as part of rezoning application but upon further review it appears that it was not intended as an exercise of the option The comment noted in the Assignment of Option to Purchase Real Estate dated November was also submitted as part of the rezoning application and similarly not intended as an exercise of the option Please disregard the comment Correct Correct Correct Finally my review was limited to the documents that were sent over by you guys some months ago and I havent looked at DealBench recently Therefore as Stuart mentioned I need to confirm that I have reviewed everything I spoke to Stuart about this issue yesterday and he is aware that I have not had time to focus on Midway as much since weve been finalizing Doyle I told him that I still needed to go through Dealbench and that I would like to consolidate the two charts that I prepared into one chart Additionally I mentioned that I was revising the Midway PSA to include comments from the Enron team in connection with Doyle He told me to focus on Doyle for now and turn to Midway as soon as I had time I just sent out execution copies for Doyle and will turn to Midway right away I will redistribute the revised PSA and chart as soon as possible Best Regards William Parish King Spalding Louisiana Suite Houston Texas Phone Fax Email Original Message From Mann Kay mailtoKay NRONcom Sent Monday October PM To Subject FW Ft Pierce and Midway Original Message From Zisman Stuart Sent Monday October PM To Mann Kay Cc Clark Barton Subject RE Ft Pierce and Midway Kay I quickly reviewed the summaries of documents done by KS and have the following questionsconcerns Items and I assume that you concluded that the prohibition doesnt prevent disclosure of the agreement itself Item It sounds like this is a confidentiality problem Also did we really exercise the option or did we just extend it Item What is meant by the Comment section Item I assume that you concluded that the confidentiality provision did not restrict us from disclosing the agreement Item I assume that you concluded that the confidentiality provision did not restrict us from disclosing the agreement and Item I assume that the change of control provision does not extend to a sale of equity What about the other documents relating to Midway Are these the only significant ones DealBench has numerous docs relating to Midway and I need to be certain that all have been consideredreviewed Thanks for your help PS Kay have we spoken with the folks at Westinghouse on the Gleason settlement issue I was hoping that you would call the author of the last email from Westinghouse to try to articulate the reason for revising the language and follow that with a conference

this one but I wanted to check to make sure that you were still involved You may have given Sheila or Bart the info but just in case you didnt did the document review on Midway get completed Thanks Kay Original Message From Zisman Stuart Sent Thursday October AM To Mann Kay Clark Barton Cc Jacoby Ben Plauche Stephen Hoff Jonathan Subject Ft Pierce and Midway Bart and Kay In preparation for providing potential purchasers with access to DealBench expected as soon as October nd I wanted to determine whether all of the documents on DealBench have been reviewed to consider whether their disclosure or the anticipated sale will cause a problem or violate the terms of any agreement At our kickoff meeting in midJuly I cant remember if Kay was there we discussed having the documents reviewed by for i confidentiality provisions ii restrictions on transferability iii continuing liability for Enron or it affiliates in the form of guarantees etc and iv unusual termination rights that might be triggered by a sale of the project My team is in the process of cleaning up DealBench in preparation for providing access to second round bidders We are focusing primarily on organization making sure that the documents are the most recent and accurate drafts with cooperation from Bens group and determining whether the documents contain information on other development sites or project which would require redaction We have stumbled across a couple of confidentiality provisions in the Midway Interconnection Feasibility Study Agreements specifically documents and on DealBench and wanted to know if i legal is ok with them and ii whether all of the other documents have been reviewed ie are there similar provisions in other documents Please let me know what has been or will be done in this regard Thanks in advance for your assistance Stuart PS Kay I sent Bart a message yesterday regarding the need to prepare forms of purchase and sale agreement for each of the projects My understanding is that you may have already prepared a form for the sale of Midway Please coordinate with Bart to develop a form that works for both projects with the understanding that there may need to be some differences between the two because of differences in the projects Under separate cover I will forward to you a copy of the email that I sent yesterday This email is the property of Enron
