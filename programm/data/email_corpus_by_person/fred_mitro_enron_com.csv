<11319288.1075845604498.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,fred.mitro@enron.com,2000-09-28 06:34:00,Re Status of the Lincoln Energy CenterBoseoManhattan matter Cc Yes My view of the remaining activities is as follows We Mark GershonKaren Waymyself are currently working with the Village of Manhattan to fufil our obligation under the Annexation Agreement to complete certain roadway improvements The Village has conducted a bid process and selected a winning bidder to complete the work Unfortunately no bidders submitted a fixed price bid to the Village The Village wants us to assume the financial risk up to k of any cost overruns We have pointed out that the annexation Agreement does not require us to assume that risk We are attempting to work this situation out with the Village Karen Way is working with Chicago Title to bring to closure the issues related to the pipeline lateral easements and obtain the title policy on the entire lateral It was recently brought to our attention that during the pipelines construction the lateral was routed across a piece of Peoples Energy property without an easement being executed The pipeline project manager Dave Lazzarro is currently working to obtain this easement Stuart Can you confirm for Karenmyself if the Northern Border easement was recorded Markmyself are working with the Village and the plant manager on these issues There are only a couple of improvements still remaining to be completed including a ditch being regraded and possibly a road regraded with gravel This should represent a small time commitment to close out Markmyself are working with the Village on this issue We have notified our surveyor of our need to prepare platts of dedication for the two roadways bordering the project site The first one to be completed should be Pauling road since that is the roadway that issue relates to the project owns to the middle of the roadway we do not wish construction workers working on our property and creating any potential liability There are no current plans for expansion of the facility so this item should require negligible work We have filed an air permit application for an additional FA turbine at the Project but this is just to allow for expansion if we choose to do so The annexation Agreement allows us to expand the facility without any additional local approvals Additional I have had discussions with Merle Churchill plant manager regarding the potential purpose of an acre parcel nearby Merle has been approached by a local electrical contractor who would like to relocate his shop out to the county This acre parcel would be ideal and would allow us to close out a potential sound receptor necessary for the expansion turbine Also the potential need for a special use permit for the generator lead needs to be evaluated I will talk with Mark Gershon on this issue If we decide to proceed then this would likely be a month project similar to what we completed on the facility last year In general I am working to wrap up Piper RudnicksPR work on the Lincoln Energy Center ASAP With regard to other Illinois development sites Pontiac and Plano I have tried to keep the majority of the work to Mark Gershon and Karen Way There have been some cases where others were needed and I have tried to limit their roles to very short specific engagements environmental sound real estate I met with Chris Townsend weeks ago and stressed our desire to have Mark and Karen handling the majority of the development work in my opinion they are the best and most productive uses of personnel at PR The rapid speed of our development activities at Plano and Pontiac have required them to take on very integrated roles This pushes the costs up but also is a big part of our successes thereby eliminating the need to recomplete numerous stages of the lengthy zoning process which exist in Illinois counties Having said that we need to watch PR and their charges closely as they have a tendency to want to involve additional people into our development activities Call me to discuss Fred From Stuart Zisman on AM To Fred CT cc Subject Status of the Lincoln Energy CenterBoseoManhattan matter Any thoughts

I received your voicemail late on Friday and will forward the August invoices to Shelia Tweed as you requested Additionally I contacted Mark Gershon and Karen Way to confirm the current status of the Lincoln Energy CenterBoseoManhattan matter While the most significant annexation and zoning issues have been addressed by establishing the zoning and annexation agreement for the Lincoln Energy Center there remain certain ongoing matters in which the firm may be involved including the following Finalizing the terms of the Roadway Construction Escrow Trust and Disbursing Agreement with the Village of Manhattan and addressing roadway construction issues Completing the review of all pipeline easements with Peoples Energy and Chicago Title Insurance Company and securing the issuance of the final master Title Policy Completing those outstanding improvements on the facility property currently covered by the Corporate Guaranty in the possession of the Village of Manhattan Completing the dedication of surrounding roadways Addressing any potential expansion or modification of the Project Additionally Fred Mitro has indicated that ENA may a acquire additional nearby property andor b secure a final Special Use Permit over the Interconnection through Will County As always please do not hesitate to contact me Mark Gershon or Karen Way if you have any questions Additionally please

cc Kathleen nron Fred CT Kay nron bcc Rusty StevensCorpEnron Subject Schaeffer Option Agreement I spoke to Kevin Schaeffer and agreed to the following items in exchange for finalizing this option This is the final real estate option that we will need to perfect this site with the exception of gas pipeline easements Exercise of option I agreed that we would not exercise the option until after March th I told him that since his parcel was not for the location of the actual plant that we could delay exercising until then He is buying another tract and wanted to use it as offset for capital gains which led to the next point LikeKind Exchange Provision I agreed that we would incorporate the ability for him to attempt to purchase another parcel in order for him to be able to avoid capital gains taxes on the property Basically the same language we used on the nearby Ledford tract is what Im talking about Should be very similar since its a small town and they will undoubtedly talk about this eventually so we need to be consistent Farm Usage He seemed to think that the document was not entirely clear that he would have the right to farm this parcel once we exercised our purchase option I told him that was not true and that our intention was to let him have the right to responsibly farm the property any time we were not using it for our own purposes I let him know that we could not have any restrictions on moving onto the property and would pay for any damages but once we ceased use for days I think it was then he could request to recommence farming operations and we would not unreasonably decline his request However I let him know that we would reserve to once again begin use of the property for our purposes and our only obligation would be to compensate him for crop damages I let him know our motive was to keep as much open land in agricultural use for PR purposes and to get an Ag exemption If we werent using it he could farm it and we had no intention of removing him and replacing him with another tenant farmer negligence on his part being an exception Please feel free to work with his attorney and get these changes implemented promptly As you know we have had solicitations from rd parties to buy this site and having this tract secured is vital to the sites perfection The information contained in this communication may be confidential is intended

Development Program Enron hereby submits its recommendations to the Management Committee for their consideration regarding the pending Torrence south parcel land acquisition decision After reviewing the relevant commercial legal and environmental issues with the respective Project Managers and development personnel Enron recommends that the following courses of action be undertaken PERC should notify Peoples Gas Light Coke PGL on that PERC does not intend to assume the role of Buyer as provided for in the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on Assuming that PGL assumes the role of Buyer under the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on and PGL proceeds to the scheduled closing PERC and Enron should continue their due diligence and development activities on the Torrence south parcel Upon establishment of a proposed budget and schedule these activities should be focused on achieving the goals of minimizing outofpocket development expenses and implementing prudent risk mitigation strategies on behalf of PERC and Enron Assuming that PGL assumes the role of Buyer under the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on and PGL plans to proceed to the scheduled closing PERC and PGL should immediately begin preparation of the documents necessary to achieve the ICC approval of any future transfer salelease or alternative structure of the Torrence south parcel from PGL to Torrence Power LLC Other IssuesRisks This recommendation is based upon the belief that although the Torrence south parcel does hold potential value to PERC and Enron as a project development site the overall viability and riskreward profile of the commercial opportunity has not yet been sufficiently finalized The potential sources of value associated with this site are listed below a The siteproject currently hold a priority position in the ComEd interconnection queue b The site in combination with the Calumet project captures the majority of available interconnection capability MW in the Calumet region of the ComEd system This would force competing IPP projects ie Wizvest to bear the financial burden of ComEd system upgrade costs c The site in combination with the Calumet project represents an integral component of developing a commercial solution to the Mission EnergyComEd MW incity regulatory obligation to the city of the Chicago d The site represents one of the unique incity sites capable of supporting a power project from a zoning fuel supply and transmission perspective The factors contributing to the recommendation for PERC and Enron not to proceed to closing on are listed below a The existence of known environmental contamination and the liabilities associated with entering the chain of title on the Torrence south parcel b The indemnification language contained within the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on c The incomplete status of the overall commercial development opportunity associated with the Torrence south parcel d PERC and Enrons desire to maintain the flexibility to minimize development costs while further developing the commercial development opportunity and associated value proposition prior to executing an ICCapproved land transfer from PGL to Torrence Power LLC It is PERC and Enrons understanding that PGL plans to proceed to the closing on and assume the role of Buyer under the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on The south parcel represents a potential power plant development project site upon which PERC and Enron will continue to conduct due diligence and development activities The site is currently being evaluated as a candidate for a x LM facility with either an or inservice date PERC and Enron have decided that it would not be prudent for either of their respective organizations to assume any form of environmental liability associated with the Torrence south parcel PERC and Enron shall work to develop risk mitigation strategies including land options environmental indemnifications and other structures which protect their respective assets and the overall economic viability of a development project on the Torrence south parcel A potential risk associated with the above recommendations is that the time required to complete the ICC approval process necessary to transfer the Torrence south parcel from PGL to Torrence Power LLC PERC development personnel have estimated that the ICC approval process

Program Enron hereby submits its recommendations to the Management Committee for their consideration regarding the pending Torrence south parcel land acquisition decision After reviewing the relevant commercial legal and environmental issues with the respective Project Managers and development personnel Enron recommends that the following courses of action be undertaken PERC should notify Peoples Gas Light Coke PGL on that PERC does not intend to assume the role of Buyer as provided for in the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on Assuming that PGL assumes the role of Buyer under the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on and PGL proceeds to the scheduled closing PERC and Enron should continue their due diligence and development activities on the Torrence south parcel Upon establishment of a proposed budget and schedule these activities should be focused on achieving the goals of minimizing outofpocket development expenses and implementing prudent risk mitigation strategies on behalf of PERC and Enron Assuming that PGL assumes the role of Buyer under the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on and PGL plans to proceed to the scheduled closing PERC and PGL should immediately begin preparation of the documents necessary to achieve the ICC approval of any future transfer salelease or alternative structure of the Torrence south parcel from PGL to Torrence Power LLC Other IssuesRisks This recommendation is based upon the belief that although the Torrence south parcel does hold potential value to PERC and Enron as a project development site the overall viability and riskreward profile of the commercial opportunity has not yet been sufficiently finalized The potential sources of value associated with this site are listed below a The siteproject currently hold a priority position in the ComEd interconnection queue b The site in combination with the Calumet project captures the majority of available interconnection capability MW in the Calumet region of the ComEd system This would force competing IPP projects ie Wizvest to bear the financial burden of ComEd system upgrade costs c The site in combination with the Calumet project represents an integral component of developing a commercial solution to the Mission EnergyComEd MW incity regulatory obligation to the city of the Chicago d The site represents one of the unique incity sites capable of supporting a power project from a zoning fuel supply and transmission perspective The factors contributing to the recommendation for PERC and Enron not to proceed to closing on are listed below a The existence of known environmental contamination and the liabilities associated with entering the chain of title on the Torrence south parcel b The indemnification language contained within the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on c The incomplete status of the overall commercial development opportunity associated with the Torrence south parcel d PERC and Enrons desire to maintain the flexibility to minimize development costs while further developing the commercial development opportunity and associated value proposition prior to executing an ICCapproved land transfer from PGL to Torrence Power LLC It is PERC and Enrons understanding that PGL plans to proceed to the closing on and assume the role of Buyer under the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on The south parcel represents a potential power plant development project site upon which PERC and Enron will continue to conduct due diligence and development activities The site is currently being evaluated as a candidate for a x LM facility with either an or inservice date PERC and Enron have decided that it would not be prudent for either of their respective organizations to assume any form of environmental liability associated with the Torrence south parcel PERC and Enron shall work to develop risk mitigation strategies including land options environmental indemnifications and other structures which protect their respective assets and the overall economic viability of a development project on the Torrence south parcel A potential risk associated with the above recommendations is that the time required to complete the ICC approval process necessary to transfer the Torrence south parcel from PGL to Torrence Power LLC PERC development personnel have estimated that the ICC approval process could require up to months The transfer of the Calumet parcel was fasttracked and took months to achieve ICC approval This risk could impact the viability of an inservice date for a Torrence Power LLC development project PERC and Enron will work to minimize the impact of this risk PERC and Enron shall work to develop a binding agreement which specifies an approval and costsharing mechanism for future development decisions on the Torrence south parcel Such an agreement shall also specify a formula for the sharing of proceeds associated with the marketingselldown strategy currently under development by PERC and Enron for all of the Chicago development projects Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or wish to discuss the above recommendations and information Fred Mitro

Development Program Enron hereby submits its recommendations to the Management Committee for their consideration regarding the pending Torrence south parcel land acquisition decision After reviewing the relevant commercial legal and environmental issues with the respective Project Managers and development personnel Enron recommends that the following courses of action be undertaken PERC should notify Peoples Gas Light Coke PGL on that PERC does not intend to assume the role of Buyer as provided for in the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on Assuming that PGL assumes the role of Buyer under the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on and PGL proceeds to the scheduled closing PERC and Enron should continue their due diligence and development activities on the Torrence south parcel Upon establishment of a proposed budget and schedule these activities should be focused on achieving the goals of minimizing outofpocket development expenses and implementing prudent risk mitigation strategies on behalf of PERC and Enron Assuming that PGL assumes the role of Buyer under the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on and PGL plans to proceed to the scheduled closing PERC and PGL should immediately begin preparation of the documents necessary to achieve the ICC approval of any future transfer salelease or alternative structure of the Torrence south parcel from PGL to Torrence Power LLC Other IssuesRisks This recommendation is based upon the belief that although the Torrence south parcel does hold potential value to PERC and Enron as a project development site the overall viability and riskreward profile of the commercial opportunity has not yet been sufficiently finalized The potential sources of value associated with this site are listed below a The siteproject currently hold a priority position in the ComEd interconnection queue b The site in combination with the Calumet project captures the majority of available interconnection capability MW in the Calumet region of the ComEd system This would force competing IPP projects ie Wizvest to bear the financial burden of ComEd system upgrade costs c The site in combination with the Calumet project represents an integral component of developing a commercial solution to the Mission EnergyComEd MW incity regulatory obligation to the city of the Chicago d The site represents one of the unique incity sites capable of supporting a power project from a zoning fuel supply and transmission perspective The factors contributing to the recommendation for PERC and Enron not to proceed to closing on are listed below a The existence of known environmental contamination and the liabilities associated with entering the chain of title on the Torrence south parcel b The indemnification language contained within the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on c The incomplete status of the overall commercial development opportunity associated with the Torrence south parcel d PERC and Enrons desire to maintain the flexibility to minimize development costs while further developing the commercial development opportunity and associated value proposition prior to executing an ICCapproved land transfer from PGL to Torrence Power LLC It is PERC and Enrons understanding that PGL plans to proceed to the closing on and assume the role of Buyer under the terms of the land purchase Agreement executed between PGL and Air Liquide on The south parcel represents a potential power plant development project site upon which PERC and Enron will continue to conduct due diligence and development activities The site is currently being evaluated as a candidate for a x LM facility with either an or inservice date PERC and Enron have decided that it would not be prudent for either of their respective organizations to assume any form of environmental liability associated with the Torrence south parcel PERC and Enron shall work to develop risk mitigation strategies including land options environmental indemnifications and other structures which protect their respective assets and the overall economic viability of a development project on the Torrence south parcel A potential risk associated with the above recommendations is that the time required to complete the ICC approval process necessary to transfer the Torrence south parcel from PGL to Torrence Power LLC PERC development personnel have estimated that the ICC approval process could require up to months The transfer of the Calumet parcel was fasttracked and took months to achieve ICC approval This risk could impact the viability of an inservice date for a Torrence Power LLC development project PERC and Enron will work to minimize the impact of this risk PERC and Enron shall work to develop a binding agreement which specifies an approval and costsharing mechanism for future development decisions on the Torrence south parcel Such an agreement shall also specify a formula for the sharing of proceeds associated with the marketingselldown strategy currently under development by PERC and Enron for all of the Chicago development projects Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or wish to discuss the above recommendations and information Fred Mitro
