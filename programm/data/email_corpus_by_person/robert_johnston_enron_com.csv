short of market and creditor expectations Bankruptcy appears increasingly likely but the dynamics of a Ch proceeding remain unclear SoCal Edison is likely to be the first in Ch following its suspended payments to creditors yesterday and is now in a day cure period Attempts to bring in the assets of the parent companies are unlikely to succeed Bankruptcy would provide Davis with some political cover to implement the tough decisions that he has so far avoided on the questions of rate hikes and other costs to taxpayers connected to the proposed operations of the California Power Authority Legislation Passes Assembly But Generators and Consumers Remain Unhappy The first legislation AB X passed the California general assembly last night but both generators and consumers are unhappy with the terms Generators object to the cent per KWH price in the proposed longterm contract while consumer groups such as the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights object to the state acting as a purchaser of power The legislation is expected to pass the Senate today and to be signed by Governor Davis as early as tonight Press and source reporting this morning confirms that the principal financial creditors and utility analysts are also unimpressed with the bill which is viewed as insubstantial and falling short of creating a solution to the financial pressures on the utilities Financial Institutions Exposure to California Utilities Bank of America million JP Morgan million There is a total of billion in outstanding loans but much of this arranged by Societe General is to the parents National Energy Group and Edison International The million mentioned above is the most immediate concern The Southern California Edison loans are subject to immediate repayment in the aftermath of yesterdays rating downgrade to junk status The Fed will not be involved except in a routine way as a bank regulator making sure that the appropriate risk reserves are made against the utilities loans and securities There is no moral hazard here because the Fed is not going to guarantee any of the utilities credits which by the way they do not have the authority to do PGENational Energy Group Shielding Assets Despite considerable anger at PGE for reorganizing to shield its profitable assets from its debtplagued utility business it would seem that Davis has little authority to intervene The question of fraudulent conveyance which is a term in bankruptcy law for transferring assets to favored parties not long before a filing which transfer can then be reversed by the court would not seem to apply here since PGE went through a regulatory process before FERC to seek approval for the reorganization on Friday While courts are reluctant to overturn regulatory agencies impaired creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding could attempt an appeal Involuntary Bankruptcy Which Creditor Moves First As for who is likely to move first it is typically the smaller creditors or those who wont receive a good price on postpetition business In this situation our source does not know who that would be but believes it is more likely that the utilities will file a voluntary petition before one of their major creditors files an involuntary petition If Dynergy files a petition with a federal bankruptcy court today the debtor utilities can delay the process for weeks if they choose to particularly since there is no allegation of fraud or criminal misappropriation of assets In bankruptcy proceedings which is what is going on here this sort of talk by a creditor such as Dynegy is just the usual polite conversational opener akin to comments about the weather or inquiries about ones familys health Edison Teetering on the Brink Moves Into Day Cure Period Yesterday Southern California Edison temporarily suspended a million bond principal and interest payments as well as million to suppliers of renewable power and million due to the California PX Both utilities are under severe shortterm debt pressure but Edison is in the worst position Edison Due Thursday Dynegy note Dynegy has threaten to take take Edison into bankruptcy court if they default PGE Current available M in cash and reserves Due Feb st M to ISO th M to California Power Exchange Contrary to press reports and leaks from the Governors office yesterday about political brinksmanship Edison is clearly not playing negotiating games and is really short of cash In this situation it is unlikely that its executives will be making fraudulent statements The bonds on which they failed to pay would have a day cure period After that the trustees will move on Edison if Edison has not already filed They have three ways of financing power purchases going forward the state continues to buy power and sell Edison and PGE power on a shortterm basis under existing authority or pending the passage of todays legislation the state legislature authorizes the purchase of power through longterm contracts under the proposed borrowing authority or Edison files for reorganization under Chapter and obtains almost immediately superpriority postpetition lines of credit secured against its unmortgaged assets which it uses to pay for power until the PUC and the rest of the state government recognize that rates have to increase New Hampshire Experience A Guide for Davis Following the bankruptcy of the Public Service Company of New Hampshire the bankruptcy judge was authorized by a higher court to mandate rate hikes The prospect of imposed rate hikes from the bankruptcy court caused the state government to subsequently determine that rate hikes to consumers were unavoidable passing a seven year rate hike of percent For Davis a similar scenario would provide him with some political cover if he were forced by the bankruptcy court to pass through rate hikes as part of a settlement

James D nron Richard nron Jaime nron John CT Jeff CT Kristin CT Scott nron Subject California Power As talks continued toward the Tuesday deadline markets have been focused on for the California electricity crisis state officials around Governor Gray Davis have toughened up their rhetoric on a couple of fronts even as they confirmed they would be in the market as early as Tuesday taking bids for energy to be paid by the State of California One problem on that front is still how much producers want to charge the state for electricity As we reported last week Davis and his aides want to pay around to dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want about Treasury Secretary Summers has suggested an auction as the best way to determine the price but California officials are taking a less free market approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over longterm contracts Our sources in Washington Sacramento and California are increasingly of the view that Governor Davis is positioning his government to establish longterm power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term This weeks legislative activities in Sacramento will create the vehicle to do so State credit backing purchases of power would obviate the need for superpriority borrowing to finance power purchases after utility bankruptcy Audit Untangling Utility Relationships California officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that half of the to billion the utilities say they owe is actually owed to themselves for power they bought from their corporate relations This strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both the powergenerating and powerdistributing companies under a holding company umbrella Of course that means that some of the power PGE and Southern California Edison bought at highly inflated prices was bought from themselves But it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations Sources confirm that Davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part of any potential solution He told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to use state credit to eliminate the risky debt premium that PGE and SCE are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and that he is willing to extend the current rate increase utility customers are paying far beyond the initial day deadline In return he is demanding that the companies prepare to share the burden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension Debt Restructuring Guarantees but No Direct State Money Davis also told the videoconference that he believes the billion in back debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up during a day forbearance period whether that period has been agreed to by all creditors is not something we are clear about right now Davis idea as he laid it out in the meeting is to use the forbearance period to securitize the debts and sell them against the utilities forward rate base or by establishing a mediumterm repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees In both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to paydown their debt One of the reasons Davis wants to stay close to the megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can pay down this debt There is a strong chance that Davis will agree to use state guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations but he remains opposed to using direct state money This frustrates both Clinton administration and utility creditors but Davis has not yet shown much flexibility Eminent DomainReregulation Perhaps most frustrating to the Washington DC free market crowd at Treasury and the White House was the continued comfort Davis and his group of political advisers have with nonmarket solutions to the energy crisis Although the Governors aides actually believe the weapon is more a way to force eventual agreement than an actual solution the talk returns frequently to these nonmarket mechanisms We have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by the Tuesday deadline If we make no progress If this thing looks like it will turn into a genuine crisis then we will use our powers of condemnation and we will retake the plants and equipment and run them ourselves a close political aide to Davis said We will absorb the plants the transmission lines and the reserved parking places of the executives The legislature would agree in a second

short of market and creditor expectations Bankruptcy appears increasingly likely but the dynamics of a Ch proceeding remain unclear SoCal Edison is likely to be the first in Ch following its suspended payments to creditors yesterday and is now in a day cure period Attempts to bring in the assets of the parent companies are unlikely to succeed Bankruptcy would provide Davis with some political cover to implement the tough decisions that he has so far avoided on the questions of rate hikes and other costs to taxpayers connected to the proposed operations of the California Power Authority Legislation Passes Assembly But Generators and Consumers Remain Unhappy The first legislation AB X passed the California general assembly last night but both generators and consumers are unhappy with the terms Generators object to the cent per KWH price in the proposed longterm contract while consumer groups such as the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights object to the state acting as a purchaser of power The legislation is expected to pass the Senate today and to be signed by Governor Davis as early as tonight Press and source reporting this morning confirms that the principal financial creditors and utility analysts are also unimpressed with the bill which is viewed as insubstantial and falling short of creating a solution to the financial pressures on the utilities Financial Institutions Exposure to California Utilities Bank of America million JP Morgan million There is a total of billion in outstanding loans but much of this arranged by Societe General is to the parents National Energy Group and Edison International The million mentioned above is the most immediate concern The Southern California Edison loans are subject to immediate repayment in the aftermath of yesterdays rating downgrade to junk status The Fed will not be involved except in a routine way as a bank regulator making sure that the appropriate risk reserves are made against the utilities loans and securities There is no moral hazard here because the Fed is not going to guarantee any of the utilities credits which by the way they do not have the authority to do PGENational Energy Group Shielding Assets Despite considerable anger at PGE for reorganizing to shield its profitable assets from its debtplagued utility business it would seem that Davis has little authority to intervene The question of fraudulent conveyance which is a term in bankruptcy law for transferring assets to favored parties not long before a filing which transfer can then be reversed by the court would not seem to apply here since PGE went through a regulatory process before FERC to seek approval for the reorganization on Friday While courts are reluctant to overturn regulatory agencies impaired creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding could attempt an appeal Involuntary Bankruptcy Which Creditor Moves First As for who is likely to move first it is typically the smaller creditors or those who wont receive a good price on postpetition business In this situation our source does not know who that would be but believes it is more likely that the utilities will file a voluntary petition before one of their major creditors files an involuntary petition If Dynergy files a petition with a federal bankruptcy court today the debtor utilities can delay the process for weeks if they choose to particularly since there is no allegation of fraud or criminal misappropriation of assets In bankruptcy proceedings which is what is going on here this sort of talk by a creditor such as Dynegy is just the usual polite conversational opener akin to comments about the weather or inquiries about ones familys health Edison Teetering on the Brink Moves Into Day Cure Period Yesterday Southern California Edison temporarily suspended a million bond principal and interest payments as well as million to suppliers of renewable power and million due to the California PX Both utilities are under severe shortterm debt pressure but Edison is in the worst position Edison Due Thursday Dynegy note Dynegy has threaten to take take Edison into bankruptcy court if they default PGE Current available M in cash and reserves Due Feb st M to ISO th M to California Power Exchange Contrary to press reports and leaks from the Governors office yesterday about political brinksmanship Edison is clearly not playing negotiating games and is really short of cash In this situation it is unlikely that its executives will be making fraudulent statements The bonds on which they failed to pay would have a day cure period After that the trustees will move on Edison if Edison has not already filed They have three ways of financing power purchases going forward the state continues to buy power and sell Edison and PGE power on a shortterm basis under existing authority or pending the passage of todays legislation the state legislature authorizes the purchase of power through longterm contracts under the proposed borrowing authority or Edison files for reorganization under Chapter and obtains almost immediately superpriority postpetition lines of credit secured against its unmortgaged assets which it uses to pay for power until the PUC and the rest of the state government recognize that rates have to increase New Hampshire Experience A Guide for Davis Following the bankruptcy of the Public Service Company of New Hampshire the bankruptcy judge was authorized by a higher court to mandate rate hikes The prospect of imposed rate hikes from the bankruptcy court caused the state government to subsequently determine that rate hikes to consumers were unavoidable passing a seven year rate hike of percent For Davis a similar scenario would provide him with some political cover if he were forced by the bankruptcy court to pass through rate hikes as part of a settlement

Jihad against the US if Afghanistan targeted heightening expectations for retaliatory attacks against US targets Bush stokes unease among allies and international press with call for Bin Ladin to be brought to the US dead or alive Taliban offers to deliver Bin Ladin to a third country likely a Muslim country Offer almost certain to be rejected by Bush Administration FBI arrests five additional suspected hijackers raising expectations for further attacks US officials to meet with Saudi Foreign Minister in Washington questions to be asked about involvement of sons of Saudi diplomat in attacks Analysis Efforts by the Bush Administration to build a multilateral coalition against terrorism will have to address two key foreign policy issues Iraq and the IsraelPalestinian peace process Missteps in either area could weaken the emerging multilateral coalition against terrorism and have important implications for the oil market For a multilateral approach to work in the long term the Administration will need to provide countries with incentives to cooperate in the antiterrorism campaign especially in places such as the moderate Arab states where dismantling the networks suspected of supporting terrorist groups will involve moving against internal targets Moreover the Administration will need to deal with the root causes that provide willing cadres to extremist groups especially economic problems and political disenfranchisement Dealing with all of these factors will necessitate US financial support as well as greater US imagination in dealing with lingering regional issues Policy towards Iraq Washington appears to be resisting attempts to broaden its attacks to include Iraq at this point despite internal and external pressure for such action This will be a leading indicator assuming that no firm proof of Baghdads involvement in the bombings is uncovered A more aggressive US approach towards Iraq has seemed likely since July when Moscow blocked the introduction of smart sanctions during the last rollover of the OilforFood program However given regional sensitivities in the Arab world to Washingtons Iraq policy and the interests that states such as Russia and to a lesser extent China have in the country the Bush Administration cannot have both a genuinely multilateral approach to antiterrorism and an unilateral hardline Iraqi policy It will need to chose between one or the other IsraeliPalestinian peace process Without an equitable solution to this conflict most experts believe that the Bush teams antiterrorism coalition is doomed to failure Initially at least the signs are not good the Sharon government in Israel has been resistant to US pressure to rein in its aggressive policies towards the Palestinians Washingtons willingness to confront Israel on this issue will give a clue to its willingness to stay the antiterrorism course and hold its broad coalition together Market Update US Equities Next hours seen as critical after

energyfinancial markets in phase twoof campaign Federal Reserve activity and nuclear plant security RJ Special ForcesLow Intensity Campaign Underway Sources agree that the US military operation in Afghanistan has begun Indications of special forces activity were strongly signaled when Taliban forces shot down a US Unmanned Aerial Vehicle UAV on Monday The UAV that was shot down a Predator has a range of less than miles suggesting that US special forces are closing in on Afghanistan Special forces units are concentrating on intelligence gathering and targeting key bin Ladin installations as well as attempting to locate bin Ladin himself As Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld noted yesterday there will not be a DDay as such The Afghanistan campaign at least initially will not be like Desert Storm where CNN cameras in Baghdad hotels offered realtime imagery of US air strikes The first phases of this war are being fought largely in secret punctuated intermittently by what little coverage the media can provide The action in phase one includes night raids a lot of smallscale special operations reconnaissance and when necessary direct contact raids A large military strike using airpower is also forthcoming but is unlikely to be reported in realtime Operational Security is Tight Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said US military officials will refuse to comment on anything that will endanger troops or operations And anyone that does talk to any of you about that is breaking federal criminal law and should be in jail Rumsfeld said When asked if he would lie to the press to disguise US military operations Rumsfeld said you never say never Next Phases of US Campaign More Important to Markets If US military action is limited to Afghanistan any immediate spike in oil prices is unlikely to endure because such a limited attack will not directly impact oil supply However US officials have said that the war on terrorism will go far beyond Afghanistan so markets will continue to exhibit some degree of uncertainty until further developments take place In the short term oil supplies would be most directly affected by strikes against Iraq But any spike might be short lived as OPEC has enough spare capacity to cover an Iraqi outage In the medium term oil markets might express fears over regional stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf regions as a result of US military strikes and possible subsequent terrorist attacks It is expected that Iraqi biologicalchemical weaponry will receive considerable attention in the days ahead and as has been widely reported there is a split in the Bush Administration over whether to include Iraq The Iraqi weapons of mass destruction capability is likely to once again complicate the rollover of the UN oilforfood program in December which could lead to the Iraqis removing their oil from the market independently of what is happening in Afghanistan Another key issue is whether the expected refugee crisis and rising Islamic radicalism will destabilize the nucleararmed Pakistani government Saudis Showing Increased Cooperation in Oil Policy and in Military Planning After a brief furor when the Saudi government announced that the US would not be able to expand its operations at the Prince Sultan Airbase near Riyahd USSaudi cooperation has improved The public announcement of the airbase prohibition had been a PR move by the Saudis to head off domestic accusations of handing blank checks to the USA CENTCOM has subsequently transferred its Ops Command to Saudi Arabia In addition the Saudis have responded to US pressure by officially severing relations with the Taliban In Vienna all indications are that the Saudis are working toward an OPEC agreement to keep the market well supplied with oil and to not take advantage of the political uncertainty affecting the crude markets by cutting production The most likely outcome is that OPEC will officially hold production at current levels but agree to limited cheating to ensure adequate supply Another possibility is that OPEC will lower the target range for the OPEC basket price that would take lower demand forecasts into account Either step would allow OPEC to preserve cohesion at a time of political and economic uncertainty If prices continue a rapid decline after the Vienna meeting Washington and Riyadh might come up with a politically correct way to spin an output reduction by blaming market volatility on speculators rather than on OPEC The cartel is likely to reconvene in early November to reassess market conditions Fed Shifts Its Model To Adapt to New Economic Reality The Fed is still struggling to answers for what recent events will do to the economy but its clear that three elements of their model have fundamentally changed The most important is a significant drop in all aspects of individuals and companies risk tolerance which must be reversed quickly The Fed has done its bit by stabilizing the financial system and Congress is stepping in with a total stimulus package of billion Greenspan supports bln On the diplomaticmilitary side the balanced multilateral approach of the administration together with discreet pressure on OPEC to reduce prices is all designed to stabilize expectations and boost sentiment On rates while the Fed is expected to keep cutting they wont disappoint the market sources report that Greenspan is actually quite comfortable using liquidity to alter actual Fed Funds rather than changing official rates However the Fed governors are increasingly convinced that sentiment really depends

energyfinancial markets in phase twoof campaign Federal Reserve activity and nuclear plant security RJ Special ForcesLow Intensity Campaign Underway Sources agree that the US military operation in Afghanistan has begun Indications of special forces activity were strongly signaled when Taliban forces shot down a US Unmanned Aerial Vehicle UAV on Monday The UAV that was shot down a Predator has a range of less than miles suggesting that US special forces are closing in on Afghanistan Special forces units are concentrating on intelligence gathering and targeting key bin Ladin installations as well as attempting to locate bin Ladin himself As Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld noted yesterday there will not be a DDay as such The Afghanistan campaign at least initially will not be like Desert Storm where CNN cameras in Baghdad hotels offered realtime imagery of US air strikes The first phases of this war are being fought largely in secret punctuated intermittently by what little coverage the media can provide The action in phase one includes night raids a lot of smallscale special operations reconnaissance and when necessary direct contact raids A large military strike using airpower is also forthcoming but is unlikely to be reported in realtime Operational Security is Tight Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said US military officials will refuse to comment on anything that will endanger troops or operations And anyone that does talk to any of you about that is breaking federal criminal law and should be in jail Rumsfeld said When asked if he would lie to the press to disguise US military operations Rumsfeld said you never say never Next Phases of US Campaign More Important to Markets If US military action is limited to Afghanistan any immediate spike in oil prices is unlikely to endure because such a limited attack will not directly impact oil supply However US officials have said that the war on terrorism will go far beyond Afghanistan so markets will continue to exhibit some degree of uncertainty until further developments take place In the short term oil supplies would be most directly affected by strikes against Iraq But any spike might be short lived as OPEC has enough spare capacity to cover an Iraqi outage In the medium term oil markets might express fears over regional stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf regions as a result of US military strikes and possible subsequent terrorist attacks It is expected that Iraqi biologicalchemical weaponry will receive considerable attention in the days ahead and as has been widely reported there is a split in the Bush Administration over whether to include Iraq The Iraqi weapons of mass destruction capability is likely to once again complicate the rollover of the UN oilforfood program in December which could lead to the Iraqis removing their oil from the market independently of what is happening in Afghanistan Another key issue is whether the expected refugee crisis and rising Islamic radicalism will destabilize the nucleararmed Pakistani government Saudis Showing Increased Cooperation in Oil Policy and in Military Planning After a brief furor when the Saudi government announced that the US would not be able to expand its operations at the Prince Sultan Airbase near Riyahd USSaudi cooperation has improved The public announcement of the airbase prohibition had been a PR move by the Saudis to head off domestic accusations of handing blank checks to the USA CENTCOM has subsequently transferred its Ops Command to Saudi Arabia In addition the Saudis have responded to US pressure by officially severing relations with the Taliban In Vienna all indications are that the Saudis are working toward an OPEC agreement to keep the market well supplied with oil and to not take advantage of the political uncertainty affecting the crude markets by cutting production The most likely outcome is that OPEC will officially hold production at current levels but agree to limited cheating to ensure adequate supply Another possibility is that OPEC will lower the target range for the OPEC basket price that would take lower demand forecasts into account Either step would allow OPEC to preserve cohesion at a time of political and economic uncertainty If prices continue a rapid decline after the Vienna meeting Washington and Riyadh might come up with a politically correct way to spin an output reduction by blaming market volatility on speculators rather than on OPEC The cartel is likely to reconvene in early November to reassess market conditions Fed Shifts Its Model To Adapt to New Economic Reality The Fed is still struggling to answers for what recent events will do to the economy but its clear that three elements of their model have fundamentally changed The most important is a significant drop in all aspects of individuals and companies risk tolerance which must be reversed quickly The Fed has done its bit by stabilizing the financial system and Congress is stepping in with a total stimulus package of billion Greenspan supports bln On the diplomaticmilitary side the balanced multilateral approach of the administration together with discreet pressure on OPEC to reduce prices is all designed to stabilize expectations and boost sentiment On rates while the Fed is expected to keep cutting they wont disappoint the market sources report that Greenspan is actually quite comfortable using liquidity to alter actual Fed Funds rather than changing official rates However the Fed governors are increasingly convinced that sentiment really depends on military success and they are even more aware than that they are running out of ammunition on the rate cutting side Despite Greenspans protests we are looking at a fiscal boost that will push the budget to at least a of GDP deficit Nuclear Plants Under Increased Security Scrutiny The Washingtonbased Nuclear Control Institute and the Los Angelesbased Committee to Bridge the Gap urged the

against the US if Afghanistan targeted heightening expectations for retaliatory attacks against US targets Bush stokes unease among allies and international press with call for Bin Ladin to be brought to the US dead or alive Taliban offers to deliver Bin Ladin to a third country likely a Muslim country Offer almost certain to be rejected by Bush Administration FBI arrests five additional suspected hijackers raising expectations for further attacks US officials to meet with Saudi Foreign Minister in Washington questions to be asked about involvement of sons of Saudi diplomat in attacks Analysis Efforts by the Bush Administration to build a multilateral coalition against terrorism will have to address two key foreign policy issues Iraq and the IsraelPalestinian peace process Missteps in either area could weaken the emerging multilateral coalition against terrorism and have important implications for the oil market For a multilateral approach to work in the long term the Administration will need to provide countries with incentives to cooperate in the antiterrorism campaign especially in places such as the moderate Arab states where dismantling the networks suspected of supporting terrorist groups will involve moving against internal targets Moreover the Administration will need to deal with the root causes that provide willing cadres to extremist groups especially economic problems and political disenfranchisement Dealing with all of these factors will necessitate US financial support as well as greater US imagination in dealing with lingering regional issues Policy towards Iraq Washington appears to be resisting attempts to broaden its attacks to include Iraq at this point despite internal and external pressure for such action This will be a leading indicator assuming that no firm proof of Baghdads involvement in the bombings is uncovered A more aggressive US approach towards Iraq has seemed likely since July when Moscow blocked the introduction of smart sanctions during the last rollover of the OilforFood program However given regional sensitivities in the Arab world to Washingtons Iraq policy and the interests that states such as Russia and to a lesser extent China have in the country the Bush Administration cannot have both a genuinely multilateral approach to antiterrorism and an unilateral hardline Iraqi policy It will need to chose between one or the other IsraeliPalestinian peace process Without an equitable solution to this conflict most experts believe that the Bush teams antiterrorism coalition is doomed to failure Initially at least the signs are not good the Sharon government in Israel has been resistant to US pressure to rein in its aggressive policies towards the Palestinians Washingtons willingness to confront Israel on this issue will give a clue to its willingness to stay the antiterrorism course and hold its broad coalition together Market Update US Equities Next hours seen as critical after

vehicle not airborne attacks in mind The buildings that house nuclear reactors themselves are far smaller targets than the Pentagon posed and it would be extremely difficult for a terrorist to mount a

Summary Utility bankruptcy appears increasingly likely next week unless the state can clear three hurdles agreement on payback for the bailout rate increases and further shortterm funding for DWR purchases of power Disagreement persists between Gov Davis and Democrats in the legislature on how the state should be paid back for its bailout of the utilities The split is over a stock warrant plan versus state ownership of utility transmission assets The economics of the longterm contracts appear to show that rate hikes are unavoidable because of the need to amortize the undercollected rates of the utilities during the recent rate freeze period Air Quality Management District regulations are under review but offer limited scope for providing additional generation capacity Legislature Democrats are feeling intense pressure from the leftwing consumer groups and are being forced to at least slow if not stop Daviss bailout and rate hike plans Senator Burtons eminent domain threats against generators which reflect this pressure are of little significance Bankruptcy Outlook Rising Once Again A deal to finalize a debt workout continues to be just beyond the reach of the state the utilities and their creditors with time running out on the debt forbearance arrangement set to expire on Tuesday SoCal Edison and PGE are not paying any of their bills except for payroll They are working very hard to keep cash onhand and have indicated that they feel that they are very close to an involuntary bankruptcy filing Once this filing occurs they will have days until either the bankruptcy court accepts the filing or the utilities file a voluntary bankruptcy Opinion within the assembly is divided with respect to the outlook for bankruptcy Assemblyman Keeley told our source that a filing is likely but that everything will be resolved during that day period Senator John Burton is in no hurry to reach a deal with the utilities as he believes that the State of California is in a good position to strongarm the utilities Burton currently does not intend to cede to the utilities so that they can avoid bankruptcy The Senator stated bankruptcy would be bad but not the worst thing possible He intends to stick to his position Senator Burton also dismissed Governor Davis endofweek deadline for striking a deal with the utilities Still bankruptcy can be avoided if a lastminute deal can be struck Monday on what the state receives in return for the bailout the scope of rate hikes a federal court is expected to rule on the PGESoCal v CPUC rate undercollection case Monday additional financing is made available to the DWR to buy more power until the revenue bonds can be issued in May There is a possibility that significant progress on these issues could lead to a further extension of creditor forbearance However the negative tone taken by Standard Poors and others concerning delays in the legislature suggest that further forbearance will difficult to achieve The previous forbearance period was only achieved via a highlevel Washington summit which does not appear likely to happen this weekend Additional financing for DWR will not be automatically approved by the legislature The nonenergy expenditures of the California government are now at risk as there is not yet a rate structure in place to recover the costs being expended on power from the General Fund State to Take of Utility Debt While the state seems to have succeeded in forcing the utility parents to eat close to one third of the billion debt a final deal has been held up on two fronts First it is still unclear what the state will get in return for the utility debt It is possible that there will be a mix of stock warrants andor transmission assets A takeover of the transmission assets seems more likely than a takeover of the hydro assets The value of these assets still has not been settled Second while the state will be on the hook for billion it is not clear what mixture of rate hikes and revenue bonds will be used to recover the cost of the bailout Finally expect Davis and other California politicians to work to minimize rate hikes although the EdisonPGE v CPUC case on Monday is likely to force their hand here and to do everything possible to avoid the appearance of a bailout The tangible transmission assets are more politically attractive than the nebulous stock warrants No price has been set at which the State would purchase the utilities transmission assets which are currently valued at approximately billion All of the proceeds though cannot be used to pay off the utilities debts as some of the money would go to existing bondholders However IPP sources advise that there is already a bid on the table for these transmission assets that is higher than what the state would offer LongTerm Contracts As noted by the governor in his announcement Tuesday only MW of the MW of power contracted for can come online immediately Much of the remainder reportedly was contracted in longterm purchases from suppliers who are building power plants Some of this will come online in approximately two years Assemblyman Keeley expressed frustration that he has received a tablet from on high from Governor Davis that there must not be a rate increase This means that the state must acquire power not from internal sources or from the market but through longterm contracts at centskwh This allows cents to amortize SoCal Edisons undercollection from the recent rate freeze period The number is slightly different for PGE This assumption is based on a natural gas price of in and in and an efficiency heating rate of in and in These numbers were quoted to industry sources who felt they were unrealistic These sources quoted the price of natural gas as The sources agreed with Keeleys number for the efficiency heating rate but they felt that in was very optimistic unless an enormous amount of new generation capacity comes on line According to Keeleys numbers and assuming the filed rate case is settled at billion rather than billion it would take to years to amortize all of the utility undercollection A settlement to this case will need to be reached so that the State can figure out how much to charge for power in order to amortize the undercollection However since Assemblyman Keeleys numbers are unrealistic a rate increase will be necessary Air Quality District Exemptions There have been a few bills introduced to provide exemptions from AQMD Air Quality Management District regulations AB X AB X AB X Also Republicans have been asking the Governor to lift the environmental regulations and immediately site the facility in San Jose that was denied by the local government Currently there is no contemplation of loosening the AQMD compliance restrictions The legislature will not allow dirtier plants to come online However there might be a change in the means of implementation in southern California by moving away from the use of credits this apparently drives up the cost of gasfired power Democratic Moderates Pressured by Consumer Advocates The moderate left Sen Burton the PUC consumer activists is afraid of Harvey Rosenfield and his consumers movement This is not just because of his initiative More important from their perspective his initiative puts him and the far left in a position to challenge and defeat the moderates in the next election Thus Democrats in the legislature will feel pressured to distance themselves from Davis and slow down any further rate increases or bailout Eminent Domain Would Have A Limited Effect The threats by Burton to seize generation assets to insure continued power supply are limited They only apply to California suppliers A federal order would be needed to seize assets from outofstate suppliers There are also Canadian suppliers such as BC Hydro who are essentially untouchable Smaller IPPs Feeling the Squeeze Many of the smaller IPPs which account for approximately MW of production appear to be within a few days of running out of cash AB X may be amended possibly sometime this week to give the smaller producers credit support

energyfinancial markets in phase twoof campaign Federal Reserve activity and nuclear plant security RJ Special ForcesLow Intensity Campaign Underway Sources agree that the US military operation in Afghanistan has begun Indications of special forces activity were strongly signaled when Taliban forces shot down a US Unmanned Aerial Vehicle UAV on Monday The UAV that was shot down a Predator has a range of less than miles suggesting that US special forces are closing in on Afghanistan Special forces units are concentrating on intelligence gathering and targeting key bin Ladin installations as well as attempting to locate bin Ladin himself As Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld noted yesterday there will not be a DDay as such The Afghanistan campaign at least initially will not be like Desert Storm where CNN cameras in Baghdad hotels offered realtime imagery of US air strikes The first phases of this war are being fought largely in secret punctuated intermittently by what little coverage the media can provide The action in phase one includes night raids a lot of smallscale special operations reconnaissance and when necessary direct contact raids A large military strike using airpower is also forthcoming but is unlikely to be reported in realtime Operational Security is Tight Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said US military officials will refuse to comment on anything that will endanger troops or operations And anyone that does talk to any of you about that is breaking federal criminal law and should be in jail Rumsfeld said When asked if he would lie to the press to disguise US military operations Rumsfeld said you never say never Next Phases of US Campaign More Important to Markets If US military action is limited to Afghanistan any immediate spike in oil prices is unlikely to endure because such a limited attack will not directly impact oil supply However US officials have said that the war on terrorism will go far beyond Afghanistan so markets will continue to exhibit some degree of uncertainty until further developments take place In the short term oil supplies would be most directly affected by strikes against Iraq But any spike might be short lived as OPEC has enough spare capacity to cover an Iraqi outage In the medium term oil markets might express fears over regional stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf regions as a result of US military strikes and possible subsequent terrorist attacks It is expected that Iraqi biologicalchemical weaponry will receive considerable attention in the days ahead and as has been widely reported there is a split in the Bush Administration over whether to include Iraq The Iraqi weapons of mass destruction capability is likely to once again complicate the rollover of the UN oilforfood program in December which could lead to the Iraqis removing their oil from the market independently of what is happening in Afghanistan Another key issue is whether the expected refugee crisis and rising

US pressure by officially severing relations with the Taliban In Vienna all indications are that the Saudis are working toward an OPEC agreement to keep the market well supplied with oil and to not take advantage of the political uncertainty affecting the crude markets by cutting production The most likely outcome is that OPEC will officially hold production at current levels but agree to limited cheating to ensure adequate supply Another possibility is that OPEC will lower the target range for the OPEC basket price that would take lower demand forecasts into account Either step would allow OPEC to preserve cohesion at a time of political and economic uncertainty If prices continue a rapid decline after the Vienna meeting Washington and Riyadh might come up with a politically correct way to spin an output reduction by blaming market volatility on speculators rather than on OPEC The cartel is likely to reconvene in early November to reassess market conditions Fed Shifts Its Model To Adapt to New Economic Reality The Fed is still struggling to answers for what recent events will do to the economy but its clear that three elements of their model have fundamentally changed The most important is a significant drop in all aspects of individuals and companies risk tolerance which must be reversed quickly The Fed has done its bit by stabilizing the financial system and Congress is stepping in with a total stimulus package of billion Greenspan supports bln On the diplomaticmilitary side the balanced multilateral approach of the administration together with discreet pressure on OPEC to reduce prices is all designed to stabilize expectations and boost sentiment On rates while the Fed is expected to keep cutting they wont disappoint the market sources report that Greenspan is actually quite comfortable using liquidity to alter actual Fed Funds rather than changing official rates However the Fed governors are increasingly convinced that sentiment really depends on military success and they are even more aware than that they are running out of ammunition on the rate cutting side Despite Greenspans protests we are looking at a fiscal boost that will push the budget to at least a of GDP deficit Nuclear Plants Under Increased Security Scrutiny The Washingtonbased Nuclear Control Institute and the Los Angelesbased Committee to Bridge the Gap urged the government to immediately station to National Guard troops around nuclear plants to protect them from attacks The watchdog groups also said the government should be prepared to deploy antiaircraft weapons to shoot down attack planes Another needed measure is to carefully recheck the background of all nuclear plant employees and contractors to prevent internal sabotage

for Longer Deeper Deflationary Recession If Current Policy Mix Muddle Remains NPLs Unresolved SUMMARY Deflationary Recession Japan apart from the raft of new and compounded di fficulties consequent of September was already facing a very difficult end of fiscal halfyear and confirmation of another recession After September The impact of the shock to the world system over the pa st two weeks has reinforced from outside the structural challenges faci ng the domestic system Yen Strength Despite Intervention Recent efforts to stem rise of Yen enla rge supplementary budget reinforce the continuing reactive basis of policy making in Japan leadership challenges Koizumi Still Enjoying Support Keeping LDP Afloat Cabinets approval rati ng is with the LDPs approval at a year high of Signs of Life Bankruptcies down and retail sales component rises as in th e US consumer behavior will drive outcomes Surrounding Asia Weakens further on concerns about risk aversion relative to emerging markets and depressed export outlook Collateral Effects US weakness reinforces trend toward coincident global r ecession NPL Update Still Vague Koizumi finally releases basis for expanded RCC ro le in settling NPLs REPORT Global Context Japans greatest challenge is coming from the coincidence of recession def lation high government debt stock and for the first time sustained eros ion of export surpluses and flight of manufacturing outside of Japan for ex port to Japan Part of the latest reductions in the world growth outlook a nd the related decline in world equities are due to the September traged y and its many human and economic consequences This portion of the equity market losses will be hard to recover Another part of the posttragedy dec line is a delayed reaction to the global deflation and recession which were deepening prior to September Economic data since September provide d firm evidence of sharply weakening economies in the US and Europe Equ ities would probably have declined even without the tragedy This part of the recent equity loss argues for policy changes to stop the global slowdow n The challenge as described in previous reports comes from differing p riorities and magnitudes of responses across major economies to a global cy cle downturn Koizumi v MoF The Japanese government reportedly signaled some flexibility in its fiscal stance Koizumi said he may have to take a flexible approach to the Y trillion cap on new JGB issuance but Shiokawa said the governments plan t o keep new JGB issuance below Y trillion was unchanged The government i s considering issuing up to Y trillion year or shorter maturity Koizum i bonds funded by the sale of national assets as well as funds arising fr om administrative reforms not included in the Y trillion cap BoJ The central bank has shown no inclination to use monetary policy stimulus t o stop the recession Instead it continues to pursue fiscal stimulus and s tructural reforms policy steps are seen by several sources as actually dee pening the recession Though nominal interest rates are at zero real inter est rates are very high The central bank provides Y trillion in excess li quidity to the commercial banking sector but the funds are very short term and have not penetrated into the economy NPLs Event Koizumi administration officials released the program for expanding the Resolution Credit Corps role in settling the NPL problem Because of still unsettled battles between FSA leader Yanagisawa and other Koizumi adv isors the details of this plan were still left vague Yanagisawa is invol ved in a twofront war pinned between officials on one side who want to ba nkrupt the top debtor companies immediately and BOJ officials on the other side who want to fund the RCC much more aggressively through buying specially issued RCC bonds to let the institution expand its purchases of bad debt Result What has been decided is to have the RCC dramatically change the pr ice at which they will purchase assets from banks and to expand its ability to make losses when it sells those assets This is an in principle decis ion and the fights rage on about exactly what this new freedom should mean Yanagisawa hopes to combine more activity on this front with his main idea of reexamining needattention loans with help from market signals like the price of company stock etc detailed in our previous reports Yanagi sawa would create a new class for these loans and then require banks to rai se the reserves they hold against these loans Strategy Using the RCC is seen as an alternative to direct capital injecti on As one senior advisor put it Its not just that Yanagisawa wants to avoid capital injection because hed be blamed for the failure of his first injection Its because capital injection into healthy banks doesnt w ork We cant really force them to change management and to improve perform ance Theres a sense at FSA and the government generally that bankers are lousy and theyll never improve Banksare very unpopular Providing cap ital to RCC is less obviously a direct help to the banks That explains som e of the interest on the part of politicians And it explains why this wil l be part of the eventual solution BOJs Interest BoJ is interested in funding this RCC because it allows the m to be part of the solution without adopting inflation targets or directly purchasing JGBs Assuming the RCC will be financed through issue of govern mentguaranteed bonds the BOJ would be happy to buy them as long as they w ere guaranteed but not issued by the Japanese government BoJ does not wa nt to directly underwrite bonds issued by RCC because that would be against the law conveniently and RCC would have a low rating Its also true tha t BOJ likes the RCC idea better than going through the process of tighter a ssessment bankruptcies and capital injection because it cleans up the ba nks books in one swoop FSAs Concern FSA officials comment There is a real problem in everybod y pretending that the problem will be solved by taking all the bad loans to RCC No matter how much money it gets the RCC simply doesnt have the cap acity to help reconstruct companies Maybe it can farm out this work to tho se who do But the most likely outcome is that it will just give up and res ell everything at market price This would mean that a lot of companies in cluding those which may be saved will go bankrupt There are social and ec onomic consequences it will be very deflationary The banks will be a lot better off but industry will be in a bad way Thats why we have to take s ome more time and figure out how much of this can be done through the RCC a nd how much through better reserving for special attention NPLs Koizumi Advisors Assessment One of Koizumis advisors looking over the s tate of play and admitting all of the hesitation that FSA officials feel s ays There is no doubt that we still have lots of stuff to be worked out But as I see it we now have vague outlines of NPL disposal In addition t he FSA now admits that it has to get tighter ie it has to get to the n eed attention loans and look at them more carefully reclassify the bad pa rts of need attention loans and those additional downgraded loans will hav e to be disposed of in the year framework In other words the Y tril lion total will go up significantly We will give banks a break through the use of something significantly above market price in selling NPLs to RCC But the most fundamental thing still to be understood is that the RCC will have to acquire reconstruction skills or buy them if the companies sold to RCC are to have a fair chance of recovery

one another in the aftermath of the Assemblys failure to pass a SoCal bailout plan Meanwhile talk of direct access is threatening to undercut the PUCs ability to hike rates Davis plans to issue bonds for a SoCal bailout and the California state budget RJ Bryson and Davis Moving To Unseat Burton There is a serious effort currently underway in California to unseat Senator Burton DSan Francisco President Pro Tem Even though the chances of this happening are relatively low John Bryson CEO of SoCal with the support of the Governor are making huge efforts to oust Burton and replace him with one of two potential candidates Richard Alarcon DSan Fernando Valley Majority Whip or Sheila Kuehl DLos Angeles Alarcon has already stated that he would not accept the position However at minimum Bryson Governor Davis andor other Senators hope that Burton will rethink his position on the MOU and a SoCal bailout Direct Access Talk a Serious Problem for SoCal and California Budget Additionally behind the scenes things are looking very grim for California due the implications of Direct Access Direct access or the right of large companies and municipalities to buy power directly in the wholesale market is fast emerging as a new and serious issue that could make a rescue of SoCal more difficult It could also complicate existing state plans for the California electricity market and the proposed municipal bond sale well placed Sacramento sources tell us The biggest opponent of Direct Access comes from the Governors office as they realize the potential effects of direct access and how it could undermine the revenue stream supporting the bond issuance for SoCal For those interested in more on Direct Access keep reading Trying to stop municipalities from opting out of the state power plans will be extremely difficult as it runs against some of the most entrenched and longstanding privileges in California politics Under California law it is very difficult to stop many cities doing what they please Most older and larger cities are charter cities rather than general law cities subject to the California Municipal code Under the California Constitution charter cities can pretty much do anything or provide any service short of printing money and raising an army says one source The League of California cities a weighty organization representing every one of Californias cities is already swinging into action to support direct access Most Assembly Democrats started out as City councillors and have some sympathy with local independence And the resistance within the Assembly is already building against Hertzbergs attempts to stop even large companies getting direct access Some city leaders will not wish to fight the Governor and the state legislature on the issue But if municipalities do not opt out they may have to explain to their local business and voters why they are paying far more for electricity than a city next door which chooses to set up its own power company Cities are beginning to realize they might potentially lose major employers Politicians are also beginning to realize that local companies stand to gain or lose a fortune on the matter and this could affect campaign contributions State power plans at risk If municipalities do move to set up their own power companies it could undermine at least three key elements of the State of Californias power plans First the rate hike already approved falls mostly on businesses and other large users But municipal power would unpick this structure allow large regions of California to ignore the PUC leaving the rate structure to be determined city by city Many municipalities may be unable to resist pressure from local businesses to protect them from disproportionate rate hikes Others might cave into irate voters Second the plans laid out by Governor Davis and State Treasurer Angelides for a California State Public Power Authority would also be badly damaged if large regions avoid having anything to do with it It is possible that longterm power contracts might also face an additional hurdle if municipalities opt out of higher longterm rates by buying on the open market one source says It could mean the state is left with excess power that it would have to sell at a loss Third revenues to back the proposed power bonds could be imperilled if municipalities opt out of the rate structure and revenue stream needed to repay the bond And if the momentum for direct access develops among the cities and municipalities across the state it could make it much more difficult to launch the bond in the first place as investors may take fright at potential threats to the viability of repayments The issue is at an early stage the PUC had a general workshop on the matter at its offices in San Francisco on Friday So far the matter has been seen as a micro technical issue rather than as one of the biggest hurdles the state will have to face State legislative leaders are likely to use every political and legal means available to stop municipal secession or at least smother the issue until the power bond is successfully away But stopping the municipalities if they choose to follow this path could prove to be difficult

California Senates MOU Debated in State Assembly Coordinating the California Legislature CPUCs Rate Setting Authority In Question Highlights from the SoCal Investor Conference Call MOU As reported earlier SB XX the leading SoCal rescue adopted by the CA Senate has undergone minor amendments by the California Assembly Three important revisions on the bill are In regard to commercial rates the assembly has now left open the definition of large or industrial users by eliminating the previous kWh usage requirement This change could enable the Assembly to categorize either smaller or larger consumers into the industrialcommercial user status The bill would not become effective unless SB XX is signed into law SB XX authored by Sen Speier is regarding the CPUCs authority over utilities and generators in California it places certain generation that was purchased by Reliant Dynegy etc from the utilities after deregulation under PUC authority The States purchase of the SoCal Ed transmission lines has been removed AB XX was also revised by the Assembly with many of the deleted provisions duplicate in SB XX such as the conservation lands and the option to buy the transmission lines Additionally AB XX can not be enacted unless SB XX the windfall profits bill is signed The joining of XX to SB XX and of XX to XX is very likely a method by which the Assembly is pressuring the governor to sign these other bills which otherwise might not have been enrolled However the joining of these bills makes their passage more difficult The remaining provisions of AB XX are as follows Renewables Portfolio Direct Access Ratepayer Refund Account changed the name to Ratepayer Benefit Account Balancing Account for SCE procurement of power DRC replaced with nonbypassable charge option for MOU This includes reference to balancing account recovery of reasonable procurement costs and the prohibition of reasonableness review on contracts by PUC Putting the MOU to a Vote The Speaker feels that everything in these bills has been discussed already so nothing is really new Hertzberg met with advisors Wednesday night pm to decide if the Assembly will convene on Friday It probably has a lot to do with the ability to get enough members support of these measures and willingness to go back to Sacramento Many are vacationing some in other countries If there is an Assembly session on Friday he plans to have an informational hearing on the measure today If the Assemblys session fails to convene Friday it is unclear what he intends to do On the other side of the equation it is unlikely that Senator Burton will bring the Senate back into session to approve this bill The Senate wont even consider it until it comes back from recess but the Assembly feels it is their responsibility thereby putting the onus back on the Senate Apparently there is really no coordination between the leadership of the different houses While SB XX and AB XX are the most publicized bills neither bill will be the actual legislative vehicle for these provisions The proposed content of these bills will be amended into other bills which are further along in the process thereby eliminating the need to waive a number of rules and hold numerous hearings This will speed up the process Apparently the Speakers office has not yet identified the actual bills that will be used But they hope to find bills that are so far along in the legislative process that if the Assembly passes the bills they will not be able to be amended in the Senate It does appear that the Assembly does intend to send these through as two separate bills though with the SB XX provisions in one bill and the AB XX provisions in another CPUC Rate Setting Authority or Rate Setting Minority Recently the California Assembly has pursued a legislative provision that would enable lawmakers to abrogate the CPUCs ratesetting authority and hand over that power to the California legislature Politically this gives the Governor the ability to say if rates increase automatically that he did not approve of the rate increase and there is nothing he can do about it But it also gives Wall Street buyers of Californias revenue bonds assurances that no matter what the need there will always be enough revenue to back revenue bonds payments thus deniability to ratepayers and certainty for bondholders Were this provision to pass the CPUC would still retain oversight of rates for the investor owned utilities As for DWR under the draft rate agreement proposed by the CPUC it contains a mechanism for the Commission to use in setting electricity rates that satisfy DWRs revenue requirement DWRs revenue requirements include bondrelated costs operating costs such as power purchase costs and administrative costs ABX provided for energyrelated bonds to be sold by the state to support DWRs power purchases Because power contracts require DWR to pay for power before it makes bond payments and DWR must sell power to obtain revenues the ratesetting mechanism in the rate agreement also applies to DWRs power purchases not just its bond payments Note that if the Commission adopts a rate agreement it becomes irrevocable The draft agreement also includes a provision stating that the CPUC will take the DWR at its word as to its retail revenue requirements The agreement would require that the CPUC set rates meeting DWRs requirements in either or days The day mechanism applies whenever DWR submits a revenue requirement The day mechanism applies when DWR anticipates or actually draws on its reserves The rate agreement includes an enforceable covenant by the CPUC specifying how the Commission will set rates to meet DWRs revenue requirements which includes both bond costs and operating costs If the CPUCs draft rate agreement is approved there will be no legislative or PUC oversight of any of those costs and no opportunity for public comment for as long as bonds are outstanding If a rate agreement can be avoided there will be opportunities to review and alter the agreements demand management and administrative costs Either way power contract costs remain an obligation of DWR and cannot be altered except by mutual consent of DWR and the contractor SoCal Edison Investor Conference Call The following are notes from the SoCal Edison conference call with holders of defaulted debt July PDT In order for California to sell their revenuebonds with an investment grade rating two criterion must be met there must be a ratesupported dedicated revenue stream in place and the legislature must have the power to override of the CPUCs rate setting authority and raise rates if necessary The second criterion however faces significant opposition from the California State Constitution Regarding the DWR rate requirement Craver the spokesperson for SoCal stated that SoCal is evaluating the numbers particularly on the DWR side He stated that if you accept their output of models and numbers it appears this requirement would fit within the existing rate structure However we need to remember that deregulation started with forecasts that proved to be wrong Therefore this is risky in that SoCal is faced with fixed revenues and floating costs Unlike DWR SoCal has no ability to adjust rates based on costs making floating natural gas prices a risk Prudential asked if based on the Hertzberg legislation the sale of the transmission assets is now off the table SoCal responded that this is correct Prudential asked if SoCal could then anticipate more securitization ie be securitized for all but million with an option to buy the transmission assets at book for years SoCal responded that it was unclear what the pricing of the transmission assets would be but there would be an option for the state to purchase the transmission assets Prudential asked about the status of the remaining nonlegislative implementing decisions on the MOU and if the legislation XX and XX contains them SoCal responded that there are outstanding issues remaining for implementing the MOU Ratemaking for the utilities retained generation The PUC is holding hearings on this issue this week These hearings have slowed the process A decision is expected by the end of August A procurement plan for the utility This plan is before the PUC SoCal suggested the PUC may be waiting to see what passes the legislature before acting on this point Regardless the company needs an adequate balancing account with an automatic rate trigger Clarification on the utility holding companys position regarding st priority On this front the PUC asserted its jurisdiction over all three utilities and their holding companies The three holding companies have challenged this decision Commissioner Bilas has written a draft decision in favor of the challenge a final decision is expected as soon as Thursday This would clarify that the utilities have first call on investment from the holding companies but that the holding companies are not obligated to pay the debts of the utilities Deutsche Bank asked if in SoCals numbers reported to date it was assuming the charges for ancillary services SoCal responded that DWR had confirmed as of January that it would pick up these charges These charges would otherwise amount to million billion in additional revenue requirement for the utility Based on FERC rulings SoCal had not been counting on paying these charges so they are not reflected in the companys numbers However SoCal will be paying grid management and uplift charges They anticipate paying some portion of these charges This could potentially require an amended URG filing Citigroup asked where Edison stands on the Edison Mission Energy issues Edison responded that they are working on new facilities on the bank side The current facilities expire on October th or th Edison indicated it is in the process of finalizing sales of approximately MW of nonstrategic assets They are in negotiations with the final bidders except for Hopewell which is done There is no specific timeline on when the deals will be announced but it is a matter of days to a week Appalucia Management asked if on SoCals generation DWR is assuming a costplus or retail rate SoCal responded that it uses costofservice based rates The return on the rate basis is approximately cents The stipulated covers SoCals generation its contracted generation QF costs which were quoted as the most significant portion and uncollectables This is driven by gas costs for the QFs Revenue is fixed at

<14376648.1075858018663.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,robert.johnston@enron.com,2001-05-25 04:39:00,Please Read California Cc definitely getting interesting As we reported on Wednesday the first glimmers of hope for a deal in the Assembly are starting to appear on the horizon The market may react positively to this news as it filters out over the next week Of course a bailout deal for SoCal could be rejected by SoCal or the generators could refuse to participate and bankruptcy could still happen Nonetheless we felt it was important to alert you to the changing dynamics in the legislature RJ Executive Summary Legislators in both parties are scared about a fiscal meltdown and looking for a realistic Plan B The Keeley plan is the most likely vehicle and would include the generator haircuts and revenue bonds backed by a dedicated rate component Despite uncertainty over dealing with transmission lines and continued oppostion from Burton and his consumer group allies the Keeley plan will probably pass the legislature The generators will not support the plan until they get clearer guarantees from the state that investigations and lawsuits will end PGE could get the same offer as SoCal through the bankruptcy court Budget Binge Could Scare Legislators into a Deal According to sources the Assembly is terrified of the current holes in the budget due to buying power The impact of the energy crisis is reportedly causing panic among some legislators This panic appears to be moving a SoCal bailout plan forward Sources report that a modified Plan B deal is not that far off it will likely take one to two weeks more likely closer to two to move a deal through the Assembly and the Senate and to the governors desk once it is introduced What Would the New Plan B Look Like This modified Plan B deal which will originate in the Assembly will almost certainly include a dedicated rate component to pay SoCals undercollect Revenue bonds will be issued securitized by this dedicated rate component It is also very likely that the generators would be offered cents on the dollar for what they are owed immediately with the possibility of more if they win litigation Sources report that the state is fairly confident that at least most generators would not be successful in winning this additional money Assembly Speaker Keeley reportedly remains the driving force behind this plan and it is being drawn up from within his office Transmission Lines It remains unclear at this time whether a transmission line purchase or option to purchase will be put into the deal since this is a major point of contention between the Democrats and Republicans According to sources the Assembly is working on this Plan Looks Good to Pass Both Assembly and Senate According to sources the vote count for passing a deal containing the above components except the transmission line purchase which is not yet settled looks very good The vote in the Senate would be very close Senator Burton still opposes a bailout deal but he reportedly might not stand in the way of others from voting for the plan making its passage more likely Even opponents of the plan including Burton and the consumer advocates say that the odds of a modified Plan B passing the Senate are better than These opponents are reportedly pessimistic about their chances of stopping a Plan B from passing at this point Caveat Generators Are Waiting For Guarantees That the Witch Hunt Will End As reported previously sources continue to believe that generators would be reluctant to take a centonthedollar haircut without the state offering them relief from further prosecution Without this relief the state could give them cents then try to take away even more Sources report that even opponents of the plan accept that the generators should be offered this relief from prosecution Thus it appears likely at this time that most generators would accept a percent haircut if they were paid immediately Also sources believe that the securitization on the dedicated rate component offered in the modified Plan B would be sufficient to pay back those generators who successfully litigated to win more than cents on the dollar Sources believe that SoCal Edisons creditors are likely to forebear from filing an involuntary bankruptcy long enough for this plan to go through since it would pay back most of what they are owed PG E Could Also Be Dealt In If this plan succeeds it will almost certainly be taken to the bankruptcy court and offered to PGE as part of a reorganization plan This plan can be offered at any time within PGEs period of exclusivity This is a day period though it is often extended following the filing of a bankruptcy petition However sources report that the state is concerned about how to approach the bankruptcy court Based on Supreme Court precedent which legal sources within the state have been reviewing the state would likely lose its sovereign immunity if it entered as a party into the bankrutpcy court This is a problem because the stakes in this case are so high Bailout Bill Would Require Follow Legislation For A New Rate Structure Even if the state passes and signs a SoCal bailout it would still need to pass a rate structure that would allow SoCal and PGE to flow through cost increases to prevent them from once again facing bankrtupcy Therefore this plan does not make the crisis go away

Summary Vice President Gore believes he has won the state of Florida and the election and is determined to see through the raft of legal challenges now launched in Florida state courts Texas Governor Bush doesnt really care what Gore thinks and is moving on several fronts including possible early cabinet appointments to press his increasingly obvious public opinionadvantage Gore Strategy Gore and his campaign leaders are watching the Bush strategy and refusing to accede to the carefully crafted sense of inevitability This all fades in a nanosecond if we win Florida one Gore campaign adviser told us Gore is still hoping to prevail in one of three legal challenges that could make a difference the dimpled chad recount for Palm Beach and MiamiDade Counties the absentee ballot fraud suit in Seminole County and the butterfly ballot revote scenario for Palm Beach In order for Gore to gain the Presidency these decisions would still have to produce enough votes for Gore to overtake the vote Bush lead unlikely in Dade possible in Palm Beach and then be held up by the US Supreme Court Of course the US Supreme Court could simply uphold the certification and render the Florida cases moot unless Bush decides to drop the Supreme Court action see below The Seminole County case is regarded as overblown because first the Voter Identification Number was not required under Florida law only by the local election board and second the Republicans only had access to the ballots before they were mailed out Gore well understands that pursuing these cases in Florida court is losing him steady ground in the court of public opinion As we wrote yesterday that opinion is steadily turning against Gores crusade and Bush plans to do everything in his power over the next few days to accelerate that turn Polls from last night before Gore spoke indicate the vice presidents position is continuing to erode The percentage of Americans who say they are willing to wait at least a little while longer to resolve this issue has dropped sharply from last week to last night while the percentage who say Gore should concede has risen from to in the same series of polls Bush Strategy As early as today Bush transition officials tell us he could start naming his cabinet and make a new decision on his US Supreme Court challenge One thing to keep firmly in mind although the press is full of Andrew Card news today the real power of the Bush throne will be Vice President Cheney He is emerging as the great hope for Bush staffers who are already growing frustrated with the lack of focus and disorientation of Bushs Texas league inner circle In the meantime dont expect Bush to do anything but seek to accelerate the trend in the polls breaking against Gore On one front Bush is considering a proposal to drop his Supreme Court appeal before oral arguments are heard this Friday Although he would position this decision as a peace offering to Gore the real reasons are far more selfserving In the first place Bush no longer gets anything from the Court unless Gore wins on one of his new lawsuits and even then Bush could refile with the Court for relief but Gore could get an affirmation that recounts should be conducted that would be a huge victory in the public opinion arena for the vice president In the second place Bush realizes that the looming Supreme Court battle gives Gore what little public relations cover he has to pursue all the other court battles in Florida as long as the election remains undetermined because of Bushs lawsuit Gore can justify asking the American public to hang on a little longer Bush Cabinet Appointees Imminent But Bush is moving on another front and he is now expected to name at least some of his senior cabinet appointments as early as this week The names he is considering are all people who have agreed to serve in his cabinet and whom he has long since chosen to serve Naming some of the new Bush cabinet members in public Bush officials believe would increase the voters sense that this will be a moderate administration of household names they can trust That is why the transition team wants to announce Colin Powell as Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice as National Security Advisor and Sam Nunn as Defense Secretary as soon as possible even though Nunn is playing hard to get There is a complication to the strategy since Powell wants to avoid becoming a political pawn and Nunn cannot afford to be part of this strategy right now since enraged Democrats would lynch him for treason What Bush wants of course is a preset senior foreign policy team made up of two AfricanAmericans and a Democrat Only one economic team decision has been made Bush will name Larry Lindsey to one of the top three economic jobs in the new administration Treasury Secretary National Economic Council Director or head of the Council of Economic Advisers and we expect Lindsey to run much of the new administrations economic policy from whatever slot he eventually occupies Think of this as the Bob Rubin model Rubin did not serve as Treasury Secretary during the first Clinton period but ran things from within the White House

<22006056.1075858050437.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,robert.johnston@enron.com,2001-05-25 04:39:00,Please Read California Cc definitely getting interesting As we reported on Wednesday the first glimmers of hope for a deal in the Assembly are starting to appear on the horizon The market may react positively to this news as it filters out over the next week Of course a bailout deal for SoCal could be rejected by SoCal or the generators could refuse to participate and bankruptcy could still happen Nonetheless we felt it was important to alert you to the changing dynamics in the legislature RJ Executive Summary Legislators in both parties are scared about a fiscal meltdown and looking for a realistic Plan B The Keeley plan is the most likely vehicle and would include the generator haircuts and revenue bonds backed by a dedicated rate component Despite uncertainty over dealing with transmission lines and continued oppostion from Burton and his consumer group allies the Keeley plan will probably pass the legislature The generators will not support the plan until they get clearer guarantees from the state that investigations and lawsuits will end PGE could get the same offer as SoCal through the bankruptcy court Budget Binge Could Scare Legislators into a Deal According to sources the Assembly is terrified of the current holes in the budget due to buying power The impact of the energy crisis is reportedly causing panic among some legislators This panic appears to be moving a SoCal bailout plan forward Sources report that a modified Plan B deal is not that far off it will likely take one to two weeks more likely closer to two to move a deal through the Assembly and the Senate and to the governors desk once it is introduced What Would the New Plan B Look Like This modified Plan B deal which will originate in the Assembly will almost certainly include a dedicated rate component to pay SoCals undercollect Revenue bonds will be issued securitized by this dedicated rate component It is also very likely that the generators would be offered cents on the dollar for what they are owed immediately with the possibility of more if they win litigation Sources report that the state is fairly confident that at least most generators would not be successful in winning this additional money Assembly Speaker Keeley reportedly remains the driving force behind this plan and it is being drawn up from within his office Transmission Lines It remains unclear at this time whether a transmission line purchase or option to purchase will be put into the deal since this is a major point of contention between the Democrats and Republicans According to sources the Assembly is working on this Plan Looks Good to Pass Both Assembly and Senate According to sources the vote count for passing a deal containing the above components except the transmission line purchase which is not yet settled looks very good The vote in the Senate would be very close Senator Burton still opposes a bailout deal but he reportedly might not stand in the way of others from voting for the plan making its passage more likely Even opponents of the plan including Burton and the consumer advocates say that the odds of a modified Plan B passing the Senate are better than These opponents are reportedly pessimistic about their chances of stopping a Plan B from passing at this point Caveat Generators Are Waiting For Guarantees That the Witch Hunt Will End As reported previously sources continue to believe that generators would be reluctant to take a centonthedollar haircut without the state offering them relief from further prosecution Without this relief the state could give them cents then try to take away even more Sources report that even opponents of the plan accept that the generators should be offered this relief from prosecution Thus it appears likely at this time that most generators would accept a percent haircut if they were paid immediately Also sources believe that the securitization on the dedicated rate component offered in the modified Plan B would be sufficient to pay back those generators who successfully litigated to win more than cents on the dollar Sources believe that SoCal Edisons creditors are likely to forebear from filing an involuntary bankruptcy long enough for this plan to go through since it would pay back most of what they are owed PG E Could Also Be Dealt In If this plan succeeds it will almost certainly be taken to the bankruptcy court and offered to PGE as part of a reorganization plan This plan can be offered at any time within PGEs period of exclusivity This is a day period though it is often extended following the filing of a bankruptcy petition However sources report that the state is concerned about how to approach the bankruptcy court Based on Supreme Court precedent which legal sources within the state have been reviewing the state would likely lose its sovereign immunity if it entered as a party into the bankrutpcy court This is a problem because the stakes in this case are so high Bailout Bill Would Require Follow Legislation For A New Rate Structure Even if the state passes and signs a SoCal bailout it would still need to pass a rate structure that would allow SoCal and PGE to flow through cost increases to prevent them from once again facing bankrtupcy Therefore this plan does not make the crisis go away

Bush doesnt really care what Gore thinks and is moving on several fronts including possible early cabinet appointments to press his increasingly obvious public opinionadvantage Gore Strategy Gore and his campaign leaders are watching the Bush strategy and refusing to accede to the carefully crafted sense of inevitability This all fades in a nanosecond if we win Florida one Gore campaign adviser told us Gore is still hoping to prevail in one of three legal challenges that could make a difference the dimpled chad recount for Palm Beach and MiamiDade Counties the absentee ballot fraud suit in Seminole County and the butterfly ballot revote scenario for Palm Beach In order for Gore to gain the Presidency these decisions would still have to produce enough votes for Gore to overtake the vote Bush lead unlikely in Dade possible in Palm Beach and then be held up by the US Supreme Court Of course the US Supreme Court could simply uphold the certification and render the Florida cases moot unless Bush decides to drop the Supreme Court action see below The Seminole County case is regarded as overblown because first the Voter Identification Number was not required under Florida law only by the local election board and second the Republicans only had access to the ballots before they were mailed out Gore well understands that pursuing these cases in Florida court is losing him steady ground in the court of public opinion As we wrote yesterday that opinion is steadily turning against Gores crusade and Bush plans to do everything in his power over the next few days to accelerate that turn Polls from last night before Gore spoke indicate the vice presidents position is continuing to erode The percentage of Americans who say they are willing to wait at least a little while longer to resolve this issue has dropped sharply from last week to last night while the percentage who say Gore should concede has risen from to in the same series of polls Bush Strategy As early as today Bush transition officials tell us he could start naming his cabinet and make a new decision on his US Supreme Court challenge One thing to keep firmly in mind although the press is full of Andrew Card news today the real power of the Bush throne will be Vice President Cheney He is emerging as the great hope for Bush staffers who are already growing frustrated with the lack of focus and disorientation of Bushs Texas league inner circle In the meantime dont expect Bush to do anything but seek to accelerate the trend in the polls breaking against Gore On one front Bush is considering a proposal to drop his Supreme Court appeal before oral arguments are heard this Friday Although he would position this decision as a peace offering to Gore the real reasons are far more selfserving In the first place Bush no longer gets anything from the Court unless Gore wins on one of his new lawsuits and even then Bush could refile with the Court for relief but Gore could get an affirmation that recounts should be conducted that would be a huge victory in the public opinion arena for the vice president In the second place Bush realizes that the looming Supreme Court battle gives Gore what little public relations cover he has to pursue all the other court battles in Florida as long as the election remains undetermined because of Bushs lawsuit Gore can justify asking the American public to hang on a little longer Bush Cabinet Appointees Imminent But Bush is moving on another front and he is now expected to name at least some of his senior cabinet appointments as early as this week The names he is considering are all people who have agreed to serve in his cabinet and whom he has long since chosen to serve Naming some of the new Bush cabinet members in public Bush officials believe would increase the voters sense that this will be a moderate administration of household names they can trust That is why the transition team wants to announce Colin Powell as Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice as National Security Advisor and Sam Nunn as Defense Secretary as soon as possible even though Nunn is playing hard to get There is a complication to the strategy since Powell wants to avoid becoming a political pawn and Nunn cannot afford to be part of this strategy right now since enraged Democrats would lynch him for treason What Bush wants of course is a preset senior foreign policy team made up of two AfricanAmericans and a Democrat Only one economic team decision has been made Bush will name Larry Lindsey to one of the top three economic jobs in the new administration Treasury Secretary National Economic Council Director or head of the Council of Economic Advisers and we expect Lindsey to run much of the new administrations economic policy from whatever slot he eventually occupies Think of this as the Bob Rubin model Rubin did not serve as Treasury Secretary during the first Clinton period but ran things from within the White House

<3741874.1075858057574.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,robert.johnston@enron.com,2001-05-25 04:39:00,Please Read California Cc definitely getting interesting As we reported on Wednesday the first glimmers of hope for a deal in the Assembly are starting to appear on the horizon The market may react positively to this news as it filters out over the next week Of course a bailout deal for SoCal could be rejected by SoCal or the generators could refuse to participate and bankruptcy could still happen Nonetheless we felt it was important to alert you to the changing dynamics in the legislature RJ Executive Summary Legislators in both parties are scared about a fiscal meltdown and looking for a realistic Plan B The Keeley plan is the most likely vehicle and would include the generator haircuts and revenue bonds backed by a dedicated rate component Despite uncertainty over dealing with transmission lines and continued oppostion from Burton and his consumer group allies the Keeley plan will probably pass the legislature The generators will not support the plan until they get clearer guarantees from the state that investigations and lawsuits will end PGE could get the same offer as SoCal through the bankruptcy court Budget Binge Could Scare Legislators into a Deal According to sources the Assembly is terrified of the current holes in the budget due to buying power The impact of the energy crisis is reportedly causing panic among some legislators This panic appears to be moving a SoCal bailout plan forward Sources report that a modified Plan B deal is not that far off it will likely take one to two weeks more likely closer to two to move a deal through the Assembly and the Senate and to the governors desk once it is introduced What Would the New Plan B Look Like This modified Plan B deal which will originate in the Assembly will almost certainly include a dedicated rate component to pay SoCals undercollect Revenue bonds will be issued securitized by this dedicated rate component It is also very likely that the generators would be offered cents on the dollar for what they are owed immediately with the possibility of more if they win litigation Sources report that the state is fairly confident that at least most generators would not be successful in winning this additional money Assembly Speaker Keeley reportedly remains the driving force behind this plan and it is being drawn up from within his office Transmission Lines It remains unclear at this time whether a transmission line purchase or option to purchase will be put into the deal since this is a major point of contention between the Democrats and Republicans According to sources the Assembly is working on this Plan Looks Good to Pass Both Assembly and Senate According to sources the vote count for passing a deal containing the above components except the transmission line purchase which is not yet settled looks very good The vote in the Senate would be very close Senator Burton still opposes a bailout deal but he reportedly might not stand in the way of others from voting for the plan making its passage more likely Even opponents of the plan including Burton and the consumer advocates say that the odds of a modified Plan B passing the Senate are better than These opponents are reportedly pessimistic about their chances of stopping a Plan B from passing at this point Caveat Generators Are Waiting For Guarantees That the Witch Hunt Will End As reported previously sources continue to believe that generators would be reluctant to take a centonthedollar haircut without the state offering them relief from further prosecution Without this relief the state could give them cents then try to take away even more Sources report that even opponents of the plan accept that the generators should be offered this relief from prosecution Thus it appears likely at this time that most generators would accept a percent haircut if they were paid immediately Also sources believe that the securitization on the dedicated rate component offered in the modified Plan B would be sufficient to pay back those generators who successfully litigated to win more than cents on the dollar Sources believe that SoCal Edisons creditors are likely to forebear from filing an involuntary bankruptcy long enough for this plan to go through since it would pay back most of what they are owed PG E Could Also Be Dealt In If this plan succeeds it will almost certainly be taken to the bankruptcy court and offered to PGE as part of a reorganization plan This plan can be offered at any time within PGEs period of exclusivity This is a day period though it is often extended following the filing of a bankruptcy petition However sources report that the state is concerned about how to approach the bankruptcy court Based on Supreme Court precedent which legal sources within the state have been reviewing the state would likely lose its sovereign immunity if it entered as a party into the bankrutpcy court This is a problem because the stakes in this case are so high Bailout Bill Would Require Follow Legislation For A New Rate Structure Even if the state passes and signs a SoCal bailout it would still need to pass a rate structure that would allow SoCal and PGE to flow through cost increases to prevent them from once again facing bankrtupcy Therefore this plan does not make the crisis go away
