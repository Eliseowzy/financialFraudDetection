there is so much happening in Sacramento and Wash DC that impacts the decision about Edison that I really need an opportunity to bring you and Richard up to speed That cannot happen during a full Committee call There have been several separate conference calls organized by Reliant to advocate the involuntary petition which is I think fraught with legal economic and political peril especially sanctions damages etc because the claims are subject to bona fide dispute by and large as you know Most others Dynergy Duke etc seem to agree with me on the involuntary The Cal legislature is pushing hard on a bill now supported by Gov Davis and Edison that specifically refuses to fund repayment of the energy sellers claims while paying the banks and QFs We need a measured and prompt message to deliver to the Gov Edison and Legisl before they pass a bill that calls for financing other claims that may not happen even at the lower number without sellers claims if the consequences are that the cloud of an involuntary or litigation or arbitration will scare the underwriters of the bonds away in any event Of course some could argue that the Gov Legisl and Edison are doing this on purpose to provoke the involuntary or litigation so that when Edison goes into chapter they can say the blood is on the gouging sellers hands not on theirs Or that may be giving all those D students more credit than they deserve I dont know Please forward this email on to Richard and others at Enron as appropriate Please also let me know when Richard is available for a separate discussion on this and related matters I know he is busy on many other things Original Message From ROBERT NELSON mailto LGMCOM Sent Monday August AM To Subject RE Arbitration Im around but Richard is in South America Hes going to try and hook into the conference call on Thursday however Richard seemed to have several problems with the idea of making a demand at this time Like Reliant he wanted to be sure that he had carefully thought through all the possible implications of making a demand as it would bear on the FERC proceedings actions by individual participants and possible bankruptcy He also wasnt sure whether he supported current committee counsel leading the charge but no firm thoughts on that point He also was not inclined to draw the line in the sand until he saw what comes out of the legislature Richard seems to have some overarching concerns about overlawyering which I suppose are understandable given the number of counsel that just Enron is supporting We obviously need to consider how the committee discharges its fiduciary duties in the most efficient and cost effective manner I Richards point is that there are a bunch of other lawyers who already are actively involved in things I guess we need to consider whether the committee can use them to represent the collective interests of all participants Bob This email including attachments contains information that is confidential and it may be

proceedings could themse lves within several months could bring us to the point of knowing the amo unt of our claim against PGE even without the benefit of the formula sugges ted by Wegs proposal That raises the question of what we get from the We g settlement Although he has not specifically articulated the benefits H oward would tell you that his settlement would avoid the cost of litigating the splits would avoid the delay attendant to inevitable challenges of a contested FERC order and would get our collateral back sooner rather than l ater Im still not entirely clear about the procedure he intends to adopt to get his deal done and whether there are potential impediments He has characterized the deal as a bankruptcy compromise between PX the debtor a nd the participants If all the participants go along that characterizati on is ok If some participants MirantSCE oppose the only way you can b ind them to the deal in the PX bankruptcy is through a reorganization plan and that itself will take time Weg seems to think that most participants will go along Im sure Edison would oppose Although they arent a favo red party in the PX case they could have the ability to stymie a settlemen t Next the settlement also impacts PGE and its bankruptcy If PGE doesn t go along it can argue that its bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to fix the claims against PGE not the PX bankruptcy court Then the settlement needs to be presented to and adopted by FERCagain an opportunity for par ties to object These procedural hurdles may not have to be dealt with bu t Ive received no good exposition of how they would be if they in fact mat erialize Are you comfortable proceeding on the assumption that everyone w ill go along Bob Nelson This email including attachments contains

July Order required Judge Birchman to make findings about the exact amounts owed by each buyer to each seller The proposal to establish methodologies does exactly that among other things Therefore it seems to me that it needs to be part of the the pending California proceedings That is not to say however that it should not also be part of the Chargeback proceedings under the April FERC order It should also be applicable to those proceedings Therefore we need to develop a strategy to make it part of both proceedings Timing is obviously critical and I am soliciting the Chargeback movants views on that subject along with the substance of the proposal I would like to point out that I have learned from the settlemen t proceedings before Judge Wagner that we must submit the proposal early in
