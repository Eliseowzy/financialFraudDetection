inquiries bids are due by Ive scheduled a meeting with you me Eric Gadd and Jerry Martin for next Wed at pm Please feel free to invite whomever you feel necessary My objective is to better understand the project construction process and what steps I can take to compress the timeline as much as possible The critical path item for this project I believe is the ROW EIS for the Flagstaff Phoenix

Phil Soldano Louis Campbell Larry Rice Randy Subject RE Phone Conversation with TNC Sun Devil Project Importance High Thanks Kevin We will continue to work on preliminary information At any point that

continued to make early contacts with the environmental community and some permitting agencies in Arizona to get a feel for any sensitive issues that might confront the proposed Sun Devil Project I think the information will be invaluable as the project is sited I appreciate the opportunity to be involved in the project at this stage and stand ready to provide any assistance needed as you move forward We will get more definitive information especially related to the greenfield portion of the project as we define the proposed corridor Why dont you catch me up on the project after your open season results start to come in If it looks like a go I would suggest that a project team be organized to plan the strategy for involvement with the environmental community Native Americans local government state government Federal agencies the media landowner resistance etc Let me know if you need anything else John Original Message From Campbell Larry Sent Wednesday August PM To Shafer John Rice Randy Hyatt Kevin Subject Phone Conversation with TNC Today I spoke with Jean Calhoun of the Arizona Chapter of The Nature Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project She was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwesterns proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project Although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established she did offer some general yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and animals The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions The TNC has requested that should this project be apporved these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by FERC To the south and east of Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the River This river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across Arizona I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies in addition to the TNC and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route Part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of Arizona I think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known

Tighten Squeeze on Power Supply By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOCalifornias already severe electricity squeeze could tighten further this summer if regulators dont ease up on air pollution rules power company officials said Friday The states power plantsmany aging and burning natural gashave been running so hard and long in this summer of electricity scarcity that many are close to spewing as much pollution as they are allowed for the year under their permits Without flexibility from air pollution regulators the plants could be forced to shut down or face fines This summer California cannot afford the loss of any of those plants at times of peak demand said the states lastresort buyer of electricity I cant tell you whether we are in big trouble or medium trouble said Terry Winter who oversees the nonprofit agency that buys lastminute supplies when electricity consumption spikes so high that it threatens to disrupt the states highvoltage grid If it stays really hot and weve got to run every unit said Winter then weve got a problem If it cools off a little bit we could turn off those units exceeding their permits and we wont have a problem at all My sense is by late August well be seeing the problem more severely But were working on it Local and state air pollution regulators say they recognize the problem and will do their best to help avoid outages I was flying by the seat of my pants said Richard Baldwin head of the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District who hurriedly struck a deal last week to keep a gasfired turbine running on the Ventura County coast The plant which would have otherwise been shut down for the rest of the year because of air pollution rules is owned by Houstonbased Reliant Energy one of the major players in Californias recently deregulated electricity market Under the deal Reliant will pay the air district for every hour it runs the relatively dirty plant the rest of the year The money will go toward replacement of heavily polluting diesel engines The agreement means that Californias grid operators can now count on the plant to produce enough electricity to supply homes On a hot day in late July they desperately needed that electricity but could not get it because Reliants air pollution permit allowed hours of operation each year and only five remained Those air quality districts could just throw up their hands and say no not our problem said Winter executive director of the California Independent System Operator the nonprofit entity that runs most of Californias electric grid but they have all been very responsive He said his Folsombased staff foresaw the problem and has been talking with the US Environmental Protection Agency the California Air Resources Board and the local air districts that set pollution limits for individual power plants They have been very very cooperative in trying to figure out ways to allow us to continue to generate but at the same time not add more pollutants to the air he said One way to do that Winter said may be to not run power plants in the evenings when demand dips We dont want to put the lights out in the state said Bill Kelly spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District which issued a letter to power producers two weeks ago warning that many will soon bump against their air pollution limits We asked them if theyre going to be above their caps to come in and work with us on compliance plans Kelly said These plans would be developed through public hearings What can be done will vary with every plant in the state said V John White who sits on the CalISO board and directs the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies in Sacramento Air quality will not suffer significantly White said with some creative application of rules and the principle that youve got to pay for the pollution somehow The root of the current conflict between air pollution and energy production lies with Californias failure in the last years to build any major power plants Demand for electricity in the states humming economy has soared higher than anyone anticipated while new supplies are not expected to reach the grid for at least a year Several times this summer grid operators have had to frantically purchase electricity elsewhere in the West to save the state from outages that can endanger lives and cost hightech companies as much as million a day in lost production The shortage of electricity compromises air quality When businesses voluntarily disconnect from the grid at times of highest demand they often turn on diesel generators to maintain computer and phone systems Such generators spew toxic air contaminants particulates and higher levels of nitrogen oxides than most power plants The tight supplies this summer also mean that Californias old inefficient power plants are running harder than ever and those built just for backup are running steadily Duke Energys power plant in Oakland helped keep lights on in the city after a disastrous earthquake Typically the costly plant operated to hours a year its air pollution permit allows no more than hours annually So far this year said Duke spokesman Tom Williams the plant has run more than hours The turbines date to late s he said Theyre being called on more and more North Carolinabased Duke purchased or leased several major power plants from utilities such as Pacific Gas Electric Co and San Diego Gas Electric after the Legislature deregulated the states electricity market in One plant in Chula Vista generates enough electricity for homes in San Diego where transmission problems leave the city especially vulnerable to power sags and surges That plant is rapidly approaching its limit on nitrogen oxide pollutants Williams said Were

making on what we might be able to do there proactively Some things I will be doing are calling Randi McCormick the CWB in California who reportedly has more knowledge about the NCLP than anyone else I will be setting a meeting with her probably at her office or wherever she keeps all of the records maps etc on the preserve so she might brief me on the NCLP and the restrictions that she believes EOTT is operating under with the HCP I am placing calls to the Nature Conservancy in California to see what they know about the preserve incidentally the Steven McCormick executive director of the California Chapter of TNC has been named the new President of the Nature Conservancy succeeding the late John Sawhill I may give him a call and see who he recommends that I call in California to get the inside scoop on the North Coles Levee Preserve I will make several other calls gathering information You need to begin talking with Scott Jones and Rick Sudderman to learn all you can from their

that they thought should have come to me instead of Dave They were correct Please take note for future emails that I am John Shafer and not Dave Schafer Now related to the essence of your email message below I am still in the process of gather information related to the California Endangered Species Act Memorandum or Understanding and Take Authorization as agreed to by the Koch Oil Company and the California Department of Fish and Game on Jan related to which Ed Attanasio has stated that such MOU and permit was assigned to EOTT after the sale of the facilities to EOTT I am requesting from Mr Attanasio copies of the January Annual Report that supposedly have been filed by EOTT with the CDFG related to activities associated with this MOU I am also holding conversations with Randi McCormick and Ed Attanasio related to the status of the USFWS Federal Incidental Take Permit issued to Arco Western Energy in March covering the same properties Therefore my comments are somewhat cursory at this point but Im getting up to speed pretty fast on this very important issue We need to thoroughly understand what agreements are in place both with the CDFG and the USFWS before we do something within this protected preserve to one of these rare threatened or endangered species that we will all live to regret Everything may be perfect and all agency personnel happy as a tree frog in the middle of a swamp in August but Im not convinced yet that we even know what these predecessors agreed to and why Some of the things I am aware of at this point The California MOU and Incidental Take Permit applies to the North Coles Levee Natural Gas Fractionator Plant Rogas Railcar facility miles of existing pipeline and miles of proposed pipeline Caveat Is this project part of the miles that has already been presented to the CDFG by Koch or is this something outside that agreement Also what about the US Fish and Wildlife Service concerns over these species Where is the agreement with the USFWS If there is not one done a fullblown Environmental Impact Study will have to be performed to get the Section consultation done under the Federal Endangered Specie Act The North Coles Plant occupies acres right in the heart of the protected preserve California Endangered species involved by the MOU and permit animals shrimp plants all of these are also Federally Endangered California Protected species involved by the MOU and permit animals these are not listed by the Feds Take Authorizations are very restricted another words if you illegally take kill harrass damage their habitat etc one of these plants or animals you go to jail and do not collect when you pass go Notices of activities to the CDFG are very restrictive and must be precisely completed prior to any ground disturbance In certain instances prior to any human intrusion into protected areas Orientation and training related to the species permit restrictions etc must be done with all employees prior to entering a construction area Biologist must be on hand for all activities All covers on oil drains pipes pits etc must be maintained as to prevent injury to wildlife Preactivity survey work must be done before any offroad driving is done except in case of emergency Mitigation Permanent loss of habitat to Temporary loss of habitat to Compensation provided on annual basis in advance of years activities Caveat Has this been done All pipe will be inspected prior to moving it If a trapped or an injured animal is discovered the CDFG is to be notified immediately All trenches are to provide an escape route for animals in steep wall trench areas Lizards in areas where the BluntNosed Leopard Lizard are found all excavation is to be done by hand Daylight work only Revegetate with local stock Reports during and post construction must be timely as indicated in permit All other activities regular maintenance during the year are to be reported on a January Report filed with the CDFG stating the effectiveness of the measures taken Koch was to establish a Pledged Savings Account or trust for the amount needed to stand behind the activities undertaken during the year until such Habitat Management Land would be donated by Koch to mitigate for the impacts that had occurred Also Koch was to provide an Endowment to CDFG for management of any new lands donated and pay all reasonable expenses I assume this also applies to EOTT now that EOTT is the owner Koch could proceed under this State Permit with ground disturbance activities prior to having the acreage to donate as long as the savings account andor trust was set up and funded to cover the activities Any default and the permit is rescinded and the CDFG will bring all charges both corporate and individual Term years from Jan Caveat A Scott Clark signed this agreement on behalf of Koch in Is this the same Scott Clark that now works for Randy Rice As you can see I only know enough about this issue at this point to be dangerous However I would caution each and every one of you to proceed with appropriate caution until we have all of the facts If we have a problem with the proposed construction or with our daily maintenance activities related to any of these species or this agreement we will need to have all the facts correctly identified and completed I am also attempting to have a conference call with most

is my understanding that they have the project on there desk and are looking at it Once we receive there approval we will send a biologist out to trap for three days to see what species are in the path of construction At the same time we can put up the bond for purchase of the required compensation lands with the Kern Water Bank Authority and Area Energy The permit we have with the Fish and Game requires a day notices before start of construction with a company contact Under Ed Attanasio guidance I sent notice of construction to the Fish and Game and that I would be the local contact for this project One issue that could keep us from trapping is the outside temperature if it is to cold the species will be trapped and not able to get back to there burrows and will freeze to death Randi McCormick believes we will have approval in two weeks but there is not any guarantee the State works at there own pace The second issues is a stream bed alteration permit with the Army Corp of

I dont know if any number for such acreage was included in the cost figures presented to the Board presumably some estimate was included There are two different types of compensation credits we will need to purchase Coles Levee Ecopreserve CLEP credits and Kern Water Bank KWB credits For KWB we will need acres to start the project From the figures I have been quoted these should cost This is only for installation of the new lines however and does not include acreage to cover removal of the existing line I will not here hazard a quess as to how many additional acres this will require but it could well be that same amount again as the lines are the same length The Enron folks can determine the actual number For CLEP we need acres While our take permit only requires us to post a letter of credit for in lieu of immediate purchase as security to ensure we will follow through with the actual purchase I believe the actual cost of buying the credits will be higher perhaps three times that amount because the market for these credits has firmed substantially since Koch was issued that permit Again the Enron folks can give us a hard number once they get an actual quote from Aera or some other seller So I believe we are looking at a best case of about and worst case of for purchasing compensation acreage John do you agree Thanks ETA Dana Gibbs To Edward ott Bob JacobsLong ott AM cc

on Arco Western Energys sale of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant and premises to Koch Oil and Gas and Kochs subsequent sale of the plant and premises to EOTT ENERGY In the letter the following limitations and clarifications were listed Because the conservation credits may be used for mitigation of EOTT impacts or sold by EOTT to third parties for their own mitigation needs EOTT must affirm that it will conform to the Departments standards for sale of conservation credits as well as management of the credit lands These obligations are already implied by the chain of Kochs and then EOTTs

letter notes however that we still need to purchase compensation acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank Specifically we must do the following contact Cheryl Harding of Kern Water Bank to acquire acres of compensation credits and to get included in their Master Permit and get Cheryl Harding a letter from the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve Mark Poe of Aera stating that we have

because as Kenny can attest our past experience has been that whenever a lawyer contacts the Water Bank it prompts them to automatically get their lawyers involved And our experience has been that this only slows things down or worse My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for proposed contract for acquisition of acres of

After returning from Austin on Wednesday and learning that Larry Campbell hadreceived a negative reaction from EPA Region IX concerning a possibl e meeting with them I worked on this issue most of Thursday and Friday The strategy I discussed with Lou was to locate a local Arizona or California politicallawyer typewho would have the necessary contacts to get us in there and get the permits moving Lou agreed and we have been working o n that strategy while gathering more information related to the right conta ct that could get this job done I personally have had lengthy discussions Thursday and Friday with Lou Larry Campbell Bill Kendrick and several k ey consultants that have extensive contacts within both Arizona and CaliforniaWe are closing in on alocal law firm and also a high le velair consultantwho will be able to get us in at the Director or Air Permit Chief levelto present oursituation clean air needs for Arizona a nd CA and how long these permits have already been on file We should hav e someone identified early this next week Let me present the following information tocomplement yours The permitting timelinebeing usedwas based on historical timelinesencounteredwhile processing prior Arizona projects No indication of backlogs or slower processing in the beginning A familiar consultan t Argentwas used for the air permit applications and no indication was offered by the AZ DEQ or EPA Region IX that normal processing was not occurring Applications filed in March and by letter from the age ncies were deemed complete by midApril Within the last two weeks the Arizona DEQ Permit Engineer assigned to th e applications for Station and has stated that he is overloaded and worki ng on the applications as they are in the que He told Larry Campbell a nd I have verifiedit also by talking to outside consultants that permit in Arizona that this is true and the AZ DEQ have been very slow lately in getting permits out Caveat One of the suggestions we want to carry in to AZ DEQ is that we would be willing to pay for a thirdparty contractor to take the permits and work them upfor release to the publishing firm so they can be sent out for public comment AZ DEQ is willing to meet with us a nd discuss our applications Even if we get this part going this is only part of the problem Bottom line iswe must play our cardscorrec tly at this juncture to be able to get our applications moved up in the que typed and out for public comment but EPA Region IX will still have thirty days after that for their review of those two state issued permits EPA Region IX is a different story It is most difficult to put press ure on them more so than AZ DEQ The applications for Stations and are on tribal land and theseapplications are not delegated to any state air qu ality departmentAfter the technical meetings in the office last week La rry made a couple of callsto the Permit Engineerin Region IX and received a negative response Larry was told that thepermits would issue in one to four months and thatthere was no need for a meeting with them Againmy adv ice at this point is to find the right person with the right contacts at a very high level and get the meeting set Its one thing to pressure the State of Arizona and get a permit applications moving but if we are not very carefu l with Region IX we could damage our ability to not only get Sun Devils permits but create audits and compliance situations that are far reaching Again we must first get a personal meeting with themto enable us to presentthe need circumstances and how long these permits have already been on file Locating thecorrect person to help us do that is of upmost importance Clarifying the complicated point EPA Region IX has responsibility toreview and publish not only the permits for Stations and but to also review the AZ DEQ permits for stations and for days Therefor e if we anger EPA Region IX over permits for Stations and they could delay the issuance of the permits for Stations and thathave been expedited wi th the AZ DEQ Its a twoedged sword Our Strategy Continue to work on the technical staff permit engineers but very carefully Indications are that our phone calls are beginning to annoy them Locate a politicallawyer type that has connections at the top of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX to help us get thedesired meeting with keypeople in order tomovethe permits This should be done within the next week Offer to assist in any manner eg funding a third party to get the permit applications moving out of AZ DEQ and EPA Region

Tighten Squeeze on Power Supply By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOCalifornias already severe electricity squeeze could tighten further this summer if regulators dont ease up on air pollution rules power company officials said Friday The states power plantsmany aging and burning natural gashave been running so hard and long in this summer of electricity scarcity that many are close to spewing as much pollution as they are allowed for the year under their permits Without flexibility from air pollution regulators the plants could be forced to shut down or face fines This summer California cannot afford the loss of any of those plants at times of peak demand said the states lastresort buyer of electricity I cant tell you whether we are in big trouble or medium trouble said Terry Winter who oversees the nonprofit agency that buys lastminute supplies when electricity consumption spikes so high that it threatens to disrupt the states highvoltage grid If it stays really hot and weve got to run every unit said Winter then weve got a problem If it cools off a little bit we could turn off those units exceeding their permits and we wont have a problem at all My sense is by late August well be seeing the problem more severely But were working on it Local and state air pollution regulators say they recognize the problem and will do their best to help avoid outages I was flying by the seat of my pants said Richard Baldwin head of the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District who hurriedly struck a deal last week to keep a gasfired turbine running on the Ventura County coast The plant which would have otherwise been shut down for the rest of the year because of air pollution rules is owned by Houstonbased Reliant Energy one of the major players in Californias recently deregulated electricity market Under the deal Reliant will pay the air district for every hour it runs the relatively dirty plant the rest of the year The money will go toward replacement of heavily polluting diesel engines The agreement means that Californias grid operators can now count on the plant to produce enough electricity to supply homes On a hot day in late July they desperately needed that electricity but could not get it because Reliants air pollution permit allowed hours of operation each year and only five remained Those air quality districts could just throw up their hands and say no not our problem said Winter executive director of the California Independent System Operator the nonprofit entity that runs most of Californias electric grid but they have all been very responsive He said his Folsombased staff foresaw the problem and has been talking with the US Environmental Protection Agency the California Air Resources Board and the local air districts that set pollution limits for individual power plants They have been very very cooperative in trying to figure out ways to allow us to continue to generate but at the same time not add more pollutants to the air he said One way to do that Winter said may be to not run power plants in the evenings when demand dips We dont want to put the lights out in the state said Bill Kelly spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District which issued a letter to power producers two weeks ago warning that many will soon bump against their air pollution limits We asked them if theyre going to be above their caps to come in and work with us on compliance plans Kelly said These plans would be developed through public hearings What can be done will vary with every plant in the state said V John White who sits on the CalISO board and directs the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies in Sacramento Air quality will not suffer significantly White said with some creative application of rules and the principle that youve got to pay for the pollution somehow The root of the current conflict between air pollution and energy production lies with Californias failure in the last years to build any major power plants Demand for electricity in the states humming economy has soared higher than anyone anticipated while new supplies are not expected to reach the grid for at least a year Several times this summer grid operators have had to frantically purchase electricity elsewhere in the West to save the state from outages that can endanger lives and cost hightech companies as much as million a day in lost production The shortage of electricity compromises air quality When businesses voluntarily disconnect from the grid at times of highest demand they often turn on diesel generators to maintain computer and phone systems Such generators spew toxic air contaminants particulates and higher levels of nitrogen oxides than most power plants The tight supplies this summer also mean that Californias old inefficient power plants are running harder than ever and those built just for backup are running steadily Duke Energys power plant in Oakland helped keep lights on in the city after a disastrous earthquake Typically the costly plant operated to hours a year its air pollution permit allows no more than hours annually So far this year said Duke spokesman Tom Williams the plant has run more than hours The turbines date to late s he said Theyre being called on more and more North Carolinabased Duke purchased or leased several major power plants from utilities such as Pacific Gas Electric Co and San Diego Gas Electric after the Legislature deregulated the states electricity market in One plant in Chula Vista generates enough electricity for homes in San Diego where transmission problems leave the city especially vulnerable to power sags and surges That plant is rapidly approaching its limit on nitrogen oxide pollutants Williams said Were

which the Bakersfield plant is located I think Ed the EOTT lawyer has realized that hes not going to buffalo me on any of these issues and will begin to openly share information and support my decision making on what we might be able to do there proactively Some things I will be doing are calling Randi McCormick the CWB in California who reportedly has more knowledge about the NCLP than anyone else I will be setting a meeting with her probably at her office or wherever she keeps all of the records maps etc on the preserve so she might brief me on the NCLP and the restrictions that she believes EOTT is operating under with the HCP I am placing calls to the Nature Conservancy in California to see what they know about the preserve incidentally the Steven McCormick executive director of the California Chapter of TNC has been named the new President of the Nature Conservancy succeeding the late John Sawhill I may give him a call and see who he recommends that I call in California to get the inside scoop on the North Coles Levee Preserve I will make several other calls gathering information You need to begin talking with Scott Jones and Rick Sudderman to learn all you can from their perspective about the easement and the preserve be available to meet with me and Randi when I get a meeting set begin assisting my efforts to develop a proactive plan related to EOTTs involvement in the NCLP As always thanks for your support John Forwarded by John ShaferOTSEnron on AM From Edward OTT on PM PST To John NRON cc Larry CampbellET NRON Louis SoldanoET NRON Molly ott Randy NRON Rich JollyET NRON William NRON Subject Re NCL Preserve History Bakersfield The State Take Permit and the Consevation Easement were mailed yesterday Please let me know if you dont receive them by Friday You are quite right that the State Permit covers only state rare threatened and endangered species However with the sole exception of the San Joaquin Antelope Squirrel which is state listed only all state listed animal species are federally listed as well Though the lists are virtually identical the rankings on each list are not that is a species considered endangered by the state may only be considered threatened by the feds and viceversaetc Listed species of plant on the other hand are not the same federally and state Plus there indeed are species of concern within the easement that are not yet listed Randi McCormick has some pretty comprehensive listings on both of these points that is lists of federally and state rare threatened and endangered species of plants and species of concern Ill have her send info on this to you Lastly I dont have a contact with the State Database folks and I dont think weve ever dealt with them I apologize if I seemed argumentative about Kenny I wasnt meaning to be I just wanted you to understand how and why that designation came about In any event I would very much look forward to discussing with you andor Larry andor whomever else you think should be involved the habitat training issue the status and further processing of our Federal Take Permit Application and related topics Thanks ETA John NRON PM To Edward OTT cc Louis

which was sent on to me regardless what I have in my possession is entitled US Fish and Wildlife service Incidental Take Permit No dated and made out to a permittee named Arco Western Energy It is helpful to have it and I am grateful to whomever sent it my way I do appreciate your relating the chain of custody of the federal permit for the North Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve NCLEP Thanks also for sending Randis phone numbers I would appreciate a copy of the CDFG permit that has been assigned to EOTT and a copy of the Conservation Easement I assume that the State CDFG permit relates to only state rare threatened and endangered species or does it also cover the federally listed species Are there any species of concern that the CDFG are working with within the easement boundaries beyond those officially listed Do you have a contact with the California Natural Heritage Program California Natural Diversity Database within the Califormia Dept of Fish Game that you have been visiting with about the NCLEP Again I am not trying to argue the point about Kenny Maltby My point to you and others is that Kenny plainly told me that he has no comprehensive knowledge about the permit and the requirements of the permit He said he relies on you and Randi McCormick for that Your attempt to stopgap with Kenny since Gary had departed to ensure representation in the field for the CDFG is understood I will want to further discuss with you the need to possibly have more people knowledgeable in the matters of the permit and involved in the execution of the same with the CDFG From Edward OTT on PM To John NRON cc Louis SoldanoET NRON Molly ott Randy NRON Rich JollyET NRON Subject Re NCL Preserve History Bakersfield I dont believe I sent you the Arco USFWS ITP No federal take permit was ever assigned to EOTT by Koch because Koch represented that it did not have such a permit rather it purportedly was having discussions with USFWS re this issue pending at the time of the asset sale to EOTT As I understand it any such federal permit was not assigned by Arco to Koch for whatever reason and consequently EOTT ended up not having a federal permit assigned to it by Koch Instead we took over the application process from Koch That application is still pending The permit from which I quoted in the email was the California Department of Fish and Game ITP between CDFG and Koch which was assigned to EOTT in connection with the asset purchase Ill be happy to send you a copy along with a copy of the Conservation Easement that is referenced in my last email Regarding Kenny Maltby the short answer is of course ETS can and indeed should designate whomever it thinks best to be the representative responsible for communications with the CDFG and for oversing the compliance with the take permit But as of last Wednesday the designated representative was Gary Fuller Matt Hughes et al informed me that they wanted to begin construction on the Rogas Line by February and possibly as early as January Consequently a new representative had to be named on short order in fact the permit technically requires such notice days in advance of ground disturbing activities While the CDFG will cut us some slack in view of Garys departure that indulgence is probably not limitless I continue to believe that Kenny M was the only logical choice While I believe Rick Suderman and Scott Jones specifically and all plant employees generally are aware of the habitat and a number of the operational issues covered by the take permit I believe Kenny has a more comprehensive knowledge of the permit requirements in their entirety including preconstruction and construction measures and compensation acreage requirements as well as how they apply to pipeline construction generally and this project specifically I tend to think that Kennys warm body comment is more a reflection of his modesty than the intent here in fact I thought of Kenny only because I did not want just a warm body appointed Simply put I was attempting a stopgap measure to ensure that this specific project got off the ground on ETSs own schedule I was in no way attempting to dictate who would be the representative for the long term Randi McCormicks phone is and her fax is If you need anything else please let me know Thanks ETA John NRON PM To Edward OTT cc Louis SoldanoET NRON Molly ott Randy NRON Rich JollyET NRON Subject NCL Preserve History Bakersfield Ed Lou forwarded your email on to me and I appreciate getting it The information I received I assume from you is actually a copy of a USFWS Incidental Take Permit ITP dated which is related to a Habitat Conservation Plan HCP covering a portion of the San Joaquin Valley floor in Kern County CA The permittee is shown as Arco Western Energy I am assuming that the ITP was transferred to Koch and then subsequently to EOTT as those property sales consummated In order to more fully understand how this permit relates to the EOTT facilities could I obtain a copy of the permit from which you are quoting in your email I dont find those sections or quotes in the copy Lou forwarded I found a paragraph very interesting in your email relating that Kenny Maltby is the designated representative responsible for communications with the California Department of Fish and Game and for overseeing the compliance with the take permit and that the two of you are the only personnel in California who are aware of the Permit and its requirements It is my understanding that Kenny reports into Randy Rices organization and works for Rich Jolly I believe that Kenny was only designated last Friday by a letter mailed to California Game and Fish as such a representative and in his own words he is a warm body for the California Game and Fish to contact related to the permit I have no problem with Kenny being a contact during the pipeline construction in the area but may want to make some further changes on contacts as we learn more about the Conservation Easement and its restrictions I recall that Randi McCormick was the CWB being used for work in the Conservation Area and I plan to give her a call By the way can you please furnish her phone number for me Again please furnish a more complete copy of the permit and any other information that might explain more fully the easement and its requirements Thanks John

that they thought should have come to me instead of Dave They were correct Please take note for future emails that I am John Shafer and not Dave Schafer Now related to the essence of your email message below I am still in the process of gather information related to the California Endangered Species Act Memorandum or Understanding and Take Authorization as agreed to by the Koch Oil Company and the California Department of Fish and Game on Jan related to which Ed Attanasio has stated that such MOU and permit was assigned to EOTT after the sale of the facilities to EOTT I am requesting from Mr Attanasio copies of the January Annual Report that supposedly have been filed by EOTT with the CDFG related to activities associated with this MOU I am also holding conversations with Randi McCormick and Ed Attanasio related to the status of the USFWS Federal Incidental Take Permit issued to Arco Western Energy in March covering the same properties Therefore my comments are somewhat cursory at this point but Im getting up to speed pretty fast on this very important issue We need to thoroughly understand what agreements are in place both with the CDFG and the USFWS before we do something within this protected preserve to one of these rare threatened or endangered species that we will all live to regret Everything may be perfect and all agency personnel happy as a tree frog in the middle of a swamp in August but Im not convinced yet that we even know what these predecessors agreed to and why Some of the things I am aware of at this point The California MOU and Incidental Take Permit applies to the North Coles Levee Natural Gas Fractionator Plant Rogas Railcar facility miles of existing pipeline and miles of proposed pipeline Caveat Is this project part of the miles that has already been presented to the CDFG by Koch or is this something outside that agreement Also what about the US Fish and Wildlife Service concerns over these species Where is the agreement with the USFWS If there is not one done a fullblown Environmental Impact Study will have to be performed to get the Section consultation done under the Federal Endangered Specie Act The North Coles Plant occupies acres right in the heart of the protected preserve California Endangered species involved by the MOU and permit animals shrimp plants all of these are also Federally Endangered California Protected species involved by the MOU and permit animals these are not listed by the Feds Take Authorizations are very restricted another words if you illegally take kill harrass damage their habitat etc one of these plants or animals you go to jail and do not collect when you pass go Notices of activities to the CDFG are very restrictive and must be precisely completed prior to any ground disturbance In certain instances prior to any human intrusion into protected areas Orientation and training related to the species permit restrictions etc must be done with all employees prior to entering a construction area Biologist must be on hand for all activities All covers on oil drains pipes pits etc must be maintained as to prevent injury to wildlife Preactivity survey work must be done before any offroad driving is done except in case of emergency Mitigation Permanent loss of habitat to Temporary loss of habitat to Compensation provided on annual basis in advance of years activities Caveat Has this been done All pipe will be inspected prior to moving it If a trapped or an injured animal is discovered the CDFG is to be notified immediately All trenches are to provide an escape route for animals in steep wall trench areas Lizards in areas where the BluntNosed Leopard Lizard are found all excavation is to be done by hand Daylight work only Revegetate with local stock Reports during and post construction must be timely as indicated in permit All other activities regular maintenance during the year are to be reported on a January Report filed with the CDFG stating the effectiveness of the measures taken Koch was to establish a Pledged Savings Account or trust for the amount needed to stand behind the activities undertaken during the year until such Habitat Management Land would be donated by Koch to mitigate for the impacts that had occurred Also Koch was to provide an Endowment to CDFG for management of any new lands donated and pay all reasonable expenses I assume this also applies to EOTT now that EOTT is the owner Koch could proceed under this State Permit with ground disturbance activities prior to having the acreage to donate as long as the savings account andor trust was set up and funded to cover the activities Any default and the permit is rescinded and the CDFG will bring all charges both corporate and individual Term years from Jan Caveat A Scott Clark signed this agreement on behalf of Koch in Is this the same Scott Clark that now works for Randy Rice As you can see I only know enough about this issue at this point to be dangerous However I would caution each and every one of you to proceed with appropriate caution until we have all of the facts If we have a problem with the proposed construction or with our daily

is my understanding that they have the project on there desk and are looking at it Once we receive there approval we will send a biologist out to trap for three days to see what species are in the path of construction At the same time we can put up the bond for purchase of the required compensation lands with the Kern Water Bank Authority and Area Energy The permit we have with the Fish and Game requires a day notices before start of construction with a company contact Under Ed Attanasio guidance I sent notice of construction to the Fish and Game and that I would be the local contact for this project One issue that could keep us from trapping is the outside temperature if it is to cold the species will be trapped and not able to get back to there burrows and will freeze to death Randi McCormick believes we will have approval in two weeks but there is not any guarantee the State works at there own pace The second issues is a stream bed alteration permit with the Army Corp of

I dont know if any number for such acreage was included in the cost figures presented to the Board presumably some estimate was included There are two different types of compensation credits we will need to purchase Coles Levee Ecopreserve CLEP credits and Kern Water Bank KWB credits For KWB we will need acres to start the project From the figures I have been quoted these should cost This is only for installation of the new lines however and does not include acreage to cover removal of the existing line I will not here hazard a quess as to how many additional acres this will require but it could well be that same amount again as the lines are the same length The Enron folks can determine the actual number For CLEP we need acres While our take permit only requires us to post a letter of credit for in lieu of immediate purchase as security to ensure we will follow through with the actual purchase I believe the actual cost of buying the credits will be higher perhaps three times that amount because the market for these credits has firmed substantially since Koch was issued that permit Again the Enron folks can give us a hard number once they get an actual quote from Aera or some other seller So I believe we are looking at a best case of about and worst case of for purchasing compensation acreage John do you agree Thanks ETA Dana Gibbs To Edward ott Bob JacobsLong ott AM cc

limitations and clarifications were listed Because the conservation credits may be used for mitigation of EOTT impacts or sold by EOTT to third parties for their own mitigation needs EOTT must affirm that it will conform to the Departments standards for sale of conservation credits as well as management of the credit lands These obligations are already implied by the chain of Kochs and then EOTTs

letter notes however that we still need to purchase compensation acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank Specifically we must do the following contact Cheryl Harding of Kern Water Bank to acquire acres of compensation credits and to get included in their Master Permit and get Cheryl Harding a letter from the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve Mark Poe of Aera stating that we have purchased acres of credits for North Coles Levee or that we have set aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased While I could make these contacts I do not believe that would be wise

this only slows things down or worse My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for proposed contract for acquisition of acres of compensation credits and perperwork to include EOTT and its contractors in their Master Permit She should also be informed that while we have not yet purchased the acres of NCL credits we will by the

After returning from Austin on Wednesday and learning that Larry Campbell hadreceived a negative reaction from EPA Region IX concerning a possibl e meeting with them I worked on this issue most of Thursday and Friday The strategy I discussed with Lou was to locate a local Arizona or California politicallawyer typewho would have the necessary contacts to get us in there and get the permits moving Lou agreed and we have been working o n that strategy while gathering more information related to the right conta ct that could get this job done I personally have had lengthy discussions Thursday and Friday with Lou Larry Campbell Bill Kendrick and several k ey consultants that have extensive contacts within both Arizona and CaliforniaWe are closing in on alocal law firm and also a high le velair consultantwho will be able to get us in at the Director or Air Permit Chief levelto present oursituation clean air needs for Arizona a nd CA and how long these permits have already been on file We should hav e someone identified early this next week Let me present the following information tocomplement yours The permitting timelinebeing usedwas based on historical timelinesencounteredwhile processing prior Arizona projects No indication of backlogs or slower processing in the beginning A familiar consultan t Argentwas used for the air permit applications and no indication was offered by the AZ DEQ or EPA Region IX that normal processing was not occurring Applications filed in March and by letter from the age ncies were deemed complete by midApril Within the last two weeks the Arizona DEQ Permit Engineer assigned to th e applications for Station and has stated that he is overloaded and worki ng on the applications as they are in the que He told Larry Campbell a nd I have verifiedit also by talking to outside consultants that permit in Arizona that this is true and the AZ DEQ have been very slow lately in getting permits out Caveat One of the suggestions we want to carry in to AZ DEQ is that we would be willing to pay for a thirdparty contractor to take the permits and work them upfor release to the publishing firm so they can be sent out for public comment AZ DEQ is willing to meet with us a nd discuss our applications Even if we get this part going this is only part of the problem Bottom line iswe must play our cardscorrec tly at this juncture to be able to get our applications moved up in the que typed and out for public comment but EPA Region IX will still have thirty days after that for their review of those two state issued permits EPA Region IX is a different story It is most difficult to put press ure on them more so than AZ DEQ The applications for Stations and are on tribal land and theseapplications are not delegated to any state air qu ality departmentAfter the technical meetings in the office last week La rry made a couple of callsto the Permit Engineerin Region IX and received a negative response Larry was told that thepermits would issue in one to four months and thatthere was no need for a meeting with them Againmy adv ice at this point is to find the right person with the right contacts at a very high level and get the meeting set Its one thing to pressure the State of Arizona and get a permit applications moving but if we are not very carefu l with Region IX we could damage our ability to not only get Sun Devils permits but create audits and compliance situations that are far reaching Again we must first get a personal meeting with themto enable us to presentthe need circumstances and how long these permits have already been on file Locating thecorrect person to help us do that is of upmost importance Clarifying the complicated point EPA Region IX has responsibility toreview and publish not only the permits for Stations and but to also review the AZ DEQ permits for stations and for days Therefor e if we anger EPA Region IX over permits for Stations and they could delay the issuance of the permits for Stations and thathave been expedited wi th the AZ DEQ Its a twoedged sword Our Strategy Continue to work on the technical staff permit engineers but very carefully Indications are that our phone calls are beginning to annoy them Locate a politicallawyer type that has connections at the top of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX to help us get thedesired meeting with keypeople in order tomovethe permits This should be done within the next week Offer to assist in any manner eg funding a third party to get the permit applications moving out of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX for public comme nt I have some strategic ideas that will increase theprobability that this type of circumstance will not occur in the future I will be glad to discuss any of this with you on

industry Original Message From Mary ODriscollPerry Plumart To Lisa Beal Cc Mary ODriscoll Sent PM Subject Saturdays LA Times on a new twist in the California power shortage story Pollution Rules Tighten Squeeze on Power Supply By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOCalifornias already severe electricity squeeze could tighten further this summer if regulators dont ease up on air pollution rules power company officials said Friday The states power plantsmany aging and burning natural gashave been running so hard and long in this summer of electricity scarcity that many are close to spewing as much pollution as they are allowed for the year under their permits Without flexibility from air pollution regulators the plants could be forced to shut down or face fines This summer California cannot afford the loss of any of those plants at times of peak demand said the states lastresort buyer of electricity I cant tell you whether we are in big trouble or medium trouble said Terry Winter who oversees the nonprofit agency that buys lastminute supplies when electricity consumption spikes so high that it threatens to disrupt the states highvoltage grid If it stays really hot and weve got to run every unit said Winter then weve got a problem If it cools off a little bit we could turn off those units exceeding their permits and we wont have a problem at all My sense is by late August well be seeing the problem more severely But were working on it Local and state air pollution regulators say they recognize the problem and will do their best to help avoid outages I was flying by the seat of my pants said Richard Baldwin head of the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District who hurriedly struck a deal last week to keep a gasfired turbine running on the Ventura County coast The plant which would have otherwise been shut down for the rest of the year because of air pollution rules is owned by Houstonbased Reliant Energy one of the major players in Californias recently deregulated electricity market Under the deal Reliant will pay the air district for every hour it runs the relatively dirty plant the rest of the year The money will go toward replacement of heavily polluting diesel engines The agreement means that Californias grid operators can now count on the plant to produce enough electricity to supply homes On a hot day in late July they desperately needed that electricity but could not get it because Reliants air pollution permit allowed hours of operation each year and only five remained Those air quality districts could just throw up their hands and say no not our problem said Winter executive director of the California Independent System Operator the nonprofit entity that runs most of Californias electric grid but they have all been very responsive He said his Folsombased staff foresaw the problem and has been talking with the US Environmental Protection Agency the California Air Resources Board and the local air districts that set pollution limits for individual power plants They have been very very cooperative in trying to figure out ways to allow us to continue to generate but at the same time not add more pollutants to the air he said One way to do that Winter said may be to not run power plants in the evenings when demand dips We dont want to put the lights out in the state said Bill Kelly spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District which issued a letter to power producers two weeks ago warning that many will soon bump against their air pollution limits We asked them if theyre going to be above their caps to come in and work with us on compliance plans Kelly said These plans would be developed through public hearings What can be done will vary with every plant in the state said V John White who sits on the CalISO board and directs the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies in Sacramento Air quality will not suffer significantly White said with some creative application of rules and the principle that youve got to pay for the pollution somehow The root of the current conflict between air pollution and energy production lies with Californias failure in the last years to build any major power plants Demand for electricity in the states humming economy has soared higher than anyone anticipated while new supplies are not expected to reach the grid for at least a year Several times this summer grid operators have had to frantically purchase electricity elsewhere in the West to save the state from outages that can endanger lives and cost hightech companies as much as million a day in lost production The shortage of electricity compromises air quality When businesses voluntarily disconnect from the grid at times of highest demand they often turn on diesel generators to maintain computer and phone systems Such generators spew toxic air contaminants particulates and higher levels of nitrogen oxides than most power plants The tight supplies this summer also mean that Californias old inefficient power plants are running harder than ever and those built just for backup are running steadily Duke Energys power plant in Oakland helped keep lights on in the city after a disastrous earthquake Typically the costly plant operated to hours a year its air pollution permit allows no more than hours annually So far this year said Duke spokesman Tom Williams the plant has run more than hours The turbines date to late s he said Theyre being called on more and more North Carolinabased Duke purchased or leased several major power plants from utilities such as Pacific Gas Electric Co and San Diego Gas Electric after the Legislature deregulated the states electricity market in One plant in Chula Vista generates enough electricity for homes in San Diego where transmission problems leave the city especially vulnerable to power sags and surges That plant is rapidly approaching its limit on nitrogen oxide pollutants Williams said Were

returning from Austin on Wednesday and learning that Larry Campbell hadreceived a negative reaction from EPA Region IX concerning a possibl e meeting with them I worked on this issue most of Thursday and Friday The strategy I discussed with Lou was to locate a local Arizona or California politicallawyer typewho would have the necessary contacts to get us in there and get the permits moving Lou agreed and we have been working o n that strategy while gathering more information related to the right conta ct that could get this job done I personally have had lengthy discussions Thursday and Friday with Lou Larry Campbell Bill Kendrick and several k ey consultants that have extensive contacts within both Arizona and CaliforniaWe are closing in on alocal law firm and also a high le velair consultantwho will be able to get us in at the Director or Air Permit Chief levelto present oursituation clean air needs for Arizona a nd CA and how long these permits have already been on file We should hav e someone identified early this next week Let me present the following information tocomplement yours The permitting timelinebeing usedwas based on historical timelinesencounteredwhile processing prior Arizona projects No indication of backlogs or slower processing in the beginning A familiar consultan t Argentwas used for the air permit applications and no indication was offered by the AZ DEQ or EPA Region IX that normal processing was not occurring Applications filed in March and by letter from the age ncies were deemed complete by midApril Within the last two weeks the Arizona DEQ Permit Engineer assigned to th e applications for Station and has stated that he is overloaded and worki ng on the applications as they are in the que He told Larry Campbell a nd I have verifiedit also by talking to outside consultants that permit in Arizona that this is true and the AZ DEQ have been very slow lately in getting permits out Caveat One of the suggestions we want to carry in to AZ DEQ is that we would be willing to pay for a thirdparty contractor to take the permits and work them upfor release to the publishing firm so they can be sent out for public comment AZ DEQ is willing to meet with us a nd discuss our applications Even if we get this part going this is only part of the problem Bottom line iswe must play our cardscorrec tly at this juncture to be able to get our applications moved up in the que typed and out for public comment but EPA Region IX will still have thirty days after that for their review of those two state issued permits EPA Region IX is a different story It is most difficult to put press ure on them more so than AZ DEQ The applications for Stations and are on tribal land and theseapplications are not delegated to any state air qu ality departmentAfter the technical meetings in the office last week La rry made a couple of callsto the Permit Engineerin Region IX and received a negative response Larry was told that thepermits would issue in one to four months and thatthere was no need for a meeting with them Againmy adv ice at this point is to find the right person with the right contacts at a very high level and get the meeting set Its one thing to pressure the State of Arizona and get a permit applications moving but if we are not very carefu l with Region IX we could damage our ability to not only get Sun Devils permits but create audits and compliance situations that are far reaching Again we must first get a personal meeting with themto enable us to presentthe need circumstances and how long these permits have already been on file Locating thecorrect person to help us do that is of upmost importance Clarifying the complicated point EPA Region IX has responsibility toreview and publish not only the permits for Stations and but to also review the AZ DEQ permits for stations and for days Therefor e if we anger EPA Region IX over permits for Stations and they could delay the issuance of the permits for Stations and thathave been expedited wi th the AZ DEQ Its a twoedged sword Our Strategy Continue to work on the technical staff permit engineers but very carefully Indications are that our phone calls are beginning to annoy them Locate a politicallawyer type that has connections at the top of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX to help us get thedesired meeting with keypeople in order tomovethe permits This should be done within the next week Offer to assist in any manner eg funding a third party to get the permit applications moving out of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX for public comme nt I have some strategic ideas that will increase theprobability that this type of circumstance will not occur in the future I will be glad to discuss any of this with you on Monday morning John Shafer Original Message From Lowry Phil Sent Sun AM To Martin Jerry D Cc Shafer John Subject Red Rock Air Permits Heads up At Stans staff meeting last week the discovery of a delay in the issua nce of Air Permits was discussed Stan indicated that this was unacceptable I requested that you conduct a meeting that afternoon with key people to outline a plan of attack to get the permit schedule back on track I am aware that you did such and you provided a voice mail update that indicated a plan Here is the problem Apparently the matter was further discussed at the weekly Red Rock status meeting on Friday and the following feedback was provided by a little birdie We can expect another unpleasant d iscussion at Mondays am meeting with Stan Joe Hartsoe has been unable to pursue any discussion with Washington officials to put pressure on Arizona WTC attacks Operations is unwilling to put much pressure on ArizonaEPA out of concer n for future responsiveness from the agency Re Sun Devil Sun Devil is a bird in the bush and Red Rock is a bird in the hand There is no way that we can get the Red Rock project completed as promise d because we waited until it was too late to find out what was going on with
