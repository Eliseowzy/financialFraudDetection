several weeks ago Tim has asked that both of you let me know of any objectionscomments to this list by the close of business today Otherwise it will be used from tomorrow onwards As indicated previously we only plan to send it to counterparties who request to have something in writing which details the key distinctions between the EEI and the WSPP Thanks Shari and Christian WSPP Section Definition of Uncontrollable Force This definition is too broad It sets out a litany of events any one of which may be considered an Uncontrollable Force by a Party seeking to avoid having to pay liquidated damages in respect of a Firm Transaction under which it has committed to sell or deliver firm energy For instance it is hard to imagine that a drought is a legitimate excuse to relieve a Party of its obligation to deliver Firm Power How can a drought cause power not to flow What is a material shortage etc In contrast EEIs definition of Force Majeure does not include a lengthy list from which a party could pick and choose to its advantage rather the key to the EEI definition is that it characterizes FM as an event that prevents one Party from performing its obligations Related to this critically important concept of firm deliverability where precise wording is very important is the puzzling existence of Section of the WSPP Agreement JUDGMENTS AND DETERMINATIONS Whenever it is provided in this Agreement that a Party shall be the sole judge of whether to what extent or under what conditions it will provide a given service its exercise of its judgment shall be final and not subject to challenge Whenever it is provided that i a service under a given transaction may be curtailed under certain conditions or circumstances the existence of which are determined by or in the judgment of a Party or that Partys or the Executive Committees determination or exercise of judgment shall be final and not subject to challenge if it is made in good faith and not made arbitrarily or capriciously Whatever the intent of this wording may have been what is clear is that it could only cause problems in resolving a deliverability issue WSPP Section Creditworthiness This clause is too subjective It would allow one party for potentially wrong reasons to unilaterally question the others financial viability and require it to post collateral in an amount which is a reasonable estimate of the damages to the requesting party If such collateral is not provided within the allotted time frame an Event of Default occurs In contrast the EEI provides for an objective test in Section c which is based on a set collateral threshold expressed in and which is likely to be commensurate with the amount of unsecured exposure that a party feels comfortable with In addition Enron routinely includes an objectively determinable bilateral material adverse change clause in the EEI Cover Sheet as a Collateral Posting Event additional Event of Default which would be triggered by a partys credit rating not meeting investment grade criteria or certain financial covenantsratios We believe that this combination provides an objectively determinable level of credit protection which both Parties can understand and agree to before entering into any transactions under the agreement All of the following points related to early termination of an agreement are very important to any NonDefaulting party in the precarious circumstances surrounding the termination of a complex trading relationship This is the area where the Agreement is going to have the most potential legal significance to the Parties and this is an area where the WSPP comes up short of the EEI in some fairly substantial ways Events of Default and Early Termination The list of events which can become Events of Default is too short The absence of important events creates significant legal risk For instance Section b speaks to a failure by a party to have made accurate representations and warranties as required by Section Section is the Trade Option Exemption This begs the question as to what happens in the event of a breach of Section Section is where the parties represent that they have the authority to enter into these types of transactions have all necessary regulatory authorizations etc With no Event of Default relating to a breach of these Section reps and warranties what would ones remedy be in the event of a breach of Section In contrast the EEI has a clear Event of Default based on a breach of reps and warranties And consider this example the WSPP Agreement does not make it an Event of Default if a Party breaches a material covenant of the Agreement This basic legal point which appears in the EEI agreement is entirely missing In addition to those listed in the WSPP Agreement the EEI contains the following additional Events of Default Merger without Assumption Cross Default Default by a Partys Guarantor breach of rep failure to pay bankruptcy expiry of guarantee while transactions are outstanding repudiation of guaranty Calculation of Early Termination Payment In order to calculate the value of any prematurely terminated transactions occasioned by an Early Termination Event the WSPP requires a party to use a market quotation comparison method and go out into the market and obtain the present value of the affected transactions Any related hedges that the NonDefaulting Party has in place and now no longer needs cannot be included in the calculations In contrast the EEI as supplemented in our proposed Cover Sheet would allow the NonDefaulting Party the flexibility to calculate a good faith estimate of its Loss by using quotes or internal calculations The NDP would also be allowed to take into account any hedges or breakage costs associated with having had to terminate the transactions early as a result of the other partys default Another problematic point in the WSPP is in Section where it requires the NonDefaulting Party to exercise its right of termination within days of learning about an Event of Default An event does not become an Event of Default until notice and failure to cure has occurred Where an event has been established as an Event of Default if the NonDefaulting Party does not call a termination within this timeframe and if no extension is granted by mutual agreement the NonDefaulting Party forfeits its right to terminate This unnecessary time restriction can only cause trouble in the already difficult circumstances that will exist in a potential termination situation In contrast under the EEI at any time so long as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing the NonDefaulting Party has the right to designate an Early Termination Date and terminate all transactions Governing Law The WSPP provides for Utah law to govern the agreement in most situations Most physical power counterparties are not located in Utah and so are not familiar with this law We would prefer to have a more developed state law govern a power trading contract The EEI provides for NY law which is well suited to handling trading related disputes It is generally recognized that New York commercial law expecially in the important trading related areas of oral trading and bankruptcy is superior to the law of most other states The ISDA for example uses New York law for these reasons Dispute Resolution The WSPP Agreement invokes arbitration and the EEI agreement does not We prefer arbitration however the WSPP version of it is unnecessarily complex First it is not clear under the WSPP Agreement that all claims or disputes arising under it are able to be arbitrated Some disputes can be arbitrated some cannot Our preferred approach would be to use arbitration for all claims or disputes Then assuming that a permissible dispute is being arbitrated the WSPP has a complicated mandatory informal and then formal dispute resolution procedure which requires the constant involvement of the WSPP Chair and the Chairs prechosen list of mediators We think it would be better to have each party select an arbitrator and then have these two arbitrators select a third independent arbitrator with at least years experience in the electricity markets We also think it would be fairer for the dispute to be settled using the arbitration methods set forth by the American Arbitration Association Payment Netting and Closeout NettingSetoff A good master trading agreement should clearly address both payment netting and close out netting and setoff in separate explicit paragraphs of the agreement They are separate topics The EEI does this Section deals with payment netting and Sections and deal with settlement netting and closeout setoffs These unambiguous paragraphs provide very explicit terms under which these important concepts are addressed and thus provide a valuable credit management tool on which the parties can rely The WSPP Agreement on the other hand fails to clearly distinguish between payment netting and closeout nettingsetoff Section seems to be dealing with payment netting and the reference to set off is incomplete and ambiguous as to whether or not it applies to closeout setoff Furthermore Section provides that a party that elects to use payment netting must post this information on the WSPP homepage once the WSPP Homepage possesses the necessary capability What can be posted can be unposted This whole system of confirming netting seems unnecessarily complicated Invoicing Section of the WSPP allows a party to send an invoice within two years from the date on which the invoice should have been delivered In contrast Section of the EEI has no such time frame and the parties are encouraged to send out invoices as soon as possible after the end of each month Contested Amounts Section of the EEI provides that in the event of a dispute the owing party pays only the uncontested amount and then tries to resolve the discrepancy On the other hand Section of the WSPP requires the contesting party to pay the entire disputed amount upfront and then try to resolve the discrepancy Breadth of Agreement The EEI is a nationwide document drafted recently by participants from all parts of the country during the most recent phase of wholesale deregulation when a number of typically difficult legal issues had already been painfully experienced by companies It includes definitions for East power products as well as West power products including products transacted for a California Delivery Point as well as any other Delivery Point in the WSCC The WSPP Agreement on the other hand began in the west during the regulated era and still contains many vestiges of its origins that are no longer necessary and therefore it cannot yet claim the same national scope as the EEI For example it still contemplates the regional notion of Membership in the Western System Power Pool What does this mean Why is this kind of membership necessary What legal value does it have Why should a power trading master agreement need to have sections such as sections dealing with Organization and Administration of various committees No other master agreement dealing with any other commodity including the ISDA agreement contains these notions of membership and committee structures and duties in their texts

<23703261.1075859545040.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,shari.stack@enron.com,2000-12-13 07:51:00,EEIWSPP comparison Cc my email of Nov th Tim has now signed off on the usage of this list Chris Foster okd it several weeks ago Tim has asked that both of you let me know of any objectionscomments to this list by the close of business today Otherwise it will be used from tomorrow onwards As indicated previously we only plan to send it to counterparties who request to have something in writing which details the key distinctions between the EEI and the WSPP Thanks Shari and Christian WSPP Section Definition of Uncontrollable Force This definition is too broad It sets out a litany of events any one of which may be considered an Uncontrollable Force by a Party seeking to avoid having to pay liquidated damages in respect of a Firm Transaction under which it has committed to sell or deliver firm energy For instance it is hard to imagine that a drought is a legitimate excuse to relieve a Party of its obligation to deliver Firm Power How can a drought cause power not to flow What is a material shortage etc In contrast EEIs definition of Force Majeure does not include a lengthy list from which a party could pick and choose to its advantage rather the key to the EEI definition is that it characterizes FM as an event that prevents one Party from performing its obligations Related to this critically important concept of firm deliverability where precise wording is very important is the puzzling existence of Section of the WSPP Agreement JUDGMENTS AND DETERMINATIONS Whenever it is provided in this Agreement that a Party shall be the sole judge of whether to what extent or under what conditions it will provide a given service its exercise of its judgment shall be final and not subject to challenge Whenever it is provided that i a service under a given transaction may be curtailed under certain conditions or circumstances the existence of which are determined by or in the judgment of a Party or that Partys or the Executive Committees determination or exercise of judgment shall be final and not subject to challenge if it is made in good faith and not made arbitrarily or capriciously Whatever the intent of this wording may have been what is clear is that it could only cause problems in resolving a deliverability issue WSPP Section Creditworthiness This clause is too subjective It would allow one party for potentially wrong reasons to unilaterally question the others financial viability and require it to post collateral in an amount which is a reasonable estimate of the damages to the requesting party If such collateral is not provided within the allotted time frame an Event of Default occurs In contrast the EEI provides for an objective test in Section c which is based on a set collateral threshold expressed in and which is likely to be commensurate with the amount of unsecured exposure that a party feels comfortable with In addition Enron routinely includes an objectively determinable bilateral material adverse change clause in the EEI Cover Sheet as a Collateral Posting Event additional Event of Default which would be triggered by a partys credit rating not meeting investment grade criteria or certain financial covenantsratios We believe that this combination provides an objectively determinable level of credit protection which both Parties can understand and agree to before entering into any transactions under the agreement All of the following points related to early termination of an agreement are very important to any NonDefaulting party in the precarious circumstances surrounding the termination of a complex trading relationship This is the area where the Agreement is going to have the most potential legal significance to the Parties and this is an area where the WSPP comes up short of the EEI in some fairly substantial ways Events of Default and Early Termination The list of events which can become Events of Default is too short The absence of important events creates significant legal risk For instance Section b speaks to a failure by a party to have made accurate representations and warranties as required by Section Section is the Trade Option Exemption This begs the question as to what happens in the event of a breach of Section Section is where the parties represent that they have the authority to enter into these types of transactions have all necessary regulatory authorizations etc With no Event of Default relating to a breach of these Section reps and warranties what would ones remedy be in the event of a breach of Section In contrast the EEI has a clear Event of Default based on a breach of reps and warranties And consider this example the WSPP Agreement does not make it an Event of Default if a Party breaches a material covenant of the Agreement This basic legal point which appears in the EEI agreement is entirely missing In addition to those listed in the WSPP Agreement the EEI contains the following additional Events of Default Merger without Assumption Cross Default Default by a Partys Guarantor breach of rep failure to pay bankruptcy expiry of guarantee while transactions are outstanding repudiation of guaranty Calculation of Early Termination Payment In order to calculate the value of any prematurely terminated transactions occasioned by an Early Termination Event the WSPP requires a party to use a market quotation comparison method and go out into the market and obtain the present value of the affected transactions Any related hedges that the NonDefaulting Party has in place and now no longer needs cannot be included in the calculations In contrast the EEI as supplemented in our proposed Cover Sheet would allow the NonDefaulting Party the flexibility to calculate a good faith estimate of its Loss by using quotes or internal calculations The NDP would also be allowed to take into account any hedges or breakage costs associated with having had to terminate the transactions early as a result of the other partys default Another problematic point in the WSPP is in Section where it requires the NonDefaulting Party to exercise its right of termination within days of learning about an Event of Default An event does not become an Event of Default until notice and failure to cure has occurred Where an event has been established as an Event of Default if the NonDefaulting Party does not call a termination within this timeframe and if no extension is granted by mutual agreement the NonDefaulting Party forfeits its right to terminate This unnecessary time restriction can only cause trouble in the already difficult circumstances that will exist in a potential termination situation In contrast under the EEI at any time so long as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing the NonDefaulting Party has the right to designate an Early Termination Date and terminate all transactions Governing Law The WSPP provides for Utah law to govern the agreement in most situations Most physical power counterparties are not located in Utah and so are not familiar with this law We would prefer to have a more developed state law govern a power trading contract The EEI provides for NY law which is well suited to handling trading related disputes It is generally recognized that New York commercial law expecially in the important trading related areas of oral trading and bankruptcy is superior to the law of most other states The ISDA for example uses New York law for these reasons Dispute Resolution The WSPP Agreement invokes arbitration and the EEI agreement does not We prefer arbitration however the WSPP version of it is unnecessarily complex First it is not clear under the WSPP Agreement that all claims or disputes arising under it are able to be arbitrated Some disputes can be arbitrated some cannot Our preferred approach would be to use arbitration for all claims or disputes Then assuming that a permissible dispute is being arbitrated the WSPP has a complicated mandatory informal and then formal dispute resolution procedure which requires the constant involvement of the WSPP Chair and the Chairs prechosen list of mediators We think it would be better to have each party select an arbitrator and then have these two arbitrators select a third independent arbitrator with at least years experience in the electricity markets We also think it would be fairer for the dispute to be settled using the arbitration methods set forth by the American Arbitration Association Payment Netting and Closeout NettingSetoff A good master trading agreement should clearly address both payment netting and close out netting and setoff in separate explicit paragraphs of the agreement They are separate topics The EEI does this Section deals with payment netting and Sections and deal with settlement netting and closeout setoffs These unambiguous paragraphs provide very explicit terms under which these important concepts are addressed and thus provide a valuable credit management tool on which the parties can rely The WSPP Agreement on the other hand fails to clearly distinguish between payment netting and closeout nettingsetoff Section seems to be dealing with payment netting and the reference to set off is incomplete and ambiguous as to whether or not it applies to closeout setoff Furthermore Section provides that a party that elects to use payment netting must post this information on the WSPP homepage once the WSPP Homepage possesses the necessary capability What can be posted can be unposted This whole system of confirming netting seems unnecessarily complicated Invoicing Section of the WSPP allows a party to send an invoice within two years from the date on which the invoice should have been delivered In contrast Section of the EEI has no such time frame and the parties are encouraged to send out invoices as soon as possible after the end of each month Contested Amounts Section of the EEI provides that in the event of a dispute the owing party pays only the uncontested amount and then tries to resolve the discrepancy On the other hand Section of the WSPP requires the contesting party to pay the entire disputed amount upfront and then try to resolve the discrepancy Breadth of Agreement The EEI is a nationwide document drafted recently by participants from all parts of the country during the most recent phase of wholesale deregulation when a number of typically difficult legal issues had already been painfully experienced by companies It includes definitions for East power products as well as West power products including products transacted for a California Delivery Point as well as any other Delivery Point in the WSCC The WSPP Agreement on the other hand began in the west during the regulated era and still contains many vestiges of its origins that are no longer necessary and therefore it cannot yet claim the same national scope as the EEI For example it still contemplates the regional notion of Membership in the Western System Power Pool What does this mean Why is this kind of membership necessary What legal value does it have Why should a power trading master agreement need to have sections such as sections dealing with Organization and Administration of various committees No other master agreement dealing with any other commodity including the ISDA agreement contains these notions of membership and committee structures and duties in their texts

on PM Dunn Suanne PM To cc Subject RE ISDA Master between ECT Investments and DLJIC Hi Shari Im sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you I had to get a few people involved and it took a lot longer than I anticipated However I have things organized now and have summarized my comments below In addition we reviewed your form of guarantee I have attached a mark up of your guarantee to conform with our form of guarantee and where possible amended our form of guarantee to conform with yours I believe there were some conversations between my trader and your credit officer about increasing the amount under your guarantee to I think it would be helpful if we used my comments below and the blackline of the guarantees as an agenda for a call to finalize the Agreement Please let me know when you would be available I look forward to hearing from you Best regards Suanne Part b Threshold Amount I know we agreed in concept to have the Threshold Amount apply collectively to each party and their Credit Support Provider but Im not sure we get there with your amendment May I suggest the following Threshold Amount means with respect to Party A and its Credit Support Provider collectively US and with respect to Party B and its Credit Support Provider collectively US Part g Credit Event Upon Merger Thank you for adding the last sentence however may I suggest clarifying it further as follows If such additional Eligible Credit Support is not provided or if additional Eligible Credit Support is deemed inadequate by Y in its sole discretion then the provisions of Section biv shall apply without amendment Part b Payee Representations I am still waiting for a response from my tax department Part a Agreement to Deliver Documents a The W ECI is not in effect until next year so we will only be able to deliver a W In addition we believe the delivery requirements are a little onerous and we would prefer to deliver the forms upon execution and thereafter upon request ECTs delivery requirements should be substantially similar c We will provide you with a copy of DLJICs Memorandum of Association We would also like to receive similar documentation from ECT evidencing its authority to execute the Agreement Part c Calculation Agent Below please find sample language Calculation Agent The Calculation Agent will be Party A and Party B jointly or in the event of a dispute a reputable unaffiliated financial institution appointed by the parties Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or Termination Event with respect to a party the Nondefaulting Party or the nonAffected Party as the case may be or in the circumstances where there are two Affected Parties as agreed between the parties shall be the sole Calculation Agent Part i Jurisdiction We can agree to this clause provided that you agree to conduct proceedings in New York City Part g Setoff We can agree to your setoff clause with the following amendments in line insert sole prior to nonAffected Party in line and please insert whether at such time or in the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency following amounts owed in each line Part r Consent to Recording Please add the following clause as requested c Consent to Recording The parties agree that each may electronically record all telephone conversations between them and that any such recordings may be submitted in evidence to any court or in any proceeding for the purpose of establishing any matters pertinent to any Transaction provided however that notwithstanding the terms of this clause the parties do not waive any rights they may have under the applicable rules of evidence CSA bii Eligible Collateral I believe we discussed adding Treasuries with maturities greater than one year We propose Treasuries under one year with a Valuation Percentage of years at and years at CSA bivB Thresholds Please remove Potential Event of Default CSA d Conditions Precedent We asked that Tax Event and Tax Event Upon Merger be excluded as Specified Conditions There is no reason to stop collateralizing a Transaction upon the occurrence of these events because if at the end of the remedy period the Transaction is terminated then the posted collateral will be returned if applicable according to the normal procedures of the CSA If the Transaction is terminated and the settlement amount is not paid then the nonAffected Party has the right to liquidate the Collateral to satisfy its claim and you would want all Transactions including the affected transaction to be fully collateralized at that time CSA f Dispute Resolution i We can agree to two Local Business Days to resolve a dispute ii We suggested that the parties look to market standard screens before polling dealers to determine Value This is our standard definition of Value Value For the purpose of Paragraph iC and ii the Value of Posted Collateral other than Cash will be equal to the sum of i the face value of the Posted Collateral multiplied by the product of A either x the closing bid price as quoted by Bloomberg Financial Markets or Dow Jones Telerate Services as of Resolution Time or y the sum of the arithmetic mean of the closing bid prices quoted by three mutuallyagreed upon Reference MarketMakers for the relevant security on the relevant date and B the applicable Valuation Percentage plus ii the accrued interest on such security except to the extent Transferred to a party pursuant to any applicable provisions of this Agreement or included in the applicable price referred to in i of this clause as of such date iii We can agree to transfer only the undisputed amount CSA g Holding and Using Posted Collateral I have several thoughts on this section The Credit Rating for a party should include both SP and Moodys and a partys ability to hold Posted Collateral should be based on the lower of those two However if the Posted Collateral is a letter of credit then a party should be entitled to hold the letter of credit regardless of their Credit Rating Under the terms of gi the party and its Custodian are individually entitled to hold Posted Collateral However there are no requirements for a Custodian I believe the requirement of a Qualified Institution should apply to the Custodian If there is a ratings requirement for the party in order for it to hold Posted Collateral and the party is no longer in compliance with that ratings requirement then in order to comply with the general terms of the CSA the party would have to transfer the Posted Collateral to a Custodian which met the requirements of a Custodian or else it would be in breach of the agreement which would be an Event of Default if not remedied within days Therefore if you apply the requirements of a Qualified Institution to a Custodian under gi then gii and can be removed Finally we would like the requirements of the Custodian to be a rating of at least AA and having total assets of at least US CSA hiii Alternative to Interest Amount Subparagraph A should not apply In the event that the downgraded party is the Secured Party and they were at the time of downgrade holding Posted Collateral and Posted Collateral is moved to a Custodian there is no reason why the Pledgor who was not downgraded should be penalized by not receiving interest payments in the form of cash when they are paid on the Posted Collateral As a matter of fact it is my understanding that it is more difficult operationally to reinvest such funds and much easier to pay them to the Pledgor CSA m Other Provisions The definition of Federal Funds Effective Rate is not necessary Please amend the definition of Letter of Credit to reflect the requirements of the issuing bank to include a rating of AA and having total assets of at least US The definition of Material Adverse Change should be amended to reflect the rating of both Moodys and SP Exhibit A Letter of Credit Provisions b Please delete the parenthetical in line to and conform i to the amended definition of Letter of Credit with respect to the requirements of the issuing bank dii Y should be entitled to draw under the LC in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph of the CSA and not only upon the occurrence of an Event of Default The first sentence of this section should be amended accordingly e Please clarify the intent of this section It is rather confusing as written Schedule I The statement to be presented to the issuing bank should conform to the circumstances under Paragraph of the CSA under which the Secured Party can demand payment and not just be limited to an Event of Default Enron Gty to DLJdoc Enron MultipleDOC Original Message From SMTP Sent Friday April PM To ljcom Subject ISDA Master between ECT Investments and DLJIC Hi Suanne I am pleased to attach the revised ISDA Schedule and CSA which contains most of the revisions DLJ requested I would also like to let you know about the following Payee Tax Representation I sent DLJs suggested clause to my Tax Dept and they said that feel such language is insufficient to permit us to not have to withhold with respect to interest and dividend payments each of which could arise during the course of our trading relationship My colleague in the Tax Dept said he would prefer that DLJ certify that it is a foreign taxpayer entitled to receive payments under the document without reduction for withholding or other taxes He said that DLJ would not be able to certify to this if the form of the document is the usual very broad form whereby it permits transactions of every type both on and off market swaps off market swaps being swaps involving a lending aspect and thus the underlying document might have to be curtailed Documents to be Delivered For the time being I have made a reference in Part to Corporate Documents to be given by DLJ Please let me know what these will be Calculation Agent I still need to get the language from you that makes the both parties the CA SetOff As you requested I had a look at amending our clause to more closely reflect the ISDA SetOff Clause but with the inclusion of the NonDefaulting Partys Affiliates Upon review the clause in the document is very similar to the ISDA clause except for the st two sentences which bring in the NonDefaulting Partys Affiliates which we have agreed to have The only other sentence in the clause that differs from the ISDA is the one which talks about conversion of the Early Termination Amounts Our language goes ahead and makes it clear that all amounts need to to be converted to the Termination Currency I think that is helpful Thus I would propose to leave the SetOff clause unamended Securities Reps We have been able to incorporate these with just a very few minor changes Resolution Time CSA I have discussed this with my Credit Officer and he thinks we really do need to have at least Business Days to resolve a dispute Transfer of Collateral all or just undisputed amount Unfortunately my Credit Officer was unable to agree to transferring the whole amount requested if part of the amount is in dispute Holding Using Posted Collateral I have reviewed this and the language we have proposed goes a lot further than what is in the printed CSA For instance there is objective criteria contained in our language which is helpful to the Pledgor since it sets out that a party must have a certain credit rating to hold collateral Also it sets out where collateral may be held I would be happy to go through our suggested clause g and explain our reasons for asking to leave our proposed language in the CSA Schedule The only other documents left to resolve are the Guarantees I look forward to receiving your

thought you would be the one working on this and gave her your telephone number Thanks Shari Forwarded by Shari StackHOUECT on PM Shari Stack PM To Susan CT Susan CT cc Subject RE ISDA Master between ECT Investments and DLJIC This response just came in on an ISDA I had worked on several months ago I dont have the time to keep this so I am passing it on Thanks Shari Forwarded by Shari StackHOUECT on PM Dunn Suanne PM To cc Subject RE ISDA Master between ECT Investments and DLJIC Hi Shari Im sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you I had to get a few people involved and it took a lot longer than I anticipated However I have things organized now and have summarized my comments below In addition we reviewed your form of guarantee I have attached a mark up of your guarantee to conform with our form of guarantee and where possible amended our form of guarantee to conform with yours I believe there were some conversations between my trader and your credit officer about increasing the amount under your guarantee to I think it would be helpful if we used my comments below and the blackline of the guarantees as an agenda for a call to finalize the Agreement Please let me know when you would be available I look forward to hearing from you Best regards Suanne Part b Threshold Amount I know we agreed in concept to have the Threshold Amount apply collectively to each party and their Credit Support Provider but Im not sure we get there with your amendment May I suggest the following Threshold Amount means with respect to Party A and its Credit Support Provider collectively US and with respect to Party B and its Credit Support Provider collectively US Part g Credit Event Upon Merger Thank you for adding the last sentence however may I suggest clarifying it further as follows If such additional Eligible Credit Support is not provided or if additional Eligible Credit Support is deemed inadequate by Y in its sole discretion then the provisions of Section biv shall apply without amendment Part b Payee Representations I am still waiting for a response from my tax department Part a Agreement to Deliver Documents a The W ECI is not in effect until next year so we will only be able to deliver a W In addition we believe the delivery requirements are a little onerous and we would prefer to deliver the forms upon execution and thereafter upon request ECTs delivery requirements should be substantially similar c We will provide you with a copy of DLJICs Memorandum of Association We would also like to receive similar documentation from ECT evidencing its authority to execute the Agreement Part c Calculation Agent Below please find sample language Calculation Agent The Calculation Agent will be Party A and Party B jointly or in the event of a dispute a reputable unaffiliated financial institution appointed by the parties Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or Termination Event with respect to a party the Nondefaulting Party or the nonAffected Party as the case may be or in the circumstances where there are two Affected Parties as agreed between the parties shall be the sole Calculation Agent Part i Jurisdiction We can agree to this clause provided that you agree to conduct proceedings in New York City Part g Setoff We can agree to your setoff clause with the following amendments in line insert sole prior to nonAffected Party in line and please insert whether at such time or in the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency following amounts owed in each line Part r Consent to Recording Please add the following clause as requested c Consent to Recording The parties agree that each may electronically record all telephone conversations between them and that any such recordings may be submitted in evidence to any court or in any proceeding for the purpose of establishing any matters pertinent to any Transaction provided however that notwithstanding the terms of this clause the parties do not waive any rights they may have under the applicable rules of evidence CSA bii Eligible Collateral I believe we discussed adding Treasuries with maturities greater than one year We propose Treasuries under one year with a Valuation Percentage of years at and years at CSA bivB Thresholds Please remove Potential Event of Default CSA d Conditions Precedent We asked that Tax Event and Tax Event Upon Merger be excluded as Specified Conditions There is no reason to stop collateralizing a Transaction upon the occurrence of these events because if at the end of the remedy period the Transaction is terminated then the posted collateral will be returned if applicable according to the normal procedures of the CSA If the Transaction is terminated and the settlement amount is not paid then the nonAffected Party has the right to liquidate the Collateral to satisfy its claim and you would want all Transactions including the affected transaction to be fully collateralized at that time CSA f Dispute Resolution i We can agree to two Local Business Days to resolve a dispute ii We suggested that the parties look to market standard screens before polling dealers to determine Value This is our standard definition of Value Value For the purpose of Paragraph iC and ii the Value of Posted Collateral other than Cash will be equal to the sum of i the face value of the Posted Collateral multiplied by the product of A either x the closing bid price as quoted by Bloomberg Financial Markets or Dow Jones Telerate Services as of Resolution Time or y the sum of the arithmetic mean of the closing bid prices quoted by three mutuallyagreed upon Reference MarketMakers for the relevant security on the relevant date and B the applicable Valuation Percentage plus ii the accrued interest on such security except to the extent Transferred to a party pursuant to any applicable provisions of this Agreement or included in the applicable price referred to in i of this clause as of such date iii We can agree to transfer only the undisputed amount CSA g Holding and Using Posted Collateral I have several thoughts on this section The Credit Rating for a party should include both SP and Moodys and a partys ability to hold Posted Collateral should be based on the lower of those two However if the Posted Collateral is a letter of credit then a party should be entitled to hold the letter of credit regardless of their Credit Rating Under the terms of gi the party and its Custodian are individually entitled to hold Posted Collateral However there are no requirements for a Custodian I believe the requirement of a Qualified Institution should apply to the Custodian If there is a ratings requirement for the party in order for it to hold Posted Collateral and the party is no longer in compliance with that ratings requirement then in order to comply with the general terms of the CSA the party would have to transfer the Posted Collateral to a Custodian which met the requirements of a Custodian or else it would be in breach of the agreement which would be an Event of Default if not remedied within days Therefore if you apply the requirements of a Qualified Institution to a Custodian under gi then gii and can be removed Finally we would like the requirements of the Custodian to be a rating of at least AA and having total assets of at least US CSA hiii Alternative to Interest Amount Subparagraph A should not apply In the event that the downgraded party is the Secured Party and they were at the time of downgrade holding Posted Collateral and Posted Collateral is moved to a Custodian there is no reason why the Pledgor who was not downgraded should be penalized by not receiving interest payments in the form of cash when they are paid on the Posted Collateral As a matter of fact it is my understanding that it is more difficult operationally to reinvest such funds and much easier to pay them to the Pledgor CSA m Other Provisions The definition of Federal Funds Effective Rate is not necessary Please amend the definition of Letter of Credit to reflect the requirements of the issuing bank to include a rating of AA and having total assets of at least US The definition of Material Adverse Change should be amended to reflect the rating of both Moodys and SP Exhibit A Letter of Credit Provisions b Please delete the parenthetical in line to and conform i to the amended definition of Letter of Credit with respect to the requirements of the issuing bank dii Y should be entitled to draw under the LC in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph of the CSA and not only upon the occurrence of an Event of Default The first sentence of this section should be amended accordingly e Please clarify the intent of this section It is rather confusing as written Schedule I The statement to be presented to the issuing bank should conform to the circumstances under

like to let you know about the following Payee Tax Representation I sent DLJs suggested clause to my Tax Dept and they said that feel such language is insufficient to permit us to not have to withhold with respect to interest and dividend payments each of which could arise during the course of our trading relationship My colleague in the Tax Dept said he would prefer that DLJ certify that it is a foreign taxpayer entitled to receive payments under the document without reduction for withholding or other taxes He said that DLJ would not be able to certify to this if the form of the document is the usual very broad form whereby it permits transactions of every type both on and off market swaps off market swaps being swaps involving a lending aspect and thus the underlying document might have to be curtailed Documents to be Delivered For the time being I have made a reference in Part to Corporate Documents to be given by DLJ Please let me know what these will be Calculation Agent I still need to get the language from you that makes the both parties the CA SetOff As you requested I had a look at amending our clause to more closely reflect the ISDA SetOff Clause but with the inclusion of the NonDefaulting Partys Affiliates Upon review the clause in the document is very similar to the ISDA clause except for the st two sentences which bring in the NonDefaulting Partys Affiliates which we have agreed to have The only other sentence in the clause that differs from the ISDA is the one which talks about conversion of the Early Termination Amounts Our language goes ahead and makes it clear that all amounts need to to be converted to the Termination Currency I think that is helpful Thus I would propose to leave the SetOff clause unamended Securities Reps We have been able to incorporate these with just a very few minor changes Resolution Time CSA I have discussed this with my Credit Officer and he thinks we really do need to have at least Business Days to resolve a dispute Transfer of Collateral all or just undisputed amount Unfortunately my Credit Officer was unable to agree to transferring the whole amount requested if part of the amount is in dispute Holding Using Posted Collateral I have reviewed this and the language we have proposed goes a lot further than what is in the printed CSA For instance there is objective criteria contained in our language which is helpful to the Pledgor since it sets out that a party must have a certain credit rating to hold collateral Also it sets out where collateral may be held I would be happy to go through our suggested clause g and explain our reasons for asking to leave our proposed language in the CSA Schedule The only other documents left to resolve are the Guarantees I look forward to receiving your comments on ours I believe we agreed to agree on a format and use it for both Guarantees Kind regards Shari See attached file actrdoc File actrdoc Enron Gty to DLJdoc Enron MultipleDOC
