<22387412.1075845596988.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,barton.clark@enron.com,2000-09-12 03:07:00,RE Presentation Forwarded by Barton ClarkHOUECT on AM Silvers Bruce C AM To Barton Clark Heather Kroll cc Pasqualini Martin J Politan Nicholas H Subject RE Presentation Given the time constraint I thought Id give you a brief summary of the law here in Connecticut and some thoughts on how to proceed The Connecticut courts and the Freedom of Information Commission the FOIC the agency charged with the enforcement of FOIA have repeatedly held that CRRA CDA and DECD are public agencies within the purview of FOIA I have not had time to consider whether the same is true for DEP CPUC and the other attendees but suspect that it is so with respect to certain of them FOIA provides among other things that all documents obtained or kept by a public agency are public records available to the public unless otherwise exempted from disclosure by special statute or by the exemptions delineated by FOIA While there is no special statute with regard to CRRA a special statute Conn Gen Stat Section ak exempts certain materials and information submitted to DECD and to CDA from public disclosure Section ak states that all information contained in any application for financial assistance submitted to DECD or CDA and all information obtained by the DECD or CDA with respect to any person or project is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA The statute specifies that this exemption includes all financial credit and proprietary information I have not had time to consider whether there are special statutory exemptions provided for similar information submitted to the other attendees Consequently FOIA governs the confidentiality of all information submitted to CRRA and perhaps certain of the other attendees and the confidentiality of information submitted to DECD and CDA falling outside Section aks exemption As may be pertinent in these circumstances FOIA exempts from disclosure preliminary drafts under certain circumstances trade secrets and commercial or financial information given in confidence and that is not required by statute to be disclosed to an agency real estate appraisals engineering or feasiblity estimates or evaluations for an agency relative to the acquisition of property or to prospective public supply and construction contracts but only until such time as the property is acquired or the transaction abandoned tax returns reports and statements exempted by federal law or state statutes and communications privileged by the attorneyclient relationship While the Connecticut courts and FOIC have held that the confidentiality of information submitted to agencies subject to FOIA is determined by applicable law rather that the representations or agreements of the parties they have suggested that measures designed to preserve confidentiality may be considered in making that determination While your notice cites a May Agreement of Confidentiality previously executed by CRRA and Enron which I have not seen obviously that will not be binding upon any attendees not a party to it and while it would be better to have the other attendees execute a written agreement regarding confidentiality I understand that that may not be practical given the timing and the number of parties involved Accordingly I recommend that the following other steps be employed with respect to confidential information submitted to the attendees All documents and information submitted to the attendees should be marked Preliminary Draft In the fourth paragraph of your notice change clause to read the Subject Information is being provided to it in confidence contains trade secrets andor confidential commercial financial and proprietary information and other information exempt from disclosure under certain laws of the State of Connecticut and it will maintain the confidentiality of the Subject Information You should take steps internally to ensure the confidentiality of the information you submit to the agencies Appropriate measures would include a limiting access to confidential information to a need to know basis b entering into confidentiality agreements with others involved in the project with respect to their studies analyses etc for the project c advising your personnel secretarial etc in writing that the information is confidential and of the need to maintain such information in confidence and d maintaining confidential information in locked or otherwise private files A request should be made by you to the agencies that confidential information be discussed by the agencies in executive session If we take these measures with regard to information supplied to the agencies we will enhance the likelihood of maintaining the confidentiality of the information in response to a public request for disclosure of the information pursuant to the FOIA Should you wish to discuss this matter in more detail please do not hesitate to call me at Original Message From Barton Clark mailto Sent Monday August PM To Heather Kroll Cc Subject Presentation I suggest adding the attached in as the first page of text in the presentation materials and call the attendees attention to it at the commencement of the presentation If there is a problem with its length I would suggest deleting the laundry list of attendees in the first paragraph and the third paragraph only Also I did not have time to check with Conn counsel on the procedures for public disclosure in Conn alluded to generally in the fourth paragraph but by copy hereof am requesting they review the language of the Notice and give us any comments When do the materials have to be distributed See attached file Notice to Recipients of

Pasqualini Martin J Politan Nicholas H Subject RE Presentation Given the time constraint I thought Id give you a brief summary of the law here in Connecticut and some thoughts on how to proceed The Connecticut courts and the Freedom of Information Commission the FOIC the agency charged with the enforcement of FOIA have repeatedly held that CRRA CDA and DECD are public agencies within the purview of FOIA I have not had time to consider whether the same is true for DEP CPUC and the other attendees but suspect that it is so with respect to certain of them FOIA provides among other things that all documents obtained or kept by a public agency are public records available to the public unless otherwise exempted from disclosure by special statute or by the exemptions delineated by FOIA While there is no special statute with regard to CRRA a special statute Conn Gen Stat Section ak exempts certain materials and information submitted to DECD and to CDA from public disclosure Section ak states that all information contained in any application for financial assistance submitted to DECD or CDA and all information obtained by the DECD or CDA with respect to any person or project is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA The statute specifies that this exemption includes all financial credit and proprietary information I have not had time to consider whether there are special statutory exemptions provided for similar information submitted to the other attendees Consequently FOIA governs the confidentiality of all information submitted to CRRA and perhaps certain of the other attendees and the confidentiality of information submitted to DECD and CDA falling outside Section aks exemption As may be pertinent in these circumstances FOIA exempts from disclosure preliminary drafts under certain circumstances trade secrets and commercial or financial information given in confidence and that is not required by statute to be disclosed to an agency real estate appraisals engineering or feasiblity estimates or evaluations for an agency relative to the acquisition of property or to prospective public supply and construction contracts but only until such time as the property is acquired or the transaction abandoned tax returns reports and statements exempted by federal law or state statutes and communications privileged by the attorneyclient relationship While the Connecticut courts and FOIC have held that the confidentiality of information submitted to agencies subject to FOIA is determined by applicable law rather that the representations or agreements of the parties they have suggested that measures designed to preserve confidentiality may be considered in making that determination While your notice cites a May Agreement of Confidentiality previously executed by CRRA and Enron which I have not seen obviously that will not be binding upon any attendees not a party to it and while it would be better to have the other attendees execute a written agreement regarding confidentiality I understand that that may not be practical given the timing and the number of parties involved Accordingly I recommend that the following other steps be employed with respect to confidential information submitted to the attendees All documents and information submitted to the attendees should be marked Preliminary Draft In the fourth paragraph of your notice change clause to read the Subject Information is being provided to it in confidence contains trade secrets andor confidential commercial financial and proprietary information and other information exempt from disclosure under certain laws of the State of Connecticut and it will maintain the confidentiality of the Subject Information You should take steps

entering into confidentiality agreements with others involved in the project with respect to their studies analyses etc for the project c advising your personnel secretarial etc in writing that the information is confidential and of the need to maintain such information in confidence and d maintaining confidential information in locked or otherwise private files A request should be made by you to the agencies that confidential information be discussed by the agencies in executive session If we take these measures with regard to information supplied to the agencies we will enhance the

proposed agreements in the top half of the matrix also have been blessed as have the Secondary Agreements Forwarded by Barton ClarkHOUECT on PM Barton Clark PM To cc Subject Stone and WebsterBlack VeatchOther Development Agreements FYI attached are the forms of design and engineering contracts for the FtPierce project The Technical Design Services Agreement will be cloned one for the Facility improvements and one for the King Plant improvements and the Black Veatch agreement relates to design of the transmission upgrades The two Technical Design Services Agreements with Stone and Webster will be amended and restated to be full blown Turbo Park compliant EPC contracts covering procurement and construction as well as design with Stone and Webster assuming its estimate and delivery date are acceptable at the time the project goes into Turbo Park The Black Veatch agreement will not be bifurcated as Black Veatch will not be the EPC contractor but we will expect the EPC contractor for the transmission improvements to warrant the work One issue we have is how to get Black Veatch to give a Turbo Park compliant transmission improvements design warranty but we may be able to get the EPC contractor to warrant the design and the improvements Turbo Park did not raise this issue but it may in the future so we need to be thinking about that The Black Veatch agreement also may be assigned to FPUA along with the transmission upgrades EPC contract as FPUA will own the transmission improvements and supervise their construction The reason for bifurcating the agreements is to allow work on soft cost items to proceed now as required to keep the project on schedule until we can close the deal with FPUAFMPA and get into Turbo Park where the hard cost procurement and construction expenditures can be made without putting the project on balance sheet Ill forward the form Turbo Park EPC Contract under separate cover Sorry about the late deliveries but maybe you will be able to pick these up in the am Forwarded by Barton ClarkHOUECT on PM Barton Clark PM To David CT Mathew CT Bruce GoldenENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Darrell nron George CT cc Lisa nronXGate Catherine nronXGate Roseann NRON Herman NRON Subject Stone and WebsterBlack VeatchOther Development Agreements Attached are Turbo Park and accounting approved forms of the Technical Design Services Agreement between FPRP and Stone Webster TDSA and the Agreement for Professional Engineering Services between FPRP and Black Veatch BV Agreement Each form has to now be fashioned to reflect the business dealpayment termsetc Note that the Scope of Work on the TDSA underwent substantial modification to conform with requirements and the attached draft Scope of Work only deals with the Facility as defined in the TDSA and not the improvements which term was included in the draft Tasking Letter from which the Scope of Work was fashionedI assume we will need to clone this TDSA except for a different Scope of Work description to deal with such improvements other than the Facility ie I assume these are the King Plant improvements The TDSA is calculated to put as much of the Turbo Parkapproved EPC in front of Stone Webster at the earliest possible date so that the amendment and restatement of the TDSA to make it a full blown Turbo Park EPC Contract will be more straightforward Right now it is contemplated FPRP would assign its interests as Construction Manager under the TDSA to ENA and the TDSA would be concurrently amended and restated as set forth above both at the time the FPRP goes into Phase II of Turbo Park At the time FPRP goes into Phase I of Turbo Park I believe the TDSA can remain an FPRP obligation like any other development agreement signed by a project entity that is subsequently transferred into Turbo Park Since the TDSA now only involves soft cost expenditures FPRP can sign it as soon as it is negotiated and agreed by Stone Webster and before it goes into Phase I of Turbo Park The B V Agreement which was modeled on Black Veatchs agreement with FPUA also can be signed prior to going into Phase I as soon as it is negotiated with Black Veatch Like the TDSA there are commercial terms that need to be added It was modeled on the FPUA Black Veatch Agreement because that should speed negotiation with B V on its terms and we may want to assign the B V Agreement to FPUA and they too would be comfortable with its terms My understanding is that FPUA is supervising the transmission work and will be driving the design and engineering of the transmission facilities so it may make sense for FPRP to assign the B V Agreement to FPUA and simply retain the obligation to pay B V up to a cap I also have attached a revised version of the spreadsheet Mathew prepared listing FPRP contracts already entered into by FPRP the socalled secondary development agreements and those proposed to be entered into before we go into Phase I of Turbo Park Herman and Lisa let me know which of the secondary agreements you have not previously reviewed those marked NO re your review that you need to review and I will endeavor to furnish them to you Let me know if you have any questions

<6724747.1075844332151.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,barton.clark@enron.com,1999-12-07 23:45:00,Privileged and Confidential Catalyticafinished marking up the drafts and thought perhaps a few thoughts would give you some insight into the reasons for my revisions Unfortunately I was engaged in discussions about the course to pursue in light of Arthur Andersons comments until almost pm when I lost my typing help so not much headway was made in inputting the changes last night My secretary is supposed to be in early it is now nearly and she still isnt in and I will enlist whatever other help I can get to turn these documents around For those not involved in the discussions last night Roger advised us that Arthur Anderson had changes to the Xonon Technology Implementation Agreement designed to make clear ENA had no primary or secondary obligations under the XTIA The principal change suggested by AA the deletion of the last sentence of the BOLD language in Section removed the obligation for ENA to pick up any obligations under the agreement owed by West LB in excess of the Cap Note that this same change applies in the Agreement in Principle related to the purchase of turbines XTIA Revision G AAs change did not appear to address comprehensively the principle AA espoused ie clarifying ENA had no primary or secondary obligations under the agreements After much discussion and some consideration I decided to prepare alternative markups of the XTIA one that attempts to meet the AA directive while preserving a level of comfort for GE I attempted this by increasing the limit on West LBs liability in Article to million from million so that GEs recourse against West LB is the same as it had against West LB and ENA in the prior drafts and by obligating West LB in the default provisions to pony up for an ENA default I also extensively modified the Section language taken verbatim from the LM deal to eliminate the limited recourse provisions favoring West LB and in doing so made it easier to conclude that references to ENA in the agreement are references to ENA acting in an agency and not its individual capacity This notion is still pretty vague in the revision because I did not want to create too much discomfort in GE since ENA explicitly acting in an agency capacity would mean there was no recourse against it since ultimate recourse would lie with the principal West LB Roger suggested I delete the limit on ENAs liability in Article to remove the implication it had any which I did and which means we have no upside protection if we are construed to have obligations under the XTIA The upshot is that in my opinion the g revision goes as far as possible toward placating AA while still retaining a possibility of selling it to GE The sheer number of changes required by the substance of AAs comment however is bound to be disconcerting to GE at this stage of negotiations particularly when GEs expectation was for a markup incorporating the new business terms agreed yesterday afternoon calling for payment of the Development Funds to be completed by September with the possibility of a refund of a portion of the Development Fund Payment if the December Milestone is not timely completed and some clean upsclarifications Note that in both revision g and ga Section now provides that the Xonon credit created is only exercisable by CCSI on and after December so that the credit amount can reflect the deduction of any Milestone refund amount paid by GE if it does not complete that Milestone on time I think the dollar value of the credit should be adjusted downward if a portion of the Development Funds paid on September are in fact refunded in December We need to make sure to make provision in the Acquisition and Development Agreement that any Milestone refund received by West LB is paid over to ENA since West LB will have been repaid its advances on September XTIA Revision GA This alternate revision to the XTIA takes a minimalist approach and incorporates only the new business terms some minor clean upclarifications and the AA change to Section and the change to Article to remove a cap for ENAs laibility suggested by Roger It seems to me it does not address meaningfully the AA admonition that ENA may not have primary or secondary liability under the XTIA if it wants to stay outside of the rigors of FAS However it has the singular advantage of looking a lot like what GE and West LB expect to see in the revision Option Repurchase Agreement This revision was complicated by the possible refund of the a portion of the Development Funds by GE if it failed to complete Milestone by December an attempt to retain some accountability for GEs performance given that it is being paid for that Milestone on September to satisfy CCSI Because the option repurchase must occur on or before September it isnt clear what will happen December so its hard to figure out what to pay if the contract is not cancelled by September or what the credits are worth on that date Since CCSI is the direct recipient of the credits under the XTIA I first thought ENA could hang onto million the amount formerly allocated to Milestone before its payment obligation was collapsed into Milestone by deducting the refund from the amount payable to CCSI on the option repurchase date and leaving CCSI to bear the risk of GEs repayment of any refund in order to make CCSI whole If GE did meet the Milestone on time and so did not pay the refund amount directly to CCSI I thought ENA could always make CCSI whole by paying the million in December when the refund matter was decided That approach subtracting the refund amount from the September payment to CCSI was decidedly unsatisfactory since the option repurchase formula could result depending on the Milestones paid on the option repurchase date in a negative payment to CCSI for the option What I settled on in this draft was to go ahead and pay CCSI the amount of the premiums it has paid to September plus if the turbine contract has not been cancelled on September This would include repayment to CCSI on September of premiums paid by CCSI under the spark spread on September Assuming CCSI made all its premium payments and West LB made all of its Development Fund advances ENA would have received million from CCSI by September paid out million plus interest to West LB by September and purchased the spark spread from CCSI for million If the turbine contract is not cancelled but GE has to pay the refund I think the million ought to go to West LB or its designee ENA If we cancel the turbine contract and do not go forward with Pastoria the dollar amount of the credits vested in CCSI and exercisable after December are equal to the Development Funds advanced less the refund amount Since the document now reads that the refund amount goes back to West LB or its designee if GE pays the refund and CCSI is holding a Xonon credit of only millionit seems to me it will be necessary to pay the refund over to CCSI instead of ENA in order to make up for the fact that it paid in premium and only received in credit in September This quick liquidation of of the credit seems to be an ancillary benefit to CCSI occasioned by GEs refund We could provide in the agreements that GE makes this payment directly to CCSI or we can continue to have the right to receive the payment from GE under the XTIA and the obligation to pay it to CCSI under the Repurchase Agreement

add a reference to Article to make clear the survival of pending claims at provision in that Article was not in conflict with Section All other changes were pretty self evident clarifications or corrections of typographical errors Option Repurchase Agreement Remember that Annexes A and B to Exhibit A are in a separate document because of format and need to be inserted in behind Exhibit A and before Annex C Section of the Agreement was revised to clarify that the Paid Premium amount payable by ENA was such amount at the Option Repurchase Date to correct a date reference to the date the Milestone Refund Amount becomes payable by GE to clarify that the vested value of the Xonon Credits equal to the Paid Premium applies in the assignment of credits to ENA pursuant to Section and to clarify that ENA may withhold from the Milestone Refund Amount payable to CCSI any unpaid premium plus any other amounts owed by CCSI to ENA eg legal expenses incurred by ENA in seeking to collect Unpaid Premium Section was revised to add a new defined term Operative Agreements to refer to the Exhibits and Annexes to the Agreement and the notion of Operative Agreements was worked into Section to make it clear that ENA was released from its obligations under the Confirmantion and Guaranty if any since it is a party when released from the Agreement Section also makes clear that ENA cannot

supplemented to include some of the key concepts from the proposed confidentiality agreement including CCSIs requested modification that disclosure not be made to any person without consent unless the person had agreed to confidentiality restrictions as least as stringent as those in Section The changes to the Guaranty and Indemnification Agreement are intended to clarify that ENA is not required to make demand under the Guaranty before proceeding to collect under the letter of credit and to clarify that the condition to payment is CCSIs failure to pay upon a Joint Concurrence Similarly the drawing certificate conditions are limited to those in the Confirmation and the requirement that there be no Event of Default or possible event of default is deleted as adding unnecessary ambiguity to the draw procedures CCSI will have notice of any such event see Section h of the Option Repurchase Agreement and ENA will have no incentive to cause West LB to advance funds if GE is not performing However to the extent West LB may advance and ENA subsequently learn of a default it is my understanding CCSI would still have to advance if the Joint Concurrence were delivered to it This is consistent with the understanding that the Paid Premium will mirror in amount and be paid at least concurrently with the West LB advances under the Xonon Agreement The Confirmation is revised to incorporate the change you suggested although we need to discuss the cap on the LC since under the Confirmation CCSI is obligated to pay interest and expenses above the cap The Confirmation also eliminates references to a Master Agreement signed in the future to supplement the terms of the option could be disruptive to say the least and CCSIs right to object to the terms of the confirm

<13240326.1075844452726.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,barton.clark@enron.com,1999-12-07 23:45:00,Privileged and Confidential Catalyticafinished marking up the drafts and thought perhaps a few thoughts would give you some insight into the reasons for my revisions Unfortunately I was engaged in discussions about the course to pursue in light of Arthur Andersons comments until almost pm when I lost my typing help so not much headway was made in inputting the changes last night My secretary is supposed to be in early it is now nearly and she still isnt in and I will enlist whatever other help I can get to turn these documents around For those not involved in the discussions last night Roger advised us that Arthur Anderson had changes to the Xonon Technology Implementation Agreement designed to make clear ENA had no primary or secondary obligations under the XTIA The principal change suggested by AA the deletion of the last sentence of the BOLD language in Section removed the obligation for ENA to pick up any obligations under the agreement owed by West LB in excess of the Cap Note that this same change applies in the Agreement in Principle related to the purchase of turbines XTIA Revision G AAs change did not appear to address comprehensively the principle AA espoused ie clarifying ENA had no primary or secondary obligations under the agreements After much discussion and some consideration I decided to prepare alternative markups of the XTIA one that attempts to meet the AA directive while preserving a level of comfort for GE I attempted this by increasing the limit on West LBs liability in Article to million from million so that GEs recourse against West LB is the same as it had against West LB and ENA in the prior drafts and by obligating West LB in the default provisions to pony up for an ENA default I also extensively modified the Section language taken verbatim from the LM deal to eliminate the limited recourse provisions favoring West LB and in doing so made it easier to conclude that references to ENA in the agreement are references to ENA acting in an agency and not its individual capacity This notion is still pretty vague in the revision because I did not want to create too much discomfort in GE since ENA explicitly acting in an agency capacity would mean there was no recourse against it since ultimate recourse would lie with the principal West LB Roger suggested I delete the limit on ENAs liability in Article to remove the implication it had any which I did and which means we have no upside protection if we are construed to have obligations under the XTIA The upshot is that in my opinion the g revision goes as far as possible toward placating AA while still retaining a possibility of selling it to GE The sheer number of changes required by the substance of AAs comment however is bound to be disconcerting to GE at this stage of negotiations particularly when GEs expectation was for a markup incorporating the new business terms agreed yesterday afternoon calling for payment of the Development Funds to be completed by September with the possibility of a refund of a portion of the Development Fund Payment if the December Milestone is not timely completed and some clean upsclarifications Note that in both revision g and ga Section now provides that the Xonon credit created is only exercisable by CCSI on and after December so that the credit amount can reflect the deduction of any Milestone refund amount paid by GE if it does not complete that Milestone on time I think the dollar value of the credit should be adjusted downward if a portion of the Development Funds paid on September are in fact refunded in December We need to make sure to make provision in the Acquisition and Development Agreement that any Milestone refund received by West LB is paid over to ENA since West LB will have been repaid its advances on September XTIA Revision GA This alternate revision to the XTIA takes a minimalist approach and incorporates only the new business terms some minor clean upclarifications and the AA change to Section and the change to Article to remove a cap for ENAs laibility suggested by Roger It seems to me it does not address meaningfully the AA admonition that ENA may not have primary or secondary liability under the XTIA if it wants to stay outside of the rigors of FAS However it has the singular advantage of looking a lot like what GE and West LB expect to see in the revision Option Repurchase Agreement This revision was complicated by the possible refund of the a portion of the Development Funds by GE if it failed to complete Milestone by December an attempt to retain some accountability for GEs performance given that it is being paid for that Milestone on September to satisfy CCSI Because the option repurchase must occur on or before September it isnt clear what will happen December so its hard to figure out what to pay if the contract is not cancelled by September or what the credits are worth on that date Since CCSI is the direct recipient of the credits under the XTIA I first thought ENA could hang onto million the amount formerly allocated to Milestone before its payment obligation was collapsed into Milestone by deducting the refund from the amount payable to CCSI on the option repurchase date and leaving CCSI to bear the risk of GEs repayment of any refund in order to make CCSI whole If GE did meet the Milestone on time and so did not pay the refund amount directly to CCSI I thought ENA could always make CCSI whole by paying the million in December when the refund matter was decided That approach subtracting the refund amount from the September payment to CCSI was decidedly unsatisfactory since the option repurchase formula could result depending on the Milestones paid on the option repurchase date in a negative payment to CCSI for the option What I settled on in this draft was to go ahead and pay CCSI the amount of the premiums it has paid to September plus if the turbine contract has not been cancelled on September This would include repayment to CCSI on September of premiums paid by CCSI under the spark spread on September Assuming CCSI made all its premium payments and West LB made all of its Development Fund advances ENA would have received million from CCSI by September paid out million plus interest to West LB by September and purchased the spark spread from CCSI for million If the turbine contract is not cancelled but GE has to pay the refund I think the million ought to go to West LB or its designee ENA If we cancel the turbine contract and do not go forward with Pastoria the dollar amount of the credits vested in CCSI and exercisable after December are equal to the Development Funds advanced less the refund amount Since the document now reads that the refund amount goes back to West LB or its designee if GE pays the refund and CCSI is holding a Xonon credit of only millionit seems to me it will be necessary to pay the refund over to CCSI instead of ENA in order to make up for the fact that it paid in premium and only received in credit in September This quick liquidation of of the credit seems to be an ancillary benefit to CCSI occasioned by GEs refund We could provide in the agreements that GE makes this payment directly to CCSI or we can continue to have the right to receive the payment from GE under the XTIA and the obligation to pay it to CCSI under the Repurchase Agreement
