around Feb Basis of ProRationCurrent Windows Calculation Currently Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system Gas Select prorates interstates receipt capacity based on prior days nominations New Calculation Changes and Display Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast They use Weather Bank as one of their tools OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well Lots of complaints People were complaining that it restricted access to the system Eliminating point specific calculation Open system to Max Oper Limits or Contractual Limits Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug procedures No changes to Wheeler Ridge Due to the need to maintain operational control an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle Replace windows with operational maximum volumes If CPUC approves comprehensive settlement will post days of information to anticipate OFOs Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows Scheduling ChangesNov Gas Select is

regulatory change to make free OFOs are going to be system wide and not customer specific OFOs can be declared intraday Once OFO declared it will be kept for entire day Concerned that if call off will have to put back on Dont want to go back and forth This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works Many times Socal see an increase of mmcfday between Cycle and so they are concerned Scheduled vs CapacityDeclare OFO Nominations may not exceed of expected usage Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week Can revise expected usage No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO Use Elapsed ProRata Rules Expected Usagecut nominations to of expected usage so will use same day of the prior week as proxy Generators need to revise expected usage Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal Flow Day Diversions dont go into effect until after Cycle Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed If call OFO after cycle or and have interruptible storage injections such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised If OFO called Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows Cycle Nom cut Cycle Nom cut Cylce Nom cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle if OFO callled after cycle and no improvement is realized Will allocate prorata Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point In other words if OFO declared during Cycle and no relief after cycles Socal will window Cycle and prorata cut Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles For penalty purposes actual burn from oclock to oclock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered For OFO assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week Declare OFO on prior days scheduled volume For an evening declarationwill use most recent

for maintenance SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast They use Weather Bank as one of their tools OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well Lots of complaints People were complaining that it restricted access to the system Eliminating point specific calculation Open system to Max Oper Limits or Contractual Limits Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug procedures No changes to Wheeler Ridge Due to the need to maintain operational control an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle Replace windows with operational maximum volumes If CPUC

Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal Flow Day Diversions dont go into effect until after Cycle Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed If call OFO after cycle or and have interruptible storage injections such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised If OFO called Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows Cycle Nom cut Cycle Nom cut Cylce Nom cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle if OFO callled after

Socal will window Cycle and prorata cut Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles For penalty purposes actual burn from oclock to oclock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ
