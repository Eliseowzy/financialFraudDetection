the BPA transmission network I am trying to find sites to locate some mobile generators that Enron has available There are several Public Power utilities BPA customers in the Region that are interested in having these units located in their service areas My understanding is that BPA is requiring small generators to go through an interconnect process if they want to sell the power on the market But if the utility owns the generation or if the utilities industrial customer owns it and they are displacing BPA power then they dont have to go through this interconnection process That seems to me like selfdealing in that BPAs Power Business Line gets the benefit of this load that the Transmission Business Line is allowing to slip in but other marketers such as Enron has to play by different rules if we want to have access to this power I have a meeting Thursday with one of BPAs VPs in theTransmission Business Line to talk about this issue I will send you other email and correspondence I receive on this At some point Enron may want to take a stand on BPAs activity if they are not going to be cooperative with our efforts Jeff Forwarded by Jeff ShieldsPDXECT on AM Paschke Al TM on AM To cc Bennett Ruth TMDITT Peterson Edward A TOCDITT Subject FW Small scale generation JeffThanks for your email I have responded to your questions below My responses are in BOLDFACE Also please note that I am sending to you two relevant documents via separate email These documents are noted in my response to your first question below As I mentioned in the voice mail that I left with you this morning you may want to come in and talk to us concerning your plans Engineering staff would be available to discuss BPATBLs interconnection requirements Take care Al Paschke Original Message From mailto Sent Saturday March PM To Subject Small scale generation I realize you are not permitted to talk directly with each other about this subject but I find myself in the middle of this policy issue and need clarity on how to respond to requests I have received from customers in the past few weeks At issue is how to connect new small scale generation in order to get generation online as quickly as possible If we set aside local and state permit requirements for the sake of this conversation I would like to ask about the process for working with Public Power utilities or their enduse consumers that have expressed an interest in installing smallscale generation with the idea of selling the output to Enron I have access to several turbine technologies ranging in size from kW to as large as MW These units are available in the next weeks I have been contacted by various BPA utility customers or in two cases industrial customers served by Public Power utilities that would like to have Enron install these units at their facilities The basic idea is that Enron would install units and operate them and sell the output The host enduser andor host utility will be paid a fee in return for supporting this installation In some instances the host would own the generation asset and Enron would have a toll in other instances Enron may own the asset Questions that I have include What is the process for interconnection with BPAs transmission system SEE THE DRAFT DOCUMENT ENTITLED BPA TRANMSISSION BUSINESS LINE PROCESS FOR SMALL GENERATION INERCONNECTIONS WITH UTILITY SYSTEMS WITHIN THE BPA LOAD CONTROL AREA ALSO SEE THE DRAFT DOCUMENT ENTITLED BPA TRANSMISSION BUSINESS LINE PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS FOR SMALL GENERATION INTERCONNECTIONS LESS THAN MW I AM SENDING COPIES OF THESE DOCUMENTS TO YOU VIA SEPARATE EMAIL Is a traditional interconnection request necessary YES If the host utility effectively takes this energy to load and virtually consumers all of the power can Enron pay BPA a transmission few as though the power were delivered over the federal transmission system TO THE EXTENT THAT POWER IS TO MOVE OVER THE FEDERAL TRANSMISSION SYSTEM TRANSMISSION AND ANCILLARY SERVICES MUST BE ACQUIRED FROM BPATBL UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES CERTAIN ANCILLARY SERVICES CAN BE SELF OR THIRD PARTYPROVIDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PROJECT WOULD BE INTERCONNECTED WITH THE SYSTEM OF ONE OF BPAS REQUIREMENTS CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASES NT TRANSMISSION SERVICEAND THE POWER SERVES THAT CUSTOMERS LOAD REQUIREMENTS THE CUSTOMER IS OBLIGATED TO PURCHASE TRANSMISSION AND ANCILLARY SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LOAD REQUIREMENTS THE CUSTOMER IN BPAS CONTROL AREA WOULD HAVE TO ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH BPATBL FOR METERING ET AL Would this power have to be sold in the Northwest NO Is BPA interested in a yr toll on these smaller generation technologies IF YOU ARE ASKING WHETHER BPA WOULD BE INTERESTED IN PURCHASING SUCH GENERATION FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS YOU SHOULD DISCUSS THIS WITH BPAS POWER BUSINESS LINE OTHERWISE PLEASE CLARIFY YOUR QUESTION THANKS I have had conversations with Scott Wilson about tolls on larger production units and advised Scott that Enron has these smaller units available I expect to talk with him further this week about siting a MW naturalgas fired generator in the region The tricky part is understanding how we get the power to BPA andor the market within the rules for interconnection with the Federal Transmission System Any help that you can offer on expediting this process would be greatly appreciated I am sure there are more questions and I suspect you will have some as well Please feel free to contact me Jeff
