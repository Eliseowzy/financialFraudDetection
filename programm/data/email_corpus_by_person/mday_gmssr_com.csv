into town yesterday to ask if we were contesting service on EEMC as you will recall we asked him to confirm whether EEMC had actually been served I replied as Gary and I had discussed that we were not going to question the effectiveness of service on EEMC as counsel had both notice and copies of the subpoena Harvey then went on to indicate that he would be sending an email to confirm the phone conversation which Gary and I had with him particularly emphasizing that he had verbally reserved the right to seek additional information especially confidential profit information after reviewing our transactional information I agree with Gary that we only raised going back to June data as a possibility we were going to discuss with the client but Harvey did continue to reserve the right to seek data back even farther than that if they were not satisfied with our response This email is his confirmation If we wisht o offer a clarification we could have Gary send a short email saying our inquiry into the June data is continuing and we had not formally committed providing that data subject to further discussions with the client Mike Day Original Message From Fergus Gary S mailto Sent Wednesday October PM To Richard B Sanders Esq Email Michael Day Email Cc Meringolo Peter Subject FW Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Richard I am not sure what prompted this email today

with it Thanks Gary Original Message From Morris Harvey Y mailto Sent Wednesday October PM To Fergus Gary S Morris Harvey Y Cc MBD Subject RE Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Gentlemen This will confirm our tentative agreement to your email subject to our right to followup under the subpoenas already issued to the extent that the Enron Entities responses on Oct and Oct are not sufficient For example per your request we will review the electronic data base you provide us on the various transactions before we decide whether we will insist on the confidential financial records addressing any of the Enron Entities profits or losses in the purchase and sale of electricity in the WSCC You also stated that we would receive the electronic data base for on Oct and that you will check with your clients as to how soon you can get us the data for the transactions from June through December This will further confirm that your response to the subpoenas on behalf of the Enron Entities includes Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC as your Oct cover letter states Therefore as Mike Day orally agreed in todays telephone conversation there is no need for the Commission to reissue or serve a new subpoena on EEMC Original Message From Fergus Gary S mailto mailto Sent Friday October PM To Cc MBD Subject Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Importance High Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission hereinafter the Commission The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis We believe that the production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production which are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary For all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges Generally speaking the Enron Entities propose to produce documents for year as noted below We also understand that the Commission will be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production Enron Energy Services Operations Inc is the parent of Enron Energy Services Inc and does not have operating authority or engage in wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy Thus the documents offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy Services Inc but we have designated them both as EES We also do not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests through Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities businesses the burden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April is significant The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of their current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization To the extent that the Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods they will also make those available One Enron Entity Portland General has published books on its corporate history If a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it With respect to the other Enron Entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October Requests and The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Documents will identify its customers and suppliers We believe this information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the staffs purposes FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data EPMI EES and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data the Transaction Documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which information includes economic data We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October and the electronic Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests and For the Enron Entities other than Portland General the generation facilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested The Enron Entities other than Portland General do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions For Portland General the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents as Portland General owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand As a result we question whether the effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the California wholesale market is necessarily limited Nevertheless Portland General proposes to provide for year electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant as discussed below We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the California market At that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Requests and We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant transaction data for year in California and outside of California and Real Time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is a purchase or a sale Because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMIs customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES confidentiality obligations to those customers We anticipate producing the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order In addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission If you have any questions or comments about our proposal please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day or myself Brobeck Phleger Harrison LLP Gary Fergus

into town yesterday to ask if we were contesting service on EEMC as you will recall we asked him to confirm whether EEMC had actually been served I replied as Gary and I had discussed that we were not going to question the effectiveness of service on EEMC as counsel had both notice and copies of the subpoena Harvey then went on to indicate that he would be sending an email to confirm the phone conversation which Gary and I had with him particularly emphasizing that he had verbally reserved the right to seek additional information especially confidential profit information after reviewing our transactional information I agree with Gary that we only raised going back to June data as a possibility we were going to discuss with the client but Harvey did continue to reserve the right to seek data back even farther than that if they were not satisfied with our response This email is his confirmation If we wisht o offer a clarification we could have Gary send a short email saying our inquiry into the June data is continuing and we had not formally committed providing that data subject to further discussions with the client Mike Day Original Message From Fergus Gary S mailto Sent

This will confirm our tentative agreement to your email subject to our right to followup under the subpoenas already issued to the extent that the Enron Entities responses on Oct and Oct are not sufficient For example per your request we will review the electronic data base you provide us on the various transactions before we decide whether we will insist on the confidential financial records addressing any of the Enron Entities profits or losses in the purchase and sale of electricity in the WSCC You also stated that we would receive the electronic data base for on Oct and that you will check with your clients as to how soon you can get us the data for the transactions from June through December This will further confirm that your response to the subpoenas on behalf of the Enron Entities includes Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC as your Oct cover letter states Therefore as Mike Day orally agreed in todays telephone conversation there is no need for the Commission to reissue or serve a new subpoena on EEMC Original Message From Fergus Gary S mailto mailto Sent Friday October PM To Cc MBD Subject Enron Proposals Regarding Document Subpoenas Importance High Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission hereinafter the Commission The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis We believe that the production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production which are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary For all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges Generally speaking the Enron Entities propose to produce documents for year as noted below We also understand that the Commission will be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production Enron Energy Services Operations Inc is the parent of Enron Energy Services Inc and does not have operating authority or engage in wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy Thus the documents offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy Services Inc but we have designated them both as EES We also do not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests through Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities businesses the burden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April is significant The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of their current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization To the extent that the Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods they will also make those available One Enron Entity Portland General has published books on its corporate history If a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it With respect to the other Enron Entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October Requests and The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Documents will identify its customers and suppliers We believe this information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the staffs purposes FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests through The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data EPMI EES and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data the Transaction Documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which information includes economic data We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October and the electronic Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests and For the Enron Entities other than Portland General the generation facilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested The Enron Entities other than Portland General do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions For Portland General the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents as Portland General owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand As a result we question whether the effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the California wholesale market is necessarily limited Nevertheless Portland General proposes to provide for year electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant as discussed below We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the California market At that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Requests and We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant transaction data for year in California and outside of California and Real Time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is a purchase or a sale Because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMIs customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES confidentiality obligations to those customers We anticipate producing the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions FERC DOCUMENTS Request The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses copies of those responses We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order In addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission If you have any questions or comments about our proposal please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day or myself Brobeck Phleger Harrison LLP Gary Fergus

issue about which I do not wish there to be any uncertainty With regard to a customers use of onsystem storage whether the gas is delivered on system or off system upon withdrawal there should be no additional storage charge as mentioned in Craigs note What I understood was that any deliveries to on system delivery points of gas withdrawn from SoCalGas storage or any other on system storage provider when there is one would not involve a double transportation fee In other words as happens today there would be a tranport charge on injection and a regular full tranport fee paid by the customer on withdrawal and delivery to the on system burner tip BUT WITH A FULL CREDIT FOR THE INJECTION TRANSPORTATION CHARGE so that only one net transport charge is made Please confirm that this is the result in such an example With regard to the delivery of storage gas on withdrawal to an off system delivery point I do not see any rationale for imposing a second transport fee or failing to offer the same credit as it offered for on system delliveries from storage This would seem to be particularly true as Lad indicated that such deliveries would be accomplished by displacement and would be subject to operational restrictions so that they would only be accomodated when SoCalGas had sufficient flow through the interconnect to make the displacement work Please explain the rationale if

customer only has to provide one of the three and subitems iv and v are additional required items In on pp make parallel changes in the ors as stated above On p under h subitems i through v should be indented more than h and then items j k and l should be renumbered i j k this will then match section which has the correct spacingalphanumbering On p and p wed like to drop the reference to US in the reference to a letter of credit issued by a major US financial institution SoCalGas has realized that it has already had dealings with Canadian or other foreignowned customers where it was reasonable to rely on letters of credit from major financial institutions of the parents country This should be ok with Paul Amirault eh B Btu content On pp twice and the settlement says we are assuming Btumcf for the heating value of gas subject to revision by Commission during term of settlement We have the wrong units It is Btu per cubic foot not per thousand cubic feet Wed propose to change the number

<4868205.1075861594402.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mday@gmssr.com,2001-11-01 10:40:38,RE Sues Retort to SCEs PremiseNot necessarily for purposes of discussion on the SCE call but for later reference if we have to fight SCE over the justification for their crediting proposal I want to chime in with my critique of SCEs analysis First of all their example does not properly characterize the obligations of the direct access customers A Direct access customer with the same hypothetical load as in the SCE example did not pay the same toward SCEs procurement costs and transition recovery they paid a lesser sum minus the actual PX costs for that billing cycle What the direct access customer paid assuming the PX costs were was a contribution directly to CTC transition cost recovery in this case When the price of energy exceeded the cents in bundled rates for procurement and transition cost recovery the utility does begin to build an undercollection from its bundled customers and the entire undercollection in the SCE example relates to the cost of power purchased for the bundled customer but not recovered in rates The same is NOT TRUE for the direct access customer The negative credit provided to the direct access customer is the same as the underrecovery from the bundled service customer in this case However for the direct access customer this amount has nothing to do with power purchased by the utility for the DA customer and represents essentially a credit against amounts overpaid toward the utilitys CTC recovery in earlier periods This is one of the many perverse effects of the residual CTC collection mechanism If a fixed CTC contribution had been established from Day direct access customers could have continued to pay that fixed contribution also pay their share of the utility TD costs and would not have had any role in creating the utilitys undercollection However because the CTC calculation was a residual calculation the generation component of the frozen rates less the actual PX costs CTC which later became negative direct access customers contribution to CTC was dependent on the utilitys procurement risk in the market compared to the generation component in frozen rates This was also consistent with the notion contained in AB and the Edison MOU that the utility bore the risk of power price volatility in recovering its CTC In order for direct access customers to contribute to CTC symmetrically with bundled customers when bundled customers no longer contributed to CTC because of high power costs and in fact REDUCED the CTC collected the power cost undercollection was to have been paid first before CTC was booked but the PUC did not properly account for this until it adopted the TURN accounting adjustment then the CTC contribution of direct access customers had to be proportionately reduced and that is the function of the negative CTC credit Thus a reduction in the CTC contribution of direct access customers to ensure they paid the same proportionate share of CTC as bundled customers is NOT a matter which SCE is entitled to recover after the fact because they sustained an undercollection of power costs The undercollection of power costs was entirely their risk and direct access customers paid their fair share of CTC and that is all they had to pay period The fact that they paid less than SCE expected because the high power costs generated a lot of negative CTC credits at the end of the transition period is one more risk that the utilities assumed when they selfishly and foolishly promoted a residual CTC calculation instead of a fixed transition cost recovery system as was used in most other states SCE is entitled to NO recovery of its undercollection from direct access customers As you can tell I am more than willing to discuss this ad infinitum If you have questions please call or email Mike Day Original Message From Steffes James D mailtoJamesD NRONcom Sent Wednesday October PM To Mara Susan

Jeff Steffes James D Mellencamp Lisa Tribolet Michael Huddleson Diann Swain Steve Curry Wanda Subject Sues Retort to SCEs Premise Importance High I dont agree Edisons premise that direct access customers contributed just as much to SCEs procurement costs undercollection as bundled service customers We need to make clear that we dont buy in to their rhetoric Heres my reasoning DA Customers are completely different from bundled customers SCE had to buy power to serve the bundled load SCE did not buy power for DA customers SCEs purchases of the power to serve the bundled load coupled with high wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was the direct reason for the undercollection I can make the argument that the undercollection is SOLELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE There are two big reasons that back me up AB and Topdown rates I will explain The utilities got what they wanted out of AB payments of plus billion in socalled stranded costs and a real delay in any competitive retail market until their costs were paid off One of the tradeoffs however was that the utilities were at risk FOR HIGH PRICES in the WHOLESALE MARKET Everyone understood that if there were high gas prices or bad hydro years the utilities would be squeezed and not collect their billions by the deadline Thats the risk they agreed to Now they are claiming that they were ENTITLED to that money and more This is in direct conflict with the statute I can make the argument that the statute requires SCE to assume this risk and therefore any undercollection is theirs alone now the CPUC can bail them out but that doesnt make ESPs subject to any presumed undercollection Now to the rates At the beginning of DA the utilities did not want to do a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and the retail busness from TD So they did a topdown calculation This meant that there had to be a credit put on the bills of DA customers to account for the costs the utility avoided by having the customers switch to DA So the PX Credit structure was a direct result of the utilities unwillingness to unbundle specific components of the rates Next although bundled customers rates were capped the decisions from the CPUC made it clear that there was no similar cap for DA customers their rates and bills would be whatever was charged by their ESPs However when the utilities filed their tariffs with the CPUC they added a cap for the PX credit that was neither proposed nor authorized by the Commission Enron attacked it but got nowhere until WPTF and Enron brought it up in the RAP Proceeding Our argument was that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of DA customers and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the utilities avoided by not serving DA customers We argued that anything less is fundamentally unfair and anticomeptitive The utilities must have thought we had a good case because they agreed to settle The settlement was accepted by the Commission in the proceeding Everyone understood that eliminating the cap on the PX Credit was primarily to allow the PX Credit to FLOAT ABOVE THE CAP when wholesale prices were high So we have a legal right to receive the full PX CreditNegative CTC which is separate and distinct from any undercollection associated with bundled customers It seems as if we should be able to prosecute this legal right keeping in mind I am not an attorney In summary we have leverage and should use it Sue Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Wednesday October AM To Mara Susan Steffes James D Mellencamp Lisa

whether such credits were to be market based or whether direct access customers were to be indifferent to their choice of power providers All of the direct access credit rules were developed by the CPUC in their approval of the direct access tariff rules Rule and in their implementation of the utility cost recovery plans the calculation of CTC Therefore we cannot protest the PE advice letter on that basis We can still argue for the DJ indexes as a more appropriate substitute for a PE credit based just on Edisons cost of generation retained generation plus QFs plus DWR purchases but we have to recognize that it the number is higher than the PE credit we will be effectively asking for a subsidy to direct access providers from the utilitys bundled customers I do not expect us to succeed in obtaining that subsidy The bottom up tariff structure is a much more likely result at this point Mike Day Original Message From mailto Sent Friday April PM To Cc JBennett MSSRcom Subject Re SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit Protest Looks good Scott One thing I admit Im not a lawyer so someone needs to show me the precise language in AB that requires the credit which I believe was created by the PUC not the legislature to be based on market and requires DA customers to be indifferent to be from DA suppliers Mike Day Do you concur with Scotts interpretation in AB Like your arguments Scott Just want to clarify that were on solid legal ground before putting the arguments foreward in a brief andor protest Best Jeff Scott ES To JBennett MSSRcom ENRON cc Harry nron Tamara ES Leslie ES AM Jeff nron Subject Re SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit ProtestDocument link Jeff Dasovich We should protest this issue and argue that nothing should change but that the Px credit should be based on DJNP and DJSP rather than the defunct Px because AB requires it to be based on market not costs Changing to procured energy is inconsistent with the law AB which requires DA customers to be indifferent to buying from DA suppliers And since DA suppliers face costs close to DJNPSP that is the only appropriate available method Further the issue of how to calculate Px is interrelated to whether DA customers should be charged the generation surcharges DA customers should be given market based Px credits based on DJNPSP because its the law There are possible interpretations resulting from the combination of AB and the new law The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and not pay any surcharge The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and pay the surcharges Interpretation results in DA customers getting lower rates than all other customers It seems unlikely that the legislation would have this intent Interpretation results in DA customers getting the same rate as all other customers until the end of AB This seems like the likely interpretation since otherwise the new legislation would have repealled AB Thus given that the DA customers are being held indifferent to frozen rates plus they should get a Px market based credit plus pay the surcharge until the rate freeze ends Once the Px credit ends Mar the surcharge should end because the law AB no longer requires them to be held at frozen rates and because Any customer that is being served by a supplier other than DWR and the utility is not causing any costs for DWR or the utility therefore they should not be charged for them In the event that Px credit is not set based on market value if the courts interpret the law differently than Enron then there should be no generation surcharge for DA customers This is the same argument we should make in our brief on rate setting Scott JBennett MSSRcom on AM To Harry Kingerski Email Robert Neustaedter Email Scott Stoness Email Tamara Johnson Business Fax IMCEAFAXTamaraJohnsonBGMSSRcom cc Jeff Dasovich Email Sue Mara Email Subject SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit Protest As you are aware SCE made an advice filing on April th to eradicate the PX Rate Schedule and Replace it with Schedule PE Procured Energy As part of the filing SCE proposes to set on an interim basis the cost of energy procurement for bundled service customers for billing purposes and in the calculation of the energy credit for direct access customers equal to the Generation rate component of the Customers otherwise applicable tariff Two primary issues arise from SCEs statement First what does interim basis mean how long will this be in effect In starts on January th but it is unclear as to when it would end Second and most important is what is meant by the Generation rate component While there is not much explanation in the April advice letter in a subsequent advice letter filed on April E SCE set forth Rate Schedule Specific Generation Related Rates which range between five and nine cents I have forwarded both the referenced advice letters to you earlier We need to protest the change in the PX credit by Wednesday April th All thoughts on the

soto voce in a private email that he was not an attorney But note that in her note she refers to him as an attorney and he is offering his opinions about EPMIs options in terms of compliance with Calfornia lawsand from what Janet said this is part of a nationwide compliance program LeBoeuf is running for Enron The email also references John Klauberg who is the main LeBoeuf attorney in NYC that Enron uses on contract stuff and all the ENA and EES guys like his work so he must be involved in this and you shouldnt mess with that I am most concerned that Enron attorneys not be misled into thinking Boothe is an attorney Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday May AM To Cc Subject Registered versus NonRegistered ESPs in California Mike Per my voicemail I am forwarding to you an email from an attorney at LeBoeuf As mentioned LeBoeuf has been helping us develop an overall compliance plan for meeting the varied retail regulatory requirements in the states where EPMI sells to industrials They came up with the suggestion as discussed further below of having EPMI deregister as an ESP in California and instead become a nonregistered ESP I understand that EPMI could still sell to large industrials under this classification First can you remember the historical reason of why EPMI registered as an ESP to begin with but with the qualification that it only intended to serve large industrials There may have been an important strategic decision to do so Second is there any reason why EPMI should not deregister as an ESP and become a nonregistered ESP I look forward to hearing from you Please feel free to call me at Janet Forwarded by Janet H MooreHOUECT on AM JAMES BOOTHE To LGM cc CHRISTOPHER HILEN COM LGMCOM JOHN KLAUBERG LGMCOM JOHN MAAS LGMCOM SANDY COFER LGMCOM Subject Registered versus NonRegistered ESPs in California PM Janet As you know EPMI is currently classified with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC as a Registered ESP ESP EPMI may want to consider deregistering with the CPUC and instead benefit from classification as a NonRegistered ESP I have confirmed that an ESP must only register with the CPUC prior to serving residential and small commercial customers The CPUC defines a small commercial customer as a customer that has a maximum peak demand of less than kW per meter for at least billing periods during the most recent month period See CPUC o h and PGE Tariff Rule As EPMI has indicated in its license application that it only intends to serve large commercial customers and per our discussions does not have immediate plans to serve small commercial customers EPMI may elect to deregister and become a NonRegistered ESP The primary advantage of deregistering is that EPMI as a NonRegistered ESP would no longer have continued reporting and compliance requirements with the CPUC including the annual submission of a standard service plan filing application update and license renewal Additionally as a NonRegistered ESP EPMI would no longer have the ongoing obligation to notify the CPUC within days of changes in address or phone numbers and to notify the CPUC of all other material changes including changes to officers and directors within days I have confirmed with a contact at the energy division of the CPUC on an anonymous basis that a Registered ESP can deregister with the CPUC by sending a letter to the address below requesting cancellation of ESP registration status California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division Electric Service Provider Registration Fourth Floor Van Ness Avenue San Francisco CA Our source at the CPUC also confirmed that the CPUC exercises no regulatory jurisdiction over a NonRegistered ESP NonRegistered ESPs however can file a complaint at the CPUC against a jurisdictional utility over issues dealing with the utilitys compliance with its tariffs with respect to ESPs Please note that while NonRegistered ESPs do not have ongoing reporting and compliance requirements with the CPUC both Registered ESPs and NonRegistered ESPs must submit various environmental compliance filings with the California Energy Commission and if participating in the Greene Program make additional filings with the Center for Resource Solutions For additional information on these reporting and compliance requirements for Registered ESPs and NonRegistered ESPs in California please refer to the LLGM website at llgmENRONllgmnsf If you have any questions about reporting requirements in California the deregistering process or would like our assistance with this

have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in the last two months However now that it is moving they have got the message Williams Kern River is going to host a meeting today to create a coalition to oppose the bill Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will take place In addition to Williams I understand that Questar WSPA and other retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill My client Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition but they dont carry that much clout or name recognition so far I am hopeful that other groups will surface soon As for the bill itself the problem is two fold First the CPUC decides what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities They take input from customers but Loretta is a command and control type all the way and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a goldplated stateregulated system While the bill does not and cannot legally bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates The large customers have to commit to take firm service on a year basis with exit fees If they dont take this they can only get interruptible service from the utilities Many if not all large customers especially generators cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the LDC system This is the same dilemma that the RLS tariff caused My belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate The Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate My view is based on Sempras reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by Lynchs office This could interfere with Enron gas sales over the interstates and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans for building across the border into California although that does not appear to be a high priority at this time This bill will also make it more costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of their needs Please call if you have further questions Mike Day

doesnt seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates from building into the state If thats true wouldnt the PUC take those projects into account when doing its analysis and only

infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities They take input from customers but Loretta is a command and control type all the way and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a goldplated stateregulated system While the bill does not and cannot legally bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates The large customers have to commit to take firm service on a year basis with exit fees If they dont take this they can only get interruptible service from the utilities Many if not all large customers especially generators cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the LDC system This is the same dilemma that the RLS tariff caused My belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate The Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate My view is based on Sempras reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by Lynchs office This could interfere with Enron gas sales over the interstates and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans for building across the border

have to fight SCE over the justification for their crediting proposal I want to chime in with my critique of SCEs analysis First of all their example does not properly characterize the obligations of the direct access customers A Direct access customer with the same hypothetical load as in the SCE example did not pay the same toward SCEs procurement costs and transition recovery they paid a lesser sum minus the actual PX costs for that billing cycle What the direct access customer paid assuming the PX costs were was a contribution directly to CTC transition cost recovery in this case When the price of energy exceeded the cents in bundled rates for procurement and transition cost recovery the utility does begin to build an undercollection from its bundled customers and the entire undercollection in the SCE example relates to the cost of power purchased for the bundled customer but not recovered in rates The same is NOT TRUE for the direct access customer The negative credit provided to the direct access customer is the same as the underrecovery from the bundled service customer in this case However for the direct access customer this amount has nothing to do with power purchased by the utility for the DA customer and represents essentially a credit against amounts overpaid toward the utilitys CTC recovery in earlier periods This is one of the many perverse effects of the residual CTC collection mechanism If a fixed CTC contribution had been established from Day direct access customers could have continued to pay that fixed contribution also pay their share of the utility TD costs and would not have had any role in creating the utilitys undercollection However because the CTC calculation was a residual calculation the generation component of the frozen rates less the actual PX costs CTC which later became negative direct access customers contribution to CTC was dependent on the utilitys procurement risk in the market compared to the generation component in frozen rates This was also consistent with the notion contained in AB and the Edison MOU that the utility bore the risk of power price volatility in recovering its CTC In order for direct access customers to contribute to CTC symmetrically with bundled customers when bundled customers no longer contributed to CTC because of high power costs and in fact REDUCED the CTC collected the power cost undercollection was to have been paid first before CTC was booked but the PUC did not properly account for this until it adopted the TURN accounting adjustment then the CTC contribution of direct access customers had to be proportionately reduced and that is the function of the negative CTC credit Thus a reduction in the CTC contribution of direct access customers to ensure they paid the same proportionate share of CTC as bundled customers is NOT a matter which SCE is entitled to recover after the fact because they sustained an undercollection of power costs The undercollection of power costs was entirely their risk and direct access customers paid their fair share of CTC and that is all they had to pay period The fact that they paid less than SCE expected because the high power costs generated a lot of negative CTC credits at the end of the transition period is one more risk that the utilities assumed when they selfishly and foolishly promoted a residual CTC calculation instead of a fixed transition cost recovery system as was used in most other states SCE is entitled to NO recovery of its undercollection from direct access customers As you can tell I am more than willing to discuss this ad infinitum If you have questions please call or email Mike Day Original Message From Steffes James D mailtoJamesD NRONcom Sent Wednesday October PM To Mara Susan

Jeff Steffes James D Mellencamp Lisa Tribolet Michael Huddleson Diann Swain Steve Curry Wanda Subject Sues Retort to SCEs Premise Importance High I dont agree Edisons premise that direct access customers contributed just as much to SCEs procurement costs undercollection as bundled service customers We need to make clear that we dont buy in to their rhetoric Heres my reasoning DA Customers are completely different from bundled customers SCE had to buy power to serve the bundled load SCE did not buy power for DA customers SCEs purchases of the power to serve the bundled load coupled with high wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was the direct reason for the undercollection I can make the argument that the undercollection is SOLELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE There are two big reasons that back me up AB and Topdown rates I will explain The utilities got what they wanted out of AB payments of plus billion in socalled stranded costs and a real delay in any competitive retail market until their costs were paid off One of the tradeoffs however was that the utilities were at risk FOR HIGH PRICES in the WHOLESALE MARKET Everyone understood that if there were high gas prices or bad hydro years the utilities would be squeezed and not collect their billions by the deadline Thats the risk they agreed to Now they are claiming that they were ENTITLED to that money and more This is in direct conflict with the statute I can make the argument that the statute requires SCE to assume this risk and therefore any undercollection is theirs alone now the CPUC can bail them out but that doesnt make ESPs subject to any presumed undercollection Now to the rates At the beginning of DA the utilities did not want to do a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and the retail busness from TD So they did a topdown calculation This meant that there had to be a credit put on the bills of DA customers to account for the costs the utility avoided by having the customers switch to DA So the PX Credit structure was a direct result of the utilities unwillingness to unbundle specific components of the rates Next although bundled customers rates were capped the decisions from the CPUC made it clear that there was no similar cap for DA customers their rates and bills would be whatever was charged by their ESPs However when the utilities filed their tariffs with the CPUC they added a cap for the PX credit that was neither proposed nor authorized by the Commission Enron attacked it but got nowhere until WPTF and Enron brought it up in the RAP Proceeding Our argument was that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of DA customers and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the utilities avoided by not serving DA customers We argued that anything less is fundamentally unfair and anticomeptitive The utilities must have thought we had a good case because they agreed to settle The settlement was accepted by the Commission in the proceeding Everyone understood that eliminating the cap on the PX Credit was primarily to allow the PX Credit to FLOAT ABOVE THE CAP when wholesale prices were high So we have a legal right to receive the full PX CreditNegative CTC which is separate and distinct from any undercollection associated with bundled customers It seems as if we should be able to prosecute this legal right keeping in mind I am not an attorney In summary we have leverage and should use it Sue Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Wednesday October AM To Mara Susan Steffes James D Mellencamp Lisa

that the utilities build a goldplated stateregulated system While the bill does not and cannot legally bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates The large customers have to commit to take firm service on a year basis with exit fees If they dont take this they can only get interruptible service from the utilities Many if not all large customers especially generators cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the LDC system This is the same dilemma that the RLS tariff caused My belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate The Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate My view is based on Sempras reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by Lynchs office This could interfere with Enron gas sales over the interstates and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans for building across the border into California although

soto voce in a private email that he was not an attorney But note that in her note she refers to him as an attorney and he is offering his opinions about EPMIs options in terms of compliance with Calfornia lawsand from what Janet said this is part of a nationwide compliance program LeBoeuf is running for Enron The email also references John Klauberg who is the main LeBoeuf attorney in NYC that Enron uses on contract stuff and all the ENA and EES guys like his work so he must be involved in this and you shouldnt mess with that I am most concerned that Enron attorneys not be misled into thinking Boothe is an attorney Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday May AM To Cc Subject Registered versus NonRegistered ESPs in California Mike Per my voicemail I am forwarding to you an email from an attorney at LeBoeuf As mentioned LeBoeuf has been helping us develop an overall compliance plan for meeting the varied retail regulatory requirements in the states where EPMI sells to industrials They came up with the suggestion as discussed further below of having EPMI deregister as an ESP in California and instead become a nonregistered ESP I understand that EPMI could still sell to large industrials under this classification First can you remember the historical reason of why EPMI registered as an ESP to begin with but with the qualification that it only intended to serve large industrials There may have been an important strategic decision to do so Second is there any reason why EPMI should not deregister as an ESP and become a nonregistered ESP I look forward to hearing from you Please feel free to call me at Janet Forwarded by Janet H MooreHOUECT on AM JAMES BOOTHE To LGM cc CHRISTOPHER HILEN COM LGMCOM JOHN KLAUBERG LGMCOM JOHN MAAS LGMCOM SANDY COFER LGMCOM Subject Registered versus NonRegistered ESPs in California PM Janet As you know EPMI is currently classified with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC as a Registered ESP ESP EPMI may want to consider deregistering with the CPUC and instead benefit from classification as a NonRegistered ESP I have confirmed that an ESP must only register with the CPUC prior to serving residential and small commercial customers The CPUC defines a small commercial customer as a customer that has a maximum peak demand of less than kW per meter for at least billing periods during the most recent month period See CPUC o h and PGE Tariff Rule As EPMI has indicated in its license application that it only intends to serve large commercial customers and per our discussions does not have immediate plans to serve small commercial customers EPMI may elect to deregister and become a NonRegistered ESP The primary advantage of deregistering is that EPMI as a NonRegistered ESP would no longer have continued reporting and compliance requirements with the CPUC including the annual submission of a standard service plan filing application update and license renewal Additionally as a NonRegistered ESP EPMI would no longer have the ongoing obligation to notify the CPUC within days of changes in address or phone numbers and to notify the CPUC of all other material changes including changes to officers and directors within days I have confirmed with a contact at the energy division of the CPUC on an anonymous basis that a Registered ESP can deregister with the CPUC by sending a letter to the address below requesting cancellation of ESP registration status California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division Electric Service Provider Registration Fourth Floor Van Ness Avenue San Francisco CA Our source at the CPUC also confirmed that the CPUC exercises no regulatory jurisdiction over a NonRegistered ESP NonRegistered ESPs however can file a complaint at the CPUC against a jurisdictional utility over issues dealing with the utilitys compliance with its tariffs with respect to ESPs Please note that while NonRegistered ESPs do not have ongoing reporting and compliance requirements with the CPUC both Registered ESPs and NonRegistered ESPs must submit various environmental compliance filings with the California Energy Commission and if participating in the Greene Program make additional filings with the Center for Resource Solutions For additional information on these reporting and compliance requirements for Registered ESPs and NonRegistered ESPs in California please refer to the LLGM website at llgmENRONllgmnsf If you have any questions about reporting requirements in California the deregistering process or would like our assistance with this

about whether such credits were to be market based or whether direct access customers were to be indifferent to their choice of power providers All of the direct access credit rules were developed by the CPUC in their approval of the direct access tariff rules Rule and in their implementation of the utility cost recovery plans the calculation of CTC Therefore we cannot protest the PE advice letter on that basis We can still argue for the DJ indexes as a more appropriate substitute for a PE credit based just on Edisons cost of generation retained generation plus QFs plus DWR purchases but we have to recognize that it the number is higher than the PE credit we will be effectively asking for a subsidy to direct access providers from the utilitys bundled customers I do not expect us to succeed in obtaining that subsidy The bottom up tariff structure is a much more likely result at this point Mike Day Original Message From mailto Sent Friday April PM To Cc JBennett MSSRcom Subject Re SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit Protest Looks good Scott One thing I admit Im not a lawyer so someone needs to show me the precise language in AB that requires the credit which I believe was created by the PUC not the legislature to be based on market and requires DA customers to be indifferent to be from DA suppliers Mike Day Do you concur with Scotts interpretation in AB Like your arguments Scott Just want to clarify that were on solid legal ground before putting the arguments foreward in a brief andor protest Best Jeff Scott ES To JBennett MSSRcom ENRON cc Harry nron Tamara ES Leslie ES AM Jeff nron Subject Re SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit ProtestDocument link Jeff Dasovich We should protest this issue and argue that nothing should change but that the Px credit should be based on DJNP and DJSP rather than the defunct Px because AB requires it to be based on market not costs Changing to procured energy is inconsistent with the law AB which requires DA customers to be indifferent to buying from DA suppliers And since DA suppliers face costs close to DJNPSP that is the only appropriate available method Further the issue of how to calculate Px is interrelated to whether DA customers should be charged the generation surcharges DA customers should be given market based Px credits based on DJNPSP because its the law There are possible interpretations resulting from the combination of AB and the new law The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and not pay any surcharge The DA customers should get a market based Px credit and pay the surcharges Interpretation results in DA customers getting lower rates than all other customers It seems unlikely that the legislation would have this intent Interpretation results in DA customers getting the same rate as all other customers until the end of AB This seems like the likely interpretation since otherwise the new legislation would have repealled AB Thus given that the DA customers are being held indifferent to frozen rates plus they should get a Px market based credit plus pay the surcharge until the rate freeze ends Once the Px credit ends Mar the surcharge should end because the law AB no longer requires them to be held at frozen rates and because Any customer that is being served by a supplier other than DWR and the utility is not causing any costs for DWR or the utility therefore they should not be charged for them In the event that Px credit is not set based on market value if the courts interpret the law differently than Enron then there should be no generation surcharge for DA customers This is the same argument we should make in our brief on rate setting Scott JBennett MSSRcom on AM To Harry Kingerski Email Robert Neustaedter Email Scott Stoness Email Tamara Johnson Business Fax IMCEAFAXTamaraJohnsonBGMSSRcom cc Jeff Dasovich Email Sue Mara Email Subject SCE Advice Filing on PX Credit Protest As you are aware SCE made an advice filing on April th to eradicate the PX Rate Schedule and Replace it with Schedule PE Procured Energy As part of the filing SCE proposes to set on an interim basis the cost of energy procurement for bundled service customers for billing purposes and in the calculation of the energy credit for direct access customers equal to the Generation rate component of the Customers otherwise applicable tariff Two primary issues arise from SCEs statement First what does interim basis mean how long will this be in effect In starts on January th but it is unclear as to when it would end Second and most important is what is meant by the Generation rate component While there is not much explanation in the April advice letter in a subsequent advice letter filed on April E SCE set forth Rate Schedule Specific Generation Related Rates which range between five and nine cents I have forwarded both the referenced advice letters to you earlier We need to protest the change in the PX credit by Wednesday April th All thoughts on the
