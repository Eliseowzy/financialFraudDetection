morning to fix his parents pancakes He found a big bowl and spoon pulled a chair to the counter opened the cupboard and pulled out the heavy flour canister spilling it on the floor He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar leaving a floury trail on the floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten Brandon was covered with flour and getting frustrated He wanted this to be something very good for Mom and Dad but it was getting very bad He didnt know what to do next whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove and he didnt know how the stove worked Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and reached to push her away knocking the egg carton to the floor Frantically he tried to clean up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs getting his pajamas white and sticky And just then he saw Dad standing at the door Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandons eyes All hed wanted to do was something good but hed made a terrible mess He was sure a scolding was coming maybe even a spanking But his father just watched him Then walking through the mess he picked up his crying son hugged him and loved him getting his own pajamas white and sticky in the process Thats how God deals with us We try to do something good in life but it turns into a mess Our marriage gets all sticky or we insult a friend or we cant stand our job or our health goes sour Sometimes we just stand there in tears because we cant think of anything else to do Thats when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us even though some of our mess gets all over Him But just because we might mess up we cant stop trying to make pancakes for God or for others Sooner or later well get it right and then theyll be glad we tried Please pass some of this love on to others suppose one morning you never wake up do all your friends know you love them I was thinking I could die today tomorrow or next week and I wondered if I had any wounds needing to be healed friendships that need rekindling or three words needing to be said sometimes I love you can heal bless Let everyone of your friends know you love them Even if you think they dont love back you would be amazed at what those three little words and a smile can do Just in case I die tomorrowI LOVE YA ReturnPath Received from rlyygmxaolcom rlyygmailaolcom by
