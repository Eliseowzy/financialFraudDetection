upswing and hesitation has crept back into the markets Analysts are busy downgrading sectors and stocks stating that prices have risen too much unsupported by the fundamentals It is true that industry

problems However it is also true that recovery is on its way Inventories are improving and rate cuts are spurring consumer spending The production lines will start rolling again The only hitch is a

surge Get invested NOW in the ChangeWave NewTech stars of the Nasdaq comeback Discover them all in this FREE special report Profiting NOW from the Tech Comeback Access your FREE copy right now at passthroughaspid General Sentiment I took a week off from some RR with family and attempted to spend as much time as possible away from the PC and the CNBC tape It doesnt always work out that as planned The tech and Internet sectors suffered two down days at the start of a holidayshortened week and then recovered a little in the following two days Nearterm conclusion Although volume was light the twoday rebound plus the up day this past Monday indicated that tradersinvestors appeared relatively optimistic as the market heads into what is historically a slow period for business for technology companies The damage from the first two sessions however couldnt be overcome in the final two days The major averages gave up some ground in the fourday period with the Nasdaq Composite Index off the Dow off a slight while the SP slipped Soothing words over the weekend from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan about inflation not being a particular and some curious comments about oil prices helped the markets extend their advance for a third straight session One remark Greenspan made was particularly interesting The past three recessions have been preceded by a spike in crude oil prices The Fed chief however didnt discuss at length the impact of an inverted yield curve From a historical perspective an inverted yield curve or a condition when shortterm interest rates are higher than longterm interest rates has served as a reliable tool used by economists to forecast a recession Readers who are unfamiliar with the term inverted yield curve can access the Googlecom search engine for an explanation Its well worth the time In addition by gaining an understanding of how the yield curve affects stock prices an investor can avoid a major downturn in the value of his or her portfolio Weekly Model Portfolio Results As was noted last weeks decline in tech and Internet stocks affected all stocks in the Ones to Watch Model Portfolio they all finished lower Xilinix XLNX Broadcom BRMC Commerce One CMRC Nokia NOK Corning Corp GLW CIENA Corp CIEN Finisar Corp FNSR Emulex Corp EMLX EMC Corp EMC Juniper Networks JNPR Sun Microsystems SUNW AOL TimeWarner AOL Check Point Software CHKP Efunds EFDS Comverse Technology CMVT Get FREE issues of Investors Business Daily with nothing to cancel partnersaspid In the News Notice how AOL TimeWarner hardly budged from the previous Friday while the other Model Portfolio components declined on average roughly Some is written and discussed about AOL TimeWarner everyday in the financial media that keeping up with the developments can amount to a fulltime job jumpcom writer Janet Evans Arnold provided a recent synopsis concerning AOL TimeWarners showdown with Microsoft Corp MSFT Heres the report storyhtmstoryid My take on the situation Like any big company AOL TimeWarner plays hardball with the smaller players in its space while going headtohead with its peers such as Microsoft In order to keep growing at a reasonable rate at both the top line and bottom line large companies continually make deals with smaller fish as they seek ways to encroach on each others established turf While listening to the postmarket commentary on CNBC concerning the AOLMicrosoft browser squabble I found one remark interesting Its not so much a battle for market share as it is more a battle for mind share In other words the slogan AOL Anywhere means exactly that in describing the Internet service providers mission As for Microsoft it seems the worlds largest software companys mission is to have its software products installed in any device run by electricity Meanwhile Sun Microsystems continually pushes its Java programming language as the standard for communication devices which in essence is a PCs main function now Hardly a day goes without Sun publishing a press release touting its latest deal with a vendor that agrees to implement Java as a programming tool In some respects this is a tell about how hard Sun and other software applications companies are pushing to remain competitive against Microsoft The outcome Apple Computer AAPL is probably the best example of what will eventually occur in the programming languagepervasive computing arena In many respects although Apple makes PCs and laptops its a product unto itself with its own way of doing things that sometimes comes in conflict with the rest of the computing world In other words the world will have to tolerate several different computing standards the same way it has to tolerate the fact that not everyone speaks a universal language When it comes product preferences some folks drive Renaults others drive Fords and then theres another group that prefers Chevrolets It will probably always be this way despite attempts by men like Bill Gates or Scott McNealy or Steve Case to manipulate people into thinking about computers andor the Internet in only one way their way Although semiconductor companies both producers and equipment makers continue to warn that the industry is facing more problems Xilinix said that its financial outlook for the fourth quarter remains unchanged Thats the good news The bad news is that revenues for the June quarter will still show a decline of to sequentially Overall Xilinx is saying its business is nearing a bottom is what is a highly cyclical industry Nokia continues to capture market share from its rivals in the cellphone market According to research firm Gartner Dataquest Nokia has increased its world market share to from in the fourth quarter Nokia is also working behind the scenes to establish a wireless infrastructure for G mobile phones But so are its rivals Here again we have a condition in which a large company does things its way Check Point Software the leader in firewall protection software took a hit Monday after some obscure research outfit called Off The Record Research last Friday claimed that Check Point was facing a significant sequential slowing in revenue to price competition from rivals Interesting how a report shows up after the bell on a Friday from an independent research firm and gets blown up all out of proportion But thats the stock market Comverse Technology reported firstquarter financial results Monday of cents a share that was a penny better than the Street estimate The stock traded higher in extended hours but not by an appreciable amount The Streets reaction was interesting to observe considering the fact that Comverse Tech the leader in voicemessaging services beat the consensus estimate while setting a new record for yearoveryear growth in revenues and earnings that were in line with its fiveyear growth rate Technical Analysis Although it may be considered as a consolation prize in the same way a contestant in a beauty contest wins the Miss Congeniality award all stocks in the Model Portfolio finished the week ending June above their week lows Most of the lows occurred between April when the Nasdaq marketplace hit absolute we hope bottom AOL TimeWarner remains above its day moving average a good technical sign but the other components have slipped a little in the past weeks Changes to the Model Portfolio While surfing the Net for financial tid bits I came across this heading Oracle goes after Ariba Commerce One with new software Ive already dropped BB software platform provider Ariba ARBA from the Model Portfolio and replaced it with Nokia Web hosting services firm Exodus Communications EXDS was dropped in favor or smallcap player Efunds a recent spinoff from Deluxe Corp DLX Oracle is the worlds No business software maker behind Germanys SAP AG SAP Like any corporate giant its under pressure to shore up its top line and bottom line during tough times One strategy large companies employ during difficult times is to enter new markets which was meat of the story concerning Oracles thrust into the BB procurement space supposedly dominated by Ariba and Commerce One CMRC The outcome In the shortterm it means pricing pressure when a new competitor enters the ring Ariba and Commerce One are already facing hard times since its become apparent that large businesses are its chief sources of revenue Implementing this software is expensive for middlesized and small businesses Procurement can be still be achieved by such arcane technologies as fax machines and telephones So its out with Commerce One the other major BB player in this space Its replacement believe it or not is Flowerscom FLWS an eretailer that sells you guessed it floral arrangements over the Internet The company is actually a multichannel retailer it provides access for its flowers and gifts via the Internet telephone catalogs and boring bricks mortar locations Flowerscom does have competition from FTDcom EFTD In fact both companies went public at roughly the same time in September Both are still trading below their IPO prices and both stocks have similar charts There are several positions for switching positions Low price to sales ratio of for the trailing months Low debttoasset ratio of million in cash Rising sales and falling costs Rising profit margins The company expects EBITDA earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization cash flow in other words to be positive in the current quarter that ends in July There are some caveats Flower sales is a seasonal business The companys best quarter is the fourth quarter that ends in April and includes Valentines Day and Easter Company is still burning cash Profitability is still a conjecture It has competition from FTDcom The slowdown in the US economy including worker layoffs could eventually affect retail sales in the second half of More pluses however More participation from institutions mutual funds pension funds insurance companies bank trusts compared to FTDcom More than just flowers FLWS sells gifts such as foods and gardening equipment after a recent acquisition of catalog company Plow and Hearth Despite the fact that insiders own of the outstanding shares there has been little insider selling in the past months Means insiders are patient with the company Good chart pattern The day simple moving average line crossed the day moving average line Whats interesting to observe is when the moving average lines crossed a technically bullish indicator it was in midFebruary The was the exact time when the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Nasdaq Index both went into a precipitous tailspin that eventually exhausted itself on April A diversified portfolio can be diversified in several ways One way is a concentration in largecap stocks that cover several industry groups Another way is to divide the capital into largecap midcap and smallcap holdings Wall Street at the present time is showing little interest in largecap stocks Ive outlined a few of reasons in this newsletter But all of the money hasnt taken flight to the safety of bonds in the past few months A considerable portion has drifted toward smallcap stocks Let the trend be your friend Comments Welcomed A resident of Wilmington NC Dave Jennings writes the Market Highlights report for jumpcom He can be reached at Advertise With Us For more information about

Yeung Rising five of the past six sessions the Nasdaq Composite Index pulled within striking distance of its May peak of For the week the techheavy index has risen or to close at Thursday hurdling resistance at All the while the market has ignored renewed signs of economic weakness and more warnings on the corporate front Instead investors focused on the increased likelihood of more interest rate cuts and shadowy signals that the worst of the downturn may have passed Confirming economic weakness alluded to in April durable goods orders new and existing home sales and purchasing managers data for May Tuesdays numbers showed April factory orders fell a biggerthanexpected and firstquarter productivity was revised lower to minus Basis Point Cut Expected at Next Meeting In response to such weakness the futures market has priced in a chance of a basis point cut in interest rates when the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC meets June and The market is giving just slight consideration to a point cut likely in recognition of the points already slashed from the Fed funds rate since the beginning of the year Which leads us to a big reason for the markets recent rally Flooded with cheap money investors appear willing to bet on a recovery in the second half of the year evident as they latch on to suggestion of the sort while ignoring blatantly negative warnings Two such examples of this were chipmakers Broadcom BRCM and National Semiconductor NSM both rallying after dismal earnings warnings Thursday Both noted signs of stabilization and hopes for a turnaround later this year Ailing telecomequipment maker Lucent Technologies LU was an unlikely tech giant reaffirming thirdquarter guidance Tuesday while semiconductor kingpin Intel INTC reiterated its secondquarter guidance and predicted a seasonally stronger second half on Thursday With the market apparently ready to take on the secondquarter earnings warning season the notion that Wall Street usually gears down for the summer months may prove untrue analogous to how many expected the market to outperform during the winter months Chip Stocks Expected to Take the Lead Thursdays exceptional strength among chip stocks which powered the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up nearly to just under a key resistance level may provide clues as to where the market goes from here It is generally accepted that movements in the chip sector lead the broader market moves by about a month and the broader market leads the economy by about six months While few believe that stocks are ready to return to their heights overly cautious strategies may miss some steady gains Next Week The economic calendar is fairly heavy with the May retail sales figures scheduled for release Wednesday the May Producer Price Index PPI
