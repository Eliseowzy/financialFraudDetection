trained to continue the family profession His early achievements on behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before his th birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training Alexander Graham was not added until he was was the second of the three sons of Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds Bell Apart from one year at a private school two years at Edinburghs Royal High School from which he was graduated at and attendance at a few lectures at Edinburgh University and at University College in London Bell was largely family trained and selftaught His first professional post was at Mr Skinners school in Elgin County Moray where he instructed the children in both music and elocution In he became a resident master in Elgins Weston House Academy where he conducted his first studies in sound Appropriately Bell had begun professionally as he would continue through lifeas a teacherscientist In he became his fathers assistant in London and assumed full charge while the senior Bell lectured in America The shock of the sudden death of his older brother from tuberculosis which had also struck down his younger brother and the strain of his professional duties soon took their toll on young Bell Concern for their only surviving son prompted the familys move to Canada in August where after settling near Brantford Ont Bells health rapidly improved In Bell spent several weeks in Boston lecturing and demonstrating the system of his fathers Visible Speech published in as a means of teaching speech to the deaf Each phonetic symbol indicated a definite position of the organs of speech such as lips tongue and soft palate and could be used by the deaf to imitate the sounds of speech in the usual way Young A Graham Bell as he now preferred to be known showed using his fathers system that speech could be taught to the deaf His astounding results soon led to further invitations to lecture Even while vacationing at his parents home Bell continued his experiments with sound In he opened his own school in Boston for training teachers of the deaf edited his pamphlet Visible Speech Pioneer and continued to study and tutor in he became professor of vocal physiology at Boston University Never adept with his hands Bell had the good fortune to discover and inspire Thomas Watson a young repair mechanic and model maker who assisted him enthusiastically in devising an apparatus for transmitting sound by electricity Their long nightly sessions began to produce tangible results The fathers of George Sanders and Mabel Hubbard two deaf students whom he helped were sufficiently impressed with the young teacher to assist him financially in his scientific pursuits Nevertheless during normal working hours Bell and Watson were still obliged to fulfill a busy schedule of professional demands It is scarcely surprising that Bells health again suffered On April he was granted the patent for his multiple telegraph but after another exhausting six months of long nightly sessions in the workshop while maintaining his daily professional schedule Bell had to return to his parents home in Canada to recuperate In September he began to write the specifications for the telephone On March the United States Patent Office granted to Bell Patent Number covering The method of and apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically by causing electrical undulations similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds Within a year followed the commercial application and a few months later the first of hundreds of legal suits Ironically the telephoneuntil then all too often regarded as a joke and its creatorprophet as at best an eccentricwas the subject of the most involved patent litigation in history The two most celebrated of the early actions were the Dowd and Drawbaugh cases wherein the fledgling Bell Telephone Company successfully challenged two subsidiaries of the giant Western Union Telegraph Company for patent infringement The charges and accusations were especially painful to Bells Scottish integrity but the outcome of all the litigation which persisted throughout the life of his patents was that Bells claims were upheld as the first to conceive and apply the undulatory current In Bell married Mabel Hubbard years his junior The Bell story does not end with the invention of the telephone indeed in many ways it was a beginning A resident of Washington DC Bell continued his experiments in communication which culminated in the invention of the photophonetransmission of sound on a beam of light in medical research and in techniques for teaching speech to the deaf In France honoured Bell with the Volta Prize and the francs roughly equivalent to US financed the Volta Laboratory where in association with Charles Sumner Tainter and his cousin Chichester A Bell Bell invented the Graphophone Employing an engraving stylus controllable speeds and wax cylinders and disks the Graphophone presented a practical approach to sound recording Bells share of the royalties financed the Volta Bureau and the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf since the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf May was one of Bells happiest days his yearold prodigy Helen Keller participated in the groundbreaking ceremonies for the new Volta Bureau buildingtoday an international information centre relating to the oral education of the deaf In Bell acquired land on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia There in surroundings reminiscent of his early years in Scotland he established a summer home Beinn Bhreagh complete with research laboratories In Bell succeeded his fatherinlaw as president of the National Geographic Society Convinced that geography could be taught through pictures he sought to promote an understanding of life in distant lands in an age when travel was limited to a privileged few Again he found the proper hands Gilbert Grosvenor his future soninlaw who transformed a modest pamphlet into a unique educational journal reaching millions throughout the world As interest in the possibility of flight increased after the turn of the century he experimented with giant mancarrying kites Characteristically Bell again found a group of four willing young enthusiasts to execute his theories Always an inspiration Mabel Hubbard Bell wishing to maintain the stimulating influence of the group soon founded the Aerial Experiment Association the first research organization established and endowed by a woman Deafness was no handicap to the wife of Professor Bell At Beinn Bhreagh Bell entered new subjects of investigation such as sonar detection solar distillation the tetrahedron as a structural unit and hydrofoil craft one of which weighed more than pounds and attained a speed record of miles per hour in Apart from his lifelong association with the cause of the deaf Bell never lingered on one project His research interests centred on basic principles rather than on refinements The most cursory examination of his many notebooks shows marginal memos and jottings often totally unrelated to the subject at handreminders of questions and ideas he wanted to investigate It was impossible for him to carry each of his creative ideas through to a practical end Many of his conceptions are only today seeing fruition indeed some undoubtedly have yet to be developed The range of his inventive genius is represented only in part by the patents granted in his name alone and the he shared with his collaborators These included for the telephone and telegraph for the photophone for the phonograph for aerial vehicles for hydroairplanes and for a selenium cell Until a few days before his death Bell continued to make entries in his journal During his last dictation he was reassured with Dont hurry to which he replied I have to

by Elton John and Kiki Dee Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to watch all the time I LOVE that song Anyway I had already started a reply to your previous email so Ill just send it along with this one I love you madly and dearly Youre the only one whos managed to say anything of worth about this whole incidence Amber and Molly stared at me blankly and said something like Dont be so overly dramatic and then rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to hang out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend and blah blah blah It was really disappointing that they didnt understand the importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men It was so not fun But I was really proud of myself because I left work fuming on the verge of tears and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with Amber and Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before Then Molly and I took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food brought it home and watched the Thursday night lineup All in all it was a very successful evening WITHOUT runner man whose name by the way is Dave Take one point off for that And guess what He ended up calling at about Molly was on the other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a message so awhile later when I got a call from Jill Daves friends girlfriend who Im also friends with this all gets very complicated I was very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with us I just assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave and made up some sweet excuse about how I had just eaten and was too full to move because I was like no way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up NO WAY So that was thator so I thought At about pm runner man himself calls and basically admits that hes psycho for cancelling our date and then calling me all night long Ya think Anyway he tells me he was in this enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride and didnt want me to see him in such a bad state I still thought it was a lame excuse and that once youd reached the ripe age of you should be smart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone So I told him that and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and my roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn which he had started the other night when he was over to make it up to me I told him if he did that he might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is where he is now thats finance lingo Anyway the plan is hes going to come over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like people who we somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight although I dont remember doing that Anna you have to stay with me one night when youre home in June because its a constant riot I wont go into some of the things Amber did the other night right now but Ill tell you soon so you can swap stories when you see her By the way she snagged an armload of my clothes actually most of which were yours to wear at fancy dinners in Denver so if you see anything you want back just let her know I think its just that red Laundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt Hey guess what I have to go Ill call you tonight Take care kate Anna Symes on AM To cc Subject RE That sucks Kate I bet that isnt the last well be seeing of Mr Running Man though First of all who gets scared off by drunk roommates If anything it should be a relief to him that he doesnt need to impress any of your clan Second it sounds like the classic insecure blowoff to me If you think back youll probably remember a couple of instances in which your demeanorcommentsfacial expression may have sent him the message that he is the stupidest thing on Gods green earth I know this because I have the same habit So he probably went home mulled over those few devastating instances and came to the conclusion that youre not that into it And being a man only men and Symess do this he cancelled on you before you had the chance to crush his ego once again Am I right I think so Tentatively planning on going out with Amber and Monica on Saturday night Im mad that Im hanging out with your roommate before I get to hang out with you Monica and I are thinking of splitting your ticket since we know youll never save the money like I should talk You have to come out here though Its about degrees right now and its in the morning on a day in March I cant believe how happy this sun makes me You would love it too Okay feel better and dont sweat the stupid running guy If he thinks hes not worthy of you chances are hes not A stiff margarita will make this whole problem a lot more manageable dont you think You should go have one Love you Luego Anna Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday March PM To Subject Re Well to tell you the truth it sucks right now Work has been snowballing with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems so many that Ive basically forgotten what they all are now And on top of that runner guy stopped by last night and it happened to be the last day of Ambers finals so she and Molly had been drinking since pm Well Im not quite sure if that scared him away but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight he asked me I accepted we had a time picked out now I NEVER make plans as a rule but this was a goddamn plan So he calls minutes ago and actually CANCELS Not even just that he doesnt give a REASON I am so livid right now theres smoke coming out of my ears I need to go finish work so I can get out of here and go bomb his car Ill call you tonight Kate Anna Symes on PM To Kate Symes Email cc Subject hey poopstain Whats up I am sooooo good Dad and my car will be here on Monday isnt that great I just want to drive for the rest of my life So I get three days off next week plus Im leaving for my outward bound course next friday So basically I have like a week vacation Things are still going with the cute waiter Nathan but Ive discovered a flaw It was only a matter of time you know Actually its a nonfatal flaw its annoying at worst Basically he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and talks on it in all types of situations such as the video store a taxi cab and while eating dinner with his friends I just cant stand those things Its one thing to chat on it when youre walking down the street by yourself or in your car by yourself but when youre with other people or in the checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you I just think its so rude But Im going to try to get over it because otherwise hes great and I seem to be the only person on Gods green earth who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze So thats my life whats going on in yours love anna

ENRON PM Sent by Ken Lay and Jeff NRON To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject California Energy Crisis Californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

heels for some cowboy dude evan introduced her to theyve been attached at the hips literally for the last three weeks and amber spends about four quality hours a day on the phone with marky then cries when she has to hang up seriously but your romance sounds much more interesting you absolutely have to keep me posted on how it unfolds and whats the guys name anyway you know whats weird is that last night after my haircut i met up with molly and her man for dinner we decided to check out the brazen bean this little swanky cigar bar across the street from the blue moon on st we heard they had a martini happy hour and we felt like pretending we were sophisticated so were walking into the place when molly suddenly remembers that she knows the people who live upstairs its in one of those old rambling victorian houses so she runs upstairs to say hi and then comes back down with them it turns out to be blake and jill this really sweet couple ive met before friends of friends you know how it goes anyway we all end up staying longer than we should and having more martinis than we planned on and then blake remembers his friend dave was coming over to watch a movie so he runs upstairs to meet dave and brings him back down well dave happens to be amazingly cute and have amazingly great legs he had just come from the gym and was amazingly good about sitting in this dimly lit velvetcouched candlelit shishi joint in shorts and a sweatshirt so dave molly tells me as she begins to put the hard sell on IMMEDIATELY ive noticed as i get older and stay single that many of my friends feel the need to try vehemently to get me coupled plays the guitar amazingly and has an amazing voice i find out over the course of the evening that he also reads A LOT and is interested in irish literature and quantum physics well who isnt yknow he also likes to sail and this is really quite scary LASER SAILBOATS yep ive officially met my father in a younger form barf anyway he and blake and i all had a jolly time talking about books and parents and that show blind date it was all very intellectual i assure you what was weirder still was that every time i said something dave looked at blake and kind of laughed and every time i was like stop your laughing or ill beat you senseless and he was like no im just laughing because we were just talking about that the other day or because ive done that or because im doing that next week i said i wanted to start a book club apparently he suggested that to blake two days ago i said i lived in italy and wanted to go back hes going there in two months oh and then theres our common love of running okay im rambling so ill get to the point which is that in my single and cynical state i didnt think much of the poor guy last night but today ive noticed im increasingly interested and ill admit maybe even attracted so as we were leaving i kind of waved goodbye and said see ya around because you always do in an incestuous vat such as portland and went on my merry way with molly and josh which im sure they were happy about since they practically tried to push me into daves car and run away dave got in his car and drove off then all of a sudden appeared in front of us as we were crossing the street to our car he had driven around the block and was now getting out of his car to give me his card which he handed to me under the pretense that we couldnt start a book club without each others contact information i already knew he worked at a running store whatever that is but when i turned the card over it had his name on it and the word owner underneath do you think that means hes the actual owner or is it one of those places like les schwab where they give all the employees stock options and call them employee owners im going to look into it now im probably making way too much of this because he was probably like yeah i need some more members for my book club but i definitely dont want to talk to this drinking smoking lump of unmolded flesh for any other reasonwhy would i the proprietor of a running store and owner of such amazing legs do a thing like date a girl who shudders at the thought of exercise and loses weight only when she ups her alcohol consumption to the point where she forgets to eat that would just be silly okay ive got to go get back to me with a detailed account of your evening such as the one i just sent you kate Anna Symes on AM To Kate Symes Email cc Subject Okay so my date was SO amazing This guy is SO cute SO nice SO smart wore pants that fit over his shoes wore an amazingly cute outfit in general knew a lot about wine took me to the cutest restaurant took me out for cocktails afterwards was a total gentleman etc Mark my words Kate I WILL MARRY THIS MAN I kid you not He is the most normal guy I have come across EVER Hes trying to get a job in graphic design so cute but he loves wine and has thought about working at a vineyard or owning a restaurant so cute Weve read all the same books He definitely has money somehow but he said he has a lot of student debts so at least he can see where Im coming from He was just interested enough but kind of aloof which is the only thing that ever keeps me interested Kate this is so weird Oh and he mentioned having a family twice like as in working at a restaurant isnt good for having a family HOW CUTE IS THAT I am in love

martyr in all of this is Big Kitty who still looks completely baffled when Kitty hurtles herself at him from behind doorways and such After she does that they generally both walk away from each other

shes giddy about this whole house move thing I hope it works out for the best I really think it will Im starting to feel really bad about leaving Kitty with her but Im in a weird situation with Ambers cat at our house already Part of me wants to just bring Kitty over and tell everyone to deal with it because its my house too but the other part of me doesnt want to deal with the bloodshed that will ensue between her and Ambers outmatched feline Oh well Im thinking about it The most excitement Ill be having this week is my haircut with Brett tonight I think I might also be purchasing a bedskirt a totally extraneous and disappointing expense that I would never have had if I hadnt insisted on getting a real house with a real bed and all that other crap that goes along with it and inevitably costs you money that you could have otherwise spent on beer And as the sands flow these are the days of our lives Im so impressed with your dating maneuvers I told Amber and Molly about it last night at dinner which we ate together around our new dining room table and they both said in unison Like sister like sister I guess I have some kind of reputation for ending up on dates with waiters go

RE Im so glad to hear everythings better at your house I totally want to come visit but my last two paycheck deposits have only raised the balance to so it may be awhile Im definitely coming in June

excited for Dad to visit not just because of the car but also because it will increase my quantity of social engagements by about Im a little worried about the effect its having on Mom who asked me when he was coming so she wouldnt run into him Like I would allow that to happen how stupid does she think I am But it sounds like shes pretty stoked about this house thing so Im excited for her I have a date with that waiter guy tonight but Im not really that excited because I am fat ugly and on the third day of my period Did I mention broke and carless I think I should just put off this whole dating thing until I increase MY net value to use Katespeak which is just ground zero for most people I am trying to pay off some debt Dad took care of most of it but I didnt have the heart to show him my Nordstrom account Its slowgoing though And car payments will not make it easy but seriously this city is so pedestrianunfriendly that I feel I have no choice I tried to go to my tennis lessons the other day and ended up walking along the shoulder of a highway for twenty minutes And every person in Denver feels the need to own a dog and allow it to bark menacingly at every passerby I am SO afraid of dogs after my brush with death in the form of a Doberman So I need a car and I dont care if it means weekly visits to the plasma donation center I actually met Markys ex the other night maybe dont mention to Amber I dont know why but the whole thing seems weird and I would rather stay out of it Anyway she is really cool She reminds me of my friend Jen Sturmer except less anorexic and depressed Speaking of have you been going out in Portland a lot I miss Veritable Quandary I havent found anything like that here yet Downtown has some cool bars but you have to pay plus an appendage

has gone out and landed herself a fullfledged boyfriend Anything to avoid getting a job Hes a natural healer and hes also had an experience with Jesus so this one should be REALLY interesting Amber and I had a few drinks last night and basically pretended like nothing happened its easier that way We both know theres no real friendship to salvage so keeping it strictly in the bars is the smartest thing to do And Anna dont think for a minute that my description of life in Portland is exciting or cultured or romantic cause its pretty much the polar opposite of all those things Ive been so tired this week that Ive been spouting out sentences like The red computer needs to climb my shoelaces and the people riding the dinosaurs are wrong Its definitely been interesting Im on my way to sushi with a few people right now but of course I can see my reflection in my forehead and my hair looks like a sad sad small animal Super Maybe Ill meet the man of my dreams Ill tell you Anna I know youve got scary clashing dresser man but sometimes from the single persons point of view that doesnt look so bad Hang in there and call me soon Love Kate Anna Symes on PM To cc Subject Hey buttface Wow it actually sounds like your roommate problems may be comparable to mine except that you probably dont fear for your life quite as much Who is paying for Amber to come to Denver It sounds like she might be a little out of her mind right now but at least shes not going back to Chris just yet So are you going to Seattle this weekend That sounds so fun I am so jealous parties dinners wine men You and I are NOT living the same life right now I am in the process of trying to break things off with the ugly dresser which was proving to be difficult until last night when I made the mistake of letting him come to a movie with Michelle and I Kate I was scared It was dark and I was surrounded by the two most psycho people I know Josh talked through the whole thing and laughed at inappropriate moments and tried to hold my hand at one point It was excruciating It made Michelle look almost normal Not much else going on Ill call you this weekend okay We need to dish Luego Anna Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday February AM To Subject Re Rockin in the Rockies bro So didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night I always knew the Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports theyre not battling with that ol Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean Well Im sorry I didnt get back to you yesterday work was hectic and I knew that if I started an email to you it would either be halfassed or Id never finish it Well Im going for the former now because I realized there would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of whats happening around here and all the while I wait more and more important nuggets get it of gossip are accumulating So its quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues mine could not be worse Amber took off for the library on Thursday night and came homefour days later After Molly and I had a mild freakout session on Friday which included calling everybody shes every known including Chris and the police we heard through the grapevine that Marky McCulloch of Neidermeyer cousin fame was in town from none other than Denver and the two were having a secret and JamesBondlike rendezvous at the beach Well that was all well and fine other than the fact that she DIDNT TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming party this weekend for the past month and she DIDNT TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and she moved kitty into the house but still hasnt told our landlords or paid the deposit oh and also SHE DIDNT TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING So many things were wrong and bizarre about that but none more than her attitude when she walked in the door Monday afternoon Lets just say I spared no lung muscles in telling her exactly what I thought about her selfish childish idiotic and most importantly psychotically selfimportant behavior She had the gall to defensively scream back that she didnt tell us BECAUSE SHE DIDNT WANT TO LIE Hmmmm Not only did she not want to lie how sweet but she couldnt have told us because Molly and I have suddenly developed an insatiable urge to spread fervent and widespread rumors about Ambers love trysts Now I KNOW theres nothing Id rather be doing Anyway enough of that She and I have reached an understanding that just because were roommates does not mean we have to be friends Weve never been good at that anyhow In other news we had an amazing housewarming party I really wish you could have been there Molly and I didnt know percent of the people there which is a good thing because it meant they were all interesting successful gracious and cute I think there were about four girls there you could tell who planned the party Sadly no love connections were made that evening but Ive decided thats my new MO keep em guessing My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in Seattle came down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing an article for Food Wine magazine Very interesting guy but potentially in the closet so Im keeping my distance But they invited me up to Seattle next weekend for a fivecourse meal and bottles of wine at some Microsoft dudes mansion Definitely sounds like my crowd Should I wear my dirty jeans or my clean jeans Ive got my eye on flights to Denver but right now its looking like the end of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash Amber on the other hand will be there five times before that because some psycho over there keeps buying her tickets Thats fair for ya Okay thats all I can do for now but call me tonight and well do the rumor mill justice Take care and hang in there well be booting a roommate soon if you feel like coming back to Portland Kate

<5196060.1075841911973.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kate.symes@enron.com,2001-04-20 15:23:00,Econ Homework nsf Kate Symes Student No The invention of the french fry would result in an increased demand for potatoes that is the demand curve for potatoes would shift outward This would result in an increase in price and a corresponding increase in supply As the supply curve comes up to meet the new higher demand curve we would actually see an increase in overall demand supply AND price The statement is wrong in assuming that increased supply equals a lower price a The value of one bottle of beer to me between points A and B is bottles of soda b I am therefore indifferent between bundles A and B because they both allow me the same frequency of use and same level of satisfaction c Bundle E must include about bottles of soda in order to make me indifferent between it and bundle D This follows from the logic that when I have bottles of soda it would take about more to make me give up one bottle of beer in the bundle Here I have bottles of soda I would need AT LEAST bottles of soda to make me give up one more beer in another bundle with the same frequency of use Firstly this legislation produces a disincentive for parents to travel with children on an airplane because it increases the already high costs associated with flying Add to this the somewhat more relaxed rules of the highway and you might find more families taking road trips on their next vacation This is a potential secondary effect of the legislation which could actually increase injuries and fatalities secondary because it would not be directly associated with injuries caused in airplane crashes but because it would incent people to find other possibly more dangerous modes of transportation Auto safety legislation puts constraints on auto makers to make cars as safe as possible while still maintaining a profit It also narrows consumers choice sets when buying a new car A person buying a car in a country with no auto safety legislation might make auto safety a priority in their decision In a country indoctrinated by Naders book the choice between whether to buy a safe or unsafe car is taken away all cars are made equally safe Because of this carbuyers have less incentive to drive safely and more leeway to choose their car for other reasons Soon safety in a car becomes a moot point and the car buyer is only concerned with a good price or other incentives Auto accidents increase because there is no longer an incentive to drive safely legislation has made cars in consumers minds indestructible If cars are indestructible so then are the people in them a My demand curve shows that I would purchase gallon of soda at a price just under So when I purchase gallons at a gallon I am better of by b I can purchase more gallons of Diet Coke when it is priced at a gallon than when its priced at Therefore Im better off by a gain of gallons times a decrease of divided by c If Diet Coke was free Id consume up to gallons of it before it wouldnt be worth it for me to consume anymore My consumer surplus is a A will sell chairs to B A can make chairs in the time it takes him to build table while B can only build in the time it takes him to build a table As chairtotable time ratio is greater than Bs to b A will buy tables from C C can make a table in only twice the amount of time it takes him to build a chair while A takes five times as long to build a table than a chair As tabletochair time ratio is greater than Cs to c B will do neither Since B can make chairs faster rate of for B to for C B wont buy chairs from C And because C can make tables faster rate of for C to for B B cant sell tables to C a The equilibrium price is P P P P The quantity is textbooks b The sticker price becomes P P P P P P The market quantity stays at textbooks c The sticker price becomes P P P P P Market quantity decreases marginally to textbooks d If the seller pays per book in taxes the seller charges and receives per book If the buyer pays per book in sales tax the buyer pays per book The costs are equal despite which party is paying the tax e The government collects tax times books in tax revenues for this set of terms a The equilibrium price is P P P The market quantity is b The sticker price becomes t Pt P t P t c The government takes in a tax revenue of t There are deadweight costs associated with this tax because the supply is more elastic than the demand for insulin Therefore consumers will bear more of the burden of the tax a Affects supply supply curve will increase

has gone out and landed herself a fullfledged boyfriend Anything to avoid getting a job Hes a natural healer and hes also had an experience with Jesus so this one should be REALLY interesting Amber and I had a few drinks last night and basically pretended like nothing happened its easier that way We both know theres no real friendship to salvage so keeping it strictly in the bars is the smartest thing to do And Anna dont think for a minute that my description of life in Portland is exciting or cultured or romantic cause its pretty much the polar opposite of all those things Ive been so tired this week that Ive been spouting out sentences like The red computer needs to climb my shoelaces and the people riding the dinosaurs are wrong Its definitely been interesting Im on my way to sushi with a few people right now but of course I can see my reflection in my forehead and my hair looks like a sad sad small animal Super Maybe Ill meet the man of my dreams Ill tell you Anna I know youve got scary clashing dresser man but sometimes from the single persons point of view that doesnt look so bad Hang in there and call me soon Love Kate Anna Symes on PM To cc Subject Hey buttface Wow it actually sounds like your roommate problems may be comparable to mine except that you probably dont fear for your life quite as much Who is paying for Amber to come to Denver It sounds like she might be a little out of her mind right now but at least shes not going back to Chris just yet So are you going to Seattle this weekend That sounds so fun I am so jealous parties dinners wine men You and I are NOT living the same life right now I am in the process of trying to break things off with the ugly dresser which was proving to be difficult until last night when I made the mistake of letting him come to a movie with Michelle and I Kate I was scared It was dark and I was surrounded by the two most psycho people I know Josh talked through the whole thing and laughed at inappropriate moments and tried to hold my hand at one point It was excruciating It made Michelle look almost normal Not much else going on Ill call you this weekend okay We need to dish Luego Anna Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday February AM To Subject Re Rockin in the Rockies bro So didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night I always knew the Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports theyre not battling with that ol Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean Well Im sorry I didnt get back to you yesterday work was hectic and I knew that if I started an email to you it would either be halfassed or Id never finish it Well Im going for the former now because I realized there would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of whats happening around here and all the while I wait more and more important nuggets get it of gossip are accumulating So its quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues mine could not be worse Amber took off for the library on Thursday night and came homefour days later After Molly and I had a mild freakout session on Friday which included calling everybody shes every known including Chris and the police we heard through the grapevine that Marky McCulloch of Neidermeyer cousin fame was in town from none other than Denver and the two were having a secret and JamesBondlike rendezvous at the beach Well that was all well and fine other than the fact that she DIDNT TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming party this weekend for the past month and she DIDNT TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and she moved kitty into the house but still hasnt told our landlords or paid the deposit oh and also SHE DIDNT TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING So many things were wrong and bizarre about that but none more than her attitude when she walked in the door Monday afternoon Lets just say I spared no lung muscles in telling her exactly what I thought about her selfish childish idiotic and most importantly psychotically selfimportant behavior She had the gall to defensively scream back that she didnt tell us BECAUSE SHE DIDNT WANT TO LIE Hmmmm Not only did she not want to lie how sweet but she couldnt have told us because Molly and I have suddenly developed an insatiable urge to spread fervent and widespread rumors about Ambers love trysts Now I KNOW theres nothing Id rather be doing Anyway enough of that She and I have reached an understanding that just because were roommates does not mean we have to be friends Weve never been good at that anyhow In other news we had an amazing housewarming party I really wish you could have been there Molly and I didnt know percent of the people there which is a good thing because it meant they were all interesting successful gracious and cute I think there were about four girls there you could tell who planned the party Sadly no love connections were made that evening but Ive decided thats my new MO keep em guessing My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in Seattle came down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing an article for Food Wine magazine Very interesting guy but potentially in the closet so Im keeping my distance But they invited me up to Seattle next weekend for a fivecourse meal and bottles of wine at some Microsoft dudes mansion Definitely sounds like my crowd Should I wear my dirty jeans or my clean jeans Ive got my eye on flights to Denver but right now its looking like the end of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash Amber on the other hand will be there five times before that because some psycho over there keeps buying her tickets Thats fair for ya Okay thats all I can do for now but call me tonight and well do the rumor mill justice Take care and hang in there well be booting a roommate soon if you feel like coming back to Portland Kate

youve been stuck in those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life It sounds like things are going really well though Rocky Mountain highs and that youve made it through most of the tumult of moving to a new place Rocky Mountain lows Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky her man of the hour he mentions how theyve got to get together with you when she comes to town which will be on next Friday whoo hoo party Im so mad that she gets to go and I dont being that I am not like her in my eighth year of college and therefore do not enjoy such things as Spring Break Mania anymore And Monica tells Marky who tells Amber who tells me that shed love to hang out with you more often It sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner eh So youve got options girlfriend which is worlds more than I can say for my life at the mo It pretty much consists of working eating and sleeping Im definitely looking into that SAD mental disorder thing because I think its got me in its clutches But the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life after winter Were doing lots of gardening cooking and decorating at the house its like having three Martha Stewarts all working together only slightly less stylish immensely less efficient and drunk Other than that Ive been trying to organize and simplify my life taking care of mounds of paperwork paying off debts sorting out all those nagging little postit notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain Im actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel like maybe I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months or even buy a SECOND pair of shoes but lets not get wild and crazy just yet So I heard Dad and Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile That is in the immortal words of the guys in Dude wheres my car SWEET DUDE You are stoked I bet thats a major load off just make sure to keep your finances in check and not get in over your head Take it from one who knows Im seriously looking into buying an old beater car but then I start fantasizing about the Audi A Quattro and suddenly doesnt seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool Lately Ive been doing a lot of research into selfimprovement measures I just applied for postbaccalaureate status at U of O so I can start taking economics and poli sci classes online I just got my new FREE computer from work Im also studying for the GRE and pretty soon here Im going to get serious about graduate school I think Ive decided on international studies andor economics depending on how well I like the classes I take Ive found my dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington DC Its a twoyear Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington and ends inare you sitting downBologna Italy Holy shit does it get more perfect Apparently its like the premiere training ground for government officials according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in my face when I told him I wanted to get into it But I figure Im not getting any younger and I dont want any regrets so Im goin for it dude As for the love life its nonexistant which is why Im putting so much energy into the selfimprovement area of my life I figure as long as Im having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value By the time they come around again the eligible pool will have shrunk to in million Whatever Anyway now that Ive written you the longest paragraph of my life I must retreat to my work duties Then its off for a thrilling tour of Portland via TriMet Mollys making me dinner tonight in exchange for a finished resume Its only taken her years to compile the information for it so this one should be a doozy Hey if you can ever make it home for a weekend you should come at the end of May David Gray is coming to the Schnitzer and its going to be fabulous Ill buy your concert ticket if you can convince Dad to get your plane ticket Call me

my pregrad school work I figured out Im going to essentially have to get a second bachelors degree before going to grad school But hey its all about the credentials man as in being able to tell people at my year high school reunion that I have two bachelors degrees a masters and a Rhodes Scholarship to study Italian wine in a th century villa surrounded by buff tan and unusually goodlooking farm workersTres important So yeah maybe well hold off on the visit for now I think its more important for us both to feel mentally stable about our finances for right now then we party I could maybe make it out there in April overlap with moms trip I dont think I could handle the whole thing with her Ill keep it in mind And yeah shes giddy about this whole house move thing I hope it works out for the best I really think it will Im starting to feel really bad about leaving Kitty with her but Im in a weird situation with Ambers cat at our house already Part of me wants to just bring Kitty over and tell everyone to deal with it because its my house too but the other part of me doesnt want to deal with the bloodshed that will ensue between her and Ambers outmatched feline Oh well Im thinking about it The most excitement Ill be having this week is my haircut with Brett tonight I think I might also be purchasing a bedskirt a totally extraneous and disappointing expense that I would never have had if I hadnt insisted on getting a real house with a real bed and all that other crap that goes along with it and inevitably costs you money that you could have otherwise spent on beer And as the sands flow these are the days of our lives Im so impressed with your dating maneuvers I told Amber and Molly about it last night at dinner which we ate together around our new dining room table and they both said in unison Like sister like sister I guess I have some kind of reputation for ending up on dates with waiters go figure Anyway its time for me to go find something to eat and then come back to my desk and consume it while it flows directly to my butt Cant wait Write back soon Kate Anna Symes on AM To cc Subject RE Im so glad to hear everythings better at your house I totally want to come visit but my last two paycheck deposits have only raised the balance to so it may be awhile Im definitely coming in June when I take a zero week class in Eugene Moms supposedly coming out here in April and we might go to Glenwood Springs hot springs spa MASSAGES You should come too Fun female family bonding time I am so excited for Dad to visit not just because of the car but also because it will increase my quantity of social engagements by about Im a little worried about the effect its having on Mom who asked me when he was coming so she wouldnt run into him Like I would allow that to happen how stupid does she think I am But it sounds like shes pretty stoked about this house thing so Im excited for her I have a date with that waiter guy tonight but Im not really that excited because I am fat ugly and on the third day of my period Did I mention broke and carless I think I should just put off this whole dating thing until I increase MY net value to use Katespeak which is just ground zero for most people I am trying to pay off some debt Dad took care of most of it but I didnt have the heart to show him my Nordstrom account Its slowgoing though And car payments will not make it easy but seriously this city is so pedestrianunfriendly that I feel I have no choice I tried to go to my tennis lessons the other day and ended up walking along the shoulder of a highway for twenty minutes And every person in Denver feels the need to own a dog and allow it to bark menacingly at every passerby I am SO afraid of dogs after my brush with death in the form of a Doberman So I need a car and I dont care if it means weekly visits to the plasma donation center I actually met Markys ex the other night maybe dont mention to Amber I dont know why but the whole thing seems weird and I would rather stay out of it Anyway she is really cool She reminds me of my friend Jen Sturmer except less anorexic and depressed Speaking of have you been going out in Portland a lot I miss Veritable Quandary I havent found anything like that here yet Downtown has some cool bars but you have to pay plus an appendage to park and cabs are not cheap either My neighborhood has some good dives like the one on our corner that has a flickering neon sign outside announcing Dons Mixed Drinks not sure but think thats the name of the bar I went in once and met Don the king of multiple body piercings here in Denver Okay Im rambling Time to get back to work which is so good lately by the way I get to start grantwriting this month Hope alls well for you Ill give you the dirt

and that youve made it through most of the tumult of moving to a new place Rocky Mountain lows Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky her man of the hour he mentions how theyve got to get together with you when she comes to town which will be on next Friday whoo hoo party Im so mad that she gets to go and I dont being that I am not like her in my eighth year of college and therefore do

thing because I think its got me in its clutches But the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life after winter Were doing lots of gardening cooking and decorating at the house its like having three Martha Stewarts all working together only slightly less stylish immensely less efficient and drunk Other than that Ive been trying to organize and simplify my life taking care of mounds of paperwork paying off debts sorting out all those nagging little postit notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain Im actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel like maybe I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months or even buy a SECOND pair of shoes but lets not get wild and crazy just yet So I heard

students and I figured out there were three siblings in my class I might actually consider that a little bizarre like a circus family or something But whatever Im definitely into it though that is if UO has decided to forgive my errant freshman year behavior that got me booted from those luxurious residance halls and readmit me Theyre probably looking over my application right now and just pissing themselves Wait a minute that goodfornothing druggy thinks shes going to GRADUATE SCHOOLHAHAHAHAHAHA and so on And by the way I didnt mean to throw you into a fit of Catholic guilt over the kitty thing Shes totally fine and mom actually likes her I think my presence actually upsets the balance And I think this move might be good for her shell be going back to her apartment roots The real martyr in all of this is Big Kitty who still looks completely baffled when Kitty hurtles herself at him from behind doorways and such After she does that they generally both walk away from each other just looking completely dissatisfied with the whole thing Big Kitty because hes old and demented and everything confuses him and Kitty because shes young and demented and everything pisses her off Gotta love it So you look like Jennifer now Hey dont underestimate the onetime popularity of that haircut Everything comes back into fashion at some point I will tell Brett you said hi His wife just had her baby they are such a freaking cute little family it makes me depressed Even more than I already am from having to sit around my house all the time and listen to Amber and Molly call their respective boyfriends schmoopy and swap sex stories Its thoroughly disgusting and Ive told them so They just throw their heads back and laugh with selfsatisfied coupleinduced mania And there you have my happy little family Have fun on your date tonight Just go into it like you have nothing to lose which you dont and like you dont care which you shouldnt Kay Love ya Kate Anna Symes on PM To cc Subject RE Zero week is a oneweek fourcredit course in June at U of O Im trying to get John to do it too Maybe we should all take one together Anyway the website is uosummeruoregonedu no www but unfortunately none of the info is posted yet because theyre all a bunch of lazy potsmoking superfreaks over there in Eugene Usually you can choose from any general ed courses Im taking polisci because I need it for my major Theyll have journalism and stuff like that We could crash at Johns house and party till the wee hours with all the wee freshmen I feel bad about Kitty too Is she getting more nuts than ever I would love to bring her out here if it wasnt for the obvious obstacles she could never go outside she would rip my face off on the ride over etc If she is still doing bad next year when my lease runs out we could consider bringing her out here I could move into a house Anyway Im sorry to hear about the whole thing I feel really guilty too Hopefully Mom is available for the five minutes a day that Kitty actually wants contact with humans Well have fun getting your hair cut and tell Brett I said hi I got my hair cut here and the man confused me with Jennifer Aniston circa I look like a freak and my hair is oily and I dont want to go on this date Have a good night Anna Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday March PM To Subject RE Hey what the heck is zero week I might be interested in signing up for that pack in some quick credits for my pregrad school work I figured out Im going to essentially have to get a second bachelors degree before going to grad school But hey its all about the credentials man as in being able to tell people at my year high school reunion that I have two bachelors degrees a masters and a Rhodes Scholarship to study Italian wine in a th century villa surrounded by buff tan and unusually goodlooking farm workersTres important So yeah maybe well hold off on the visit for now I think its more important for us both to feel mentally stable about our finances for right now then we party I could maybe make it out there in April overlap with moms trip I dont think I could handle the whole thing with her Ill keep it in mind And yeah shes giddy about this whole house move thing I hope it works out for the best I really think it will Im starting to feel really bad about leaving Kitty with her but Im in a weird situation with Ambers cat at our house already Part of me wants to just bring Kitty over and tell everyone to deal with it because its my house too but the other part of me doesnt want to deal with the bloodshed that will ensue between her and Ambers outmatched feline Oh well Im thinking about it The most excitement Ill be having this week is my haircut with Brett tonight I think I might also be purchasing a bedskirt a totally extraneous and disappointing expense that I would never have had if I hadnt insisted on getting a real house with a real bed and all that other crap that goes along with it and inevitably costs you money that you could have otherwise spent on beer And as the sands flow these are the days of our lives Im so impressed with your dating maneuvers I told Amber and Molly about it last night at dinner which we ate together around our new dining room table and they both said in unison Like sister like sister I guess I have some kind of reputation for ending up on dates with waiters go figure Anyway its time for me to go find something to eat and then come back to my desk and consume it while it flows directly to my butt Cant wait Write back soon Kate Anna Symes on AM To cc Subject

heels for some cowboy dude evan introduced her to theyve been attached at the hips literally for the last three weeks and amber spends about four quality hours a day on the phone with marky then cries when she has to hang up seriously but your romance sounds much more interesting you absolutely have to keep me posted on how it unfolds and whats the guys name anyway you know whats weird is that last night after my haircut i met up with molly and her man for dinner we decided to check out the brazen bean this little swanky cigar bar across the street from the blue moon on st we heard they had a martini happy hour and we felt like pretending we were sophisticated so were walking into the place when molly suddenly remembers that she knows the people who live upstairs its in one of those old rambling victorian houses so she runs upstairs to say hi and then comes back down with them it turns out to be blake and jill this really sweet couple ive met before friends of friends you know how it goes anyway we all end up staying longer than we should and having more martinis than we planned on and then blake remembers his friend dave was coming over to watch a movie so he runs upstairs to meet dave and brings him back down well dave happens to be amazingly cute and have amazingly great legs he had just come from the gym and was amazingly good about sitting in this dimly lit velvetcouched candlelit shishi joint in shorts and a sweatshirt so dave molly tells me as she begins to put the hard sell on IMMEDIATELY ive noticed as i get older and stay single that many of my friends feel the need to try vehemently to get me coupled plays the guitar amazingly and has an amazing voice i find out over the course of the evening that he also reads A LOT and is interested in irish literature and quantum physics well who isnt yknow he also likes to sail and this is really quite scary LASER SAILBOATS yep ive officially met my father in a younger form barf anyway he and blake and i all had a jolly time talking about books and parents and that show blind date it was all very intellectual i assure you what was weirder still was that every time i said something dave looked at blake and kind of laughed and every time i was like stop your laughing or ill beat you senseless and he was like no im just laughing because we were just talking about that the other day or because ive done that or because im doing that next week i said i wanted to start a book club apparently he suggested that to blake two days ago i said i lived in italy and wanted to go back hes going there in two months oh and then theres our common love of running okay im rambling so ill get to the point which is that in my single and cynical state i didnt think much of the poor guy last night but today ive noticed im increasingly interested and ill admit maybe even attracted so as we were leaving i kind of waved goodbye and said see ya around because you always do in an incestuous vat such as portland and went on my merry way with molly and josh which im sure they were happy about since they practically tried to push me into daves car and run away dave got in his car and drove off then all of a sudden appeared in front of us as we were crossing the street to our car he had driven around the block and was now getting out of his car to give me his card which he handed to me under the pretense that we couldnt start a book club without each others contact information i already knew he worked at a running store whatever that is but when i turned the card over it had his name on it and the word owner underneath do you think that means hes the actual owner or is it one of those places like les schwab where they give all the employees stock options and call them employee owners im going to look into it now im probably making way too much of this because he was probably like yeah i need some more members for my book club but i definitely dont want to talk to this drinking smoking lump of unmolded flesh for any other reasonwhy would i the proprietor of a running store and owner of such amazing legs do a thing like date a girl who shudders at the thought of exercise and loses weight only when she ups her alcohol consumption to the point where she forgets to eat that would just be silly okay ive got to go get back to me with a detailed account of your evening such as the one i just sent you kate Anna Symes on AM To Kate Symes Email cc Subject Okay so my date was SO amazing This guy is SO cute SO nice SO smart wore pants that fit over his shoes wore an amazingly cute outfit in general knew a lot about wine took me to the cutest restaurant took me out for cocktails afterwards was a total gentleman etc Mark my words Kate I WILL MARRY THIS MAN I kid you not He is the most normal guy I have come across EVER Hes trying to get a job in graphic design so cute but he loves wine and has thought about working at a vineyard or owning a restaurant so cute Weve read all the same books He definitely has money somehow but he said he has a lot of student debts so at least he can see where Im coming from He was just interested enough but kind of aloof which is the only thing that ever keeps me interested Kate this is so weird Oh and he mentioned having a family twice like as in working at a restaurant isnt good for having a family HOW CUTE IS THAT I am in love Just thought Id let you know love anna

ENRON PM Sent by Ken Lay and Jeff NRON To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject California Energy Crisis Californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

<3121126.1075841683617.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kate.symes@enron.com,2001-03-23 09:09:00,REnsf Anna Youre stoked on the song thing Youll never guess how cool mine is though Its Dont go breakin my heart by Elton John and Kiki Dee Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to watch all the time I LOVE that song Anyway I had already started a reply to your previous email so Ill just send it along with this one I love you madly and dearly Youre the only one whos managed to say anything of worth about this whole incidence Amber and Molly stared at me blankly and said something like Dont be so overly dramatic and then rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to hang out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend and blah blah blah It was really disappointing that they didnt understand the importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men It was so not fun But I was really proud of myself because I left work fuming on the verge of tears and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with Amber and Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before Then Molly and I took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food brought it home and watched the Thursday night lineup All in all it was a very successful evening WITHOUT runner man whose name by the way is Dave Take one point off for that And guess what He ended up calling at about Molly was on the other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a message so awhile later when I got a call from Jill Daves friends girlfriend who Im also friends with this all gets very complicated I was very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with us I just assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave and made up some sweet excuse about how I had just eaten and was too full to move because I was like no way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up NO WAY So that was thator so I thought At about pm runner man himself calls and basically admits that hes psycho for cancelling our date and then calling me all night long Ya think Anyway he tells me he was in this enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride and didnt want me to see him in such a bad state I still thought it was a lame excuse and that once youd reached the ripe age of you should be smart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone So I told him that and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and my roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn which he had started the other night when he was over to make it up to me I told him if he did that he might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is where he is now thats finance lingo Anyway the plan is hes going to come over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like people who we somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight although I dont remember doing that Anna you have to stay with me one night when youre home in June because its a constant riot I wont go into some of the things Amber did the other night right now but Ill tell you soon so you can swap stories when you see her By the way she snagged an armload of my clothes actually most of which were yours to wear at fancy dinners in Denver so if you see anything you want back just let her know I think its just that red Laundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt Hey guess what I have to go Ill call you tonight Take care kate Anna Symes on AM To cc Subject RE That sucks Kate I bet that isnt the last well be seeing of Mr Running Man though First of all who gets scared off by drunk roommates If anything it should be a relief to him that he doesnt need to impress any of your clan Second it sounds like the classic insecure blowoff to me If you think back youll probably remember a couple of instances in which your demeanorcommentsfacial expression may have sent him the message that he is the stupidest thing on Gods green earth I know this because I have the same habit So he probably went home mulled over those few devastating instances and came to the conclusion that youre not that into it And being a man only men and Symess do this he cancelled on you before you had the chance to crush his ego once again Am I right I think so Tentatively planning on going out with Amber and Monica on Saturday night Im mad that Im hanging out with your roommate before I get to hang out with you Monica and I are thinking of splitting your ticket since we know youll never save the money like I should talk You have to come out here though Its about degrees right now and its in the morning on a day in March I cant believe how happy this sun makes me You would love it too Okay feel better and dont sweat the stupid running guy If he thinks hes not worthy of you chances are hes not A stiff margarita will make this whole problem a lot more manageable dont you think You should go have one Love you Luego Anna Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday March PM To Subject Re Well to tell you the truth it sucks right now Work has been snowballing with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems so many that Ive basically forgotten what they all are now And on top of that runner guy stopped by last night and it happened to be the last day of Ambers finals so she and Molly had been drinking since pm Well Im not quite sure if that scared him away but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight he asked me I accepted we had a time picked out now I NEVER make plans as a rule but this was a goddamn plan So he calls minutes ago and actually CANCELS Not even just that he doesnt give a REASON I am so livid right now theres smoke coming out of my ears I need to go finish work so I can get out of here and go bomb his car Ill call you tonight Kate Anna Symes on PM To Kate Symes Email cc Subject hey poopstain Whats up I am sooooo good Dad and my car will be here on Monday isnt that great I just want to drive for the rest of my life So I get three days off next week plus Im leaving for my outward bound course next friday So basically I have like a week vacation Things are still going with the cute waiter Nathan but Ive discovered a flaw It was only a matter of time you know Actually its a nonfatal flaw its annoying at worst Basically he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and talks on it in all types of situations such as the video store a taxi cab and while eating dinner with his friends I just cant stand those things Its one thing to chat on it when youre walking down the street by yourself or in your car by yourself but when youre with other people or in the checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you I just think its so rude But Im going to try to get over it because otherwise hes great and I seem to be the only person on Gods green earth who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze So thats my life whats going on in yours love anna

<9841462.1075841702295.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kate.symes@enron.com,2001-04-20 15:23:00,Econ Homework nsf Kate Symes Student No The invention of the french fry would result in an increased demand for potatoes that is the demand curve for potatoes would shift outward This would result in an increase in price and a corresponding increase in supply As the supply curve comes up to meet the new higher demand curve we would actually see an increase in overall demand supply AND price The statement is wrong in assuming that increased supply equals a lower price a The value of one bottle of beer to me between points A and B is bottles of soda b I am therefore indifferent between bundles A and B because they both allow me the same frequency of use and same level of satisfaction c Bundle E must include about bottles of soda in order to make me indifferent between it and bundle D This follows from the logic that when I have bottles of soda it would take about more to make me give up one bottle of beer in the bundle Here I have bottles of soda I would need AT LEAST bottles of soda to make me give up one more beer in another bundle with the same frequency of use Firstly this legislation produces a disincentive for parents to travel with children on an airplane because it increases the already high costs associated with flying Add to this the somewhat more relaxed rules of the highway and you might find more families taking road trips on their next vacation This is a potential secondary effect of the legislation which could actually increase injuries and fatalities secondary because it would not be directly associated with injuries caused in airplane crashes but because it would incent people to find other possibly more dangerous modes of transportation Auto safety legislation puts constraints on auto makers to make cars as safe as possible while still maintaining a profit It also narrows consumers choice sets when buying a new car A person buying a car in a country with no auto safety legislation might make auto safety a priority in their decision In a country indoctrinated by Naders book the choice between whether to buy a safe or unsafe car is taken away all cars are made equally safe Because of this carbuyers have less incentive to drive safely and more leeway to choose their car for other reasons Soon safety in a car becomes a moot point and the car buyer is only concerned with a good price or other incentives Auto accidents increase because there is no longer an incentive to drive safely legislation has made cars in consumers minds indestructible If cars are indestructible so then are the people in them a My demand curve shows that I would purchase gallon of soda at a price just under So when I purchase gallons at a gallon I am better of by b I can purchase more gallons of Diet Coke when it is priced at a gallon than when its priced at Therefore Im better off by a gain of gallons times a decrease of divided by c If Diet Coke was free Id consume up to gallons of it before it wouldnt be worth it for me to consume anymore My consumer surplus is a A will sell chairs to B A can make chairs in the time it takes him to build table while B can only build in the time it takes him to build a table As chairtotable time ratio is greater than Bs to b A will buy tables from C C can make a table in only twice the amount of time it takes him to build a chair while A takes five times as long to build a table than a chair As tabletochair time ratio is greater than Cs to c B will do neither Since B can make chairs faster rate of for B to for C B wont buy chairs from C And because C can make tables faster rate of for C to for B B cant sell tables to C a The equilibrium price is P P P P The quantity is textbooks b The sticker price becomes P P P P P P The market quantity stays at textbooks c The sticker price becomes P P P P P Market quantity decreases marginally to textbooks d If the seller pays per book in taxes the seller charges and receives per book If the buyer pays per book in sales tax the buyer pays per book The costs are equal despite which party is paying the tax e The government collects tax times books in tax revenues for this set of terms a The equilibrium price is P P P The market quantity is b The sticker price becomes t Pt P t P t c The government takes in a tax revenue of t There are deadweight costs associated with this tax because the supply is more elastic than the demand for insulin Therefore consumers will bear more of the burden of the tax a Affects supply supply curve will increase

working on the malfunctioning phone circuit We dont know when the service will be reinstated but in the meantime you can reflect on what life was like before the darn thing was invented Bell Alexander Graham b March Edinburgh d Aug Beinn Bhreagh Cape Breton Island Nova Scotia Can Scottishborn American audiologist best known as the inventor of the telephone For two generations his family had been recognized as leading authorities in elocution and speech correction with Alexander Melville Bells Standard Elocutionist passing through nearly editions in English Young Bell and his two brothers were trained to continue the family profession His early achievements on behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before his th birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training Alexander Graham was not added until he was was the second of the three sons of Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds Bell Apart from one year at a private school two years at Edinburghs Royal High School from which he was graduated at and attendance at a few lectures at Edinburgh University and at University College in London Bell was largely family trained and selftaught His first professional post was at Mr Skinners school in Elgin County Moray where he instructed the children in both music and elocution In he became a resident master in Elgins Weston House Academy where he conducted his first studies in sound Appropriately Bell had begun professionally as he would continue through lifeas a teacherscientist In he became his fathers assistant in London and assumed full charge while the senior Bell lectured in America The shock of the sudden death of his older brother from tuberculosis which had also struck down his younger brother and the strain of his professional duties soon took their toll on young Bell Concern for their only surviving son prompted the familys move to Canada in August where after settling near Brantford Ont Bells health rapidly improved In Bell spent several weeks in Boston lecturing and demonstrating the system of his fathers Visible Speech published in as a means of teaching speech to the deaf Each phonetic symbol indicated a definite position of the organs of speech such as lips tongue and soft palate and could be used by the deaf to imitate the sounds of speech in the usual way Young A Graham Bell as he now preferred to be known showed using his fathers system that speech could be taught to the deaf His astounding results soon led to further invitations to lecture Even while vacationing at his parents home Bell continued his experiments with sound In he opened his own school in Boston for training teachers of the deaf edited his pamphlet Visible Speech Pioneer and continued to study and tutor in he became professor of vocal physiology at Boston University Never adept with his hands Bell had the good fortune to discover and inspire Thomas Watson a young repair mechanic and model maker who assisted him enthusiastically in devising an apparatus for transmitting sound by electricity Their long nightly sessions began to produce tangible results The fathers of George Sanders and Mabel Hubbard two deaf students whom he helped were sufficiently impressed with the young teacher to assist him financially in his scientific pursuits Nevertheless during normal working hours Bell and Watson were still obliged to fulfill a busy schedule of professional demands It is scarcely surprising that Bells health again suffered On April he was granted the patent for his multiple telegraph but after another exhausting six months of long nightly sessions in the workshop while maintaining his daily professional schedule Bell had to return to his parents home in Canada to recuperate In September he began to write the specifications for the telephone On March the United States Patent Office granted to Bell Patent Number covering The method of and apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically by causing electrical undulations similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds Within a year followed the commercial application and a few months later the first of hundreds of legal suits Ironically the telephoneuntil then all too often regarded as a joke and its creatorprophet as at best an eccentricwas the subject of the most involved patent litigation in history The two most celebrated of the early actions were the Dowd and Drawbaugh cases wherein the fledgling Bell Telephone Company successfully challenged two subsidiaries of the giant Western Union Telegraph Company for patent infringement The charges and accusations were especially painful to Bells Scottish integrity but the outcome of all the litigation which persisted throughout the life of his patents was that Bells claims were upheld as the first to conceive and apply the undulatory current In Bell married Mabel Hubbard years his junior The Bell story does not end with the invention of the telephone indeed in many ways it was a beginning A resident of Washington DC Bell continued his experiments in communication which culminated in the invention of the photophonetransmission of sound on a beam of light in medical research and in techniques for teaching speech to the deaf In France honoured Bell with the Volta Prize and the francs roughly equivalent to US financed the Volta Laboratory where in association with Charles Sumner Tainter and his cousin Chichester A Bell Bell invented the Graphophone Employing an engraving stylus controllable speeds and wax cylinders and disks the Graphophone presented a practical approach to sound recording Bells share of the royalties financed the Volta Bureau and the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf since the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf May was one of Bells happiest days his yearold prodigy Helen Keller participated in the groundbreaking ceremonies for the new Volta Bureau buildingtoday an international information centre relating to the oral education of the deaf In Bell acquired land on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia There in surroundings reminiscent of his early years in Scotland he established a summer home Beinn Bhreagh complete with research laboratories In Bell succeeded his fatherinlaw as president of the National Geographic Society Convinced that geography could be taught through pictures he sought to promote an understanding of life in distant lands in an age when travel was limited to a privileged few Again he found the proper hands Gilbert Grosvenor his future soninlaw who transformed a modest pamphlet into a unique educational journal reaching millions throughout the world As interest in the possibility of flight increased after the turn of the century he experimented with giant mancarrying kites Characteristically Bell again found a group of four willing young enthusiasts to execute his theories Always an inspiration Mabel Hubbard Bell wishing to maintain the stimulating influence of the group soon founded the Aerial Experiment Association the first research organization established and endowed by a woman Deafness was no handicap to the wife of Professor Bell At Beinn Bhreagh Bell entered new subjects of investigation such as sonar detection solar distillation the tetrahedron as a structural unit and hydrofoil craft one of which weighed more than pounds and attained a speed record of miles per hour in Apart from his lifelong association with the cause of the deaf Bell never lingered on one project His research interests centred on basic principles rather than on refinements The most cursory examination of his many notebooks shows marginal memos and jottings often totally unrelated to the subject at handreminders of questions and ideas he wanted to investigate It was impossible for him to carry each of his creative ideas through to a practical end Many of his conceptions are only today seeing fruition indeed some undoubtedly have yet to be developed The range of his inventive genius is represented only in part by the patents granted in his name alone and the he shared with his collaborators These included for the telephone and telegraph for the photophone for the phonograph for aerial vehicles for hydroairplanes and for a selenium cell Until a few days before his death Bell continued to make entries in his journal During his last dictation he was reassured with Dont hurry to which he replied I have to

ENRON PM Sent by Ken Lay and Jeff NRON To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject California Energy Crisis Californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

legislation produces a disincentive for parents to travel with children on an airplane because it increases the already high costs associated with flying Add to this the somewhat more relaxed rules of the highway and you might find more families taking road trips on their next vacation This is a potential secondary effect of the legislation which could actually increase injuries and fatalities secondary because it would not be directly associated with injuries caused in airplane crashes but because it would incent people to find other possibly more dangerous modes of transportation Auto safety legislation puts constraints on auto makers to make cars as safe as possible while still maintaining a profit It also narrows consumers choice sets when buying a new car A person buying a car in a country with no auto safety legislation might make auto safety a priority in their decision In a country indoctrinated by Naders book the choice between whether to buy a safe or unsafe car is taken away all cars are made equally safe Because of this carbuyers have less incentive to drive safely and more leeway to choose their car for other reasons Soon safety in a car becomes a moot point and the car buyer is only concerned with a good price or other incentives Auto accidents increase because there is no longer an incentive to drive safely legislation has made cars in consumers minds indestructible If cars are indestructible so then are the people in them a My demand curve shows that I would purchase gallon of soda at a price just under So when I purchase gallons at a gallon I am better of by b I can purchase more gallons of Diet Coke when it is priced at a gallon than when its priced at Therefore Im better off by a gain of gallons times a decrease of divided by c If Diet Coke was free Id consume up to gallons of it before it wouldnt be worth it for me to consume anymore My consumer surplus is a A will sell chairs to B A can make chairs in the time it takes him to build table while B can only build in the time it takes him to build a table As chairtotable time ratio is greater than Bs to b A will buy tables from C C can make a table in only twice the amount of time it takes him to build a chair while A takes five times as long to build a table than a chair As tabletochair time ratio is greater than Cs to c B will do neither Since B can make chairs faster rate of for B to for C B wont buy chairs from C And because C can make tables faster rate of for C to for B B cant sell tables to C a The equilibrium price is P P P P The quantity is textbooks b The sticker price becomes P P P P P P The market quantity stays at textbooks c The sticker price becomes P P P P P Market quantity decreases marginally to textbooks d If the seller pays per book in taxes the seller charges and receives per book If the buyer pays per book in sales tax the buyer pays per book The costs are equal despite which party is paying the tax e The government collects tax times books in tax revenues for this set of terms a The equilibrium price is P P P The market quantity is b The sticker price becomes t Pt P t P t c The government takes in a tax revenue of t There are deadweight costs associated with this tax because the supply is more elastic than the demand for insulin Therefore consumers will bear more of the burden of the tax a Affects supply supply curve will increase

working on the malfunctioning phone circuit We dont know when the service will be reinstated but in the meantime you can reflect on what life was like before the darn thing was invented Bell Alexander Graham b March Edinburgh d Aug Beinn Bhreagh Cape Breton Island Nova Scotia Can Scottishborn American audiologist best known as the inventor of the telephone For two generations his family had been recognized as leading authorities in elocution and speech correction with Alexander Melville Bells Standard Elocutionist passing through nearly editions in English Young Bell and his two brothers were trained to continue the family profession His early achievements on behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before his th birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training Alexander Graham was not added until he was was the second of the three sons of Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds Bell Apart from one year at a private school two years at Edinburghs Royal High School from which he was graduated at and attendance at a few lectures at Edinburgh University and at University College in London Bell was largely family trained and selftaught His first professional post was at Mr Skinners school in Elgin County Moray where he instructed the children in both music and elocution In he became a resident master in Elgins Weston House Academy where he conducted his first studies in sound Appropriately Bell had begun professionally as he would continue through lifeas a teacherscientist In he became his fathers assistant in London and assumed full charge while the senior Bell lectured in America The shock of the sudden death of his older brother from tuberculosis which had also struck down his younger brother and the strain of his professional duties soon took their toll on young Bell Concern for their only surviving son prompted the familys move to Canada in August where after settling near Brantford Ont Bells health rapidly improved In Bell spent several weeks in Boston lecturing and demonstrating the system of his fathers Visible Speech published in as a means of teaching speech to the deaf Each phonetic symbol indicated a definite position of the organs of speech such as lips tongue and soft palate and could be used by the deaf to imitate the sounds of speech in the usual way Young A Graham Bell as he now preferred to be known showed using his fathers system that speech could be taught to the deaf His astounding results soon led to further invitations to lecture Even while vacationing at his parents home Bell continued his experiments with sound In he opened his own school in Boston for training teachers of the deaf edited his pamphlet Visible Speech Pioneer and continued to study and tutor in he became professor of vocal physiology at Boston University Never adept with his hands Bell had the good fortune to discover and inspire Thomas Watson a young repair mechanic and model maker who assisted him enthusiastically in devising an apparatus for transmitting sound by electricity Their long nightly sessions began to produce tangible results The fathers of George Sanders and Mabel Hubbard two deaf students whom he helped were sufficiently impressed with the young teacher to assist him financially in his scientific pursuits Nevertheless during normal working hours Bell and Watson were still obliged to fulfill a busy schedule of professional demands It is scarcely surprising that Bells health again suffered On April he was granted the patent for his multiple telegraph but after another exhausting six months of long nightly sessions in the workshop while maintaining his daily professional schedule Bell had to return to his parents home in Canada to recuperate In September he began to write the specifications for the telephone On March the United States Patent Office granted to Bell Patent Number covering The method of and apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically by causing electrical undulations similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds Within a year followed the commercial application and a few months later the first of hundreds of legal suits Ironically the telephoneuntil then all too often regarded as a joke and its creatorprophet as at best an eccentricwas the subject of the most involved patent litigation in history The two most celebrated of the early actions were the Dowd and Drawbaugh cases wherein the fledgling Bell Telephone Company successfully challenged two subsidiaries of the giant Western Union Telegraph Company for patent infringement The charges and accusations were especially painful to Bells Scottish integrity but the outcome of all the litigation which persisted throughout the life of his patents was that Bells claims were upheld as the first to conceive and apply the undulatory current In Bell married Mabel Hubbard years his junior The Bell story does not end with the invention of the telephone indeed in many ways it was a beginning A resident of Washington DC Bell continued his experiments in communication which culminated in the invention of the photophonetransmission of sound on a beam of light in medical research and in techniques for teaching speech to the deaf In France honoured Bell with the Volta Prize and the francs roughly equivalent to US financed the Volta Laboratory where in association with Charles Sumner Tainter and his cousin Chichester A Bell Bell invented the Graphophone Employing an engraving stylus controllable speeds and wax cylinders and disks the Graphophone presented a practical approach to sound recording Bells share of the royalties financed the Volta Bureau and the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf since the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf May was one of Bells happiest days his yearold prodigy Helen Keller participated in the groundbreaking ceremonies for the new Volta Bureau buildingtoday an international information centre relating to the oral education of the deaf In Bell acquired land on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia There in surroundings reminiscent of his early years in Scotland he established a summer home Beinn Bhreagh complete with research laboratories In Bell succeeded his fatherinlaw as president of the National Geographic Society Convinced that geography could be taught through pictures he sought to promote an understanding of life in distant lands in an age when travel was limited to a privileged few Again he found the proper hands Gilbert Grosvenor his future soninlaw who transformed a modest pamphlet into a unique educational journal reaching millions throughout the world As interest in the possibility of flight increased after the turn of the century he experimented with giant mancarrying kites Characteristically Bell again found a group of four willing young enthusiasts to execute his theories Always an inspiration Mabel Hubbard Bell wishing to maintain the stimulating influence of the group soon founded the Aerial Experiment Association the first research organization established

<17945479.1075841907579.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kate.symes@enron.com,2001-04-20 15:23:00,Econ Homework nsf Kate Symes Student No The invention of the french fry would result in an increased demand for potatoes that is the demand curve for potatoes would shift outward This would result in an increase in price and a corresponding increase in supply As the supply curve comes up to meet the new higher demand curve we would actually see an increase in overall demand supply AND price The statement is wrong in assuming that increased supply equals a lower price a The value of one bottle of beer to me between points A and B is bottles of soda b I am therefore indifferent between bundles A and B because they both allow me the same frequency of use and same level of satisfaction c Bundle E must include about bottles of soda in order to make me indifferent between it and bundle D This follows from the logic that when I have bottles of soda it would take about more to make me give up one bottle of beer in the bundle Here I have bottles of soda I would need AT LEAST bottles of soda to make me give up one more beer in another bundle with the same frequency of use Firstly this legislation produces a disincentive for parents to travel with children on an airplane because it increases the already high costs associated with flying Add to this the somewhat more relaxed rules of the highway and you might find more families taking road trips on their next vacation This is a potential secondary effect of the legislation which could actually increase injuries and fatalities secondary because it would not be directly associated with injuries caused in airplane crashes but because it would incent people to find other possibly more dangerous modes of transportation Auto safety legislation puts constraints on auto makers to make cars as safe as possible while still maintaining a profit It also narrows consumers choice sets when buying a new car A person buying a car in a country with no auto safety legislation might make auto safety a priority in their decision In a country indoctrinated by Naders book the choice between whether to buy a safe or unsafe car is taken away all cars are made equally safe Because of this carbuyers have less incentive to drive safely and more leeway to choose their car for other reasons Soon safety in a car becomes a moot point and the car buyer is only concerned with a good price or other incentives Auto accidents increase because there is no longer an incentive to drive safely legislation has made cars in consumers minds indestructible If cars are indestructible so then are the people in them a My demand curve shows that I would purchase gallon of soda at a price just under So when I purchase gallons at a gallon I am better of by b I can purchase more gallons of Diet Coke when it is priced at a gallon than when its priced at Therefore Im better off by a gain of gallons times a decrease of divided by c If Diet Coke was free Id consume up to gallons of it before it wouldnt be worth it for me to consume anymore My consumer surplus is a A will sell chairs to B A can make chairs in the time it takes him to build table while B can only build in the time it takes him to build a table As chairtotable time ratio is greater than Bs to b A will buy tables from C C can make a table in only twice the amount of time it takes him to build a chair while A takes five times as long to build a table than a chair As tabletochair time ratio is greater than Cs to c B will do neither Since B can make chairs faster rate of for B to for C B wont buy chairs from C And because C can make tables faster rate of for C to for B B cant sell tables to C a The equilibrium price is P P P P The quantity is textbooks b The sticker price becomes P P P P P P The market quantity stays at textbooks c The sticker price becomes P P P P P Market quantity decreases marginally to textbooks d If the seller pays per book in taxes the seller charges and receives per book If the buyer pays per book in sales tax the buyer pays per book The costs are equal despite which party is paying the tax e The government collects tax times books in tax revenues for this set of terms a The equilibrium price is P P P The market quantity is b The sticker price becomes t Pt P t P t c The government takes in a tax revenue of t There are deadweight costs associated with this tax because the supply is more elastic than the demand for insulin Therefore consumers will bear more of the burden of the tax a Affects supply supply curve will increase

working on the malfunctioning phone circuit We dont know when the service will be reinstated but in the meantime you can reflect on what life was like before the darn thing was invented Bell Alexander Graham b March Edinburgh d Aug Beinn Bhreagh Cape Breton Island Nova Scotia Can Scottishborn American audiologist best known as the inventor of the telephone For two generations his family had been recognized as leading authorities in elocution and speech correction with Alexander Melville Bells Standard Elocutionist passing through nearly editions in English Young Bell and his two brothers were trained to continue the family profession His early achievements on behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before his th birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training Alexander Graham was not added until he was was the second of the three sons of Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds Bell Apart from one year at a private school two years at Edinburghs Royal High School from which he was graduated at and attendance at a few lectures at Edinburgh University and at University College in London Bell was largely family trained and selftaught His first professional post was at Mr Skinners school in Elgin County Moray where he instructed the children in both music and elocution In he became a resident master in Elgins Weston House Academy where he conducted his first studies in sound Appropriately Bell had begun professionally as he would continue through lifeas a teacherscientist In he became his fathers assistant in London and assumed full charge while the senior Bell lectured in America The shock of the sudden death of his older brother from tuberculosis which had also struck down his younger brother and the strain of his professional duties soon took their toll on young Bell Concern for their only surviving son prompted the familys move to Canada in August where after settling near Brantford Ont Bells health rapidly improved In Bell spent several weeks in Boston lecturing and demonstrating the system of his fathers Visible Speech published in as a means of teaching speech to the deaf Each phonetic symbol indicated a definite position of the organs of speech such as lips tongue and soft palate and could be used by the deaf to imitate the sounds of speech in the usual way Young A Graham Bell as he now preferred to be known showed using his fathers system that speech could be taught to the deaf His astounding results soon led to further invitations to lecture Even while vacationing at his parents home Bell continued his experiments with sound In he opened his own school in Boston for training teachers of the deaf edited his pamphlet Visible Speech Pioneer and continued to study and tutor in he became professor of vocal physiology at Boston University Never adept with his hands Bell had the good fortune to discover and inspire Thomas Watson a young repair mechanic and model maker who assisted him enthusiastically in devising an apparatus for transmitting sound by electricity Their long nightly sessions began to produce tangible results The fathers of George Sanders and Mabel Hubbard two deaf students whom he helped were sufficiently impressed with the young teacher to assist him financially in his scientific pursuits Nevertheless during normal working hours Bell and Watson were still obliged to fulfill a busy schedule of professional demands It is scarcely surprising that Bells health again suffered On April he was granted the patent for his multiple telegraph but after another exhausting six months of long nightly sessions in the workshop while maintaining his daily professional schedule Bell had to return to his parents home in Canada to recuperate In September he began to write the specifications for the telephone On March the United States Patent Office granted to Bell Patent Number covering The method of and apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically by causing electrical undulations similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds Within a year followed the commercial application and a few months later the first of hundreds of legal suits Ironically the telephoneuntil then all too often regarded as a joke and its creatorprophet as at best an eccentricwas the subject of the most involved patent litigation in history The two most celebrated of the early actions were the Dowd and Drawbaugh cases wherein the fledgling Bell Telephone Company successfully challenged two subsidiaries of the giant Western Union Telegraph Company for patent infringement The charges and accusations were especially painful to Bells Scottish integrity but the outcome of all the litigation which persisted throughout the life of his patents was that Bells claims were upheld as the first to conceive and apply the undulatory current In Bell married Mabel Hubbard years his junior The Bell story does not end with the invention of the telephone indeed in many ways it was a beginning A resident of Washington DC Bell continued his experiments in communication which culminated in the invention of the photophonetransmission of sound on a beam of light in medical research and in techniques for teaching speech to the deaf In France honoured Bell with the Volta Prize and the francs roughly equivalent to US financed the Volta Laboratory where in association with Charles Sumner Tainter and his cousin Chichester A Bell Bell invented the Graphophone Employing an engraving stylus controllable speeds and wax cylinders and disks the Graphophone presented a practical approach to sound recording Bells share of the royalties financed the Volta Bureau and the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf since the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf May was one of Bells happiest days his yearold prodigy Helen Keller participated in the groundbreaking ceremonies for the new Volta Bureau buildingtoday an international information centre relating to the oral education of the deaf In Bell acquired land on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia There in surroundings reminiscent of his early years in Scotland he established a summer home Beinn Bhreagh complete with research laboratories In Bell succeeded his fatherinlaw as president of the National Geographic Society Convinced that geography could be taught through pictures he sought to promote an understanding of life in distant lands in an age when travel was limited to a privileged few Again he found the proper hands Gilbert Grosvenor his future soninlaw who transformed a modest pamphlet into a unique educational journal reaching millions throughout the world As interest in the possibility of flight increased after the turn of the century he experimented with giant mancarrying kites Characteristically Bell again found a group of four willing young enthusiasts to execute his theories Always an inspiration Mabel Hubbard Bell wishing to maintain the stimulating influence of the group soon founded the Aerial Experiment Association the first research organization established and endowed by a woman Deafness was no handicap to the wife of Professor Bell At Beinn Bhreagh Bell entered new subjects of investigation such as sonar detection solar distillation the tetrahedron as a structural unit and hydrofoil craft one of which weighed more than pounds and attained a speed record of miles per hour in Apart from his lifelong association with the cause of the deaf Bell never lingered on one project His research interests centred on basic principles rather than on refinements The most cursory examination of his many notebooks shows marginal memos and jottings often totally unrelated to the subject at handreminders of questions and ideas he wanted to investigate It was impossible for him to carry each of his creative ideas through to a practical end Many of his conceptions are only today seeing fruition indeed some undoubtedly have yet to be developed The range of his inventive genius is represented only in part by the patents granted in his name alone and the he shared with his collaborators These included for the telephone and telegraph for the photophone for the phonograph for aerial vehicles for hydroairplanes and for a selenium cell Until a few days before his death Bell continued to make entries in his journal During his last dictation he was reassured with Dont hurry to which he replied I have to

has gone out and landed herself a fullfledged boyfriend Anything to avoid getting a job Hes a natural healer and hes also had an experience with Jesus so this one should be REALLY interesting Amber and I had a few drinks last night and basically pretended like nothing happened its easier that way We both know theres no real friendship to salvage so keeping it strictly in the bars is the smartest thing to do And Anna dont think for a minute that my description of life in Portland is exciting or cultured or romantic cause its pretty much the polar opposite of all those things Ive been so tired this week that Ive been spouting out sentences like The red computer needs to climb my shoelaces and the people riding the dinosaurs are wrong Its definitely been interesting Im on my way to sushi with a few people right now but of course I can see my reflection in my forehead and my hair looks like a sad sad small animal Super Maybe Ill meet the man of my dreams Ill tell you Anna I know youve got scary clashing dresser man but sometimes from the single persons point of view that doesnt look so bad Hang in there and call me soon Love Kate Anna Symes on PM To cc Subject Hey buttface Wow it actually sounds like your roommate problems may be comparable to mine except that you probably dont fear for your life quite as much Who is paying for Amber to come to Denver It sounds like she might be a little out of her mind right now but at least shes not going back to Chris just yet So are you going to Seattle this weekend That sounds so fun I am so jealous parties dinners wine men You and I are NOT living the same life right now I am in the process of trying to break things off with the ugly dresser which was proving to be difficult until last night when I made the mistake of letting him come to a movie with Michelle and I Kate I was scared It was dark and I was surrounded by the two most psycho people I know Josh talked through the whole thing and laughed at inappropriate moments and tried to hold my hand at one point It was excruciating It made Michelle look almost normal Not much else going on Ill call you this weekend okay We need to dish Luego Anna Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday February AM To Subject Re Rockin in the Rockies bro So didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night I always knew the Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports theyre not battling with that ol Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean Well Im sorry I didnt get back to you yesterday work was hectic and I knew that if I started an email to you it would either be halfassed or Id never finish it Well Im going for the former now because I realized there would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of whats happening around here and all the while I wait more and more important nuggets get it of gossip are accumulating So its quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues mine could not be worse Amber took off for the library on Thursday night and came homefour days later After Molly and I had a mild freakout session on Friday which included calling everybody shes every known including Chris and the police we heard through the grapevine that Marky McCulloch of Neidermeyer cousin fame was in town from none other than Denver and the two were having a secret and JamesBondlike rendezvous at the beach Well that was all well and fine other than the fact that she DIDNT TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming party this weekend for the past month and she DIDNT TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and she moved kitty into the house but still hasnt told our landlords or paid the deposit oh and also SHE DIDNT TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING So many things were wrong and bizarre about that but none more than her attitude when she walked in the door Monday afternoon Lets just say I spared no lung muscles in telling her exactly what I thought about her selfish childish idiotic and most importantly psychotically selfimportant behavior She had the gall to defensively scream back that she didnt tell us BECAUSE SHE DIDNT WANT TO LIE Hmmmm Not only did she not want to lie how sweet but she couldnt have told us because Molly and I have suddenly developed an insatiable urge to spread fervent and widespread rumors about Ambers love trysts Now I KNOW theres nothing Id rather be doing Anyway enough of that She and I have reached an understanding that just because were roommates does not mean we have to be friends Weve never been good at that anyhow In other news we had an amazing housewarming party I really wish you could have been there Molly and I didnt know percent of the people there which is a good thing because it meant they were all interesting successful gracious and cute I think there were about four girls there you could tell who planned the party Sadly no love connections were made that evening but Ive decided thats my new MO keep em guessing My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in Seattle came down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing an article for Food Wine magazine Very interesting guy but potentially in the closet so Im keeping my distance But they invited me up to Seattle next weekend for a fivecourse meal and bottles of wine at some Microsoft dudes mansion Definitely sounds like my crowd Should I wear my dirty jeans or my clean jeans Ive got my eye on flights to Denver but right now its looking like the end of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash Amber on the other hand will be there five times before that because some psycho over there keeps buying her tickets Thats fair for ya Okay thats all I can do for now but call me tonight and well do the rumor mill justice Take care and hang in there well be booting a roommate soon if you feel like coming back to Portland Kate

youve been stuck in those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life It sounds like things are going really well though Rocky Mountain highs and that youve made it through most of the tumult of moving to a new place Rocky Mountain lows Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky her man of the hour he mentions how theyve got to get together with you when she comes to town which will be on next Friday whoo hoo party Im so mad that she gets to go and I dont being that I am not like her in my eighth year of college and therefore do not enjoy such things as Spring Break Mania anymore And Monica tells Marky who tells Amber who tells me that shed love to hang out with you more often It sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner eh So youve got options girlfriend which is worlds more than I can say for my life at the mo It pretty much consists of working eating and sleeping Im definitely looking into that SAD mental disorder thing because I think its got me in its clutches But the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life after winter Were doing lots of gardening cooking and decorating at the house its like having three Martha Stewarts all working together only slightly less stylish immensely less efficient and drunk Other than that Ive been trying to organize and simplify my life taking care of mounds of paperwork paying off debts sorting out all those nagging little postit notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain Im actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel like maybe I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months or even buy a SECOND pair of shoes but lets not get wild and crazy just yet So I heard Dad and Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an

tell everyone to deal with it because its my house too but the other part of me doesnt want to deal with the bloodshed that will ensue between her and Ambers outmatched feline Oh well Im thinking about it The most excitement Ill be having this week is my haircut with Brett tonight I think I might also be purchasing a bedskirt a totally extraneous and disappointing expense that I would never have had if I hadnt insisted on getting a real house with a real bed and all that other crap that goes along with it and inevitably costs you money that you could have otherwise spent on beer And as

UO has decided to forgive my errant freshman year behavior that got me booted from those luxurious residance halls and readmit me Theyre probably looking over my application right now and just pissing themselves Wait a minute that goodfornothing druggy thinks shes going to GRADUATE SCHOOLHAHAHAHAHAHA and so on And by the way I didnt mean to throw you into a fit of Catholic guilt over the kitty thing Shes totally fine and mom actually likes her I think my presence actually upsets the balance And I think this move might be good for her shell be going back to her apartment roots The real martyr in all of this is Big Kitty who still looks completely baffled when Kitty hurtles herself at him from behind doorways and such After she does that they generally both walk away from each other just looking completely dissatisfied with the whole thing Big Kitty because hes old and demented and everything confuses him and Kitty because shes young and demented and everything pisses her off Gotta love it So you look like Jennifer now Hey dont underestimate the onetime popularity of that haircut Everything comes back into fashion at some point I will tell Brett you said hi His wife just had her baby they are such a freaking cute little family it makes me depressed Even more than I already am from having to sit around my house all the time and listen to Amber and Molly call their respective boyfriends schmoopy and swap sex stories Its thoroughly disgusting and Ive told them so They just throw their heads back and laugh with selfsatisfied coupleinduced mania And there you have

heels for some cowboy dude evan introduced her to theyve been attached at the hips literally for the last three weeks and amber spends about four quality hours a day on the phone with marky then cries when she has to hang up seriously but your romance sounds much more interesting you absolutely have to keep me posted on how it unfolds and whats the guys name anyway you know whats weird is that last night after my haircut i met up with molly and her man for dinner we decided to check out the brazen bean this little swanky cigar bar across the street from the blue moon on st we heard they had a martini happy hour and we felt like pretending we were sophisticated so were walking into the place when molly suddenly remembers that she knows the people who live upstairs its in one of those old rambling victorian houses so she runs upstairs to say hi and then comes back down with them it turns out to be blake and jill this really sweet couple ive met before friends of friends you know how it goes anyway we all end up staying longer than we should and having more martinis than we planned on and then blake remembers his friend dave was coming over to watch a movie so he runs upstairs to meet dave and brings him back down well dave happens to be amazingly cute and have amazingly great legs he had just come from the gym and was amazingly good about sitting in this dimly lit velvetcouched candlelit shishi joint in shorts and a sweatshirt so dave molly tells me as she begins to put the hard sell on IMMEDIATELY ive noticed as i get older and stay single that many of my friends feel the need to try vehemently to get me coupled plays the guitar amazingly and has an amazing voice i find out over the course of the evening that he also reads A LOT and is interested in irish literature and quantum physics well who isnt yknow he also likes to sail and this is really quite scary LASER SAILBOATS yep ive officially met my father in a younger form barf anyway he and blake and i all had a jolly time talking about books and parents and that show blind date it was all very intellectual i assure you what was weirder still was that every time i said something dave looked at blake and kind of laughed and every time i was like stop your laughing or ill beat you senseless and he was like no im just laughing because we were just talking about that the other day or because ive done that or because im doing that next week i said i wanted to start a book club apparently he suggested that to blake two days ago i said i lived in italy and wanted to go back hes going there in two months oh and then theres our common love of running okay im rambling so ill get to the point which is that in my single and cynical state i didnt think much of the poor guy last night but today ive noticed im increasingly interested and ill admit maybe even attracted so as we were leaving i kind of waved goodbye and said see ya around because you always do in an incestuous vat such as portland and went on my merry way with molly and josh which im sure they were happy about since they practically tried to push me into daves car and run away dave got in his car and drove off then all of a sudden appeared in front of us as we were crossing the street to our car he had driven around the block and was now getting out of his car to give me his card which he handed to me under the pretense that we couldnt start a book club without each others contact information i already knew he worked at a running store whatever that is but when i turned the card over it had his name on it and the word owner underneath do you think that means hes the actual owner or is it one of those places like les schwab where they give all the employees stock options and call them employee owners im going to look into it now im probably making way too much of this because he was probably like yeah i need some more members for my book club but i definitely dont want to talk to this drinking smoking lump of unmolded flesh for any other reasonwhy would i the proprietor of a running store and owner of such amazing legs do a thing like date a girl who shudders at the thought of exercise and loses weight only when she ups her alcohol consumption to the point where she forgets to eat that would just be silly okay ive got to go get back to me with a detailed account of your evening such as the one i just sent you kate Anna Symes on AM To Kate Symes Email cc Subject Okay so my date was SO amazing This guy is SO cute SO nice SO smart wore pants that fit over his shoes wore an amazingly cute outfit in general knew a lot about wine took me to the cutest restaurant took me out for cocktails afterwards was a total gentleman etc Mark my words Kate I WILL MARRY THIS MAN I kid you not He is the most normal guy I have come across EVER Hes trying to get a job in graphic design so cute but he loves wine and has thought about working at a vineyard or owning a restaurant so cute Weve read all the same books He definitely has money somehow but he said he has a lot of student debts so at least he can see where Im coming from He was just interested enough but kind of aloof which is the only thing that ever keeps me interested Kate this is so weird Oh and he mentioned having a family twice like as in working at a restaurant isnt good for having a family HOW CUTE IS THAT I am in love Just thought Id let you know love anna

<29524074.1075841900936.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kate.symes@enron.com,2001-03-23 00:43:00,California Energy Crisisnsf Happy reading Forwarded by Kate SymesPDXECT on AM From Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling ENRON PM Sent by Ken Lay and Jeff NRON To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject California Energy Crisis Californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

<31677996.1075841901510.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kate.symes@enron.com,2001-03-23 09:09:00,REnsf Anna Youre stoked on the song thing Youll never guess how cool mine is though Its Dont go breakin my heart by Elton John and Kiki Dee Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to watch all the time I LOVE that song Anyway I had already started a reply to your previous email so Ill just send it along with this one I love you madly and dearly Youre the only one whos managed to say anything of worth about this whole incidence Amber and Molly stared at me blankly and said something like Dont be so overly dramatic and then rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to hang out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend and blah blah blah It was really disappointing that they didnt understand the importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men It was so not fun But I was really proud of myself because I left work fuming on the verge of tears and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with Amber and Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before Then Molly and I took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food brought it home and watched the Thursday night lineup All in all it was a very successful evening WITHOUT runner man whose name by the way is Dave Take one point off for that And guess what He ended up calling at about Molly was on the other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a message so awhile later when I got a call from Jill Daves friends girlfriend who Im also friends with this all gets very complicated I was very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with us I just assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave and made up some sweet excuse about how I had just eaten and was too full to move because I was like no way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up NO WAY So that was thator so I thought At about pm runner man himself calls and basically admits that hes psycho for cancelling our date and then calling me all night long Ya think Anyway he tells me he was in this enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride and didnt want me to see him in such a bad state I still thought it was a lame excuse and that once youd reached the ripe age of you should be smart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone So I told him that and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and my roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn which he had started the other night when he was over to make it up to me I told him if he did that he might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is where he is now thats finance lingo Anyway the plan is hes going to come over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like people who we somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight although I dont remember doing that Anna you have to stay with me one night when youre home in June because its a constant riot I wont go into some of the things Amber did the other night right now but Ill tell you soon so you can swap stories when you see her By the way she snagged an armload of my clothes actually most of which were yours to wear at fancy dinners in Denver so if you see anything you want back just let her know I think its just that red Laundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt Hey guess what I have to go Ill call you tonight Take care kate Anna Symes on AM To cc Subject RE That sucks Kate I bet that isnt the last well be seeing of Mr Running Man though First of all who gets scared off by drunk roommates If anything it should be a relief to him that he doesnt need to impress any of your clan Second it sounds like the classic insecure blowoff to me If you think back youll probably remember a couple of instances in which your demeanorcommentsfacial expression may have sent him the message that he is the stupidest thing on Gods green earth I know this because I have the same habit So he probably went home mulled over those few devastating instances and came to the conclusion that youre not that into it And being a man only men and Symess do this he cancelled on you before you had the chance to crush his ego once again Am I right I think so Tentatively planning on going out with Amber and Monica on Saturday night Im mad that Im hanging out with your roommate before I get to hang out with you Monica and I are thinking of splitting your ticket since we know youll never save the money like I should talk You have to come out here though Its about degrees right now and its in the morning on a day in March I cant believe how happy this sun makes me You would love it too Okay feel better and dont sweat the stupid running guy If he thinks hes not worthy of you chances are hes not A stiff margarita will make this whole problem a lot more manageable dont you think You should go have one Love you Luego Anna Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday March PM To Subject Re Well to tell you the truth it sucks right now Work has been snowballing with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems so many that Ive basically forgotten what they all are now And on top of that runner guy stopped by last night and it happened to be the last day of Ambers finals so she and Molly had been drinking since pm Well Im not quite sure if that scared him away but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight he asked me I accepted we had a time picked out now I NEVER make plans as a rule but this was a goddamn plan So he calls minutes ago and actually CANCELS Not even just that he doesnt give a REASON I am so livid right now theres smoke coming out of my ears I need to go finish work so I can get out of here and go bomb his car Ill call you tonight Kate Anna Symes on PM To Kate Symes Email cc Subject hey poopstain Whats up I am sooooo good Dad and my car will be here on Monday isnt that great I just want to drive for the rest of my life So I get three days off next week plus Im leaving for my outward bound course next friday So basically I have like a week vacation Things are still going with the cute waiter Nathan but Ive discovered a flaw It was only a matter of time you know Actually its a nonfatal flaw its annoying at worst Basically he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and talks on it in all types of situations such as the video store a taxi cab and while eating dinner with his friends I just cant stand those things Its one thing to chat on it when youre walking down the street by yourself or in your car by yourself but when youre with other people or in the checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you I just think its so rude But Im going to try to get over it because otherwise hes great and I seem to be the only person on Gods green earth who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze So thats my life whats going on in yours love anna

official capacity has no nexus with the issue of power or energy and he has no nexus with the issue of ethics or conflict of interests South asserted Hes a pure political phony THE STATE Renewed Ethics Attacks Put Davis on the Defensive Politics The governors conflictofinterest problems with his energy advisors give GOP rival Bill Jones a ray of hope for his struggling campaign by MARK Z BARABAK TIMES POLITICAL WRITER In when Gray Davis first ran for governor his Republican rival tested a series of attacks on Davis ethical conduct There were charges that he improperly used state workers in a previous campaign accusations that he placed cronies on the state payroll and questions about possible conflicts surrounding Davis voracious fundraising activities But when voters heard the allegations they simply shrugged them off The response was Hes a politician Of course he does stuff like that recalled one GOP strategist who sat in on the voter interviews conducted for Republican nominee Dan Lungren The campaign shelved its line of attack and Democrat Davis romped to a landslide victory Now he is under renewed assault for alleged ethical lapses this time surrounding the states electricity crisis The issue has put the governor and his campaign aides on the defensive just as the states power crunch appears to have finally eased The charges have also invigorated the struggling campaign of Bill Jones the Republican secretary of state and Davis sole declared rival in the race for governor Last week Jones called the conflictofinterest allegations one of the most significant pervasive and costly ethics scandals in California history But as yet there has been no evidence of profiteering on the part of Davis energy advisors let alone the governor himself And unless there is some proof many observers doubt that the revelations will seriously set back the governors reelection prospects in November I dont see this becoming a dominant campaign issue said Jim Knox executive director of California Common Cause the good government group and one of Davis most prominent critics Its likely that the more resonant issue is going to be how well the overall crisis was resolved or not resolved That said Knox worries that the controversy will only contribute to the corrosive cynicism turned up in Lungrens focus group interviews The danger is that this could undermine the publics confidence in state governments ability to resolve this crisis in their best interest Knox said It does surprise me that the governors office with all of its experience and talent could so cavalierly disregard the states conflictofinterest laws which to me appears to be what happened The controversy involves nearly a dozen Davis administration officials with financial ties to some of the major energy companies doing business in California Their investments surfaced months after the officials should have filed economic disclosure statementsrevelations that resulted in part from Jones pressure Five of them have been fired and others are facing state or federal investigations Garry South the governors chief political strategist points to the firings as evidence of Davis probity Clearly if the governors office did not feel there was a conflict of interest there they would not have been fired South said As for others in the administration who may have failed to promptly disclose their ties to the energy industry there is absolutely nothing illegal about anyone on the governors staffor anyone in state governmentowning stock in any company whatsoever South said Even so Davis top spokesman Steve Maviglio earlier this month sold his shares of stock in a California power company after news of his holdings surfaced Maviglio said he lost in the transaction At the least the revelations have been a distraction for Davis at a time when he would rather boast about a blackoutfree summer It is a mistake that didnt need to be made and shouldnt have been made said Gale Kaufman a Sacramento campaign consultant and one of the rare Democratic strategists willing to publicly criticize the governor The fact that it took a while to correct it creates an image problem he didnt need Republicans of course see a larger problem Hes either incompetent or there is corruption within his administration said Rob Stutzman a spokesman for the California Republican Party And we think it starts with the tone and example he sets with those who work for him In characteristically pugnacious fashion the Davis campaign has sought to turn Jones charges around by accusing the secretary of state of exploiting his public office for political gain This man in his official capacity has no nexus with the issue of power or energy and he has no nexus with the issue of ethics or conflict of interests South asserted Hes a pure political phony But Jones said political oversight falls well within his purview as the states chief elections officer For the governors office to say that I dont have any jurisdiction in this area or shouldnt be able to speak to it is patently false Jones said New Life for Jones Campaign Whatever his stake there is no question that the attention has given life to Jones campaign while he is fighting desperately to sustain his gubernatorial bid The in contributions that Jones reported for the first six months of the year is embarrassingly small by California standards and the Bush White House has all but formally endorsed rival Richard Riordan who is still exploring the race Fellow Republican William E Simon Jr a Los Angeles investment banker has been campaigning for governor for months but has yet to officially declare his candidacy But ironically for all Jones efforts it may be Riordan who is best able to capitalize on the ethics controversy Unlike Simon a political neophyte and Jones an year officeholder Riordan had a decadeslong business career before serving two terms as Los Angeles mayor Hes cut from a different cloth said Don Sipple a GOP strategist who is neutral in the governors race If this serves to remind people that politics is a slimy game Riordan can point to the fact he didnt start public service until he was more than years old But even while insisting that Davis did nothing wrong strategists say voters will make a careful distinction between the governors professional conduct and any evidence of personal enrichment And Davis best defense they argue is his famously modest lifestylea frugality symbolized during his campaign by his cramped West Hollywood home If anyone thinks Davis has used his office to get rich one advisor said All wife Sharon has to do is throw open the door to their condo
