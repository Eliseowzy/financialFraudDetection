<19428717.1075859996184.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,dave.samuels@enron.com,2000-05-08 09:08:00,comments on the Argus draftForwarded by Dave SamuelsHOUECT on PM Abudi Zein on PM To David A Samuels cc Subject comments on the agreement draft David Thank you for sending the agreement draft on Friday Here are my notes after the first reading If you wish to discuss those further perhaps we can schedule a time on the phone Preamble We are a Delaware corporation Section Definition the attrition rate per your definition is diluted by the addition of new clients The attrition rate should calculated based on the number of existing clients at the beginning of the agreement without taking new clients into account Section Termination of the Agreement should be mutual and we cannot agree to keeping the Exclusivity at the same level through any renewal periods Section the definition of competitors is too broad We would like to see something that more tightly defines electronic trading of wholesale commodities We would like to retain the ability to offer these services in areas where Enron Online is not active such as supply chain systems and in the retail markets for large commercial and industrial concerns Also I am not sure whether this is intended but your reference to any Publication will give you exclusivity to ALL our publications for the fee set out in a That is not the intent Section b should be removed see comments on Section Section we cannot agree to letting Enron disclose the existence of this agreement without our consent Any disclosure about this agreement including the fact of its existence should be by mutual consent Section we need a mirror section indemnifying us against all and any claims against Enron Online This would be a showstopper for our lawyers Section I am not sure we have such an insurance but even if we did I am not sure why Enron is requiring this given that there is a clear indemnification Section a three days seems unduly short I would say days is more reasonable There are no fee payments in advance so I believe we can remove mention of fees being paid back Section were really not looking for a monetary commitment from Enron on helping us find illegal distribution What is important to us is that Enron has a contractual obligation to notify us immediately if it becomes aware of any breach of copyright or illegal distribution It would be good if that were written into this section Section typically we do not agree to arbitration clauses for the simple reason that these types disputes tend to end up in court anyway and then the two parties have spent money on arbitration and still have the legal costs ahead of them I believe we can live with this clause but it would be better if it were not there There might be a couple more points that come up from my colleagues or on a second reading but I believe these are the main sticking points at the moment Abudi Zein
