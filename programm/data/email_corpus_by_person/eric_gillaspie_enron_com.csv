Gerald provided me with the address so the only other outstanding issues are the expected date of completion and the Affiliate contact person both of which are highlighted on the attached Affiliate Work Offer Call me if you have any questions or comments Thanks Eric Gillaspie Enron Building Chris Sonneborn PM To Eric CT cc Lal CT Audrey CT Gregory CT Subject Scope of work for Lost Creek SCADA installation Eric this is a copy of the scope of work that I forwarded to Pat Flavin It will need some cleanup to put it into the contract but this should give you a flavor of what I am working toward Thanks Chris Sonneborn phone cut here Timeline Purge and pack pipeline First flow to CIGWIC SCADA total meter sites SCADA Software versions Enron Modbus CM Q Ver c Daniels GC Comm Q Ver c Enron EFM Q Rev f At North end of pipeline LysiteLost Cabin production office There are three meter stations at the north end of the Lost Creek pipeline They are the Fred Novotny Keith Baker and the Madden West meters Each of these is a Fisher ROC which needs to be set up with an MDS radio and a yaggi antenna They will be polled using a master radio to be located at the Burlington Resources Lysite office nearby This master radios antenna will be mounted on a shared tower with the existing BR master radio system for the Madden Field area The Lost Creek radio will operate on a different hopping frequency Poll requests will be sent from Houston via VSAT andor analog phone A phone modem and a VSAT are to be installed at BRs Lysite production office and connected to the master radio through a PanelTec device The VSAT should have the master port Each of the RTUs is installed in a portable building along with a chromatograph and other equipment V power should already be available at each of the sites At Sand Draw A small meter mmscfd will be located at Sand Draw WY This is another Fisher ROC We would like to install a cellphone modem for this device as it will be polled infrequently and is not of a critical nature Again power should already be available onsite Lost Creek does not require analog dialaround capabilities at this meter At South end of line Wamsutter Plant There are two meter stations a plant and a compressor that must be monitored here To do this we have two Fisher ROC s and a Rosemount Delta V One Fisher ROC and the Delta V are installed at the Lost Creek Wamsutter plant site The other RTU will be installed at the CIGWIC interconnect site approximately feet away This remote RTUs data will be collected using an MDS radio system and yaggi antenna back to the Lost Creek plant site where a master radio with a degree antenna is to be installed All three devices will be polled from Houston via either VSAT K dedicated line or standard phone system The current debate over the VSAT versus the K line will be decided shortly based on decisions by Enron IT security Greg Lind should have more details soon Again we would like to install a PanelTec to provide dialaround capabilities should we have problems with the VSATK line The RTU for the CIGWIC interconnect is currently in a chromatograph building at our staging area and is programmed to handle flow through an orifice tube meter The CIG and WIC meters are ultrasonics This will require a reprogramming of the RTU Is this something that can be done by HMS or should I simply order a brand new RTU for the CIGWIC interconnect and have it built correctly from scratch Whether I use the one we already own or order a new one I will have to have RTUs for both the CIGWIC interconnect as well as the chromatograph building I am talking about raiding Thoughts Either way I believe this is a tight if not downright impossible timeline to meet for this particular interconnect point in terms of SCADA telemetry Please correct me if I am wrong Finally we are working on the required legal documentation to allow Lost Creek personnel and contractors access to the CIGWIC meter site to perform the installation Equipment Enron Mike Moore will place the orders for the VSATS and phone lines Pat I believe that you know how this works normally with the breakout between Hughes and commisioning the VSAT and HMS and connecting the RTU and VSAT This piece is currently on hold as we are looking at the possibility of using a K line at Wamsutter and CDPD at the Lysite production office Enron will provide the MDS radios and masters Enron will provide antennas for the MDS radios at the RTUs the Lysite production office and at the Wamsutter plant site Enron will provide the cellphone modem and cell service for the Sand Draw meter site Enron will provide both of the PanelTecs Standard phone modems are already installed on all of the Fisher ROCs One of these should be used at the Lysite office for dialaround capabilities Another one should be used at the Wamsutter plant to provide dialaround capabilites Installation HMS will install and test all radio systems including cabling and the antennas at the Wamsutter and Lysite production office sites HMS will perform final connections between VSATS and PanelTecs and test communications throughput if necessary HMS will perform final connections between K line and PanelTecs and test communications throughput if necessary HMS will install and test PanelTecs and correctly connect with analog modems installed phone lines and with the RTUs and the Delta V at both Wamsutter and the Lysite production office as appropriate HMS will install and test the cellular modem at Sand Draw Best regards Chris Sonneborn ENA Facility Planning

Illinois the courts have generally held a contract may be assigned to another party if the contract is silent on whether the contract is assignable However the case law fails to specifically discuss if consent of the nonassigning party is required for the assignment to be valid However I think it is reasonable to interpret the omission of such a consent requirement in the discussion on assignment to conclude that consent is not required See the discussion below ILLINOIS JURISPRUDENCE Copyright LEXIS Law Publishing a div of Reed Elsevier Inc Thomas D Nusbaum JD COMMERCIAL LAW PART TWO UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE CHAPTER ARTICLE SALES III PERFORMANCE A OVERVIEW OF OBLIGATIONS Illinois Jur Commercial Law o o Delegation or assignment A party may perform a duty under a sales contract through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having the original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach n All rights of the seller or buyer may be assigned unless otherwise agreed n This may include rights under a warranty such that the assignee of a warrantees rights under an express warranty if the assignment is otherwise valid succeeds to all those rights and thus stands in privity with the warrantor Such an assignees privity would generally enable it to sue for economic loss and consequential damages just as an original contracting party might do n Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of the contract is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignors performance n However an assignment is barred where it would materially change the duty of the other party increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by the contract or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignors due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite an agreement otherwise n because no delegation of any performance is involved n An assignment of the contract of all my rights under the contract or in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances as in an assignment for security indicate the contrary is also a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor The acceptance of such an assignment by the assignee constitutes a promise to perform those duties This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract n Comment Article of the Uniform Commercial Code n takes no position on the possibility of extending some recognition or power to the original parties to work out normal commercial readjustments of the contract in the case of financing assignments even after the original obligor has been notified of the assignment This question is dealt with in Article n On the other hand the other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee n Digest Data Case Authorities Assignments to jobbers were not forbidden where agreements assignment provision made only one limitation on dealers right to assign and no limitations on franchisor Beachler v Amoco Oil Co Fd CA Ill The sale of the defendant corporation was not violative of a clause in the parties contract that prohibited assignment without the prior written consent of the plaintiff since a change in corporate ownership does not constitute a variation of that corporations contractual duty and at all times the defendant remained an independent functioning organization thus the sale of the defendant corporation did not change the defendants obligations under the contract and did not assign the defendants rights and duties under the agreement to anyone Baxter Healthcare Corp v OR Concepts Fd CA Ill The change of ownership of defendants stock did not constitute an assignment of defendants

GUARANTY SURETY AND INDEMNITY CONTRACTS II GUARANTY CONTRACTS A IN GENERAL Illinois Jur Commercial Law o o Assignability substitution of parties Illinois recognizes the general principle of nonassignability of guaranties n The general rule provides that a guarantor is released from his obligations where the creditor assigns his contract to a third party n However that rule is not applied mechanically rather the facts of each case determine whether the policy underlying the rule applies n The test of whether a guaranty may be transferred is not whether new credit is extended after the transfer but whether the obligations of the parties to the guaranty have thereby changed n The rationale for the rule that a special guaranty is not assignable without the consent of the guarantor stems from the general contract principle that a person may be held only to the precise obligation he undertook n The rule thus rests upon the principle that the assignment would be a material alteration because the surety may have extended his promise because of his reliance on one or the other of the original parties or because the addition of the new party would materially affect the operation of the instrument n A simple assignment of a guaranty pursuant to a contract between a creditorguarantee and a third party is more likely to cause a material alteration in the guarantors obligation than an assignment pursuant to a merger but in either case a court must determine whether the guarantors obligation was materially altered The manner in which an assignment takes place is not determinative n Claims for money arising by virtue of past extensions of credit made in reliance upon a continuing guaranty can be assigned n Eric Gillaspie Enron Building

<10635133.1075842785294.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,eric.gillaspie@enron.com,2001-04-17 02:28:00,China Jonny email from a few weeks agoHotel expenses anywhere from yuan per night USD Totally depends on what hotel you chose and how nice a room you want In general youll probably be choosing to stay in middle tier lodgings Unfortunately hotel rates in China arent cheap When I first travelled through southern China in I budgeted myself yuan USD per night but ended up staying in group dormstyle backpacker rooms and paid much less However you and Cathy probably wont be adopting this approach on your short excursion In Shanghai Ai Ping and I usually stay in an old hotel named the Pujiang built in by a Brit Its strategically placed on the Bund waterfront and is quite decrepit yet funky We pay about yuan for a double bed This is probably the cheapest double in Shanghai and thusly all the backpackers flock here If we want a newer cleaner and more comfortable double we usually pay anywhere between yuan per night USD Because you are a whiteskinned foreigner and in China this automatically means youre a millionaire and because you cant speak Chinese youll probably be quoted the highest fare the hotel clerks can dream up Remember in China every price is negotiable and if you dont play the role of greedy Westerner and bargain for minutes to get a lower price THEY WILL EAT YOU ALIVE If you dont haggle with them over the price you are considered a fool and automatically deemed unworthy of their regard and they will make you pay five times the actual price of the room AND THEN THEY WILL CONSUME YOUR LIVER This is what makes me wary of sending you out on your own with little or no language skills You will be preyed upon by everyone in every business transaction You are not a human you are a dollar sign with two legs in China Basically it goes something like this You walk into a hotel that claims to be of star quality In truth this means that the hotel is probably desperately clinging to a star level You stroll up to the front desk and ask what the room rates are The clerks will give you a schmaltzy brochure with photos of the rooms and a price list AND THEN THEYLL DECIDE WHAT SAUCE TO COOK YOU IN The doublebed room is listed as yuan You then ask the clerks if this is the real price Theyll probably say yes AND WONDER AMONGST THEMSELVES WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO MAKE A SOUP OUT OF YOU You then ask them if they can give you a lower price If they refuse you smile benignly and offer to pay them yuan for one night And then the fun begins AND THEYLL BEGIN TO GORGE THEMSELVES ON YOUR STEAMING INTESTINES Meals anywhere from yuan to yuan cents USD You can get a huge bowl of steaming rice and two big dishes of wokfried bliss for a buck in China You can also go to the other extreme and spend thousands of yuan on a meal if you want to get ridiculous In China food is religion They dissed Buddha adopted Mao as supreme being for a couple decades and then retreated to their one true love eating Every Chinese city has about billion restaurants ranging from hovels that cater to the peasantconstruction workers these are the ones I frequented but Ai Ping wont let me go anymore to the new rich Dont worry about food prices Youll probably be choosing semidecent establishments Expect to pay between yuan per meal USD Speaking of meals did you know that the Australian aborigines LOVED to eat Chinese seamen Its actually very well documented The Chinese sailed throughout the South China Sea which borders the Philippines Indonesia Vietnam etc It seems that the aborigines thought the Chinese had very sweettasting meat and considered them a delicacy They were a highly soughtafter food item years ago My Australian boss uses this small fact against his Chinese students whenever they begin to spew racist theories about the cosmic worthlessness of aboriginal cultures in Australia and it horrifies them Airfare cheaper than the states Let me get exact airfares from Ai Ping She made a list of fares between cities but its not available at the moment Trains cheap To give you an idea TaiyuanWuxi hourshardsleeper class is about yuan USD Basically this train goes from Shanxi province northcentral China to Jiangsu province southeast China Can supply you with more examples if you need them Money bring travellers checks and some cash fiftyhundred dollar bills Yes some bigger hotels and banks offer ATM services but dont rely on credit in China Duration of stay your call Sounds like you are dealing with two busy work schedules Come up with a trip that youre both comfortable with You should see some places other than Shanghai and Qingdao but you neednt create a breakneck schedule either Destinations talk it over with the folks Do you want

continuous temperature static pressure and differenti al pressure monitoring will be applicable If electronic measurement is used in conjunction with onsite chromatograph continuous monitoring of specific gravity will be applicable otherwise the volumes computed using a fixed value specific gravity factor shall be corrected to reflect the actual specific gravity of the flowing Gas as determined by a chromatographic analysis of the sample accumulated during the same period of flow or in th e case of spot samples the specific gravity factor determined by chromatographic analysis shall be applied to volumes delivered during the succeeding chart periods The correction for deviation from the Ideal Gas Laws shall be computed and applied to volumes calculated by electronic measurement devices Specific gravity and Btu shall be determined by such methods as may be developed by Houston through use of a continuous Gas samp le accumulator on premises analysis or by spot samples taken at the Receipt Points and Delivery Points at intervals determined to be appropriate by Houston Results from a continuous sampler shall be used to calculate volumes delivered during the same period in which the sample was accumulate d provided however that Houston reserves the right to adopt the practice of using the Btu content measured for a period prior to the Month of Gas flow in calculating the quantity of Gas transported during a given Month Results from a spot sample shall be used to calculate volumes during the subsequent period until another sample is taken The arithmetical average of the continuous temperature recorded during each chart period the factor for specific gravity according to the latest test therefor and the correction for deviation from Ideal Gas Laws applicable during each chart period shall be used to make proper computations of volumes hereunder The gross heatin g value Btu content used shall be determined by adjusting the Btu content measured to reflect the actual water vapor content of the Gas delivered at a temperature of sixty degrees Fahrenheit F at an absolute pressure of fourteen and sixtyfive onehundredths pounds per square inch absolute If the water vapor content of the Gas delivered is equal to or less than seven pounds per one million cubic feet Mcf the Gas shall be considered dry The volume of Gas measured shall be multiplied by the applicable Btu content for such Gas either that measured for the Month of Gas flow or for the designated period of Btu measurement that may occur prior to the actual Month of Gas flow to determine the total volume of Gas in MMBtu In the event that the aggregate quantity of Gas tendered by Shipper and accepted by Houston under this Agreement during any Month at a given Receipt Point equals a quantity less than the product of i MMBt u per Day times ii the number of Days in the Month during which Shipper tendered Gas to Houston in accordance with a confirmed nomination then Houston may at its election charge Shipper a metering fee Metering Fee of for such Month with respect to each such Receipt Point Eric Gillaspie Enron Building

<13532765.1075842815516.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,eric.gillaspie@enron.com,2001-04-17 02:28:00,China Jonny email from a few weeks agoHotel expenses anywhere from yuan per night USD Totally depends on what hotel you chose and how nice a room you want In general youll probably be choosing to stay in middle tier lodgings Unfortunately hotel rates in China arent cheap When I first travelled through southern China in I budgeted myself yuan USD per night but ended up staying in group dormstyle backpacker rooms and paid much less However you and Cathy probably wont be adopting this approach on your short excursion In Shanghai Ai Ping and I usually stay in an old hotel named the Pujiang built in by a Brit Its strategically placed on the Bund waterfront and is quite decrepit yet funky We pay about yuan for a double bed This is probably the cheapest double in Shanghai and thusly all the backpackers flock here If we want a newer cleaner and more comfortable double we usually pay anywhere between yuan per night USD Because you are a whiteskinned foreigner and in China this automatically means youre a millionaire and because you cant speak Chinese youll probably be quoted the highest fare the hotel clerks can dream up Remember in China every price is negotiable and if you dont play the role of greedy Westerner and bargain for minutes to get a lower price THEY WILL EAT YOU ALIVE If you dont haggle with them over the price you are considered a fool and automatically deemed unworthy of their regard and they will make you pay five times the actual price of the room AND THEN THEY WILL CONSUME YOUR LIVER This is what makes me wary of sending you out on your own with little or no language skills You will be preyed upon by everyone in every business transaction You are not a human you are a dollar sign with two legs in China Basically it goes something like this You walk into a hotel that claims to be of star quality In truth this means that the hotel is probably desperately clinging to a star level You stroll up to the front desk and ask what the room rates are The clerks will give you a schmaltzy brochure with photos of the rooms and a price list AND THEN THEYLL DECIDE WHAT SAUCE TO COOK YOU IN The doublebed room is listed as yuan You then ask the clerks if this is the real price Theyll probably say yes AND WONDER AMONGST THEMSELVES WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO MAKE A SOUP OUT OF YOU You then ask them if they can give you a lower price If they refuse you smile benignly and offer to pay them yuan for one night And then the fun begins AND THEYLL BEGIN TO GORGE THEMSELVES ON YOUR STEAMING INTESTINES Meals anywhere from yuan to yuan cents USD You can get a huge bowl of steaming rice and two big dishes of wokfried bliss for a buck in China You can also go to the other extreme and spend thousands of yuan on a meal if you want to get ridiculous In China food is religion They dissed Buddha adopted Mao as supreme being for a couple decades and then retreated to their one true love eating Every Chinese city has about billion restaurants ranging from hovels that cater to the peasantconstruction workers these are the ones I frequented but Ai Ping wont let me go anymore to the new rich Dont worry about food prices Youll probably be choosing semidecent establishments Expect to pay between yuan per meal USD Speaking of meals did you know that the Australian aborigines LOVED to eat Chinese seamen Its actually very well documented The Chinese sailed throughout the South China Sea which borders the Philippines Indonesia Vietnam etc It seems that the aborigines thought the Chinese had very sweettasting meat and considered them a delicacy They were a highly soughtafter food item years ago My Australian boss uses this small fact against his Chinese students whenever they begin to spew racist theories about the cosmic worthlessness of aboriginal cultures in Australia and it horrifies them Airfare cheaper than the states Let me get exact airfares from Ai Ping She made a list of fares between cities but its not available at the moment Trains cheap To give you an idea TaiyuanWuxi hourshardsleeper class is about yuan USD Basically this train goes from Shanxi province northcentral China to Jiangsu province southeast China Can supply you with more examples if you need them Money bring travellers checks and some cash fiftyhundred dollar bills Yes some bigger hotels and banks offer ATM services but dont rely on credit in China Duration of stay your call Sounds like you are dealing with two busy work schedules Come up with a trip that youre both comfortable with You should see some places other than Shanghai and Qingdao but you neednt create a breakneck schedule either Destinations talk it over with the folks Do you want history or nature Northern or Southern China Han culture or minority cultures Villages or cities Think it over and get back to me From Jgillaspieci To Jon W Gillaspie CC Eric A Gillaspie RODGER GILLASPIE Subject Our Journey to the Land of Heavens Date Fri Mar Jonny Cathy and I are trying to plan for the upcoming expenses in China What should we expect to pay for hotels for airfare Shanghai to Quingdao any trains meals etc etc If you could give me ballpark on these items it would be very helpful Also Im assuming that there is not an ATM on very corner or even credit card machines in

installation Eric this is a copy of the scope of work that I forwarded to Pat Flavin It will need some cleanup to put it into the contract but this should give you a flavor of what I am working toward Thanks Chris Sonneborn phone cut here Timeline Purge and pack pipeline First flow to CIGWIC SCADA total meter sites SCADA Software versions Enron Modbus CM Q Ver c Daniels GC Comm Q Ver c Enron EFM Q Rev f At North end of pipeline LysiteLost Cabin production office There are three meter stations at the north end of the Lost Creek pipeline They are the Fred Novotny Keith Baker and the Madden West meters Each of these is a Fisher ROC which needs to be set up with an MDS radio and a yaggi antenna They will be polled using a master radio to be located at the Burlington Resources Lysite office nearby This master radios antenna will be mounted on a shared tower with the existing BR master radio system for the Madden Field area The Lost Creek radio will operate on a different hopping frequency Poll requests will be sent from Houston via VSAT andor analog phone A phone modem and a VSAT are to be installed at BRs Lysite production office and connected to the master radio through a PanelTec device The VSAT should have the master port Each of the RTUs is installed in a portable building along with a chromatograph and other equipment V power should already be available at each of the sites At Sand Draw A small meter mmscfd will be located at Sand Draw WY This is another Fisher ROC We would like to install a cellphone modem for this device as it will be polled infrequently and is not of a critical nature Again power should already be available onsite Lost Creek does not require analog dialaround capabilities at this meter At South end of line Wamsutter Plant There are two meter stations a plant and a compressor that must be monitored here To do this we have two Fisher ROC s and a Rosemount Delta V One Fisher ROC and the Delta V are installed at the Lost Creek Wamsutter plant site The other RTU will be installed at the CIGWIC interconnect site approximately feet away This remote RTUs data will be collected using an MDS radio system and yaggi antenna back to the Lost Creek plant site where a master radio with a degree antenna is to be installed All three devices will be polled from Houston via either VSAT K dedicated line or standard phone system The current debate over the VSAT versus the K line will be decided shortly based on decisions by Enron IT security Greg Lind should have more details soon Again we would like to install a PanelTec to provide dialaround capabilities should we have problems with the VSATK line The RTU for the CIGWIC interconnect is currently in a chromatograph building at our staging area and is programmed to handle flow through an orifice tube meter The CIG and WIC meters are ultrasonics This will require a reprogramming of the RTU Is this something that can be done by HMS or should I simply order a brand new RTU for the CIGWIC interconnect and have it built correctly from scratch Whether I use the one we already own or order a new one I will have to have RTUs for both the CIGWIC interconnect as well as the chromatograph building I am talking about raiding Thoughts Either way I believe this is a tight if not downright impossible timeline to meet for this particular interconnect point in terms of SCADA telemetry Please correct me if I am wrong Finally we are working on the required legal documentation to allow Lost Creek personnel and contractors access to the CIGWIC meter site to perform the installation Equipment Enron Mike Moore will place the orders for the VSATS and phone lines Pat I believe that you know how this works normally with the breakout between Hughes and commisioning the VSAT and HMS and connecting the RTU and VSAT This piece is currently on hold as we are looking at the possibility of using a K line at Wamsutter and CDPD at the Lysite production office Enron will provide the MDS radios and masters Enron will provide antennas for the MDS radios at the RTUs the Lysite production office and at the Wamsutter plant site Enron will provide the cellphone modem and cell service for the Sand Draw meter site Enron will provide both of the PanelTecs Standard phone modems are already installed on all of the Fisher ROCs One of these should be used at the Lysite office for dialaround capabilities Another one should be used at the Wamsutter plant to provide dialaround capabilites Installation HMS will install and test all radio systems including cabling and the antennas at the Wamsutter and Lysite production office sites HMS will perform final connections between VSATS and PanelTecs and test communications throughput if necessary HMS will perform final

Illinois the courts have generally held a contract may be assigned to another party if the contract is silent on whether the contract is assignable However the case law fails to specifically discuss if consent of the nonassigning party is required for the assignment to be valid However I think it is reasonable to interpret the omission of such a consent requirement in the discussion on assignment to conclude that consent is not required See the discussion below ILLINOIS JURISPRUDENCE Copyright LEXIS Law Publishing a div of Reed Elsevier Inc Thomas D Nusbaum JD COMMERCIAL LAW PART TWO UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE CHAPTER ARTICLE SALES III PERFORMANCE A OVERVIEW OF OBLIGATIONS Illinois Jur Commercial Law o o Delegation or assignment A party may perform a duty under a sales contract through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having the original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach n All rights of the seller or buyer may be assigned unless otherwise agreed n This may include rights under a warranty such that the assignee of a warrantees rights under an express warranty if the assignment is otherwise valid succeeds to all those rights and thus stands in privity with the warrantor Such an assignees privity would generally enable it to sue for economic loss and consequential damages just as an original contracting party might do n Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of the contract is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignors performance n However an assignment is barred where it would materially change the duty of the other party increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by the contract or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignors due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite an agreement otherwise n because no delegation of any performance is involved n An assignment of the contract of all my rights under the contract or in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances as in an assignment for security indicate the contrary is also a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor The acceptance of such an assignment by the assignee constitutes a promise to perform those duties This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract n Comment Article of the Uniform Commercial Code n takes no position on the possibility of extending some recognition or power to the original parties to work out normal commercial readjustments of the contract in the case of financing assignments even after the original obligor has been notified of the assignment This question is dealt with in Article n On the other hand the other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee n Digest Data Case Authorities Assignments to jobbers were not forbidden where agreements assignment provision made only one limitation on dealers right to assign and no limitations on franchisor Beachler v Amoco Oil Co Fd CA Ill The sale of the defendant corporation was not violative of a clause in the parties

GUARANTY SURETY AND INDEMNITY CONTRACTS II GUARANTY CONTRACTS A IN GENERAL Illinois Jur Commercial Law o o Assignability substitution of parties Illinois recognizes the general principle of nonassignability of guaranties n The general rule provides that a guarantor is released from his obligations where the creditor assigns his contract to a third party n However that rule is not applied mechanically rather the facts of each case determine whether the policy underlying the rule applies n The test of whether a guaranty may be transferred is not whether new credit is extended after the transfer but whether the obligations of the parties to the guaranty have thereby changed n The rationale for the rule that a special guaranty is not assignable without the consent of the guarantor stems from the general contract principle that a person may be held only to the precise obligation he undertook n The rule thus rests upon the principle that the assignment would be a material alteration because the surety may have extended his promise because of his reliance on one or the other of the original parties or because the addition of the new party would materially affect the operation of the instrument n A simple assignment of a guaranty pursuant to a contract between a creditorguarantee and a third party is more likely to cause a material alteration in the guarantors obligation than an assignment pursuant to a merger but in either case a court must determine whether the guarantors obligation was materially altered The manner in which an assignment takes place is not determinative n Claims for money arising by virtue of past extensions of credit made in reliance upon a continuing guaranty can be assigned n Eric Gillaspie Enron Building
