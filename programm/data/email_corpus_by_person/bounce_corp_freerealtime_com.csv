an AOL address you must click on this link htmlfrtsp ecialindexhtm IMAGE IMAGE SPECIAL ALERT HyperDynamics Corp OTC BB HYPD December IMAGE REASONS TO BUY HYPD IMAGE HYPD is well positioned to grow its business substantially to achieve a niche market dominance HYPD opened up access to significant and recurring longterm revenue streams HYPDS SCS acquisition represents an ideal fitsynergy will offer an industry s uperior solution for the oil and gas industry exploration process HY PDs Revenue potential estimated to exceed million per year for fiscal year HYPD has brand new tier data facility that is cost effectiv e for companies to outsource HYPD has an ATT Dedicated Entrance facilit y ATT laid fiber to HYPDS data center that can be scaled to an OC Hug e broadband capacity SYMBOL HYPD SHARES OUTSTANDING mm FLOAT est mm WEEK HIGHLOW SHORT TERM PRICE PROJ MONTH PRICE PROJ IMAGE HYPD is an Intel Premium Provid er licensed to sell the highestlevel processors HYPD is a Great Pla ins and Microsoft Solution Provider HYPD is a Computer Associates partne r New management team with proven track record of business success HYPDS business model is targeted on obtaining recurring revenue streams IMAGE INVESTMENT SUMMARY HYPD is a premier provider of comprehens ive integrated technology services ITSP and solutions for a client base in the rapidly growing ITSP marketplace for smalltomedium sized business es HYPD is capable of handling a wide range of its clients unique ITSP needs with services ranging from conventional IT services to enterprise m igration and comprehensive IT HyperSource solutions outsourcing all of a c lients ebusiness needs HYPD has positioned its future business strateg y around the development of uniquely designed Integrated Technology Centers ITCs which will offer client companies comprehensive bundled ITSP servi ces and solutions integrated with its state of the art facilities The fir st Houston based ITC has recently begun operations and is offering its cli ents a full and expansive range of outsourced IT and backoffice services HYPDs first ITC is designed around an ATT Dedicated Entrance Facility wit h onnet redundant fiber provisioning offering scalable bandwidth up to an OC and beyond Th is comprehensive Tier hosting center enables HYPD to offer clients complete endtoend IT services in a fully redundant and s eamless environment Through recently developed Hyperserve connection prod ucts HYPD has been able to improve the functionality of its services by of fering clients remote server appliances that connect to the ITC Bolstered by strategic alliances and strong working relationships with major players in technology and telecommunications including Microsoft Intel ATT an d Great Plains HYPD has demonstrated a superior ability to cater to the un ique needs and limitations of smalltomedium sized businesses effectively creating a business model that partners HYPDS success with that of its cl ients Utilizing this innovative approach HYPD should be able to grow its business in conjunction with client business growth and position itself a s the ITSP provider of choice for an emerging market of small and mi d siz ed companies Within the Houston region and with this small and mid sized target market HYPD is well positioned to grow its business substantially over the near to intermediate term and achieve niche market dominance withi n an appreciable time period HYPD has recently aimed its fullservice IT hosting business model towards the unique needs and growth strategies of small to mediumsized businesses a rapidly growing market that is relativ ely undeserved by major IT service providers such as Level UUNet and Sp rint HYPD has based this approach around the potentially lucrative lon gterm revenue streams afforded through association with growing companies For example HYPD has recently initiated longterm Hypersource IT hosting arrangements with Eagle Wireless International and Premiere Media Group Eagle Wireless is a leading supplier of broadband wired and wireless equipm ent and services for a variety of markets including the Internet digital settop boxes and wireless convergence products and is anticipated to rea ch national market penetration within the next several years As the clien t company grows its business over the next several years the highly scalab le nature of the Hyperdynamics IT hosting model will enable the Company to offer additional needed services readily while retaining high margins By being able to refine and scale up client IT services in a quick time peri od and for minimal additional expenses HYPD has opened up access to signi ficant and recurring longterm revenue streams from smaller and midsized b usiness clients Moreover HYPD offers client companies an unprecedented d egree of personalized attention and customization when compared to major n ational ITSP providers The infrastructure of HYPDS first ITC design ed to support endtoend ITSP services can also be leveraged for easy and s mart diversification With its recent acquisition of Seacon Computer System s Inc SCS HYPD has been able to enter the vertical seismic data manage ment market Thus in addition to its horizontal industry approach for ITSP services new and innovative vertically oriented business opportunities of fering diversified revenue streams are coming to HYPD For example SCS is a seismic data management company that has developed a unique and cost s aving method for transferring seismic and geologic data for oil and gas com panies on mm and mm magnetic tapes to state of the art DVD optical stor age The current methods of storing this type of data on magnetic tapes ar e time consuming prohibitively expensive outdated the technology is over years old and inefficient SCS will enable clients in the expanding oil and gas industry to migrate the estimated billion magnetic tapes that degrade in years to DVD storage with an expected lifespan of over years at a cheaper price point and with easy accessibility The SCS acqu isition moreover provides an ideal strategic fit to the core data center business of HYPD and opens up significant and highly lucrative revenue str eams SCS will derive revenue s from three principal sources convers ion of existing tapes to superior DVD storage technologies accessing D VD data through HYPDs ITC facility and a vertical ASP approach to rem ote seismic interpretation processing of data through the Houston ITC using technical and hardware support from Intel In addition to opening up an i nnovative and new business through the SCS acquisition HYPD believes that it will be able to apply this type of vertical ASP approach towards other t arget industries such as insurance services either through additional acq uisitions or joint ventures HYPDs projected revenue and business gro wth will be largely driven by several principal catalysts including c ontinuing to implement its full service IT hosting solution Hypersource t hrough the Houstonbased stateoftheart Integrated Technology Center and future planned ITCs in regional markets orienting its ITSP solutions and services towards the unique needs of expanding smallandmedium sized businesses entering into longterm recurring revenue contracts by gro wing with its clients and providing additional services at higher margins as these client businesses expand opening up new and lucrat ive reven ue streams through its subsidiary SCS and integrating this business opport unity through internal synergies with its core IT hosting and services busi ness and positioning itself within a competitively underserved marketp lace for ITSP services and products for small and midsized business client s VALUATION Consolidation within the ITSP industry has been a consi stent theme within the past several years Major ITSP hosting players have been acquired in a series of recognizable transactions Notable among the se has been the acquisition of Verio by NTT and the acquisition of Digex b y WorldCom Within the remaining players in the IT hosting industry remai ning players have been devastated by the decline in valuations accorded ba sed on consistently increasing earnings deficits and increased cost of serv ices provided In addition these players have suffered due to aggressive acquisition strategies undertaken during the previous two years that have n ot proven out as significant growth catalysts and increased debt structures By contrast HYPD has pursued a conservative growth strategy with limite d acquisitions carefully calculated to directly and immediately benefit agg regate revenues and earnings Relative to comparative companies within the ITSP industry HYPD could realize superior growth in business and earnings over the neartointermediate term period A grouping of comparable compa nies within this sector currently trades at an average price to sales multi ple of X On a forward looking basis using FY revenue and earni ngs estimates for the Company fiscal year starts July this r epresents roughly a fold premium to current trading levels Thus when a pplying the comparative groupings average price to earnings and price to r evenue multiples to HYPD we can arrive at a relative valuation of per share over the next months SUMMARY Aggressive investors look ing for aboveaverage return potential on a portion of their investment cap ital should give HYPD a serious look Management of the Company headed by CEO Kent Watts are highly talented and educated in their technical areas We believe HYPD has assembled an astute goal oriented sophisticated tea m committed to HYPD becoming very very successful Investors at current l evels may be rewarded in the short term and beyond as HYPDS business pla n is executed HYPD may very well be one of the stock markets best secret s IMAGE Disclaimer IMAGE Marketwizardalerts MWA publishes rep orts providing information on selected companies that MWA believes

Growing Companies by Denver Business Journal Strong management tea m led by an established team of oil gas leaders IMAGE Leading Petroleum Engineering firm reports GASCO ENERGYs unrisked future net rev enues of billion from Utah wells alone Analyst forecasts shar e price target Gasco Energy Inc is an oil gas company whose natural gas properties could potentially begin producing in the billiondollar ran ge but is still trading under per share IMAGERecently Gasco Ene rgys OTCBB GASE properties and future revenues in Utah were independen tly evaluated and estimated by Netherland Sewell Associates NSAI a yearold international petroleum consulting firm NSAI wwwnetherlands ewellcom has worked with hundreds of top financial institutions from Ba nk of America to Credit Suisse as well as major oil and gas companies from Exxon to Shell The report states that the estimated unrisked future n et revenue on GASEs interest will most likely produce BILLION Ple ase note that the report discusses NET revenues which are calculated by d educting state production and ad valorem taxes operating expenses and ALL future capital costs from the gross revenues While these are net revenue s as opposed to net income this can mean great news for GASEs existing and future shareholders In evaluating probabilities of occurrence NS AIs report states there is very little risk of not encountering gas in t his basincentered gas accumulation In fact according to NSAI the prope rtys most likely present worth is million discounted at based on average NYMEX prices for the period to Wellhead prices used in the report are per MMBtu escalated per year to a maximum of per MMBtu Foremost among GASEs strategic partnerships is GASEs agreement with Phillips Petroleum NYSEP GASE and Phillips have been w orking to maximize shareholder value on the Utah properties GASE has also teamed with Halliburton Co NYSEHAL to potentially drill and complete up to wells within the same area IN ADDITION to the interest in Ut ah properties GASE also recently reported that it has teamed up with Burl ington Resources NYSE BR one of the worlds largest independent oil a nd gas companies to explore and develop a series of natural gas plays in Wyoming This significantly enlarges GASEs land mass which may further increase the companys net present worth According to the U S Geol ogical

million With its high probability Utah stake AND its Wyoming partnership with Burlington GASE is now divers ified AND showing huge growth potential BILLION DOLLAR QUESTION How quickly will GASEs stock price start to reflect its real value As the co mpany is still trading on the OTCBB maybe it hasnt been able to attract institutional investors who price stocks based on their real value When t hey learn about the recent developments GASEs valuation could potentiall y change overnight URGENT With an application for listing pending an d the type of assets GASE possesses it may be only a matter of

eastern part of China and for Cyrixs CPU in Shanghai A population of over million people GChoices sales in year were million with in pretax net income audited In the first months of GChoice generated approximately million in sales Management expects the company to generate million in ann ualized sales by the end of this calendar year and profitable Recently Acquired Propamedia Inc a streaming

sidiary eSpectus Systems Inc entering multibillion dollar direct email market New management team with proven track record of business succes s Potential company spinoffs mean shareholders gain stock in additio nal companies IMAGE INVESTMENT SUMMARY When we consider GTEC we must understand the business model and huge potential in the Companys va luation GTEC develops invests in and operates high technology related c ompanies in the US China Taiwan Hong Kong and Singapore GTECs strateg y includes the internal development and operation of subsidiaries within t he Companys corporate family as well as investment in other high technol ogy companies directly and through other venture capital arrangements Th e Companys strategy also envisions and promotes opportunities for synergis tic business relationships among all of the companies within its family We believe the Company story will get a lot of attention in the investmen t community in the coming months as China joins the WTO GTEC is a brand new publicly trading company via a reversemerger with Newagecitiescom I nc NACT The Companys mission is to accelerate the success of technolo gy companies by acquisition and development as evidenced by GTECs recen t acquisitions GTEC has been growing at an exciting rate and the foundati on has been laid for spectacular growth in its earnings and sales in the c oming quarters In a world in which tech companies are losing money lurk s around every corner of the market its refreshing to find a technology company that offers real success for growth in revenues and earnings C hinas pending entry into the World Trade Organization WTO will generate enormous opportunities within the service sector and give impetus to the countrys already robust economic growth The agreement on Chinas WTO en try paves the way for China to join the world trade body and opens up Chin as economy to more foreign trade and investment in sectors ranging from b anking and automobiles to telecommunications and IT services and products A recent survey by the Ministry of the Information Industry showed China s IT industry is robust in sharp contrast to the slowdown in the growth of the worlds IT industry Statistics show that the sales volume of IT pr oducts for the past six months has reached billion yuan US billi on nationwide up percent over the same period for the previous year Registered Internet users have exceeded million in the country an av erage annual increase of percent It is estimated that China will spend one trillion yuan US billion over the next five years to spur its i nformation industry according to a meeting of Ministry of Information Ind ustry held in Beijing on October Chinas information industry is to develop steadily with its value added accounting for seven percent of the nations gross domestic product by the year said sources from t he ministry Through the information industry will become a major pi llar industry of the country The Chinese government will make great effor ts to push forward and give priority to the application of information tec hnology as a way of boosting economic and social development Recently GTECs subsidiary entered into a distribution agreement with Intel Cor poration INTC Cyrix and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD Under the t erms of the agreement GTECs subsidiary has exclusive distribution rights for Intel CPU and AMD CPUs in the eastern part of China GTEC has also be en awarded the exclusive distribution rights for Cyrixs CPU in Shanghai The Eastern part of China is believed to have the most dynamic economy in the greater China marketplace VALUATION A penny stock with mult idollar potential trading today for about cents per share but in our opinion has longterm potential for huge gains The stock may be one of the years BIG surprises making its current status as an undiscovered sto ck a rare timing opportunity for investors Dont overlook this one We no t only consider GTEC an attractive Emerging Growth Company in our opin ion but also a Value Stock in view of its revenues and earnings its cur rent price is about per share We believe that GTEC has targeted a c reative niche in a hot sector One way to value a company is to look a t its peers in the industry One public company listed on the OTCBB is pre tty much in the same line of business as GTEC It is the Hartcourt Compani es Inc OTCBB HRCT that has about million market cap with only million in annualized revenues and losing money Even if GTEC were to trade at the same market cap as HRCT GTEC would then be valued at p er share If the stock trades to its peers valuation ratios such as PE a nd price to sales ratios GTEC should be valued at about per share HRC T has a HUGE following on Raging Bull over messages GTEC has v irtually NONE slightly over posts In our opinion UNDERVALUED AND OV ERLOOKED The GTEC acquisitionspinoff schedule in should add a c onsiderable number of technology companies According to management this will bring the projected revenue of GTEC by fiscal to million and net income of million or earnings per share of on the basis o f million shares outstanding GTEC intends to acquire other businesss b y issuing restricted stock If GTEC were to trade in the marketplace at times earnings then this would value GTEC at per share If GTEC were to trade in the marketplace at times sales this would value GTEC a t per share HRCT trades today at about times annualized sales SUMMARY We believe GTEC is well positioned to take advantage of the changes in the technology industry We believe these changes are s till in their earliest stages affecting primarily the small technology co mpanies to date In other words we believe GTEC is situated nicely to rid e out the slowing domestic economy In our opinion we dont see much down side for GTEC that is traded around per share IMAGE Disclaim er IMAGE Marketwizardalerts MWA publishes reports providing informat ion on selected

community becomes aware of STTNs HUGE upside potential as an attractive Emerging Growth Company With STTN trading today at around per share based on STTNs projections we believe t hat by fiscal year STTN will earn Million Dollars on Millio n in gross revenues or cents per share Applying a conservative mul tiple of times earnings less then STTNs estimated growth rate STTN should be valued at per share near term Looking out to fiscal yea r which Wall Street Analysts are currently doing STTN projects cents per share in earnings using the same price earnings multiple of this could peg STTNs stock at over per share over the next m onths At STTNs current price of around per share STTN appears to be extremely undervalued and potentially has HUGE UPSIDE SUMMARY With lower interest rates individual investors will seek an alternative for better returns In our opinion the next time around individual inve stors will seek a more even playing field with the big boys in executin g their trades Individual investors are more educated today regarding tra de execution and should migrate to a Direct Access Trading platform such a n STTN This should make STTNs business and STTNs stock much
