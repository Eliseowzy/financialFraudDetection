comments As discussed it may be useful to see how the doorstep and BRM approaches interact anything written down that explains it I am going to proceed with driving accountability for op risk assessment to my controllers we should discuss at the global offsite if it is worth formalising this process I am totally open to ideas on this Lastly in conversations with Shawn we agreed to delay the full planning for European BRM whilst we finalise this years reports lots of activity due in October Thanks for the call yesterday Mike Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Shona Wilson ENRON To Mike CT cc Shawn nron Fernley CT Sally CT Cassandra nron Subject Re Transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses an internal approach to internal audit Dear Mike Thanks for your insight In the past few months we have established a detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with BRM Through my calls the past week Ive been trying to update you so we can determine how best to coordinate the Enron Europe work as well as get an understanding of what resources you can supply for this global initiative My next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to determine their skill set and what locationscommodities theyd be best to work on Ill send you an updated schedule once Ive finalized this Thanks Shona Mike CT AM To Shawn nron Shona nron cc Fernley CT Sally CT Subject Transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses an internal approach to internal audit Shawn Shona We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is we will need to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely Aims Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive ongoing communication and a structure of measurement and tracking Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused by it All elements of implementing completing and reviewing internal control should generate defined output We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and origination controls we have defined the control structure for trading offices agency offices and origination offices and we must police our labelling for each office The output from Enrons perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be discussed at controlgovernance meetings eg at SallyTedFernleys level and at the audit committee level the important issue here is that every list must be extracted from an agreed database of issues different lists have different amounts of filtering applied judgementally by seniorexperienced staff The output from AAs perspective is their internal controls audit opinion based upon our database and our review and management process of it Trading Process monthly Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction cycle rating made by business controller is red amber green with trend indicator of static improving or declining see attachment for full listing Monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management see attachment you will notice that this

operational risk to an acceptable level Prioritisation made for BRM which functions NOT BUSINESS UNITS require external independent review highly leveraging the above self assessment and doorstep processes could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal governance process most likely reviews completed on functions that assessed as concerns across multiple business such as FX exposure

efficient way to reference this effort as an Enronwide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded is great and I would hope to reference it via the reporting process that shona is trying to roll out I will work with Shona who undoubtedly would want to send out in your name the global notification of our aims Mike Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Sally Beck To Mike CT cc Subject Re a note being sent out under John Sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note I read your note back to Shona and I understand Johns desire to put a reminder in front of people including commerical staff members about the need for operating standards If this is the best time to put that in writing for Europe then by all means go forward with that If there is an efficient way to reference this effort as an Enronwide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded then that would be great It simply helps put the London initiative in the context of an Enronwide effort that we all feel is important Sally Mike Jordan AM To Sally CT cc Fernley CT Subject Re a note being sent out under John Sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note Comments in red Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Sally Beck To Mike CT cc Fernley CT Subject Re a note being sent out under John Sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards but I wonder about the most appropriate timing enough of a global message it is a European note and the means of delivery On the means of delivery I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication yes and in addition a letter to be sent under Johns name if so to whom will the letter be sent Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article Yes apologies if there is confusion With regard to a global message I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities With these operating standards implemented worldwide we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across Agreed but the note was targeted at Europe would welcome the opportunity to work on this with you and Shona Finally a question regarding timing The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated Shona took this to do after Brents return to Houston for comments to all business controllers I dont believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed understand and have implemented these standards And not to belittle the process of creating the standards the tough part and the real meat behind this will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buyin and commitment to these standards and hopefully our first draft of a meaningful exception report Can we discuss this please see separate note from me to Shona Sorry that this response looks so long I have been interrupted times while responding so I hope that it makes sense Thanks for sharing this with me Since you asked for input I hope that you dont mind that I gave you some Sally Certainly not and thanks Mike Jordan AM To Fernley CT Sally CT cc Subject a note being sent out under John Sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note Fernley Sally Off and on with Jackie Gentles help I have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards itself a one page summary We are in the final stages of this process where we draft a cover letter for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash the Enron Europe

any further information please call otherwise I will forward updates as they are completed Regards Mike ISSUE The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure OBSF pre yearend to meet Enron requirements for gearing ratios Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants these being bearer documents it does present an issue when physical metal the value o f which depends upon brand and location is placed into the facility Given t he hard deadline of yearend the operational support of this process initially took place on spreadsheets The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business should not be underestimated The process of moving material off and on balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement s particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in the AS With the specified functionality it is believed that all operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed satisfactorily The core functionality which was due prior to the yearend was released during January but was subsequently found to have introduced bugs t o the integrated business control processes Whilst an improvement on having no OBSF functionality the bugs have had an increasingly negative effe ct on the control environment compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a guaranteed delivery for the bug fixes and non core reporting functionality This has given rise to the following concerns There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at a brand location level to coordination records the global position is reconciled however It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EMCL as a PL on spread moves from Cash to months positions and related cash to months provisions can not be produced by the system and must be estimate d and b System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values These concerns are compounded by the following The most experienced AS IT developer for the EMCL business has resigned He is currently working his months notice which will expire in July The most experienced AS IT developer on the EML side of the business h as also resigned He left in January There is no documentation for the AS It is therefore difficult for experienced AS programmers to get upto speed on the system Conclusion It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the AS system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays The current situation has arisen due to nondelivery of IT

Fernley CT Andrew CT Howard nron Nigel nron Mark CT Subject Merchanting Metals Update The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update see attached email was to provide a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage spread and brand and location a timely substantiation of stock on balance sheet forward MTM debtors and creditor balances OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany account Despite the best efforts of IT continuing problems with the AS application a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values Consequently I need to inform you of andor require your approval for the following I will discuss with AA the following that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to data issues above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model simplifications that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses AS on screen enquiries and the formal global position report these differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA within the audit timetable an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped see MO work The creation of an incentive payment pool possibly via personal best awards for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to meet the above stated objectives The signoff for additional permanent Enron headcount who will duplicate certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing Traffic staff A reconciling difference of mm exists between the reported DPR and the final accounting pl as generated on the AS We will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system pl as a result of data or system valuation problems within the month end reporting timeframe However this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system pl values with traders The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet reduced where economically viable until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows the stock circularisation initiated for close of business rd with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by trafficcoordination an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the th replacing planned rd review due to system issues requiring full download of contract detail for later reference reconciliation of stock movements between rd and th sample tests of vanilla forward transactions detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to Barclays documentation spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually created position analysis the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our cut off and substantiation analysis the debtorscreditors partial

risk for the Merchanting Metals business Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility OBSF which commenced two weeks before the year end The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AAs signoff for the facility late in the year end audit The discovery of a number of bugs within the AS Merchanting code arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality which compounded the operational burden of supporting the OBSF The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays and AA The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus gain comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q DPR and business balance sheet The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and effectively decoupled from the higher risk higher benefit Brokerage implementation benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting developers The ARAP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process tracking cash settlement funding data to working capital components for all Metals businesses An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q covering gross tonnage spread positions and summarised analyses for brand and locations The necessary report functionality should be available within the AS however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBAexcel reports outside of the AS but using AS data downloads User requests for additional AS functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of Q following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF A resubstantiation of the full Q DPR will be completed by the Risk control staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q open and Q close A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q audit timetable which incorporates A full circularisation of inventory balances and matching to source documentation within Enron Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances by third party inspectors where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basis Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced positions report spot checking the key position report signed off by the traders Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase and to AS Barclays account A risk based debtors review matching to source documentation where applicable and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements A full substantiation of creditors to internal contract commitments or external documentation invoicesrequest for payment A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during April If you have any questions please call me on x Regards Mike

Corp From Sally Beck To Mike CT cc Subject Re a note being sent out under John Sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note I read your note back to Shona and I understand Johns desire to put a reminder in front of people including commerical staff members about the need for operating standards If this is the best time to put that in writing for Europe then by all means go forward with that If there is an efficient way to reference this effort as an Enronwide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded then that would be great It simply helps put the London initiative in the context of an Enronwide effort that we all feel is important Sally Mike Jordan AM To Sally CT cc Fernley CT Subject Re a note being sent out under John Sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note Comments in red Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Sally Beck To Mike CT cc Fernley CT Subject Re a note being sent out under John Sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards but I wonder about the most appropriate timing enough of a global message it is a European note and the means of delivery On the means of delivery I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication yes and in addition a letter to be sent under Johns name if so to whom will the letter be sent Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article Yes apologies if there is confusion With regard to a global message I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities With these operating standards implemented worldwide we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across Agreed but the note was targeted at Europe would welcome the opportunity to work on this with you and Shona Finally a question regarding timing The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated Shona took this to do after Brents return to Houston for comments to all business controllers I dont believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed understand and have implemented these standards And not to belittle the process of creating the standards the tough part and the real meat behind this will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buyin and commitment to these standards and hopefully our first draft of a meaningful exception report Can we discuss this please see separate note from me to Shona Sorry that this response looks so long I have been interrupted times while responding so I hope that it makes sense

depends upon brand and location is placed into the facility Given t he hard deadline of yearend the operational support of this process initially took place on spreadsheets The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business should not be underestimated The process of moving material off and on balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement s particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in the AS With the specified functionality it is believed that all operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed satisfactorily The core functionality which was due prior to the yearend was released during January but was subsequently found to have introduced bugs t o the integrated business control processes Whilst an improvement on having no OBSF functionality the bugs have had an increasingly negative effe ct on the control environment compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a guaranteed delivery for the bug fixes and non core reporting functionality This has given rise to the following concerns There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at a

side of the business h as also resigned He left in January There is no documentation for the AS It is therefore difficult for experienced AS programmers to get upto speed on the system Conclusion It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the AS system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays The current situation has arisen due to nondelivery of IT

Structure OBSF pre yearend to meet Enron requirements for gearing ratios Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants these being bearer documents it does present an issue when physical metal the value o f which depends upon brand and location is placed into the facility Given t he hard deadline of yearend the operational support of this process initially took place on spreadsheets The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business should not be underestimated The process of moving material off and on balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement s particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in the AS With the specified functionality it is believed that all operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed satisfactorily The core functionality which was due prior to the yearend was released during January but was subsequently found to have introduced bugs t o the integrated business control processes Whilst an improvement on having no OBSF functionality the bugs have had an increasingly negative effe ct on the control environment compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a guaranteed delivery for the bug fixes and non core reporting functionality This has given rise to the following concerns There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at a brand location level to coordination records the global position is reconciled however It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EMCL as a PL on spread moves from Cash to

developer on the EML side of the business h as also resigned He left in January There is no documentation for the AS It is therefore difficult for experienced AS programmers to get upto speed on the system Conclusion It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the AS system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays The current situation has arisen due to nondelivery of IT developments and tig ht timescales on the finalisation of the OBSF facility To meet Q end requirements ie full production of the DPR and stock reconciliation IT and the OBSF deal

approval for the following I will discuss with AA the following that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to data issues above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model simplifications that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses AS on screen enquiries and the formal global position report these differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA within the audit timetable an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped see MO work The creation of an incentive payment pool possibly via personal best awards for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to meet the above stated objectives The signoff for additional permanent Enron headcount who will duplicate certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing Traffic staff A reconciling difference of mm exists between the reported DPR and the final accounting pl as generated on the AS We will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system pl as a result of data or system valuation problems within the month end reporting timeframe However this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system pl values with traders The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet reduced where economically viable until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows the stock circularisation initiated for close of business rd with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by trafficcoordination an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the th replacing planned rd review due to system issues requiring full download of contract detail for later reference reconciliation of stock movements between rd and th

risk for the Merchanting Metals business Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility OBSF which commenced two weeks before the year end The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AAs signoff for the facility late in the year end audit The discovery of a number of bugs within the AS Merchanting code arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality which compounded the operational burden of supporting the OBSF The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays and AA The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus gain comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q DPR and business balance sheet The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and effectively decoupled from the higher risk higher benefit Brokerage implementation benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting developers The ARAP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process tracking cash settlement funding data to working capital components for all Metals businesses An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q covering gross tonnage spread positions and summarised analyses for brand and locations The necessary report functionality should be available within the AS however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBAexcel reports outside of the AS but using AS data downloads User requests for additional AS functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of Q following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF A resubstantiation of the full Q DPR will be completed by the Risk control staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q open and Q close A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q audit timetable which incorporates A full circularisation of inventory balances and matching to source documentation within Enron Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances by third party inspectors where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basis Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced positions report spot checking the key position report signed off by the traders Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase and to AS Barclays account A risk based debtors review matching to source documentation where applicable and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements A full substantiation of creditors to internal contract commitments or external documentation invoicesrequest for payment A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during April If you have any questions please

comments As discussed it may be useful to see how the doorstep and BRM approaches interact anything written down that explains it I am going to proceed with driving accountability for op risk assessment to my controllers we should discuss at the global offsite if it is worth formalising this process I am totally open to ideas on this Lastly in conversations with Shawn we agreed to delay the full planning for European BRM whilst we finalise this years reports lots of activity due in October Thanks for the call yesterday Mike Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Shona Wilson ENRON To Mike CT cc Shawn nron Fernley CT Sally CT Cassandra nron Subject Re Transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses an internal approach to internal audit Dear Mike Thanks for your insight In the past few months we have established a detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with BRM Through my calls the past week Ive been trying to update you so we can determine how best to coordinate the Enron Europe work as well as get an understanding of what resources you can supply for this global initiative My next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to determine their skill set and what locationscommodities theyd be best to work on Ill send you an updated schedule once Ive finalized this Thanks Shona Mike CT AM To Shawn nron Shona nron cc Fernley CT Sally CT Subject Transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses an internal approach to internal audit Shawn Shona We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is we will need to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely Aims Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive ongoing communication and a structure of measurement and tracking Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused by it All elements of implementing completing and reviewing internal control should generate defined output We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and origination controls we have defined the control structure for trading offices agency offices and origination offices and we must police our labelling for each office The output from Enrons perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be discussed at controlgovernance meetings eg at SallyTedFernleys level and at the audit committee level the important issue here is that every list must be extracted from an agreed database of issues different lists have different amounts of filtering applied judgementally by seniorexperienced staff The output from AAs perspective is their internal controls audit opinion based upon our database and our review and management process of it Trading Process monthly Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction cycle rating made by business controller is red amber

efficient way to reference this effort as an Enronwide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded is great and I would hope to reference it via the reporting process that shona is trying to roll out I will work with Shona who undoubtedly would want to send out in your name the global notification of our aims Mike Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Sally Beck To Mike CT cc Subject Re a note being sent out under John Sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note I read your note back to Shona and I understand Johns desire to put a reminder in front of people including commerical staff members about the need for operating standards If this is the best time to put that in writing for Europe then by all means go forward with that If there is an efficient way to reference this effort as an Enronwide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded then that would be great It simply helps put the London initiative in the context of an Enronwide effort that we all feel is important Sally Mike Jordan AM To Sally CT cc Fernley CT Subject Re a note being sent out under John Sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note Comments in red Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Sally Beck To Mike CT cc Fernley CT Subject Re a note being sent out under John Sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards but I wonder about the most appropriate timing enough of a global message it is a European note and the means of delivery On the means of delivery I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication yes and in addition a letter to be sent under Johns name if so to whom will the letter be sent Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article Yes apologies if there is confusion With regard to a global message I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities With these operating standards implemented worldwide we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across Agreed but the note was targeted at Europe would welcome the opportunity to work on this with you and Shona Finally a question regarding timing The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated Shona took this to do after Brents return to Houston for comments to all business controllers I dont believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed understand and have implemented these standards And not to belittle the process of creating the standards the tough part and the real meat behind this will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buyin and commitment to these standards and hopefully our first draft of a meaningful exception report Can we discuss this please see separate note from me to Shona Sorry that this response looks so long I have been interrupted times while responding so I hope that it makes sense Thanks for sharing this with me Since you asked for input I hope that you dont mind that I gave you some Sally Certainly not and thanks Mike Jordan AM To Fernley CT Sally CT cc Subject a note being sent out under John Sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note Fernley Sally Off and on with Jackie Gentles help I have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards itself a one page summary We are in the final stages of this process where we draft a cover letter for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash the Enron Europe
