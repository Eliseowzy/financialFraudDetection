When we received Jacksons plea for pictures our members were blown away We hustled up a package of pix as did a majority of the Parrot Head clubs from around the globe and the result is pure Parrothedonistic pleasure This collection is bound for glory in the annals of island time If moderation is your key to life then stay away from JimmyDotCom cause this book is packed with those stories only we can tell Congratulations BubbaFreak BobRob Sandlapper PHC CLUB TRINI UPDATE Speaking of expatriates how about the guys who play the true music of The Zone Club Trinis long awaited Live CD will finally be coming out this April one year after its recording Jimmy has been keeping Mike and Robert pretty busy so its understandable that it took awhile It will be the third in the Margaritaville Cafe Late Nite series I cant wait to hear it as my wife and I were some of the lucky ones who were in New Orleans when it was recorded You can get a look at all the songs included on the new CD at Club Trinis revamped web site at Along with the great songs weve become accustomed to are a few Im pretty excited about If you havent heard CTs version of African Friend youre in for a real treat Along with that is a song that Tina and Nadirah have been treating audiences to this past summer Cario and Bob Marleys No Woman No Cry At the new web site fans can now order their favorite Club Trini CDs using their credit cards So theres no excuse to not owning everything available I think a true Expatriate Musical Library is incomplete without Club Trini This summer Helen Hiatt Jimmy and The Coral Reefers Wardrobe Designer came up with a shirt that Club Trini members lovingly call the Ice Cream Vendor shirt which they wear out front at the start of the concert OK Pete sometimes forgets his and when he does have it on it lost its sleeves somewhere along the way Theres a great design that has been applied to a Tshirt that we all can own Check it out at their site JESTERS AND FRIENDS NOTE CARD SERIES TroPics has just released their first Note Cards Series from their Jesters and Friends Original Oils Friends places and musicians from past years have inspired these cards and Parrot Heads and Expatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times when an email just isnt personal enough The Original Artwork is also on sale at this site so be sure to stop by and visit them Included in the Jesters Series are our good Friends Tim Glancey and Wally Nickel MILLENNIUM CHANGE BUBBA STYLE Ive got to tell you I wasnt buying into this New Millennium thing one bit In fact I had almost decided not to go to the Buffett New Years Eve Show Nothing to do with Jimmy but I just didnt get the whole hype But at the last minute I had a change of heart And now after being a special guest at Seagrams Party honoring the new Margaritaville Tequila Im sure glad I went The shows kind of melded together for me making the Millennium change over very special If you want to
