Jeff Hodge andor Steve Van H Original Message From Concannon Ruth Sent Monday May AM To Mann Kay Cc McMichael Jr Ed Garza Maria Germany Chris Barbe Robin Vanderhorst Barry Subject Nation Fuel Gas Supply Corporation ENA EES Motions We just found out that National Fuel Gas Supply NFGS filed motions with the bankruptcy court on December to vacate the automatic stay and allow NFGS to terminate the firm and interruptible transport agreements compel the Debtor to assume or reject the agreements or provide adequate assurance of future performance by the Debtor A separate motion for ENA and EES was filed The hearing looks like it was scheduled on January I do not believe that ENAs and EESs commercial groups were aware that these NFGSs motions had been made to the court Was Legal involved in a response to these motions If ENA and EES did not respond at the court hearing is the decision of the court to terminate the agreements Most of the agreements were for interruptible services that had no future value to the Estate One of the two firm ENA agreements was tied to a producer netback transaction that Enron Canada is working on a settlement with the producer The other firm ENA agreement is outofthemoney and would have been rejected anyway Please confirm that by ENA and EES taking no action at the hearing that the agreements have been terminated I will get with Enron Canada so that fact can be included in their settlement with the producer Thanks for your help Ruth Concannon This email is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and
