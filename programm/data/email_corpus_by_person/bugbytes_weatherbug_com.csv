is the perfect distance across to have two extremes of weather in th e wintertime Advertisement Click to learn more The United State s is roughly miles from coast to coast and by coincidence the jet str eam has an average wavelength of about miles as well Wavelength is t he distance between the ridges and the troughs of a wave and the jet stream is really just a series of waves in the flow of air around the earth Thi s means that many times during the year the west coast will have a trough or cold pattern and the east coast will have a ridge or warm pattern or v isa versa This winter has been no exception In December the jet strea m pattern had a large trough in the west This spread cold air and heavy sn ows to the areas west of the Mississippi Many ski areas are enjoying great ski conditions and the Olympic venues in Utah are extremely happy Back ea st it was a different story Many ski slopes in the Appalachians did not o pen before Christmas and did not see any snow or even make snow In fact s ome of the major cities in the east had the latest first freeze ever record ed As you read this big shifts have occurred Over the week of Christmas the jet stream amplitude reversed and the east had the trough and the ridg e shifted west This finally brought a real shot of winter to the east and happiness to the ski slope operators Shifts like this are common and most winters have at least one such major shift in the jet stream each year Thi s year was no exception What is in our future It is likely we will see an other shift or two to keep the temperatures across the country acting like a yoyo The new WeatherBug offers some great ways to follow the chang ing Jet Stream Upgrade to version so you can enjoy the allnew WinterN et which includes worldwide ski

Processor It Never Felt So Cold Perception has a lot to do with how someone f eels If you are told it is below zero and it really is only below you will still act as if it is below For more than years the NWS and forecasters have been telling you the wind chill and you have been preparing for the worst It turns out this formula needed some serious u pgrading when research showed the values in the formula were much too low The old wind chill did the public a disservice by convincing people they could safely endure extreme cold More often it scared people into stayin g indoors when they could safely go out and it prompted unnecessary schoo l and business closings Specifically the old wind chill was too cold si nce it was based on wind measurements at feet the official height for wind observations which can be times as strong as the wind at the sur face In Antarctic explorers Siple and Passel developed the first wi nd chill index by measuring the heat loss from a container of water as it froze while suspended from the foot pole When the old formula was dev eloped the technology did not exist to verify the accuracy those index va lues The new formula implemented Nov uses winds measured at feet which is much more representative of the wind that a human body exp eriences The new Wind ChillTemperature Index also makes use of advances in meteorology biometeorology and computer modeling to provide a more acc urate useful formula for calculating the dangers from winter winds and f reezing temperatures In addition clinical trials have been conducted and the results of those trials have been used to verify and improve the accu racy of the new formula Check out the new Wind Chill values by watching t he live weather from your closest WeatherBug weather station as well as c
