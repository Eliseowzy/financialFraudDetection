review and have found a couple more We will want to discuss these on Monday I should be able to send you the Doorstep reports for St Louis and Chicago updated once David and Bjorn get a chance to review them Best regards Shona Tim Poullain CT AM To Marcelo GUSA cc Mike CT Naomi CT Shona nron Robert CT Subject Re Chicago Doorstep Review Thanks for the update as you say hopefully this summary covers all the issues Shona Point comes up in Doorstep after Doorstep It was discussed extensively upon being raised in the Singapore Doorstep and Andy Cowx Telecoms expert for Enron Europe researched potential solutions without success I cant help but feel that as this is a global issue a global solutionanswer needs to be found Shona can you take this up with either Sally or Ted and find someone accountable for coming up with a global answer Point per the updated list of Authorised Traders and follow up note to Sam Hainsworth defining scope of what Chicago and Montreal maymay not do any residual position that Chicago may create is preauthorised by Sam and is an integral part of his global book I have forwarded the follow up note to Shona this morning and confirmed with Sam that he has communicated the contents with his staff in those offices ie no local limits however small are required Point Lous list of AS development needs has been prioritised and depending on where on this list the improvements to customer reports are this should be done in the very near future Point we considered preserving the Helsinki typewriter in perspex as a reminder to us all however I am assured it has now been destroyed Suggest that once the forms have been converted this machine is rendered useless eg remove the e key or take a spanner to it Per the point you make about the timing of moving the scrap business I will assume that the timing is acceptable to Houston unless we hear concerns to the contrary Thanks and regards Tim Marcelo GUSA To Mike CT Tim Poullain CT Naomi CT cc Subject Chicago Doorstep Review Please find Dereks report on the visit by the Houston RiskControlling team Assuming that this summary covered all the issues it seems that we are making progress Point The problem with the phones will be addressed when they move to the other Enron office I agree that the sooner the move takes place the better but lets make sure that they are properly set up in the new office prior to their move The critical part of the move is to assure that availability to the AS is established prior to the move Point Using cell phones needs to be addressed How are you controlling this in London and other offices Once we transfer the Scrap business to London Jan we will not have position issues in Chicago Until that time comes please note that Chicago has been instructed not to take any positions In the event of an unbalanced book with an agreement from Sam they will need a small limit Tim Can you formalize this with Sam see point below for good order sake Point We need a better customer exposure report from the AS Mike Sweeny should help us on this front Point RussiaBills of LadingTypewriter Helsinki is still fresh in our minds What can I say I told them to unplug the machine Point Stephanie reporting to Lou is not a problem Derek doing logistics and assisting the traders is not a problem since we have taken away all the middle office functions from his control Please let me know if you hear anything different Best regards Marcelo Enron Metals Commodity Corp EMail Forwarded by Marcelo ParraNYCMGUSA on PM Derek Van Deusen PM To Louis GUSA Marcelo GUSA cc Bob GUSA David GUSA Subject Chicago Doorstep Review Following is a recap of issues Bob I discussed yesterday with Shona Wilson David Port Bjorn Hagelmann We explained how all confirmspricingsinvoices were now sent directly to counterparties from NY not Chicago David Port was very concerned that we were not using taped phones yet and will push this issue upon return to Houston as reason for us to move to ENA before Thanksgiving perhaps as early as next weekend Discussed problems with confirming business when out of the office on home phones cell phones or external meetings a Conversations not taped suggested that a conference call be made to a taped line at our office to record the transaction or that someone from the office call the counterparty directly to confirm the contract b They were concerned about fixing prices without a screen We explained that mostly we only fix premiumsdiscounts for later pricing When fixing a price the trader would either call the office or LME broker for a live quote and for hedging We explained that we do not have formal position limits because our book is more or less fully hedged as per JRs memo David asked if we had any informal limits to which we suggested MT due to buying selling through the course of the day but unhedged positions if any would not be left open unless discussed with approved by Sam We agreed that credit functions reporting should be strengthened especially to show total exposures by customers not just limits or receivables Shona will follow up with Alan Aronowitz to finalize GTCsMaster Agreements ASAP Shona asked about progress with agency agreements Lou please add this to your action plan with Naomi Connell in London as responsible party Showed them our daily positions AS positions which they agreed were in good order Explained that NY reconciles positions daily and Chicago balances AS vs daily position periodically as needed They asked how we track overshipments and undershipments Showed them how traffic dept uses Access system to highlight lateoverundershipments which are brought to trader for action Showed comparable reports in AS showing late shipments and undershipments but explained that overshipments were automatically zeroed out by AS I will discuss this further with Sweeney to formalize reporting of overshipments for tracking of position changes contract overages Bjorn was very concerned that we use a typewriter to fill out certain forms most notably Enrons part carbonpaper insurance certs Apparently Helskinki problem involved using a typewriter to alter Bills of Lading Bjorn will discuss with Enron insurance dept possibility of converting to electronic forms They suggested that Stephanie should report directly to Lou instead of DVD in order to maintain frontmiddle

Thanks for your insight In the past few months we have established a detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with BRM Through my calls the past week Ive been trying to update you so we can determine how best to coordinate the Enron Europe work as well as get an understanding of what resources you can supply for this global initiative My next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to determine their skill set and what locationscommodities theyd be best to work on Ill send you an updated schedule once Ive finalized this Thanks Shona Mike CT AM To Shawn nron Shona nron cc Fernley CT Sally CT Subject Transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses an internal approach to internal audit Shawn Shona We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is we will need to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely Aims Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive ongoing communication and a structure of measurement and tracking Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused by it All elements of implementing completing and reviewing internal control should generate defined output We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and origination controls we have defined the control structure for trading offices agency offices and origination offices and we must police our labelling for each office The output from Enrons perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be discussed at controlgovernance meetings eg at SallyTedFernleys level and at the audit committee level the important issue here is that every list must be extracted from an agreed database of issues different lists have different amounts of filtering applied judgementally by seniorexperienced staff The output from AAs perspective is their internal controls audit opinion based upon our database and our review and management process of it Trading Process monthly Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction cycle rating made by business controller is red amber green with trend indicator of static improving or declining see attachment for full listing Monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management see attachment you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not solely drive the judgement within the self assessment Shona this is the work that Mike Moscoso is leading Periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss operational risk and areas of concern red and amber with agreement of action plans for such areas Monthly review by controllersenior controller of database where all high red and medium amber risk issues are recorded Milestones for action plans revisited reconfirmed or amended Monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if the risk rating for any remote offices has changed All new information on issues raised by self assessment doorstep review or BRM completion populated into database Database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and decision on whether original BRM and doorstep plans require amendment Process Yearly Planning Checkpoint taken of current operational environment say end Oct proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in office and IT development plans for next year Prioritisation made for doorstep which offices require a visit and what depth does report need to go to Note the doorstep review would be an end to end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the review effort on areas of concern the actions plans in place and concluding on the mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level Prioritisation made for BRM which functions NOT BUSINESS UNITS require external independent review highly leveraging the above self assessment and doorstep processes could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal governance process most likely reviews completed on functions that assessed as concerns across multiple business such as FX exposure management cash management credit exposure management IT change management controlsprocess Where are we NOW if we all thought to do this immediately We do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses I am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the Houston offsite do this rd Oct The above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as senior controllers could put together for the audit committee last week Oct We agree on a robust tracking process throw out one of the BRM and Doorstep databases November Given AA have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate the database from scratch November Review Doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly do we need to visit all November Review all of the above and blend into risk based approach for BRM planning end November to end December

but on a smaller scale Ill put a resource requirement memo together by the end of the week and then we can determine who would fit these requirements and where these people should come from LondonHouston I think this project would be a great opportunity for some analystsassociates of course working under experienced personnel Regards Shona Mike CT AM To Tim Poullain CT cc Richard CT Fernley CT Andrew CT Shona nron Subject Re MG Integration Resource Requirements A good tee up and one we should regularly reassess here goes some initial feedback which you should push back on Valuation review resource requirement to be defined in detail by Andy in his new role I think the offer from Eric of finding some Analysts and Associates for the short term assessment may be the immediate answer Balance Sheet substantiation at present I assess the power and gas substantiation process as priority although we should review the resources coming free from Global Chris and Rashpal as they may not be easily useable by Raewyn Chris is free at present and Rashpal promised for Thunderball Whilst I am as concerned as you are we should reassess level of risk because AA would have done could do more some substantive due diligence on balance sheet The trade accountants at MG had a simplistic entity structure based around an infrastructure where the AS did both the DPR and account posting unlike our own systems so inherent risk is lower excluding inventory we must make certain our efforts are aligned to Fin Ops Inventory interesting one this it should be very accurately controlled already it is the business yet the problem is that it is not transparent at the consolidation level I would like you to get David Tregar to assess the level of risk with you and discuss with me and Philip Lord the current securitisation of inventory before we put an action plan in place for this balance sheet category Integration Controls you should continue your efforts to bring the MG priority to the functional stripe leaders agenda after Fridays meeting they know the effort required are that recruitment is key SAP we will look to Michael Heap on this but we did identify some key business analysis work for Kevin Rhodes to be done ASAP we should track this Remote offices continues to be the dog that has not barked YET Richard you and I need to rethink where we are particularly with South America Overall we both agree more resources are required but they have to be scoped quite precisely Thanks for the note Tim PoullainPatterson To Mike CT cc Subject MG Integration Resource Requirements Mike As you know we still have a very full issues list and we are spreading the few resources we have on ground pretty thinly leaving a residue of partially completed tasks that will need to be revisited at some point Also though we are leveraging MG staff where we can we have already made an assessment that their support infrastructure is very lean this is being stretched to breaking point by the RW acquisition and various Enron integration initiatives eg establishing functional teams At present we have the following resources on the ground We are continuing to identify issues that add to our assessment of operational risk If we are to reduce this risk to an acceptable level we need to commit additional resources to the project I assess our current resource needs as follows Valuation Review the valuation review that Andy and I performed prior to effective control date identified a number of complex valuation issues that require further quantitative analysis Also there is imbedded optionality in a lot of the physical business transacted throughout MG which should be modelled to determine the correct valuation and accounting treatment and if there is any extra value to be extracted Eric Gadd has recently prioritised this Requirement risk manager with developed quantitativemodelling skills Balance Sheet Substantiation a comprehensive validation of balances including a review of reconciliations evidence of account ownership detection of s accounts etc is overdue Requirement lead accountant plus two juniors Inventory a lot more analysis is required of the global inventory balances see earlier note to Eric Gadd Requirement onetwo risk managers General Integration having now identified the functional leads for MG in London we are now due to involve the stripe leaders in the process of creating the functional groups including identifying gaps in resourcing I will not prejudge the outcome beyond saying that each functional group will need extra staff that I am expecting the stripe leaders to provide Requirement to be determined by stripe leaders SAP Requirement to be determined by SAP project team Remote Offices the above requests relate to the London office only Having identified Enron Controllers for the offices in the Far East I do not envisage significant issues integrating those offices However I have minimal understanding of what our requirements in the US and South America are and propose deferring that discussion to another time Regards Tim

with He is currently working on a project at one of PwCs clients to standardize their mid office processes He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of PwC but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to manager I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July this year but due to capacity issues I dont expect that the promotion will be approved

his name His number is Dave Simpson analyst at Koch Energy in Houston has a degree in accounting and has work experience of about months He is very interested in leaving Koch I know him on a person basis but have not worked with him He is a good guy and very likeable I dont have his phone number but should be reachable through the general number for Koch Admin assistants Connie Shugart she is currently working at PwC as an administrative assistant She is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for PwCs audit and internal audit service lines She is very interested in Enron and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here I have not worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office I talked to her a number of times and was very impressed general PwC

understood by us and the individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the traders Are you in addition saying that your group who has been very helpful in the past will no longer help us understand the cause of violationsnotifications To me this appears contrary to a team spirit attitude and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussed earlier today Also we are working toward getting the memos out earlier and this is a real set back to that process Thoughts To Shona nron Michael NRON Chris CT Daniel NRON cc Veronica CT Sally CT Subject Limit Violations and Notifications Process Shona To share with the others our telephone discussion the notification template was not my request it was requested directly by Skilling I know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations and in accordance with your request below Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements The new PL notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next Tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications so that should help It probably makes sense to redistribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations These should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group Under the policy that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group If the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ops desk head business unit controller Ill be happy to send them an email explaining their compliance obligation under the policy Why dont you talk to each of the business unit controllers consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback as I understand it is for Global Products for example and if youd like me to send an email to whoever youre having difficulty with I will just let me know who Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations but the problem is they can see whether theyre short or long and how the market moved in comparison but its the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether theyre adjusting it based on the market moves etc Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process Regards Cassandra Forwarded by Cassandra SchultzNAEnron on AM From Shona Wilson AM To Cassandra nron cc Michael NRON Chris CT Daniel NRON Veronica CT Sally CT

request we have started to prepare this in addition to the normal word violationnotification memos and our other work As you have certain requests and requirements it would be helpful for someone in

Daniel NRON cc Veronica CT Subject Limit Violations and Notifications Comments I realize this has already gone out but I see a few errors that we should correct and actually I think we should call Skilling and Lays and Buys assistants Veronica will handle this and see if we can just hand deliver to them a corrected version early this morning email is OK for Ted David and I I have a few other suggestions on formatreporting changes as well The NA Power VaR of MM was not over its VaR limit of that would have been to require a report to Skilling but if we had had to report it dont use WSCC try to spell out or just dont use UK Gass VaR limit is not its MM I cant tie in UK Gas QTD and YTD PL shouldnt it be whats on the DPR adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas call over to that Yeo person and get the info from them please The nd item for NA Gas shouldnt be listed like that as it looks like another violation the comment re the VaR increase was mean to go at the bottom under RAC comments The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg VaR is not its notification requirement box EES had a VaR violation vs that is a Skilling level violation Lets have the Re say Limit Violations and Notifications for December Lets number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level Veronica will call you to coordinate redistribution Going forward we

<30670531.1075849812547.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,shona.wilson@enron.com,2000-12-11 02:35:00,How do officialized books make it to credit Cc past few months much focus has been put on understanding VAR and how it is calculated through RisktRAC However everyone should note that the credit department also receives our information Market risk and credit risk are inherently different with different requirements This memo serves as a reminder of what some of the key differences are how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk how this affects us what some key problems are in the credit system caused by our data and changes to be made by risk management groups differences are between credit and market risk you all know this but many of your bas dont when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit Flat books must be officialized market risk is keyed off positions and curves When we make money market risk is reduced Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers When we make money credit risk is increased as people owe us more money how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk Market risk picks up all officialized books If a book is not officialized it does not pick the book up Credit picks up all officalized books If a book is not officialized it picks up the previous days position Therefore if positions in book A are moved to book B and A is no longer officialized credit picks up the previous days position for book A As a result if a book is no longer used please officialize it the first day it is no longer used so credit will pick up on a go forward basis Market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names Credit needs correct counterparty codes and names In recent months the counterparty information has deteriorated Enron official counterparty names need to be used so they flow properly to credit what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data As referenced above correct counterparty names and books with positions not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info As a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names are used and that if a book has positions that it is officialized the first day it has positions If you have specific questions about credit please call Debbie Brackett at X

Thanks for your insight In the past few months we have established a detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with BRM Through my calls the past week Ive been trying to update you so we can determine how best to coordinate the Enron Europe work as well as get an understanding of what resources you can supply for this global initiative My next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to determine their skill set and what locationscommodities theyd be best to work on Ill send you an updated schedule once Ive finalized this Thanks Shona Mike CT AM To Shawn nron Shona nron cc Fernley CT Sally CT Subject Transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses an internal approach to internal audit Shawn Shona We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is we will need to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely Aims Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive ongoing communication and a structure of measurement and tracking Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused by it All elements of implementing completing and reviewing internal control should generate defined output We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and origination controls we have defined the control structure for trading offices agency offices and origination offices and we must police our labelling for each office The output from Enrons perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be discussed at controlgovernance meetings eg at SallyTedFernleys level and at the audit committee level the important issue here is that every list must be extracted from an agreed database of issues different lists have different amounts of filtering applied judgementally by seniorexperienced staff The output from AAs perspective is their internal controls audit opinion based upon our database and our review and management process of it Trading Process monthly Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction cycle rating made by business controller is red amber green with trend indicator of static improving or declining see attachment for full listing Monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management see attachment you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not solely drive the judgement within the self assessment Shona this is the work that Mike Moscoso is leading Periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss operational risk and areas of concern red and amber with agreement of action plans for such areas Monthly review by controllersenior controller of database where all high red and medium amber risk issues are recorded Milestones for action plans revisited reconfirmed or amended Monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if the risk rating for any remote offices has changed All new information on issues raised by self assessment doorstep review or BRM completion populated into database Database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and decision on whether original BRM and doorstep plans require amendment Process Yearly Planning Checkpoint taken of current operational environment say end Oct proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in office and IT development plans for next year Prioritisation made for doorstep which offices require a visit and what depth does report need to go to Note the doorstep review would be an end to end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the review effort on areas of concern the actions plans in place and concluding on the mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level Prioritisation made for BRM which functions NOT BUSINESS UNITS require external independent review highly leveraging the above self assessment and doorstep processes could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal governance process most likely reviews completed on functions that assessed as concerns across multiple business such as FX exposure management cash management credit exposure management IT change management controlsprocess Where are we NOW if we all thought to do this immediately We do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses I am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the Houston offsite do this rd Oct The above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as senior controllers could put together for the audit committee last week Oct We agree on a robust tracking process throw out one of the BRM and Doorstep databases November Given AA have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate the database from scratch November Review Doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly do we need to visit all November Review all of the above and blend into risk based approach for BRM planning end November to end December

understood by us and the individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the traders Are you in addition saying that your group who has been very helpful in the past will no longer help us understand the cause of violationsnotifications To me this appears contrary to a team spirit attitude and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussed earlier today Also we are working toward getting the memos out earlier and this is a real set back to that process Thoughts To Shona nron Michael NRON Chris CT Daniel NRON cc Veronica CT Sally CT Subject Limit Violations and Notifications Process Shona To share with the others our telephone discussion the notification template was not my request it was requested directly by Skilling I know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations and in accordance with your request below Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements The new PL notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next Tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications so that should help It probably makes sense to redistribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations These should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group Under the policy that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group If the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ops desk head business unit controller Ill be happy to send them an email explaining their compliance obligation under the policy Why dont you talk to each of the business unit controllers consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback as I understand it is for Global Products for example and if youd like me to send an email to whoever youre having difficulty with I will just let me know who Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations but the problem is they can see whether theyre short or long and how the market moved in comparison but its the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether theyre adjusting it based on the market moves etc Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process Regards Cassandra Forwarded by Cassandra SchultzNAEnron on AM From Shona Wilson AM To Cassandra nron cc Michael NRON Chris CT Daniel NRON Veronica CT Sally CT Subject Re Limit Violations and Notifications Comments Dear Cassandra In looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us one in the template itself and some suggestions At your request we have started to prepare this in addition to the normal word violationnotification memos and our other work As you have certain requests and requirements it would be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to ensure it meets your requirements Please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be Thanks Shona To Michael NRON Chris CT Shona nron Daniel NRON cc Veronica CT Subject Limit Violations and Notifications Comments I realize this has already gone out but I see a few errors that we should correct and actually I think we should call Skilling and Lays and Buys assistants Veronica will handle this and see if we can just hand deliver to them a corrected version early this morning email is OK for Ted David and I I have a few other suggestions on formatreporting changes as well The NA Power VaR of MM was not over its VaR limit of that would have been to require a report to Skilling but if we had had to report it dont use WSCC try to spell out or just dont use UK Gass VaR limit is not its MM I cant tie in UK Gas QTD and YTD PL shouldnt it be whats on the DPR adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas call over to that Yeo person and get the info from them please The nd item for NA Gas shouldnt be listed like that as it looks like another violation the comment re the VaR increase was mean to go at the bottom under RAC comments The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg VaR is not its notification requirement box EES had a VaR violation vs that is a Skilling level violation Lets have the Re say Limit Violations and Notifications for December Lets number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level Veronica will call you to coordinate redistribution Going forward we

review and have found a couple more We will want to discuss these on Monday I should be able to send you the Doorstep reports for St Louis and Chicago updated once David and Bjorn get a chance to review them Best regards Shona Tim Poullain CT AM To Marcelo GUSA cc Mike CT Naomi CT Shona nron Robert CT Subject Re Chicago Doorstep Review Thanks for the update as you say hopefully this summary covers all the issues Shona Point comes up in Doorstep after Doorstep It was discussed extensively upon being raised in the Singapore Doorstep and Andy Cowx Telecoms expert for Enron Europe researched potential solutions without success I cant help but feel that as this is a global issue a global solutionanswer needs to be found Shona can you take this up with either Sally or Ted and find someone accountable for coming up with a global answer Point per the updated list of Authorised Traders and follow up note to Sam Hainsworth defining scope of what Chicago and Montreal maymay not do any residual position that Chicago may create is preauthorised by Sam and is an integral part of his global book I have forwarded the follow up note to Shona this morning and confirmed with Sam that he has communicated the contents with his staff in those offices ie no local limits however small are required Point Lous list of AS development needs has been prioritised and depending on where on this list the improvements to customer reports are this should be done in the very near future Point we considered preserving the Helsinki typewriter in perspex as a reminder to us all however I am assured it has now been destroyed Suggest that once the forms have been converted this machine is rendered useless eg remove the e key or take a spanner to it Per the point you make about the timing of moving the scrap business I will assume that the timing is acceptable to Houston unless we hear concerns to the contrary Thanks and regards Tim Marcelo GUSA To Mike CT Tim Poullain CT Naomi CT cc Subject Chicago Doorstep Review Please find Dereks report on the visit by the Houston RiskControlling team Assuming that this summary covered all the issues it seems that we are making progress Point The problem with the phones will be addressed when they move to the other Enron office I agree that the sooner the move takes place the better but lets make sure that they are properly set up in the new office prior to their move The critical part of the move is to assure that availability to the AS is established prior to the move Point Using cell phones needs to be addressed How are you controlling this in London and other offices Once we transfer the Scrap business to London Jan we will not have position issues in Chicago Until that time comes please note that Chicago has been instructed not to take any positions In the event of an unbalanced book with an agreement from Sam they will need a small limit Tim Can you formalize this with Sam see point below for good order sake Point We need a better customer exposure report from the AS Mike Sweeny should help us on this front Point RussiaBills of LadingTypewriter Helsinki is still fresh in our minds What can I say I told them to unplug the machine Point Stephanie reporting to Lou is not a problem Derek doing logistics and assisting the traders is not a problem since we have taken away all the middle office functions from his control Please let me know if you hear anything different Best regards Marcelo Enron Metals Commodity Corp EMail Forwarded by Marcelo ParraNYCMGUSA on PM Derek Van Deusen PM To Louis GUSA Marcelo GUSA cc Bob GUSA David GUSA Subject Chicago Doorstep Review Following is a recap of issues Bob I discussed yesterday with Shona Wilson David Port Bjorn Hagelmann We explained how all confirmspricingsinvoices were now sent directly to counterparties from NY not Chicago David Port was very concerned that we were not using taped phones yet and will push this issue upon return to Houston as reason for us to move to ENA before Thanksgiving perhaps as early as next weekend Discussed problems with confirming business when out of the office on home phones cell phones or external meetings a Conversations not taped suggested that a conference call be made to a taped line at our office to record the transaction or that someone from the office call the counterparty directly to confirm the contract b They were concerned about fixing prices without a screen We explained that mostly we only fix premiumsdiscounts for later pricing When fixing a price the trader would either call the office or LME broker for a live quote and for hedging We explained that we do not have formal position limits because our book is more or less fully hedged as per JRs memo David asked if we had any informal limits to which we suggested MT due to buying selling through the course of the day but unhedged positions if any would not be left open unless discussed with approved by Sam We agreed that credit functions reporting should be strengthened especially to show total exposures by customers not just limits or receivables Shona will follow up with Alan Aronowitz to finalize GTCsMaster Agreements ASAP Shona asked about progress with agency agreements Lou please add this to your action plan with Naomi Connell in London as responsible party Showed them our daily positions AS positions which they agreed were in good order Explained that NY reconciles positions daily and Chicago balances AS vs daily position periodically as needed They asked how we track overshipments and undershipments Showed them how traffic dept uses Access system to highlight lateoverundershipments which are brought to trader for action Showed comparable reports in AS showing late shipments and undershipments but explained that overshipments were automatically zeroed out by AS I will discuss this further with Sweeney to formalize reporting of overshipments for tracking of position changes contract overages Bjorn was very concerned that we use a typewriter to fill out certain forms most notably Enrons part carbonpaper insurance certs Apparently Helskinki problem involved using a typewriter to alter Bills of Lading Bjorn will discuss with Enron insurance dept possibility of converting to electronic forms They suggested that Stephanie should report directly to Lou instead of DVD in order to maintain frontmiddle

whether or not they will be officializing how frequently etc However s ince the data Im sending you today is the data many of these rules dont apply For the data we want to ensure we have correct VAR c ounterparty data for SEC reporting so for those of you that are not offici alizing due to lack of staff we still need you to calc and officialize you r data for the st Over the next day or so based on the below I will be following up with ea ch of you to determine if there is any VAR or counterparty risk that was no t captured and then asking you to officialize the books so we can pic k up the complete information for the st I will then put together a dea dline to get it done so I can rerun VAR Thanks for your cooperation If you have any questions or comments please call me at X Thanks

<10131671.1075858751267.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,shona.wilson@enron.com,2001-10-29 05:59:01,RE UK Continental Power Doorstep Cc Dear Sally After the meeting with Rick Rick Beth David and I discussed how best to perform the Q London Doorsteps and have implemented the following Before any doorstep takes place the doorsteppers must work directly with EAS to determine what has been done in regards to control reviews To date what we have obtained from London are the self assessments prepared by Operations and will receive copies of EASAA reports upon their completion expected endNov Each doorstepping team has had a conference call with EAS to ensure the doorstep team fully understands what has been done to date around the trading controls and where possible issues lie We are using the reports noted above as a background for these discussions The doorstep teams are all planning to use AAEASs deal test results the only exception to this is Essen where we feel that additional sampling should be done With the exception of metals recycling London EOTT RAC will take on a consulting only role As far as the video conference idea was concerned we felt that if the doorstep team was willing to travel that would be the best way to perform the doorstep This is because we feel that there is really no substitute for being in the location to hear side comments feel what morale is like etc Lastly we have talked to EAS about adding some procedures on to the testing AA is performing however they feel they can not take on any additional work This is primarily because AA got a late start this year and is feeling challenged to complete their work Best regards Shona Original Message From Beck Sally Sent Friday October PM To Wilson Shona Cc Apollo Beth Subject FW UK Continental Power Doorstep Please see exchange below Can you send me current plans who when where and what for London reviews I would put a several day moratorium on contacting London regarding upcoming Doorstep review plans until I get back with you Thanks Sally I know that in our meeting with Rick and Rick we talked about being creative on London reviews and leveraging what is being done by EAS maybe directing them on additional activities and doing some leg work by video conference What happened to that effort Sounds as if from the London emails that we stepped right back to flying people around the world Original Message From Beck Sally Sent Friday October PM To Dyson Fernley Cc New James Jordan Mike Apollo Beth Brown Michael COO London Subject RE UK Continental Power Doorstep In an October update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues In reviewing the plans for th quarter one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September th terrorists attacks We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned th quarter reviews until early Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the th quarter Certainly life on October feels different today at Enron than it did on October I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process and in your case the voluntary redundancy program In the next few days I will again review the th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey sharing with them your concerns I will let you know the outcome of those conversations If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved Sally Original Message From Dyson Fernley Sent Friday October AM To New James Jordan Mike Cc Beck Sally Apollo Beth Brown Michael COO London Subject RE UK Continental Power Doorstep The EAS work takes priority over Doorstep we need the AA opinion Im afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time I certainly do not want other things to suffer Thanks Fernley

following shortly Stacey and Kristin Albrecht aim to be here for the whole week starting first thing on Monday the th EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication In addition we will also need to make commercial aware of a reduced capacity to perform analytical tasks as well as model review and gap analysis work etc James Original Message From White Stacey W Sent October To New James Subject RE UK Continental Power Doorstep We will not be there next week so that should be fine Are the complex derivatives group and structured book run by Paul Darcy the same thing If yes then we are planning on reviewing that area Should I contact Paul Darcy directly If no what is the complex derivatives group Thanks Stacey Original Message From New James Sent Thursday October PM To White Stacey W Subject RE

already being used for BRNT trades At the end of Aug early Sept these books also started being used for BRN and BRCM positions as well The additional usage for these books was not communicated to Risk

but on a smaller scale Ill put a resource requirement memo together by the end of the week and then we can determine who would fit these requirements and where these people should come from LondonHouston I think this project would be a great opportunity for some analystsassociates of course working under experienced personnel Regards Shona Mike CT AM To Tim Poullain CT cc Richard CT Fernley CT Andrew CT Shona nron Subject Re MG Integration Resource Requirements A good tee up and one we should regularly reassess here goes some initial feedback which you should push back on Valuation review resource requirement to be defined in detail by Andy in his new role I think the offer from Eric of finding some Analysts and Associates for the short term assessment may be the immediate answer Balance Sheet substantiation at present I assess the power and gas substantiation process as priority although we should review the resources coming free from Global Chris and Rashpal as they may not be easily useable by Raewyn Chris is free at present and Rashpal promised for Thunderball Whilst I am as concerned as you are we should reassess level of risk because AA would have done could do more some substantive due diligence on balance sheet The trade accountants at MG had a simplistic entity structure based around an infrastructure where the AS did both the DPR and account posting unlike our own systems so inherent risk is lower excluding inventory we must make certain our efforts are aligned to Fin Ops Inventory interesting one this it should be very accurately controlled already it is the business yet the problem is that it is not transparent at the consolidation level I would like you to get David Tregar to assess the level of risk with you and discuss with me and Philip Lord the current securitisation of inventory before we put an action plan in place for this balance sheet category Integration Controls you should continue your efforts to bring the MG priority to the functional stripe leaders agenda after Fridays meeting they know the effort required are that recruitment is key SAP we will look to Michael Heap on this but we did identify some key business analysis work for Kevin Rhodes to be done ASAP we should track this Remote offices continues to be the dog that has not barked YET Richard you and I need to rethink where we are particularly with South America Overall we both agree more resources are required but they have to be scoped quite precisely Thanks for the note Tim PoullainPatterson To Mike CT cc Subject MG Integration Resource Requirements Mike As you know we still have a very full issues list and we are spreading the few resources we have on ground pretty thinly leaving a residue of partially completed tasks that will need to be revisited at some point Also though we are leveraging MG staff where we can we have already made an assessment that their support infrastructure is very lean this is being stretched to breaking point by the RW acquisition and various Enron integration initiatives eg establishing functional teams At present we have the following resources on the ground We are continuing to identify issues that add to our assessment of operational risk If we are to reduce this risk to an acceptable level we need to commit additional resources to the project I assess our current resource needs as follows Valuation Review the valuation review that Andy and I performed prior to effective control date identified a number of complex valuation issues that require further quantitative analysis Also there is imbedded optionality in a lot of the physical business transacted throughout MG which should be modelled to determine the correct valuation and accounting treatment and if there is any extra value to be extracted Eric Gadd has recently prioritised this Requirement risk manager with developed quantitativemodelling skills Balance Sheet Substantiation a comprehensive validation of balances including a review of reconciliations evidence of account ownership detection of s accounts etc is overdue Requirement lead accountant plus two juniors Inventory a lot more analysis is required of the global inventory balances see earlier note to Eric Gadd Requirement onetwo risk managers General Integration having now identified the functional leads for MG in London we are now due to involve the stripe leaders in the process of creating the functional groups including identifying gaps in resourcing I will not prejudge the outcome beyond saying that each functional group will need extra staff that I am expecting the stripe leaders to provide Requirement to be determined by stripe leaders SAP Requirement to be determined by SAP project team Remote Offices the above requests relate to the London office only Having identified Enron Controllers for the offices in the Far East I do not envisage significant issues integrating those offices However I have minimal understanding of what our requirements in the US and South America are and propose deferring that discussion to another time Regards Tim

suggestions on formatreporting changes as well The NA Power VaR of MM was not over its VaR limit of that would have been to require a report to Skilling but if we had had to report it dont use WSCC

call over to that Yeo person and get the info from them please The nd item for NA Gas shouldnt be listed like that as it looks like another violation the comment re the VaR increase was mean to go at

long and how the market moved in comparison but its the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether theyre adjusting it based on the market moves etc Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process Regards Cassandra Forwarded by Cassandra SchultzNAEnron on AM From Shona Wilson AM To Cassandra nron cc Michael NRON Chris CT Daniel NRON Veronica CT Sally CT Subject Re Limit Violations and Notifications Comments Dear Cassandra In looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us one in the template itself and some suggestions At your request we have started to prepare this in addition to the normal word violationnotification memos and our other work As you have certain requests and requirements it would be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to ensure it meets your requirements Please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be Thanks Shona To Michael NRON Chris CT Shona nron Daniel NRON cc Veronica CT Subject Limit Violations and Notifications Comments I realize this has already gone out but I see a few errors that we should correct and actually I think we should call Skilling and Lays and Buys assistants Veronica will handle this and see if we can just hand deliver to them a corrected version early this morning email is OK for Ted David and I I have a few other suggestions on formatreporting changes as well The NA Power VaR of MM was not over its VaR limit of that would have been to require a report to Skilling but if we had had to report it dont use WSCC try to spell out or just dont use UK Gass VaR limit is not its MM I cant tie in UK Gas QTD and YTD PL shouldnt it be whats on the DPR adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas call over to that Yeo person and get the info from them please The nd item for NA Gas shouldnt be listed like that as it looks like another violation the comment re the VaR increase was mean to go at the bottom under RAC comments The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg VaR is not its notification requirement box EES had a VaR violation vs that is a Skilling level violation Lets have the Re say Limit Violations and Notifications for December Lets number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level Veronica will call you to coordinate redistribution Going forward we

Thanks for your insight In the past few months we have established a detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with BRM Through my calls the past week Ive been trying to update you so we can determine how best to coordinate the Enron Europe work as well as get an understanding of what resources you can supply for this global initiative My next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to determine their skill set and what locationscommodities theyd be best to work on Ill send you an updated schedule once Ive finalized this Thanks Shona Mike CT AM To Shawn nron Shona nron cc Fernley CT Sally CT Subject Transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses an internal approach to internal audit Shawn Shona We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is we will need to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely Aims Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive ongoing communication and a structure of measurement and tracking Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused by it All elements of implementing completing and reviewing internal control should generate defined output We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and origination controls we have defined the control structure for trading offices agency offices and origination offices and we must police our labelling for each office The output from Enrons perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be discussed at controlgovernance meetings eg at SallyTedFernleys level and at the audit committee level the important issue here is that every list must be extracted from an agreed database of issues different lists have different amounts of filtering applied judgementally by seniorexperienced staff The output from AAs perspective is their internal controls audit opinion based upon our database and our review and management process of it Trading Process monthly Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction cycle rating made by business controller is red amber green with trend indicator of static improving or declining see attachment for full listing Monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management see attachment you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not solely drive the judgement within the self assessment Shona this is the work that Mike Moscoso is leading Periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss operational risk and areas of concern red and amber with agreement of action plans for such areas Monthly review by controllersenior controller of database where all high red and medium amber risk issues are recorded Milestones for action plans revisited reconfirmed or amended Monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if the risk rating for any remote offices has changed All new information on issues raised by self assessment doorstep review or BRM completion populated into database Database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and decision on whether original BRM and doorstep plans require amendment Process Yearly Planning Checkpoint taken of current operational environment say end Oct proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in office and IT development plans for next year Prioritisation made for doorstep which offices require a visit and what depth does report need to go to Note the doorstep review would be an end to end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the review effort on areas of concern the actions plans in place and concluding on the mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level Prioritisation made for BRM which functions NOT BUSINESS UNITS require external independent review highly leveraging the above self assessment and doorstep processes could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal governance process most likely reviews completed on functions that assessed as concerns across multiple business such as FX exposure management cash management credit exposure management IT change management controlsprocess Where are we NOW if we all thought to do this immediately We do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses I am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the Houston offsite do this rd Oct The above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as senior controllers could put together for the audit committee last week Oct We agree on a robust tracking process throw out one of the BRM and Doorstep databases November Given AA have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate the database from scratch November Review Doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly do we need to visit all November Review all of the above and blend into risk based approach for BRM planning end November to end December

could help them Forwarded by Shona WilsonNAEnron on PM To Debbie R CT Stephen CT cc Jitendra PatelMarket Risk CT James CT Shona nron Ted CT Subject Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power volatilities and correlations FYI This relates to the quality of the upstream risk systems and Continental Powers ability to get its risk system in order To summarise option products valued incorrectly in Enpower and not using a volatility curve no ability to produce vega and gamma sensitivities for a portfolio incorporating options Steve what is the valuation routine used in Houston for power options I would like to see it if possible Shona we ought to examine these valuation methods to ensure we are happy DP Forwarded by David PortMarket RiskCorpEnron on PM James CT AM To Ted CT David PortMarket NRON cc Mike CT Coralie CT Fernley CT Subject Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power volatilities and correlations As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that the market has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in their mark In looking at the impacts of this various other issues came to light Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as this was way out of date We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a matrix that both the traders risk and RAC are happy with Secondly as you may be aware in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the deal ticket and not off any volatility curve The current portfolio is swaptions and so this represents a serious issue for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change We cannot use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options We also have not found any way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to force in the few we have We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a new piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of worrying bugs These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of approximating the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the underlying They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel who have sufficient option knowledge I understand that the two most experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of Enrons power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the volatility at the deal ticket level This will almost certainly mean that different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value the swaption portfolio globally As well as these issues we have concerns over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc worryingly it does not seem that you can switch this off Briefly it seems that Portcalc calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the forward price of the underlying itself We have engaged London based IT and are looking at the code we have used in Power to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or gamma risk from Portcalc in its current state as the information is just no there so we are told by IT The system seems we cannot be sure given all the other errors to produce a vega and gamma PL number but what the risk is remains a mystery Again this is very worrying in that we have Power option traders all over the world who cant get their underlying vega or gamma risk position from the global valuation system We are trying to work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem knowingly or not for years What sign offs were gained for the implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy How do we validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their VAR However as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their model vol curve generator I have today asked for a full explanation details of any testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help We are having to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of Consequently we have not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in gaining the increased limits so months ago but I would hope you agree that it is not for a lack of trying Sorry its so long but if there are any questions or any perceived inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know James

power options I would like to see it if possible Shona we ought to examine these valuation methods to ensure we are happy DP Forwarded by David PortMarket RiskCorpEnron on PM James CT AM To Ted CT David PortMarket NRON cc Mike CT Coralie CT Fernley CT Subject Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power volatilities and correlations As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that the market has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in their mark In looking at the impacts of this various other issues came to light Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as this was way out of date We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a matrix that both the traders risk and RAC are happy with Secondly as you may be aware in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the deal ticket and not off any volatility curve The current portfolio is swaptions and so this represents a serious issue for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change We cannot use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options We also have not found any way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to force in the few we have We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a new piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of worrying bugs These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of approximating the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the underlying They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel who have sufficient option knowledge I understand that the two most experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of Enrons power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the volatility at the deal ticket level This will almost certainly mean that different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value the swaption portfolio globally As well as these issues we have concerns over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc worryingly it does not seem that you can switch this off Briefly it seems that Portcalc calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the forward price of the underlying itself We have engaged London based IT and are looking at the code we have used in Power to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or gamma risk from Portcalc in its current state as the information is just no there so we are told by IT The system seems we cannot be sure given all the other errors to produce a vega and gamma PL number but what the risk is remains a mystery Again this is very worrying in that we have Power option traders all over the world who cant get their underlying vega or gamma risk position from the global valuation system We are trying to work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem knowingly or not for years What sign offs were gained for the implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy How do we validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their VAR However as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their model vol curve generator I have today asked for a full explanation details of any testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help We are having to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of Consequently we have not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in gaining the increased limits so months ago but I would hope you agree that it is not for a lack of trying Sorry its so long but if there are any questions or any perceived inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know James
