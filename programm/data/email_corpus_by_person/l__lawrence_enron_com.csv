Via Internet MEMORANDUM TOInterested Clients FROMJohn Hengerer RECommission Meeting October At todays lengthy Commission meeting the Commissioners approved the conse nt agenda and then discussed the items detailed below ELECTRIC MATTERS State Participation in RTO Development Process In light of comments voiced during last weeks RTO workshops Commissioner Brownell suggested that avenues for participation by the State Commissions in the RT O development process need to be explored She suggested that one option m ight be to establish regional panels made up of state commission representa tives Commissioner Brownell further suggested that state commissions per haps through such regional panels could explore issues related to RTO set up adequacy of revenue requirements demandside management programs mark et monitoring and mitigation and distributed generation The other Commissioners generally echoed Commissioner Brownells sentiment although Commissioner Massey cautioned that the pace of RTO development sh ould not be slowed by excessive or redundant administrative procedures and costs The Commissioners unanimously voted to instruct Staff to develop pr oposals for greater state commission involvement and to present their prop osals to the Commissioners at an upcoming agenda meeting At this point t he initiative appears to be designed to explore alternatives More concret e proposals however could be included in the broader RTO strategy the Com mission is expected to announce in the near future Discussion of RTO Development Process in Southeast Docket No EX Staff began the discussion with a power point presentation on the Southeast RTO mediation process noting that participants had reached a consensus on most issues including market monitoring operational authority shortter m reliability and planning Staff explained that consensus could not be r eached on issues of governance and independence and provided an overview of the two competing RTO Models outlined in the Judge McCartneyDs mediation report After briefly describing the Collaborative Governance CG model and Independent System Administrator ISA model Staff identified positive s and negatives for both Staff did not take a position on which model sho uld be approved by FERC rather it concluded that either model satisfies t he requirements of Order No Staff also noted that in the Southeast participation by public power is essential to the formation of a functioni ng RTO in the region After StaffDs presentation Judge McCartney and Herbert Tate former New Jersey Chairman discussed the proceeding with the Commissioners Specific issues discussed included public power participation concern over indepe ndence in the ISA model whether the ISA was analogous to current ISOs and the allocation of functions in the CG model Overall Judge McCartney exp ressed support for CG model citing concerns over independence in the ISA m odel as well as what she viewed as the experimental nature of the ISA pro posal As a former state commissioner Mr Tate outlined the concerns expr essed by the state commissions during the mediation period In their final recommendations both Judge McCartney and Mr Tate encouraged the Commissi on to provide additional guidance as to the essential elements or principle s to structure RTOs Discussion of RTO Developments in the Northeast Docket No EX Staff began this discussion item with a presentation on the Northeast RTO m ediation process Staff explained that a Business Plan was issued to imple ment the Northeast RTO The Business Plan consists of eight sections post mediation process governance market design operations technology asses sment transmission tariffrelated issues regional transmission planning and interregional coordination Staff did not detail the content of the Bu siness Plan but noted that in the two areas where there was disagreement B governance and market design options B the plan included three alternative s for each StaffDs presentation was followed by a discussion with Judge Young and Jo e Garcia former Florida Commissioner Judge Young explained that the Bus iness Plan provides a viable blueprint for the formation of the Northeast R TO He noted that several issues must still be resolved including govern ance market design and shareholder process Judge Young reiterated his r ecommendation that a independent nonvendor expert should analyze the tech nology of the three ISOs to assess whether entirely new software will be ne cessary to implement the Northeast RTO In response to Commissioner Breath itt Staff explained that software is one of the biggest hurdles in the Nor theast RTO Mr Garcia expressed some concern that the ALJ and participant s could waste too must time attempting to achieve the perfect RTO Chairman Wood noted that the CommissionDs intention is to leave the regio n better not worse off than preRTO He also explained that the Northeas t is in a better position to form a viable RTO than the other regions becau se of the maturity of its markets Commissioner Brownell noted that incons istencies between the existing ISOs are working against retail competition programs in the Northeast region She cautioned against proceeding too slo wly with regard to RTO formation Commissioner Wood noted that there are s ome issues that can be resolved relatively quickly for example regional t ransmission planning realtime imbalance market software In response to Chairman Wood the Judge Young and Mr Garcia provided recom mendations Mr Garcia explained that the Business Plan provided participa nts with a basic plan and asked the Commission to provide guidance in the a reas were there was divergence He also encouraged the Commission to issue a decision in the near future noting that the Commission should let parti es litigate jurisdictional issues so that RTO issues could be resolved soon er rather than later Judge Young encouraged the Commission to take the ti me to assess market design in order to prevent a further waste of time and money in the likelihood that the chosen market design proves unworkable J udge Young also requested that the Commission provide additional guidance o n the parameters of Abest practices governance structure market design and stakeholder process Discussion of RTO Developments in the Midwest Docket No EX Staff provided an update of recent developments in the Midwest A settleme nt agreement between Alliance and MISO approved by the Commission earlier this year provides the basis for developing a seamless market in the regio n that will be served by the two groups Under the terms of the Illinois p ower settlement the financial viability of MISO is guaranteed the Allianc e business model is preserved and seams issues between MISO and Alliance a re addressed Staff explained that the seams agreement provides for ones top shopping congestion information on a joint bulletin board an imbalanc e market transmission planning and market monitoring Staff explained that both MISO and Alliance recently filed status reports w ith the Commission addressing their ability to be functional and the seams agreement included in the settlement previously approved by the Commission Alliance noted that a proposal by National Grid USA EL to manag e the Alliance RTO along with Alliancess proposed Business Plan are cri tical to the RTOs startup Alliance reports that it would take up to days to initiate operations once it has received final Commission approval In response to Commissioner Brownell Staff maintained that both MISO and A lliance have made progress in addressing seams issues Staff expressed sat isfaction with both the substance and timing of the entities filings There was some discussion over the division of functions between MISO and A lliance Chairman Wood noted that if there is going to be one regional en tity with not forprofit and forprofit entities the Commission will have to address how the functions should be split Chairman Wood also expressed concern that a viable wholesale market may not result if all the functions were delegated to the forprofit entity Discussion of Western Infrastructure Adequacy Conference Docket No AD First in a series of regional meetings on infrastructure the Western Infra structure Adequacy Conference will be held in Seattle on November Staff identified three main questions to be addressed at the meeting i whether the current infrastructure is adequate ii the infrastructure ne eds of the region and iii the factors that are inhibiting adequate inves tment in infrastructure Such questions will be addressed within the conte xt of the outlook for growth and population increases in the region as well as the outlook for future energy needs The Commission hopes to determine what the states and the federal government can do to encourage infrastruct ure investment Next Staff gave a power point presentation on the infrastructure throughou t the United States This presentation which breaks down energy infrastru cture by fuel use and priceresponsive demand can be accessed by the publi c on the CommissionDs website under AFERC Discussion Papers Staff note d that gas is the primary fuel in West and that use of gas continues to ris e within the region In a separate presentation Staff then presented its findings on its western infrastructure assessment which began in August S taff has collected data and analyzed information on Western infrastructure with a final assessment available Friday October The western infrastructure assessment was broken into three sections deman d supply markets and transmission With regard to demand Staff traced the population and consumption differences over past few years in the West Staff noted that the Southwest started to consume larger amounts of gas a nd electricity because of population and economic growth Staff traced gas uses growth total capacity and peak loads within Western region as wel l as projections for demand capacity use and infrastructure Next Staf f provided an overview of the supply of electricity hydropower and gas in the United States Staff asserted that proven and potential gas reverses i n United States could provide supply for next years In the portion of the presentation on markets Staff identified the primary trading hubs in t he West and the average monthly spot market prices and monthly trading volu mes in the region Staff also noted that recently there has been a downwar d shift in the gas futures market for the West which it attributed to lower temperatures more capacity lower gas prices and the CommissionDs price mitigation plan Finally Staff provided an overview of transmission proj ects in the Western region New York Independent System Operator Inc Docket No ER Cinergy Services Inc Docket Nos ER and ER Commonwealth Edison Company Docket ER American Electric Power Service Corp ER In a July order in Docket No ER the Commission denied a trans mission providerDs request to receive interest on system upgrade payments In this draft order the Commission issued an interim order which granti ng rehearing on this issue The Commission will address the issue of interest on system upgrade payment s in the generic proceeding addressing transmission interconnection Commi ssioner Breathitt dissented in part maintaining that the Commission should not issue an interim order but instead should address the issue in the t ransmission interconnection proceeding where the ramifications can be more fully explored Commissioner Massey and Wood voiced their support for the order noting that if generators are treated as banks they should receive interest However Commission Massey explained that as a longterm issue he has an open mind as to how the generation costs should be allocated Kern River Gas Transmission Company Docket Nos CP and CP There was no Staff presentation on these two items which were placed on the discussion agenda by Commissioner Breathitt Although she concurred with the decision Commissioner Breathitt expressed concern over intervenors all egations that the pipeline expansion would negatively impact the availabili ty of takeaway capacity on the Kern River system Commissioner Breathitt noted that in determining whether pipeline expansions are in the public con venience and necessity the Commission must address concerns that there wil l be a degradation of existing shippers firm rights FWordMEMOFM eazwpd

<179286.1075858718045.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,l..lawrence@enron.com,2001-09-27 08:21:56,Summary FERC Meeting Sept September Commission Meeting September The Commission meeting was the first held under the leadership of Chairman Wood and there were several notable changes to the content and format of this and future meetings There are now six categories of items administrative miscellaneous electric gas hydroelectric and certificates Next a greater number of items were placed on the discussion agenda at the Commission meeting with the meeting concluded shortly before pm In addition some of the items placed on the discussion addressed larger were issues such as RTO formation and utility infrastructure ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS Strategic and Business Plans Docket No AD The Commission will release A Making Markets Work a fiveyear strategic and business plan that will revise its current plan The Commissioners identified four core principles i promoting a secure highquality environmentallyresponsible energy infrastructure through consistent policies ii fostering competitive energy markets as a substitute for traditional regulation iii protecting customers and market participants through vigilant and fair market oversight and iv efficiently administering the agencys resources to achieve its goals Thus the plan elevates the priority of the market oversight and monitoring function of the Commission After receiving internal and external comments on the proposed plan the Commissioners expect to issue a plan sometime at the end of October The final plan will be internally reviewed each quarter Infrastructure Adequacy Docket No AD The Commission announced that it will hold open meetings in four regions of the country West South Northeast and MidWest to discuss the adequacy of infrastructure within each region At each openmeeting the Commission hopes to reach a consensus within the region on the following items i what comprises the regions current infrastructure ii the projected demand within the region and iii the constraints that currently exist within the region Chairman Wood noted that the openmeetings will assist the Commission in planning for the future as well as addressing current issues related to inadequate infrastructure The first meeting will address the West and will likely be held at the Western Governors Association meeting scheduled for October The Northeast meeting will be held in December or early with the South and MidWest meetings held sometime later in California Infrastructure Adequacy Docket No AD The Commission Staff provided an update on the projects undertaken by the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC to enhance infrastructure in California Staff noted that many of the figures provided by the CPUC did not reconcile with those figures available through the Energy Information Administration The CPUCs final report on infrastructure within California is available on its web site MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS Standards of Conduct for Transmission Providers Docket No RM The Commissioners outlined a NOPR for revised affiliate standards of conduct that would apply to both the electric transmission providers and natural gas pipelines There were two important aspects to the revisions i the expansion of the definition of an affiliate and ii the separation of the transmission function and the sales function including specifically the bundled retail sales function The Commissioners proposed to broaden the definition of an affiliate to include all affiliates not just a pipeline or transmission providers marketing affiliate This definition would include affiliates that are solely engaged in financial transactions such as options or derivatives related to the transmission of energy Notably asset managers would also be covered by this definition of affiliate After some discussion the Commissioners also elected to propose the separation of the transmission function from the bundled retail sales function Commissioner Breathitt explained that she was uncomfortable with the separation of the bundled retail sales function noting that many state commissions would not welcome the development Additional language was added to the order which specifically solicited comments from state commissions on this issue Chairman Wood explained that while he favors the separation of the bundled retail sales function the final rule will depend upon the comments the Commission receives He encouraged parties to submit costbenefit analyses regarding the proposed separation of the retail bundled sales function In response to Commissioner Massey Staff provided support for the separation i it would provide consistency among all functions and ii it may not be a major operational change because the wholesale sales function has already been separated from the transmission function Commissioner Massey acknowledged the federalstate tension but concluded that the opportunity for discrimination trumped such concerns Under the proposed rule transmission providers employees engaged in transmission system operation would be required to function separately from the providers sales andor marketing employees and energy affiliates Both transmission providers and pipelines would have to treat outsiders in a nondiscriminatory manner with the prohibition on preferential sharing of transmission information broadened to include all energy affiliates Thus transmission providers and pipelines would only be able to share pricesensitive information with their affiliates if they contemporaneously released the information to outsiders It appears that there would be a limited waiver of the standards of conduct under certain circumstances First a waiver of the standards of conduct would be available for transmission owners that i belong to a Commissionapproved RTO and ii do not have control over their transmission assets Second a transmission provider could request a waiver for operational or size reasons Finally a waiver would also be available for transmission providers under emergency operating circumstances Electronic Service of Documents Docket No RM Chairman Wood expressed his desire to transition from paper filings to electric filings ELECTRIC MATTERS Discussion on Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity Docket No EX Staff presented a discussion paper on ensuring adequate reserve capacity in the electric market The discussion paper was not meant to be a definitive study of a problem but simply a brief description of the problem in order to stimulate discussion Staff concluded that market forces can do little to prevent shortages of reserve capacity Instead Staff advocated the use of purchases of forward reserves as well as the use of a deficiency charge that would invoked if reserves fall below a certain level for example ICAP Staff also cited demandside management as a possible mechanism to ensure adequate capacity Staffs discussion paper will be formally issued with initial comments due by October Significant National Transmission Constraints Discussion Docket No EX Staff presented a second discussion paper on national transmission constraints The full report which will address the top constraint points in the United States is expected to be published by November Staff briefly described two significant constraints i Path in Central California and ii the Central East Interface in New York Staff estimated the congestion costs assessed with the Path and Central East Interface to be million and million respectively Staff noted that such costs are passed on to the consumer Further discussion of constraints will likely occur when the full report is issued later this fall Commission Massey inquired as to whether California has initiated plans to invest in technology which will make transmission more efficient Staff explained that California does have plans to install FAST devices but noted that stakeholders often resist easing constraint points Staff explained that some stakeholders have a financial incentive to maintain the constraint status quo Chairman Wood explained that the Commission intends to work with both federal and state authorities to address these points of constraint The Commission will forward the findings of its final report to the Department of Energy which is currently studying the national grid Discussion of RTO Progress Docket No EX There was no presentation by Staff instead the focus of the discussion was Chairman Woods recommendation for future proceedings as summarized below First Chairman Wood expressed a strong preference for standardizing marketdesign rules across all RTOs the regional RTOs and ERCOT He suggested that standardized rules be adopted then a rebuttable presumption be afforded those rules such that RTOs proposing variances would bear some burden of proof He indicated that a formal rulemaking might be preferable to hashing out market design issues in contested proceedings Chairman Woods also suggested that a new pro forma OATT should be developed to replace the one adopted by Order No Next Chairman Wood would like to conduct a series of RTO workshops during the week of October Topics identified by the Chairman included congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability and the allocation of transmission rights The Commissioners indicated that a formal NOPR or similar document would probably not be issued until after the workshops in October Third Chairman Wood suggested the adoption of sticks for forcing entities to meet Order No s December deadline for RTO membership or to force membership as soon thereafter as possible He indicated such sticks could include i subjecting merger approval to RTO membership and ii revoking marketbased rate authority The Chairman stated that he envisions two worlds an Old World with separate rules for entities that do not join RTOs and a New World with separate rules for entities that do join RTOs While supporting the Chairmans effort to encourage RTO membership the other Commissioners were somewhat skeptical of the Chairmans proposed sticks They noted that the FERC cannot just revoke marketbased rate authority without replacing existing rates presumably with costbased rates that could require new rate cases Commissioner Breathitt noted that December deadline was always ambitious even when first adopted Finally the Chairman noted that there are numerous other RTO issues that must be addressed even beyond the realm of market design issues Chairman Woods noted that the transco v ISO debate is one the Commission will have to tackles in the coming weeks Commissioner Breathitt added that she does not want the Commission to take any actions that would discourage the formation of transcos although she did not indicate any preference for a transcoontop RTO structure Western Systems Coordinating Council Western Regional Transmission Association and Southwest Regional Transmission Association Docket Nos EL and ER The Commissioners unanimously granted the request filed by the Western Systems Coordinating Council Western Regional Transmission Association and Southwest Regional Transmission Association to transfer assets to the Western Electricity Coordinating Council WECC The Commissioners found that WECCs bylaws were reasonable as proposed Chairman Wood placed the item on the discussion agenda in order to commend the parties for their initiative Discussion of MarketBased Rate Reviews Docket No EX Due to technical difficulties with the cable feed we were unable to observe this item on discussion at the Commission meeting When our access resumed we were able to ascertain the following First it appears that an order initiating a Section investigation into marketbased rates is scheduled to be issued at the next Commission agenda meeting on October with initial comments due days after issuance The Commissioners goal to delineate what they described as the A Commandments of marketbased rates Next a NOPR will be issued in the future to address market monitoring and the standard by which the Commission will determine whether market power has been asserted We will have a better understanding of the substance of the order once it has been issued GAS MATTERS El Paso Natural Gas Company Docket Nos CP and RP The Commissioners unanimously denied the request for rehearing of the acceptance of El Pasos withdrawal of its prior notice filing to construct and operate two delivery point and lateral pipeline facilities to provide natural gas service to proposed gasfired electric generation facilities of Pinnacle and Duke Energy Maricopa LLC Duke in Maricopa County Arizona El Paso proposed to service Pinnacle under the full requirements contract of its affiliate Arizona Public Service Company After numerous protests El Paso filed to withdraw its previous prior notice filing The Commission granted the request this past summer Although the order denies rehearing Chairman Wood explained that he remains concerned over the capacity available on El Paso He maintained that the El Paso system should be watched by the Commission and longterm planning should be undertaken so that the constraints in the Southwest would not be a bedsore for customers in the area Chairman Wood concluded that although the underlying capacity allocation problems would not be resolved in this order such problems would be resolved in El Pasos Order No compliance proceeding or earlier
