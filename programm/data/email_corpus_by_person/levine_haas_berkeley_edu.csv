COMMENTARY I thought others might want to read Software A New Calculus for the New Economy How reclassifying it as an investment boosts growth The US truly has seen the birth of a New Economy over the past several years Thats one way to read the results of a comprehensive revision of historical data on the gross domestic product released on Oct by the Commerce Depts Bureau of Economic Analysis The most stunning data in the report are about the acceleration of productivity in the s Official revisions of productivity data incorporating the latest output figures from Commerce wont be released by the Labor Dept until Nov But a BUSINESS WEEK analysis of the new data from the Commerce Dept shows that nonfarm business productivity growth in this decade will likely be revised upward to roughly a year from Productivity growth will be boosted for the s as well but not by as much chart Whats even more striking is the upward revision in productivity growth for the last three years from to a stunning rate That explains how the US has been able to grow at a rate over that stretch without creating inflationary pressures KEEPS ON TICKING While the rate of increase in economic output in the s isnt as impressive as the growth in productivity it is not as low as the old statistics indicated From through the Commerce Dept statisticians say the economy grew at an annual rate of about even with the s growth rate of And the report confirms what everyone senses Growth has accelerated recently Commerce revised the economys growth rate for upward to an average of from a previously reported By comparison annual average GDP growth for the entire year span covered by the revisions was pushed upward to from The implication of the revisions The US economy may now be able to sustain a higher rate of growth without inflation than was previously believed The Commerce Dept now says that the GDP last year was trillion which is about billionor higher than previously believed A new calculus for software investments accounted for about twothirds of the upward revision in GDP And since software sales are growing far faster than the economy as a whole adding them into the GDP raises the economys official growth rateand will likely continue doing so for years to come Indeed the biggest factor in the Commerce Depts revisions is the new way of accounting for software the poster product of the New Economy The government now treats software purchases by business and government as investments which are part of GDP Until now the only software sales that counted toward GDP were sales to consumers and the sale of software that came bundled with computers and was included in the computers purchase price Now all software sales are factored into the GDP figures The new treatment of software isnt just some statistical trick Until now software spending by business and government was considered an expense and expenses are left out of GDP to avoid doublecounting For instance it would be doublecounting to list the steel that goes into a car as part of GDP and count the car too But software is not consumed in the production of new goods and services And the government is acknowledging now that software shouldnt be considered an expense such as steel or stationery Its being reclassified as an investment like a machine tool in recognition that it has a useful life of at least a year PIGGYBANK BLOAT By recognizing software as an investment instead of an expense the Commerce Dept also increases the national savings rate Savings are the mirror image of investment While the national savings rate was revised downward for it was revised upward for the years since The biggest revision was for the most recent year covered The government now says that total national savings were of gross national product last year a jump of percentage points from the previous calculation Of that increase fully was accounted for by the governments recognition of business and government software purchases as an investment The Commerce Dept also rejiggered the composition of the national savings accounts raising personal savings while lowering government savings by an equal amount Thats because of a new way of accounting for government pension plans contributions to which are now considered a form of personal rather than governmental savings The reshuffling means that the personal savings rate is now calculated as for instead of a previously reported The new methodology will undoubtedly turn the current personal savings rate from negative to positive But since the governments savings fell by a corresponding amount the reshuffling had no impact on the overall national savings rate And the downward trend in personal savings is still in place By the new measure the personal savings rate declined from in to last year instead of from to as had been previously reported KINDER HINDSIGHT The GDP revisions were wideranging and included hundreds of large and small tweaks For instance the government is now using a better way to measure the value of banking services such as automated teller machines and electronic funds transfers That increases the sectors official output and productivity Also new inflation measures developed by the Labor Dept are being incorporated all the way back to not just since One footnote The government now says the recession of was milder than previously thought From its peak in the second quarter of to its trough in the first quarter of GDP fell The old figure was a drop The Commerce Depts rewrite of economic history doesnt mean that the Federal Reserve can afford to be any less vigilant about inflation Regardless of the official growth rate Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has to keep his eye on the same warning signs tight job markets busy factories rising commodity prices The real significance is that government statistics are finally reflecting the reality of the highgrowth highproductivity lowinflation New Economy By Peter Coy in Washington My comments The article is a bit unclear on whether software was ever counted The key point is that the value of software not yet depreciated is a percent or of GDP Thus GDP is a few larger than the old accounting system that expensed all software immediately Consider your own desktop What of your salary is the market value of the software you have on the machine Not the original cost as Word has a very low market cost even if it was years ago David I Levine Associate professor Haas School of Business ph University of California fax Berkeley CA email wwwlevine

is using marginal incentives Should California Media Firms Get State Funds for Training By SHEILA MUTO From The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition For years the state Employment Training Panel gave little attention to two renowned California enterprises multimedia and entertainment But then both industries started complaining of a tight labor market and stiff competition from outside the state As a result a raft of companies including Seagram Cos Universal Studios Walt Disney Co and USWebCKS Corp have been the beneficiaries of million from the Employment Training Panel The eightmember board metes out about million annually to attract and retain businesses and jobs by improving workers skills And while California clearly has an interest in promoting a healthy climate for business including an able work force some are questioning whether multimedia and entertainment are really the kind of struggling industries that couldnt make it without state assistance The funds doled out by the Training Panel amount to corporate welfare says Naomi Lopez a policy analyst at the Pacific Research Institute a freemarketoriented think tank in San Francisco And just because theres a labor shortage in entertainment and multimedia doesnt mean we need to be using government resources to alleviate it According to Brady Bevis director of San Franciscos Bay Area Multimedia Partnership thats exactly what the Training Panel should be doing to ensure the health of the states economy These industries and jobs can go anywhere she adds noting they are already moving to Canada India and Japan Training Panel funds come from a special tax collected from businesses which amount to a maximum of about per employee Businesses or training agencies apply to the panel to underwrite their training programs and can be reimbursed for them after employees complete the training and stay with their jobs for days The bulk of panel funds between and go to manufacturers Kathleen Milnes a senior vice president at the Entertainment Industry Development Corp in Los Angeles estimates that entertainment companies fork over about million annually to the panel fund but until recently hadnt benefited from it We were subsidizing other industries she says So in Ms Milness and Ms Beviss organizations prompted the Training Panels venture into the celluloid and digital realms The two economicdevelopment nonprofits devised a program called SkillsNet which aims to keep cuttingedge highpaying entertainment and multimedia jobs in the state The effort has received about from the panel to study which skills companies are looking for set up a Web page and help firms tap into state training funds among other things Later this month SkillsNet plans to unveil a new report on the postproduction industry plus an online posting of internships But misgivings about the panels new focus are being unveiled as well Though he hasnt looked at the impact of state training dollars spent on multimedia and entertainment companies Richard W Moore a management professor at California State UniversityNorthridge says that panel funds are most effective when used as an incentive for employers who typically underinvest in training In contrast entertainment and multimedia companies tend to invest in training anyway says Prof Moore who was commissioned by the panel to assess its effectiveness He released reports in and his next study is set to come out later this summer In general he says the panel works Based on his report Prof Moore found that the training provided by panel funds meant that after two years employees who received retraining increased their salary by and new hires increased theirs by Considering the panel spends only about a participant he says thats a healthy payoff Still Sen Patrick Johnston the Stockton Democrat who wrote the legislation that created the Employment Training Panel in is attempting to reel in the agency through Senate Bill Among other things the bill which has already passed the Senate reduces the panel from a grantmaking agency to an advisory commission to the state Employment Development Department While the panel has helped some workers and boosted some businesses that are important to the California economy in other instances it has made less than stellar funding decisions Sen Johnston says pointing to funds given to hotels law firms and other service industries that clearly werent going anywhere But he believes that the agencys focus on multimedia and entertainment will prove to be an effective use of state funds During the past three years the panel has awarded million for retraining about workers and training new hires on the latest computer systems software and techniques in the multimedia and entertainment fields For example state records show that Universal Studios was granted million last year to retrain employees in management and computer skills And Video Symphony Entertraining Inc in Los Angeles received million to retrain workers from companies including Walt Disney on techniques such as video editing and digital animation The entertainment and multimedia industries need the funds says Charles Lundberg the panels marketing director because competition keeps getting tougher and the software and hardware keeps getting upgraded Indeed Paul Sidlo chief executive of REZN Productions Inc which does everything from Web design to visual effects for film and television says his Los Angeles firm has lost out to Canadian companies on a handful of contracts because they underbid him by nearly thanks to government subsidies Given that the D animation training that of his employees received last year through funding from the state which he estimates was worth about in instruction costs and employees time went a long way toward reducing the he spends annually on retraining workers The training subsidy he says really helped My comments Trainin funds are most useful it they go to folks who would not pay for the training themselves perhaps due to difficulties borrowing Also if the skills are useful at many employers no single employer wants to pay for the skills that workers walk away with to competitors Do you think the multimedia training subsidies meets these critera If not how could one target the training better David I Levine Associate professor Haas

<16810864.1075842933983.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,levine@haas.berkeley.edu,1999-11-02 15:35:00,Recent articlesFor this week please be sure you have read a story on determinants or costs of longterm or very high inflation andor on very high or longterm unemployment Later in the course we will examine changes in unemployment and inflation and their relation in the short run this week we focus on definitions and longrun determinants and costs Hint for unemployment what has happened to the workweek in France Concerning growth you might want to look at Report Corruption Ruining Economies Of South Asia hnmwlasiaunhtml a Reuters story Concerning measurement of The New Economy a fellow student recommends the Economist article at editorialfreeforallcurrentindexfnhtml will all the pretty pics and graphs or the plain text version below Exaggeration The digital economy is much smaller than you think NEWSPAPERS and magazines are packed with stories about the digital economy the informationtechnology IT revolution and the Internet age That their pages are filled with advertising from IT firms presumably has nothing to do with it Such firms account for a quarter of the total value of the SP and this week Dow Jones announced that Microsoft Intel and SBC Communications will be included in its industrial average from November st Not before time many say for hightechnology businesses now account for a huge chunk of the economy Actually they dont New figures published on October th by Americas Department of Commerce appear to support the view that IT is very important to the American economy The department now counts all business spending on software as investment previously it was a cost This has both increased the apparent size of IT investment and boosted Americas rate of growth in recent years But measuring the size of the new economy is a statistical minefield The most generous estimate comes from the OECD which tracks the knowledgebased economy It estimates that this accounts for of total business output in the developed economiesup from in But this definition which tries to capture all industries that are relatively intensive in their inputs of technology and human capital is implausibly wide As well as computers and telecoms it also includes cars chemicals health education and so forth It would be a stretch to call many of these businesses new A study published in June by the Department of Commerce estimates that the digital economythe hardware and software of the computer and telecoms industriesamounts to of Americas GDP this year If that sounds rather disappointing then a second findingthat IT has accounted for of total real GDP growth since should keep efanatics happy Perhaps unwisely A new analysis by Richard Sherlund and Ed McKelvey of Goldman Sachs argues that even this definition of technology is too wide They argue that since such things as basic telecoms services television radio and consumer electronics have been around for ages they should be excluded As a result they estimate the computing and communicationstechnology sector at a more modest of GDPup from in This would make it bigger than the car industry but smaller than health care or finance In most other economies the share is lower for the world as a whole therefore the technology sector might be only of GDP But what you might ask about the Internet Goldman Sachss estimate includes Internet service providers such as America Online and the technology and software used by online retailers such as Amazoncom It does not however include transactions over the Internet Should it Ebusiness is tiny at present but Forrester Research an Internet consultancy estimates that this will increase to more than trillion in America by Internet bulls calculate that this would be equivalent to about of GDP Yet it is misleading to take the total value of such goods and services whose production owes nothing to the Internet The value added of Internet salesie its contribution to GDPwould be much less probably little more than of GDP This is not to deny that the Internet is changing the way that many firms do businessby for example enabling them to slim inventoriesbut in the near future as a proportion of GDP it is likely to remain small A Luddites lament If measuring the size of the technology sector is hard calculating its contribution to real economic growth is trickier still because the prices of IT goods and services adjusted for quality have fallen sharply relative to the prices of other goods and services For example official figures show that Americas spending on IT has risen by a year in nominal terms since but by more than a year in real terms This figure is so high partly because it is extremely sensitive to assumptions about the rate at which the price and quality of IT is changing The Commerce Department calculates that the technology sector has contributed to overall economic growth over the past four years But because such figures are based on spending in real terms the Goldman Sachs study reckons they are misleading In nominal terms IT has accounted for a more modest of GDP growth in the past four years Another popularly quoted figure is that business spending on IT has risen from of firms total capitalequipment investment in to today But again this is based on constantdollar figures and so it hugely exaggerates the true increase In terms of current dollars and before the latest revisions Goldman Sachs calcuate that business investment in computers accounts for of total capital spending not And even this exaggerates the importance of IT because much of the money goes to replace equipment which becomes obsolete ever more quickly The share of IT in additional net investment is much smaller Computers still account for only of Americas total net capital stock For years economists have been seeking in vain for evidence that computers have dramatically raised productivity One explanation for the failure of productivity to surge may be that official statistics are understating its growth Another is that much investment in IT has been wasted hours spent checking email surfing the Net or playing games reduce not increase productivity A third may simply be that IT is still too small to make a difference for the moment appropriately enough you can count the digital economy on the fingers of one hand That is changing and firms are learning And note this if you add in all computer software and telecoms on the widest definition the share of IT in the capital stock rises to As it happens this is almost the same as railways at the peak of Americas railway age in the late th century Railways boosted productivity and changed the face of Victorian commerce Hype is hypebut the new economy may yet happen anyway LINKS The Commerce Departments statistics on information technology spending are summarised in a press release PressReleasewwwcbhtml The complete text of

<23380831.1075842934557.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,levine@haas.berkeley.edu,1999-11-04 17:19:00,A reading on inflationalso contributed this article from the Economist Sep A new economy for the New World Inflation may not be as dead as it seems ONCE upon a time sailors went to sea in the belief that the earth was flat putting them at risk of dropping off the edge Fortunately the discovery that it was round solved that problem Economic thinking about monetary policy and inflation has undergon e a similar aboutturn In the s the conventional economic wisdom was that monetary policy could reduce unemployment The theoretical underpinning for this was the Phillips curve named after Bill Phillips an economist from New Zealand based at the London School of Economics Mr Phillips also a trained engineer constructed a machine to demonstrate the workings of the economy using water to represent liquidity In he published a study showing that between and some kind of tradeoff between wage inflation an d unemployment seemed to have been operating in Britain when unemployment wa s high inflation was low and vice versa This seemed to suggest that centra l banks could permanently reduce unemployment by tolerating a bit more inflation A decade later however two American economists Milton Friedman and Edmun d Phelps challenged this theory The tradeoff between inflation and unemployment they argued was only shortterm because once people came to expect higher inflation they would demand higher wages and unemployment would rise back to its Fnatural rateF which depended on the efficien cy of the labour market There was no longterm tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the long run monetary policy could influence only inflation If policymakers tried to hold unemployment below its natural rat e also known by an acronym NAIRU the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment inflation would be pushed ever higher Just as Messrs Friedman and Phelps had predicted the level of inflation associated with a given level of unemployment rose through the s and policymakers had to abandon the Phillips curve Today there is a broad consensus that monetary policy should focus on holding down inflation But this does not mean as is often claimed that central banks are Finflati on nuttersF cruelly indifferent towards unemployment If there is no longterm tradeoff low inflation does not permanently chok e growth Moreover by keeping inflation low and stable a central bank in effect stabilises output and jobs Don Brash governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand explains how this happens using The straight line represents the growth in output that the economy can sustain over the long run the wavy line represents actual output When the economy is producing below potential ie unemployment is above the NAIRU at point A inflation will fall until the Foutput gapF is eliminated When output is above potential at point B inflation will rise for as long as demand is above capacity If inflation is falling point A then a central bank wil l cut interest rates helping to boost growth in output and jobs when inflation is rising point B it will raise interest rates dampening dow n growth Thus if monetary policy focuses on keeping inflation low and stable it will automatically help to stabilise employment and growth The Fed clearly understands this relationship between inflation and the output gap but initial signs suggest that the ECB may underestimate the extent to which it can safely hold interest rates low in the short run to boost output and jobs It has repeatedly said that lower interest rates cannot reduce unemployment That is undoubtedly true in the long run but i f an economy is operating below potential and the jobless rate is above the NAIRU then interest rates can safely be cut and hence output boosted without pushing up inflation Statements by ECB officials often appear to suggest that all of the unemployment rate in the euro area is structura l and none of it cyclical However estimates from the IMF suggest that outpu t in the area is currently almost below potential ie the economy is operating at point A With growth in the euro area starting to pick up th e ECB is already muttering about a rise in interest rates But it is far too soon the area still has a significant output gap that will continue to hol d down inflation Is a bit of inflation good for you When inflation was in double digits central banks had a simple rule bring it down But now that the rate in almost all rich economies is or less they are being forced to ask how low This is hotly debated because some economists believe that inflation has economic benefits as well as costs Consider first the costs When inflation is high people find it difficul t to distinguish between changes in average prices and changes in relative prices For example a firm cannot tell if a rise in the price of copper reflects general inflation or a scarcity of the metal This distorts important price signals leading to a misallocation of resources Inflation also creates uncertainty about the future which reduces investment And lastly because of the way inflation interacts with tax systems which are never fully indexed for inflation it reduces the real return on saving and hence reduces future growth Inflation in double digits clearly does considerable harm but what about lower rates And does inflation do more damage than or zero Yes answers Martin Feldstein president of the National Bureau of Economic Research He believes that even modest inflation can do significant damage through its effect on saving Tax is levied on nominal interest income so as inflation rises the real aftertax return on savings comes down and people save less which depresses future growth rates Mr Feldstein estimates that in America a cut in inflation from to zero would permanently increase the level of GDP by To reduce inflation by two percentage points would involve a oneoff loss in output of of GDP but the discounted present value of the future annual gains of around of GDP would far outweigh the loss Zero inflation he concludes is a worth y goal Yet there is little empirical evidence that lower inflation rates do noticeably improve growth performance once inflation is below say A scatter plot of inflation against growth for a range of countries shows no clear trend see A study by Robert Barro an economist at Harvard University found that a reduction in inflation of one percentage point increases the annual growth rate by a paltry of a percentage point Some economists go much further arguing that modest inflation of perhaps is good for growth and employment Nominal wages they say tend to b e rigid downwards Workers may be prepared to put up with flat wages when the inflation rate is which amounts to a decline in real income but they are reluctant to accept a pay cut in money terms So if the inflation rate is zero real wages cannot be adjusted downwards in declining industries or regions which means that unemployment will rise Inflation the argument runs greases the wheels of the labour market allowing real wages to adjus t more smoothly A widely cited study by the Brookings InstitutionF which examined pay i n America since confirmed that very few people take nominal wage cuts i n any year However the problem of wage FstickinessF may be overstated There have been few periods in the past when inflation has been less than for an extended period so it is not surprising that falling wages are rare If inflation were to remain low resistance to wage cuts might fade Indeed i n Japan wages have been falling over the past two years And as long as productivity is rising allowing unit labour costs to fall there may be no need for nominal pay cuts anyway AmericaFs recent experience certainly suggests that nominal wage rigidities are no cause for concern unemploymen t has continued to fall even though average inflation over the past three years has been only A second common worry about zero inflation is that interest rates cannot fall below zero so there is no way of allowing real interest rates to become negative to help the economy out of a recession But the need for negative real interest rates may be exaggerated Mervyn King a deputy governor of the Bank of England argues that negative real interest rates have been rare in America during the past halfcenturyF During most recessions low real interest rates have been enough to boost demand The only time when there might be a problem is if the economy suffers a shock when the output gap is already large and inflation below target because policymakers have failed to react to a previous slump in demand A preemptive policy which aims to prevent inflation going below target as well as above argues Mr King minimises the need for negative real interes t rates The final and most serious concern is that if central banks aim for zero inflation prices are more likely to fall for brief periods and the experiences of the s and Japan today show that deflation can be more dangerous than modest inflation But falling prices are not necessarily a problem Before the first world war a decline in the average price level was quite common during periods of rapid technological change such as the late th century yet these were also periods of strong growth This is quite different from the harmful sort of deflation seen during the Great Depression Moreover the odd year of falling prices does not matter so lon g as it does not feed expectations that they will continue to fall causing households to delay spending On balance the benefits of retaining some inflation are probably overstated Price stability reduces uncertainty and so offers the best economic environment for firms and households So why do central banks not invariably aim for zero inflation The answer is that official consumerprice indices tend to overstate the true rate of inflation in all countries because they do not adjust fully for improvements over time in the quality of goods and services Estimates suggest that in most countries the official consumerprice index overstates inflation by around a year This is the best reason why central banks should aim for a slightly positive inflation rate Flatearth economics With rates of consumerprice inflation of or under most rich countries have therefore more or less achieved Fprice stabilityF However that does not mean that central bankers can go out on the town and celebrate Despite subdued inflation the big three central banks all face their own particula r dilemmas JapanFs economy is still at risk from deflation The ECB is ha ving to deal with the added uncertainty of a completely new currency which has made the bankFs monetary policy extra cautious at a time when output in the euro area is stuck below its potential As for the American economy the Fe d is baffled because inflation is currently lower than any economic model would have predicted Under the old economic rules if unemployment fell below the NAIRU thought to be around inflation would start to rise This in turn implied that the maximum rate of growth the American economy could safely sustain adding up growth in the labour force and in productivity was about Today AmericaFs jobless rate stands at a year low of and GDP has grown at an average rate of almost a year over the past three years According to the textbooks inflation should be rising Instead AmericaFs underlying inflation rate has remained subdued Hence all the talk about the Goldilocks economyFneither too hot nor too cold One popular explanation of why strong growth has not pushed up inflation is that the American economy is undergoing a paradigm shift In this Fnew economyF it is argued information technology and increased global competition have opened up new investment opportunities and boosted productivity growth Mr Greenspan himself frequently sings the praises of the IT revolution and talks of a Fonceacentury phenomenonF Other economists go further and argue that in this new era of low inflation the Fed can throw away its rulebook the notions of a NAIRU and a maximum sustainable rate of growth have become redundant Inflation is dead Then again perhaps not AmericaFs productivity growth in the nonfarm sector has indeed increased to an annual average of over the past three years twice the average over the previous years The big question is whether this is just a cyclical blip or a permanent increase in trend growth If a big if this increase is maintained it may raise the economy F s noninflationary speed limit to a year say But that does not mean there are no limits to growth if it continues at its recent pace and the labour market continues to tighten inflation is bound to rise Some people may want to believe in economic miracles but there is an alternative explanation for AmericaFs low rate of inflation The country has benefited from four favourable factors First weak oil and commodity price s until earlier this year and a strong dollar and weak overseas demand especially in Asia have held down import prices Second an investment boo m has created excess capacity which has made it hard for firms to pass on wag e increases in higher prices Although unemployment is at a year low AmericaFs capacity utilisation is well below its historical average Thi rd nonwage labour costs have been curbed by a booming stockmarket which has allowed firms to reduce their contributions to employee pension plans And fourth the inflation rate has been nudged down by changes in the way of measuring it By holding down prices these factors have in turn helped to restrain wages But the old relationship between a tight labour market and wage growth remains alive and well real wage growth has accelerated over the past few years as you would expect when the unemployment rate is below the NAIRU This may have been temporarily offset by the favourable factors but as these effects wear off inflation is likely to creep up again Oil prices are already rising the dollar has slipped and recovery in the rest of the world will push up import prices There are also signs that nominal wage costs are now starting to pick up Goldilocks is in danger of burning her tongue and the Fed may come to regret that it did not raise interest rates sooner Despite the increases this summer real interest rates still remain lower than a year ago Reports of the death of inflation are therefore much

questions were relevant in a given year thus the year of the exam is sometimes included in brackets Short Answer True False or Uncertain and Why The grade you receive depends solely on the quality of your explanation If you are not sure of what the question assumes simply state your own assumptions clearly and answer based on these assumptions The US unemployment rate would decline rapidly if unemployment insurance were cut The rate of growth of M and M have both been fairly rapid recently Assume this sentence is true Thus we can expect that the inflation rate will soon increase rapidly In the late seventies the US had both high inflation and relatively high unemployment Thus the Phillips curve theory is wrong since it predicts that inflation and unemployment are negatively related Recently Canada has informally maintained a fixed exchange rate with the US This sentence is true As long as they target exchange rates monetary policy will not be effective in Canada You may want to refer to Canadian and US dollars as Cs and USs in your answer If the Japanese would lower their interest rates to expand their aggregate demand then Japanese purchases of US goods would increase Hint Consider the exchange rate Why is our money ever less valuable Perhaps it is simply that we have inflation because we expect inflation and we expect inflation because weve had it Robert M Solow Technology Review DecJan The current US Federal Government Budget Deficit BD is not a problem in the short run ie this year Fiscal policy is less effective in France than in the United States Hint Consider differences both in the openeconomy multiplier and the exchange rate regime Lowwage countries such Greece and Portugal will gain more from the creation on a common market than will highwage countries such as Germany and Denmark True unemployment is above measured unemployment We should not worry much about inflation The multiplier is higher when marginal tax rates marginal savings rates and marginal propensity to import are all high Budget deficits in a recession are a good thing For each dollar of revenue lost to the government capital gains tax cuts are less effective at spurring investment than are increases in the investment tax credit The federal government should increase spending on education Unions are responsible for a significant fraction of US unemployment Free trade hurts American workers but helps workers in lowwage nations It is good for the nation when monetary policy accommodates fiscal policy Frictional unemployment represents people rationally choosing to search for a job Thus no government policy is called for to address it European unemployment rates and unionization rates are both above US levels proving unions cause unemployment In class we assumed money demand depended on output and interest rates L kY hi In the ISLM framework when the demand for money k increases at any given level of output output and interest rates will rise A balanced budget rule so long as it corrected for cyclical factors would be a good thing Increasing consumption increases output Hint Is this a trick question In an open economy monetary policy is less effective than in a closed economy No policy can costeffectively reduce the rate of longterm unemployment Because the stock market falls when output and employment rise the market is not a good predictor of future output growth Japan will grow faster than Russia next year Japan will grow faster than Russia over the next years Russian inflation will decline next year The creation of the EMU will reduce Italian longterm interest rates The process of qualifying for the EMU has reduced French economic growth A Booming Economy Made it All Much Easier For the Shrinking Deficit Thank the Economy New York Times The recent actions of the Labour government concerning the Central Bank should lower expected inflation in the United Kingdom The recent appreciation of the US dollar is bad for Argentine Ireland should join the European Monetary Union Hints Irelands economy is closely tied to Europe but most closely to the United Kingdom Irish inflation has historically been above the EC average the Irish economy has been growing rapidly for several years and is likely approaching the output level associated with the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment and the Irish currency has been near the top of its permissible band of fluctuation against other European countries Investors give East Europe a miss Problems with legal system taxes crime and corruption deter foreign funds Financial Times The EMU should include Italy The multiplier is higher when marginal tax rates marginal savings rates the marginal propensity to import are all low and the investment accelerator is high The government should subsidize private savings The capital gains tax should cut but only if it is reformed The government should subsidize student loans for college Longer answers

While in class we focussed on fixed vs flexible exchange rates many nations have intermediate cases For example some nations have band where rates are fixed plus or minus some percent For example a nation may fix its rates at pesos per dollar plus or minus percent thus fixing between and pesos per dollar In other cases the fixed rate has a crawl built into it We fix at pesos to the dollar depreciating percent per month Other nations combine the two a band each month with builtin depreciation over time What are the advantages and disadvantages of these hybrid systems compared to pure fixed rates After evaluating all other relevant arguments for and against adoption of a fixed currency policymakers in the small open economy of Haasland are still undecided The costs seem to exactly equal the benefits The last piece of information they are to consider is that Haasland has historically been subject to more shocks of consumer and investor confidence than supply or price shocks Given this fact and the desire of Haasland policymakers to stabilize output what exchange rate policy would you recommend Hint Make reference to ISLM diagrams in which you show the effect on output and interest rates of a negative shock to the IS curve consumer or investor confidence and a negative shock to the LM curve supply or price shock under both fixed and floating exchange rates In the small open economy of New Zealand had a policy of maintaining a fixed exchange rate Suddenly due to a political crisis the risk premium for investment in New Zealand increased dramatically Policymakers were left with two options raise interest rates or devalue the currency Recommend a response based on an analysis of the impact of these policies on output interest rates and inflation

Paradox at WorkF on the hour week FLatin American markets rally Getting to the Bottom of Japans Economic Blues FA French Paradox at WorkF New York Times November By SUZANNE DALEY FASTATT France Last year the Beyer family which owns a small jam and fruit preserves plant here near the Swiss border made a proposal to th eir employees Would they like a hour workweek and continue to be paid for working hours To no ones great surprise the employees said yes An hour more for yourself is an hour more said Christiane Grimm whose job includes slapp ing labels on jars sorting through crates of fruit and watching over bubbling vats of jam Theres lots you can do with it Surprisingly the Beyers ended up happy too The company one of thousands of French enterprises that have reorganized their businesses because of a monthold law creating one of the shortest workweeks in the world believes that it is far better off than before In the reshuffle Philippe Beyer split his employees into two team s and staggered their shifts His factory here in the Alsace region now operates hours a day up from And it produces percent more than it did last year with only two extra employees The promise of hours of pay for hours of work was a campaign pl ank that helped catapult Lionel Jospins leftist coalition to power in the Parliament elections And it remains the glue that keeps Socialists Communists and Greens together It was aimed at creating as many as a mill ion jobs in a country that has struggled with a doubledigit rate of unemployme nt for years But many experts think that this bold experiment which business lead ers had warned would cripple Frances economy is not going to be a cureall fo r the nearly three million unemployed Instead it could accomplish something the leftist governing coalitio n never aimed for a kind of housecleaning in the French workplace that will tear the cobwebs from French industry and lead to a more productive and flexible work force as it did at Beyer The primary goal of this policy is very unlikely said Emanuel Ferr y an economist at Banque National de Paris who is studying the policy But it seems to be having a backdoor effect It is providing a very good opportun ity to renovate the workplace And it is introducing these elements productivity flexibility quietly without triggering social unrest So ev en if the direct goal of job creation is not achieved it may still not necessarily be a bad thing for the economy That may be but there is hardly a policy that has caused as much argument in France as the hour week While labor was an early advocate o f the idea many unions have recently demonstrated against it fearing that the way it is being carried out will freeze salary levels and reverse hardfoug ht gains in employee rights Businesses have protested too Last month some industrialists and executives gathered in an empty Paris conference center to wave placards and chant slogans deploring the policy They say i t will cost too much and destroy Frances competitiveness Average citizen s also seem to be losing their appetite for it Surveys show that the idea w as very popular when first proposed but resistance grew the more the French considered it A recent poll found that less than percent of Frances citizens now believe that they are going to benefit from shorter workweeks Most people suspect that one way or another they will be inconvenienced Either way it is a subject almost sure to start a fight People feel very strongly about it Beyer said In this country we are a little retrograde we live the way we lived years ago and this is forcing change and so people are uneasy with it So far there is little proof that the hour week has created many jobs Labor Ministry officials said in Parliament recently that the plan had created or saved new jobs But one legislator called the figures thin air and most economists say a more realistic number would probably be half tha t Opponents also point out that the government has been subsidizing the transition with business tax cuts and other incentives Frances economy grew at a healthy rate of percent in and i s expected to do nearly as well this year The unemployment rate has dropped to in August from a high of percent in June But few see much connection between the new jobs and the hour policy The hours was a political decision a Finance Ministry official said but it may become a really positive thing Nothing was moving befor e Now suddenly everyone has to go back and look at the way we have been doin g business People are talking and thinking and being creative The process of carrying out this complicated law passed in June is still in its early stages This month Parliament passed a tangle of more t han amendments spelling out exactly how and when the policy should be instituted One rule All companies with employees or more must operate with a hour workweek by the year So far only about businesses or little more than percent of eligible French employers have formally made plans for the conversion Economists say the brunt of the law will be felt unevenly Some businesses like the Beyer factory will benefit Others including service industries are likely to have a much harder time George Jallerat who owns Le Grand Monarque Hotel and Restaurant in Chartres says he cannot figure out how to reduce his employees hours pa y them the same wages and not lose money In the end we will have to raise prices he said There is no other way Some entrepreneurs are already taking steps to protect themselves Dr Thierry Sandr employs people in his medical lab on the outskirts of Paris He says he will do all that he can to avoid hiring a th person and bring the hour workweek into his business But he does not trust the government to leave him alone So he has no t raised the pay of any of his employees in two years as a way of saving mo ney for the day he has to give them a hour workweek for hours of pay He says he is not alone While the hour workweek was being debated government officials beg an trying to enforce the hour limit that now exists even among managers Agents prowled garages to see what time people were actually leaving Thousands of fines were issued and in one case the director of a electronics factory owned by ThomsonRCM was hauled into court for working too hard and allowing his engineers and other managers to put in an average of hours a week In June he received an fine The action prompted some businesses to install time clocks even for managers and made the governmen t the butt of jokes Those who have jumped at the shortened workweek are often those who w ere already planning to expand their businesses For instance the Packard Bell factory in the western town of Angers which makes computers went to the hour week this year precisely because it wanted to increase production b y percent To do that it needed to reorganize its employees into more teams and more shifts Offering a hour week was a way of opening negotiations with its unions JeanLuc Bayel the director of human resources said the plan had wor ked out even better than anyone expected We have far less absenteeism Baye l said And we are seeing a better product People have to stand to do the job and standing for eight hours is hard Now they stand for only seven and we are seeing a percent reduction in problem computers We are very happy with the changes Packard Bell did not take advantage of government subsidies because i t did not want to follow government rules But others like Beyer also saw in the new law a way of getting government aid to pay for expansion plans At Beyer for instance the government aid package will pay nearly percent of the salary for the two employees he added this year Next year it will pay about percent and percent the year after that But Beyer w ho took over the business from his father two years ago wanted to expand anyway He says he might have gone ahead with his plans anyhow but the law gave h im a push Not far from Beyers factory Didier Thuet who owns a small heating installation business adopted the hour week for just the same reason I t was an opportunity to try something he said Thuets business is seasonal There is little work at all from March to May So he offered his employees a shorter workweek during those months in exchange for a longer one during peak business periods They also got an additional six to eight days off All six of the employees agreed to a sal ary freeze until the year was over and the company could see how much money it made But both Thuet and Beyer have their doubts about whether the law will work everywhere And there are complaints from the supposed beneficiaries of the new jobs At Beyer Sarah Charro who at had a series of temporary jobs was hire d because of the reorganization but she has little good to say about it Sh e says the atmosphere in the factory is tense I feel in some ways like we went backward Ms Charro said We are working only hours but they are trying to push a lot into those hours push push push We are all stressed out Thuets new employee Christoffe Foulon says the hour week is grea t if he does not lose any money But in truth he would rather work more and ea rn more He says few of his friends seem to envy him Instead he says most give him a hard time They treat me like Im lazy he said Published Monday November in the San Jose Mercury News FLatin American markets rallyF Simon Romero New York Times SAO PAULO Brazil Buoyed by fresh inflows of overseas investment money st ock markets in Latin America are staging a rally that could presage a return t o economic growth in many of the regions countries next year Over the last few weeks indexes like the Bovespa on the Sao Paulo stock exchange Latin Americas largest stock market have soared to a sixmonth high In Mexico Latin Americas secondlargest country the bolsa index reached a threemonth high On the coattails of these markets stocks in Argentina Chile and Colombia registered healthy gains Much of the rally has been fueled by relief over potential interest rate increases in the United States as recent economic reports have led some investors to believe that only one increase in rates instead of several is likely in coming months Lower interest rates in the United States Latin Americas biggest source of investment translates into more money availab le for purchases of stocks in the region However a growing consensus that Latin America is positioned for a revi val of economic growth next year is also encouraging investors to increase the ir stock holdings The recovery of some commodities prices healthy demand for Latin Americ an exports in rich industrialized nations and political and economic developments in countries like Mexico have led analysts such as Geoffrey Dennis of Salo mon Smith Barney to predict percent growth for the region as a whole next year compared with fourtenths of a percent contraction in Investors are lifting the veil from a period in which Latin America was oversold said Edmar Bacha the New Yorkbased strategist for Banco BBA Creditanstalt What theyre seeing minus the threat of higher Fed rates is a region looking a lot better next year than this year One of the best examples of this newfound optimism is Chile a nation th at was hit hard by the economic crisis suffered by some of its Pacific Rim trading partners Helped by lower domestic interest rates and a recovery in the price of copper Chiles economy is expected to grow percent in compared with a shrinkage of half a percent this year And coming presidential elections are not viewed as risky since the two leading candidates are pledging a simil ar blend of centrist economic policies said Neil Dougall an economist with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson In Mexico politics is also generating optimism over the economy with concern easing over the possibility of disruption resulting from primary presidential elections And strong growth in the United States Mexicos m ain export market contributes to positive sentiment over the countrys econom y which is increasingly viewed by economists as more linked to its northern neighbors than to the rest of Latin America Yet while prospects look better in countries like Chile and Mexico it is in Brazil Latin Americas biggest economy where most attention is focused So perhaps it is no small wonder that the rally lifting most Latin markets is nowhere as dramatic as it is here Two weeks ago Brazils currency the real was getting hammered as speculators who had been betting on weakness pushed the real beyond two to the dollar for the first time in eight months As alarm grew over the reals decline Brazil successfully sought greater flexibility to defend the currency by using money from the International Monetary Fund which has oversight o ver such matters because it is financing an economic aid package to the countr y The real began to strengthen All of a sudden there was much less pressure on the bank to raise rate s to attract foreign capital said Carlos Novis Guimaraes head of Latin American investment banking at Lehman Brothers With the likelihood larger that Brazil might lower rates rather than raise them a fresh assessment emerged Corporate profits like those from eucalyptus producers benefitting from higher pulp prices and banks prosper ing from prescient investment strategies suggested an economic recovery stron ger than once thought Most analysts are predicting Brazils economy will grow percent in compared with percent expected this year Still investors remain cautious about the potential for rebound While shocks like Ecuadors moratorium on foreign bonds seem to have been absorb ed without causing much damage to investor sentiment other factors lead some investors to remain wary For instance interest rate increases abroad like those announced Thurs day by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England could undermine Lati n Americas stock rally Reticence by Brazils Congress to approve governmen t proposals to simplify the tax system and trim pension spending may also ra ise a red flag Nevertheless an important shift in sentiment seems to be taking place It appears that global risk aversion is lowering after the collapses predicte d by some people never materialized said Ernest Brown senior Latin America economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter JAPAN ECHO Vol No February Getting to the Bottom of Japans Economic Blues KOJIMA Akira The Japanese economy found itself pushed to the edge of a precipice in by a rapid surge of deflationary pressure Obuchi Keizo who succeeded Hashimoto Ryutaro as prime minister at the end of July proclaimed his new administration an economic revitalization cabinet and policy at least shifted in the right direction however belatedly The government secured passage for legislation setting aside a huge volume of public funds to deal with the stricken financial sector and it approved fiscal outlays on an unprecedented scale to stimulate demand Thanks to these measures the econ omy managed to stop just short of the precipice During the economy should enjoy a bit of a breather as the effects of the heavy dose of government stimulus take hold But it will be no more than a breather and it will be essential for financial institutions to take advantage of this temporary respite to restructure their operations and for business corporations to undertake serious efforts to strengthen themselves If they fail to do so the economy is liable to slip back into critical condit ion as soon as the effects of the stimulus have worn off This year will be a decisive one representing as it does the last chance of the twentieth cent ury for the Japanese economy to be revitalized After achieving a recovery labeled miraculous in the years after Wo rld War II our countrys economy suddenly lost its momentum in the final decad e of the century The downturn started in and from through the growth rate was close to zero In and the economy managed to expa nd by but then in fiscal April to March it contracted by And the growth rate for fiscal is being estimated at around This will be the first time in the postwar period that the economy has recorded negative growth for two years in a row It will also mean that the average growth rate from through will fall to dipping below the mark Why did the economy suddenly lose its steam The main causes are th e speculative bubbles of the late s and the policy blunders following the ir bursting starting in Over the course of history countries around the world have experienced economic bubbles Where they differ is in the skill of their policies to deal with the aftermath Japans record on this score has clearly been a string of failures Until the authorities did virtually nothing to promote the clearing up of the large volume of loans that went b ad after the collapse of the bubble economy This huge overhang of nonperformi ng assets in the financial sector acted as a drag on the economy as a whole preventing it from regaining its forward momentum And as the recession dragged on the baddebt problem grew even greater in scale The situation deteriorated to the point where a series of major financial institutions went bankrupt i n November setting off an overall contraction of credit Earlier in the year the government had implemented a set of belttightening measures including a hike of the consumption tax from t o that produced a negative fiscal impulse on the order of trillion In other words was a year of powerful deflationary pushes from both the monetary and fiscal sides of the macroeconomic picture No economy could withstand this sort of double punch without buckling Particularly from November on the economy was obviously heade d down but even so the government dallied in shifting its fiscal stance and in dealing with the bad debts that were at the root of the financial deflation What set off the powerful deflationary contraction of credit was the first occurrence of default in the interbank market in the postwar period in earl y November Despite the smallness of the amount defaulted the market panicke d because all its transactions were premised on the absolute impossibility of default Financial institutions became leery of extending credit to each other and the interbank market ceased to function smoothly Every institution tri ed to build up its own liquidity And financial institutions whose capital was meager by comparison with the scale of their nonperforming loans found themselves coming under a fierce attack in the stock market As a result t hey moved to raise their capital adequacy ratios by cutting back on their lending This set off a classic credit crunch LENDER OF FIRST RESORT When matters reach this sort of pass the relaxation of monetary policy by the central bank fails to affect the real economy Though the Bank of Ja pan has adopted an extremely loose policy stance actual financial conditions h ave become severely tightened This can be seen most clearly in the relationshi p between the money supply and bank credit Normally when the money supply c ash and bank deposits expands the volume of lending by banks grows accordingl y and financial conditions relax But in the credit contraction that became pronounced from the end of on bank lending has shrunk in volume despi te growth of the money supply For example if we look at the figures for the socalled city banks Japans major moneycenter banks in the month period ending September we find that their deposits were up but their outstanding loans decreased by or trillion And the ratio of loans to deposits fel l by a remarkable percentage points over the same period Banks were under pressure to write off their bad loans which they had been putting off doin g the capital crunch in the financial sector was accompanied by a credit crun ch in the general economy So what have the banks been doing with their increased deposits Th ey have been avoiding risk by investing them in government bonds and as a res ult the yield on the governments year issues has fallen below This is a first for Japan of course and in fact it is unprecedented in capital mark ets around the world The problem is that even as government bond yields have been falling the yield on the corporate bond issues of big businesses has been rising In other words not only has it become harder for businesses to bor row from banks but it has also become harder for them to raise funds from the capital market Even so major corporations have been raising some funds through bond issues But smaller firms that are not in a position to issue their own bonds have felt the full brunt of banks cutbacks in lending If this situation were left untreated the Japanese economy would h ave no prospect of recovering During the course of therefore the Bank o f Japan implemented largescale purchases via banks of commercial paper wh ich are notes issued by corporations to cover their operating expenses In effe ct the central bank was stepping in to lend where regular banks would not One might even say that it became the lender not of last resort but of first resort In addition other governmentaffiliated financial institutions hav e been actively extending loans to companies and other firms The root cause of the contraction in bank lending is the remaining pile of bad loans which has still not been adequately dealt with In order to alleviate this problem the government has come up with a massive trill ion package of public funding for the financial sector But bank executives are reluctant to make use of these public funds fearing that if they do they will be expected to take responsibility for the failure of their earlier lending decisions And under these circumstances the credit crunch appears certain to continue even if it becomes somewhat less serious in degree The gravity of the baddebt problem is apparent from the volume of the asset value lost as a result of the collapse of the bubble economy In the period from through land prices fell trillion and from through stock prices dropped trillion In other words the value of assets in these two major categories plunged by over quadrillion in the postbubble period an amount equivalent to more than two years gross national product Since a large portion of the purchases of both land and stocks had been financed by bank lending the deflation in these asset values led directly to the emergence of huge amounts of bad loans STRUCTURAL FACTORS ADDING TO THE DRAG The principal causes of the Japanese economys sudden loss of momen tum in the s thus appear to have been the policy failures in dealing with t he aftermath of the bubble years in connection both with the baddebt problem and the handling of fiscal affairs These were not the only causes however Ot her factors systemic and structural account for probably to of the to tal negative change A number of problems may be cited in this connection Japan completed the decadeslong process of catching up with the West The country was tardy in coping systematically with the forces of globalization and megacompetition that picked up strength following the end of the cold war The Japanese population has been aging at a pace never experienced by any country in the world and this has heightened peoples concerns about the future The focus of technology has been shifting from manufacturing toward information software and services The end of the catchup process meant less scope for growth through the introduction of technologies and products from overseas forcing Japan to r ely on innovations of its own to achieve further economic expansion Furthermor e it had to do so within the context of the worlds highest average wage leve ls Next the advent of megacompetition meant the emergence of rivalry from the newly industrialized economies many with wages only a tenth or a fifteenth of Japans placing Japanese businesses in a highly disadvantageous positio n Population aging meanwhile is a process that has been going on in all the industrial nations but in Japans case it has been progressing at an especially rapid clip This has forced the country to scramble in order to make the required systemic adjustments in areas like pensions and employment In addition to the rise in longevity there has been a sharp decline in the birthrate which has further accelerated the rise in the elderly share of t he population Early in the twentyfirst century the total number of Japanese is expected to start declining In the years following the end of World War II the population grew by an average of about million people a year but in the years to come it is estimated that it will decline on average by half a million a year This will mean a shrinking labor force which will face an increased burden in supporting the growing numbers of elderly and it will also mean shrinking markets Various systems including pensions taxes employment and wages will have to be reformed fundamentally in order to keep them fro m collapsing Meanwhile of course the vitality of the economy will wane an d with it the capacity for economic growth The outlook is bleak Finally the paradigm shift in technology will pose a major challen ge for Japan in the period to come During the twentieth century Japan has bee n extraordinarily successful with its technology for standardized mass production which was the dominant paradigm of the century Automobiles and electric appliances are representative of the fields in which Japanese manufacturers have won strong positions But since the early s when Japanese industry was seen by many people to be victorious the focus in highvalue technology has been shifting away from standardized mass product ion in the direction of knowledgeintensive and informationintensive areas fr om hardware to software and from manufacturing to services As globalization has progressed capital technology and managemen t knowhow have been moved actively across national borders and standardized production was easily shifted to the newly industrialized economies The medium for these transfers has been crossborder direct investment which has grow n by leaps and bounds since the end of the cold war We have entered an age in which comparative advantage in standard mass production can be imported This produces a tendency toward price leveling In most cases the trend is a downward one with prices being drawn to the level of the lowwage countrie s And it makes it difficult for a high wage country like Japan to sustain hig h valueadded production THE PARADOX OF SUCCESS There are two ways out of this difficulty One is to shift manufacturing operations overseas to take advantage of lower wage levels The other is fo r businesses to compete in nonprice areas by coming up with their own technologies and products Corporations that shift their operations offshor e can continue to enjoy growth in their consolidated results on a global basi s but meanwhile they are promoting the hollowing out of the domestic manufacturing sector For Japan as a whole the second alternative nonprice competition is more desirable especially now that the goal of catching up with the West has been accomplished But in order to succeed at this endeav or it will be necessary to recast the whole set of systems that were designed for the catchup period The new systems will have to shift their focus from th e achievement of equality of results to support of those who take risks and display creativity The system of automatic wage hikes in line with increas ing seniority will have to be overhauled and the egalitarianism of the school system will also have to be modified Making such reforms will mean fundamentally changing the social val ues to which we have become accustomed Resistance is likely to be great Peopl e will be quick to agree with the need for reform in principle but will resis t the particulars that affect their own areas of activity Already over the p ast decade we have witnessed many loud calls for reform leading to numerous reports and recommendations but there has been little by way of implementation One reason for this lack of followthrough is the fantastic success that Japan enjoyed in the economic sphere for the previous several decades Sinc e the existing systems and practices were so successful for so long they hav e become quite hard to change This is the paradox of success or reward of success to which Peter Drucker refers It may be possible for the Japanese economy to get out of its curre nt hole by overcoming the credit crunch arising out of the baddebt problem an d correcting the earlier mistakes in fiscal policy This however will amoun t to no more than the righting of earlier wrongs In order for our economy and society to demonstrate vigor and creatively produce new value and new technologies in the century to come we must overcome the paradox of succe ss and remake our longstanding systems and practices The lack of progress toward this goal is the source of our current sense of being at an impasse The massive dose of financial and fiscal stimulus that the government is now administering should halt the severe downturn that started in November and in we can hope to see at least faint signs of a recovery Bu t it is essential that this respite be used to achieve progress toward systemic reform Unless this is accomplished the s

D Exports Imports Also in an open economy Y D C I G NX When exports rise foreigners buy m ore of our output thus aggregate demand for domestically produced goods rises When imports rise we are buying from foreigners so imported purchases do not en ter domestic aggregate demand NX D trade surplus D trade deficit D net borrowing from abro ad When NX is negative imports exports we have a trade deficit This is finan ced by borrowing from abroad To a first approximation when the US spends mor e on exports than it earns on imports it needs to borrow to make up the difference The trade deficit is not exactly equal to borrowing from abroad because of the returns from net foreign assets When the US was a creditor nation it also made money on its investments abroadthis income permitted a modest trade deficit without borrowing Now as a debtor nation a modest trade surplus is required to avoid the need for new borrowing We are also ignoring government buying and selling of currencies The Current Account Surplus D Exports Imports interest and profits received from net foreign assets Exchange rates An exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another For example a French Franc FF costs yesterday while it was when I traveled in France in The US currently has floating exchange rates meaning that the valu e of the dollar fluctuates The is about yen today but has varied from to in the last months Thus the dollar bought fewer yeni t weakenedover much of the last year Under fixed exchange rates there would in principle be no dayto day changes in the exchange rate The Federal Reserve would buy and sell dolla rs and foreign currencies to keep the exchange rate fixed The float is a lit tle bit dirty since the Fed and other central banks intervene on currency markets ie buy and sell dollars to affect the value of the dollar Unlike the US most nations in the world fix their exchange rates with someone A few dozen use common currencies the West African Franc is used by many former French colonies and Panama uses the US Other countries such as Argentine or Hong Kong promise to keep as many US dollars or DM as they have circulating currency this currency board arrangement makes a fixed exchange rate credible because if folks want to sell the local currency th ere are always dollars or DM to redeem them The value of the dollar Many factors affect the value of the dollar US and foreign aggregate demand US and foreign interest rates speculative bubbles and so forth The dollar becomes stronger ie can buy more of a foreign currency when US real interest rates r are high If r is high then foreigners want to buy dollars in order to put them into US banks and recei ve the high interest rate When the demand for dollars goes up so does its price in terms of foreign currencies it gets stronger The net demand for dollars is low and the dollar will depreciate weaken when Foreigners dont want to buy US goods US exports low foreigne rs importing little US want to buy foreign goods US imports high foreigners exporting a lot US AD high implies leakage to foreign markets IM high Foreigners dont want to buy US assets often when US interest rates are low US wants to buy foreign assets often when foreign real interest rates are high People think will get even weaker This adds a speculative dimension so speculative bubbles sometimes appear to be important as are expectation s of foreign or US changes in policy David Levine Macroeconomics November A Morality Play of International Trade Chris and Pat were having a conversation one day upstairs at Kips Chris Pat I dont see how you can be for free trade If Taiwan grows fas ter than us we will lose Pat Chris you clearly do not understand the great economist Ricardos ide a of Comparative Advantage C Thats for sure I dont Wazzat P Comparative advantage is what you are least worst or most best at For example this great entrepreneur whose name escapes me was the worlds fast est typist but hired a secretary nevertheless He was perhaps times as productive as she was as an entrepreneur but only times as productive as a typistthus he had absolute advantage in both but she had comparative advantage in typing C So what does that have to do with free trade P An example may clarify Step over to this handy blackboard and let me write a bit First imagine a world with two countries the US and Taiwan and two goods computers and wine Further assume that labor is the only inpu t into production Each country has hours of labor First consider a case with no trade when each nations output equals their consumption USA WITH NO TRADE Product Productivity Output computers hrs PC wine hrs bottle total hours D D TAIWAN WITH NO TRADE Product Productivity Output computers hrs PC wine hrs bottle total hours D D Note that Taiwan makes computers in the US time and wine in the US time Thus Taiwan has absolute advantage at both wine and computers Tai wan has comparative advantage is most best at computers US has comparative advantage is least worse at wine Now lets see what happens if we permit trade The US will specialize in wine what it is best at The world price will be about bottles of wine per P C in the world with trade USA WITH TRADE Product Productivity Output Consumption computers hrs PC wine hrs bottle wine hrs bottle total hours D D consumption of wine D production sold to Taiwan consumption of computers D bought from Taiwan TAIWAN WITH TRADE Product Productivity Output Consumption computers hrs PC wine hrs bottle total hours D D Both countries receive at least as much of both goods after trade The ex act price with free trade and therefore the amount of consumption in each country depends on the demand elasticities in the two countries and other factors Thus in a world of comparative advantage trade helps both countries Nations should specialize in what they do best Complete specialization as in thi s example is an extreme case As Adam Smith pointed out years ago specialization permits all to grow wealthier C Your argument assumes quite a bit Implicit in your example is the assumption that when the US quits producing computers all of those Coryha ll types be magically transformed into Vit Eno majors from Davis If we are in a recession then the computer workers who lose their jobs wont get new jo bs policies to protect our domestic industry can avoid unemployment and increa se aggregate demand P You are recommending beggarthyneighbor policies since any gain in o ur demand is offset by losses to our neighbors If we get started on that ta ck the whole world loses Not everyone can increase demand by restricting imports C Even without the macroeconomic problem there is still the unemployment caused by free trade destroying industries How will all the excomputer f olk get the skills to make wine P You are correct and both US computer makers and Taiwanese wine makers both companies and employees prefer not to have trade in the short run The po int is that the winners ie US wine makers Taiwanese computer makers and consumers in both countries win more than the losers lose C If free trade brings so many benefits then it should bring enough prosperity to compensate the losers It is not fair to the computer worker s that they bear the cost of adjustment It makes sense to tax some of the winners and pay some subsidy to help the losers retrain Full employment is not your only key assumption You also assume that mark ets are competitive so that firms make no monopoly profits In fact it appea rs that some industries make big profits When we lose market share in these industries the capital flows to a less profitable industry P Again I must grant your point that there are monopolistic industries an d most Americans would rather the monopoly profits stay at home In general free trade eliminates monopoly profits and will help consumers enormously C Yes but in addition to there being highprofit industries there are highwage industries so workers care which industry they are in When we lose market share in these industries the workers move to industries with lower pay and lower productivity Autoworkers who become hamburger flippers are not making a marginal switch to their next bestpaying job For example Boeing has traditionally made big profits and paid its worker s well When Europeans subsidized Airbus and we lost airplane manufacturing jobs we lost both those high profits and the workers had to move to lowerwage employers P I agree that it is theoretically possible for subsidies to increase a nations welfare if the subsidies bring oligopoly profits and highwage jo bs Nevertheless it would be better for everyone if nobody subsidized and markets were more competitive In the US today both imports and exports are mostl y made in highwage jobs Thus we should favor the expansion of trade not restrictions C Your hypothetical situation is irrelevant since other nations are subsidizing Japan is famous for protecting its industries until they beco me big enough to compete internationallythen watch out P Do you really think that the US steel auto and computer industries are too small to compete internationally C Well I have to admit that USX GM and IBM are not what one usually thin ks of as part of infant industries But the Japanese also subsidize industrie s and dump exports below cost in order to drive competitors out of business Once they have a monopoly then they really gouge P Have the Japanese really increased prices of color TVs RAM chips or ot her goods Antidumping laws primarily mean that foreigners are not allowed to cut pricesprice cuts that would benefit US consumers Even with an uneven playing field I disagree with you As usual with protectionists you ignore consumers When European subsidies created Airb us Airbus made the market for passenger aircraft much more competitive US consumers won in terms of lower airfaressomething you forgot to stress in your arguments about Boeings loss of high profits and highwage jobs I am very suspicious of these claims that we need to protect all sorts of industries since it gives companies enormous incentives to pour money into lobbying The large firms of the US steel industry have been incredibly successful at lobbying for protection This protection has mostly protecte d an inefficient oligopoly at great cost to US consumers C But we sometimes need protection as a stick to beat foreigners into opening their markets to us P While protection can be a stick it is not easy to wield It seems most likely to lead to a trade war where retaliation by foreigners leads them t o close markets to us if we restrict trade Usually when we run protectionism it is in the form of the misnamed voluntary export restraint VER like the one that we have with the Japanese for automobiles These basically require the foreigners to form a cartel lower sales and increase price I do not know why the US government helps foreigners run cartels that hurt US consumers Antitrust policy is suppos ed to restrict cartels The auto VERs cost consumers over for each US job that is saved C Well I am not convinced All of your arguments concerning the advanta ges of free trade are based on this notion of comparative advantage which you assume is somehow granted by nature In todays hightech industries comparative advantage is won by experience in producing complicated technologies not by weather or natural resources P If comparative advantage is won by experience then experience in produc ing becomes a sort of investment Why cant US firms undertake investments tha t are profitable You cannot seriously believe that IBM is too small to comp ete with foreigners C But there are spillovers from one industry to another The experience o f Silicon Valley for example shows that when one part of hightech does wel l other parts learn from it and do well also Even your economists have always agreed that when there are positive externalities that there is a role for public subsidies For example an innovating firm rarely captures all the gains of its research and developme nt In the example above when new computer technologies are developed only th e Taiwanese will be able to develop the new products based on their expertise in PC manufacture P I agree that companies providing positive spillovers should be encourage d I think that support of university research coupled with an RD tax credit makes more sense than protectionism You on the other hand seem to be promoting an industrial policy in whi ch the government picks winners to promote Didnt the billions of dollars th at France and Britain poured into the Concorde supersonic transport as well a s wastage of the US with Synfuels synthetic gasoline teach you that industria l policy wont work C Well arent you selfrighteous The US has always had a multitude of vigorous and expensive industrial policies they have just gone under a variety of other names and have never been coordinated to work together Agricultu re receives billions in subsidies steel and textiles have quotas on imports Lockheed and Chrysler received governmentbacked loans and housing gets th e mortgage interest deduction Perhaps most importantly a vast proportion o f our research is funded by the military which has always looked to advantag es for certain industries All I want is a rational and democratic industrial policy We should coordinate our goals and choose our subsidies more democratically and in ways that do not work to crosspurposes For example any bailouts or protection from impor ts should be short run and explicitly tied to promises to invest in new machinery and new skills for workers New technologies to be promoted should be chos en by democraticallychosen representatives not by nameless bureaucrats at DA RPA the Defense Advanced Projects Research Administrationan agency almost nobody has heard of P I would just as soon cut subsidies to all those industries as adjust wha t subsidies I give Nevertheless I grant you that if subsidies are given th ey should at least include promises from the industry and its workers to inves t not just enjoy high current wages and profits C Youre starting to talk sense now We must always keep in mind that America needs high tech to maintain its competitiveness P I dont understand this word competitiveness I like you would like US productivity to grow quickly so that we are more prosperous and have more resources to care for the disadvantaged the environment and so forth I care about the absolute level of US growth not the relative level C But if the US growth more slowly than Japan we will lose our standing a s a world power P I am not thrilled about any nation being overwhelmingly powerful It is ok with me if the US must consult with its allies before invading various smal l open economies C Well I have won enough points from you that I should probably stop Yo u agree that at least in theory protectionism can help keep highprofit highwage and highspillover industries at home and raise national output P I must agree in theory and also remind you that the industries have political clout to receive protectionism are often the worstrun Furthermore any protectionist policy leads to the risk of trade wars and they make everyone worse off C Hey

monetary policy Do you think this is appropriate for the entire class Thanks Jay Iyer econrsrchwklyltrwklyltrelhtml Economic Research FRBSF Economic Letter Number January indexhtmEconomic Letter Index The Goals of US Monetary Policy The evolution of the Feds legislative mandate The debate about the Feds current mandate References The Federal Reserve has seen its legislative mandate for monetary policy change several times since its founding in when macroeconomic policy as such was not clearly understood The most recent revisions were in and and they require the Fed to promote both price stability and full employment The past changes in the mandate appear to reflect both economic events in the US and advances in understanding how the economy functions In the twenty years since the Feds mandate was last changed there have been further important economic developments as well as refinements in economic thought and these raise the issue of whether to modify the goals for US monetary policy once again Indeed a number of other countriesnotably those that adopted the Euro as a common curency at the start of this yearhave accepted price stability as the new primary goal for their monetary policies In this Letter we spell out the evolution of the legislation governing US monetary policy goals and summarize the debate about whether they could be improved The evolution of the Feds legislative mandate The Federal Reserve Act of did not incorporate any macroeconomic goals for monetary policy but instead required the Fed to provide an elastic currency This meant that the Fed should help the economy avoid the financial panics and bank runs that plagued the th century by serving as a lender of last resort which involved making loans directly to depository institutions through the discount windows of the Reserve Banks During this early period most of the actions of monetary policy that affected the macro economy were determined by the US governments adherence to the gold standard The trauma of the Great Depression coupled with the insights of Keynes led to an acknowledgment of the obligation of the federal government to prevent recessions The Employment Act of was the first legislative statement of these macroeconomic policy goals Although it did not specifically mention the Federal Reserve it required the federal government in general to foster conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment opportunities for those able willing and seeking to work and to promote maximum employment production and purchasing power The Great Inflation of the s was the next major US economic dislocation This problem was addressed in a amendment to the Federal Reserve Act which provided the first explicit recognition of price stability as a national policy goal The amended Act states that the Fed shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economys long run potential to increase production so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates The goals of stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates are related because nominal interest rates are boosted by a premium over real rates equal to expected future inflation Thus stable prices will typically produce longterm interest rates that are moderate The objective of maximum employment remained intact from the Employment Act however the interpretation of this term may have changed during the intervening years Immediately after World War II when conscription and price controls had produced a highpressure economy with very low unemployment in the US some perhaps believed that the goal of maximum employment could be taken in its mathematical sense to mean the highest possible level of employment However by the second half of the s it was well understood that some frictional unemployment which involves the search for new jobs and the transition between occupations is a necessary accompaniment to the proper functioning of the economy in the long run This understanding went hand in hand in the latter half of the s with a general acceptance of the Natural Rate Hypothesis which implies that if policy were to try to keep employment above its longrun trend permanently or equivalently the unemployment rate below its natural rate then inflation would be pushed higher and higher Policy can temporarily reduce the unemployment rate below its natural rate or equivalently boost employment above its longrun trend However persistently attempting to maintain maximum employment that is above its longrun level would not be consistent with the goal of stable prices Thus in order for maximum employment and stable prices to be mutually consistent goals maximum employment should be interpreted as meaning maximum sustainable employment referred to also as full employment Moreover although the Fed has little if any influence on the longrun level of employment it can attempt to smooth out shortrun fluctuations Accordingly promoting full employment can be interpreted as a countercyclical monetary policy in which the Fed aims to smooth out the amplitude of the business cycle This interpretation of the Feds mandate was later confirmed in the HumphreyHawkins legislation As its official titlethe Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of clearly implies this legislation mandates the federal government generally to promote full employment and production increased real income balanced growth a balanced Federal budget adequate productivity growth proper attention to national priorities achievement of an improved trade balance and reasonable price stability italics added Besides clarifying the general goal of full employment the HumphreyHawkins Act also specified numerical definitions or targets The Act specified two initial goals an unemployment rate of for full employment and a CPI inflation rate of for price stability These were only interim goals to be achieved by and followed by a further reduction in inflation to by however the disinflation policies during this period were not to impede the achievement of the fullemployment goal Thereafter the timetable to achieve or maintain price stability and full employment was to be defined by each years Economic Report of the President The debate about the Feds current mandate The Fed then has two main legislated goals for monetary policy promoting full employment and promoting stable prices With this mandate the Fed has helped foster the exceptional performance of the US economy during the past decade Still some have argued that the Feds mandate could be improved especially in looking ahead to future attempts to maintain or institutionalize recent low inflation Much discussion has centered on two topics the transparency of the goals and their dual nature The transparency of goals refers to the extent to which the objectives of monetary policy are clearly defined and can be easily and obviously understood by the public The goal of full employment will never be very transparent because it is not directly observed but only estimated by economists with limited precision For example the Economic Report of the President which has authority in this matter from the HumphreyHawkins Act gives a range of to for the unemployment rate consistent with full employment with a midpoint of Research suggests that there is a very wide range of uncertainty around any estimate of the natural rate with one prominent study finding a probability that it falls in the wide range of to see Walsh Price stability as a goal is also subject to some ambiguity Recent economic analysis has uncovered systematic biases say on the order of percentage point in the CPIs measurement of inflation see Motley In this case actual price stability would be consistent with measured inflation of In addition at any point in time different price indexes register different rates of inflation Over the past year for example the CPI has risen about while the GDP price index has risen about Still a transparent price stability goal could be specified as a precise numerical growth rate or range for a particular index which could take into account any biases However economists have also suggested other ways to enhance the transparency of policy For example publishing mediumterm inflation forecasts might help to clarify the direction of policy Rudebusch and Walsh Because the central bank has some control over inflation in the medium term its forecasts would contain an indication of where it wanted inflation to go A second recent proposed modification to the Feds goals involves focusing to a larger extent on price stability and deemphasizing business cycle stabilization Some economists have argued that having dual goals will lead to an inflation bias despite the Feds best attempts to control inflation This argument stresses that the temptation to engineer gains in output in the short run will overcome the central banks desire to control inflation in the long run As a result of elevated inflation expectations of the public inflation will end up being higher than the central bank intended despite its best efforts This timeinconsistency argument as economists call it coupled with the pain incurred in the s as inflation skyrocketed and in the early s as inflation was reduced to moderate levels persuaded many that the primary goal of the central bank should be to stabilize prices This view is embodied in the charter for the central bank in the new European Monetary Union The primary objective of the European System of Central Banks is to maintain price stability Without prejudice to the objective of price stability the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community Among these latter policies are a high level of employment and a balanced development of economic activities Economists remain divided on the importance of the time inconsistency problem and on the need to put primary emphasis on price stability at the expense of output stabilization Some stress the fact that the central bank is the only entity that can guarantee price stability and that this goal is not likely to be attained for long unless price stability is designated as the primary goal Others find the arguments for time inconsistency implausible because policymakers who are aware of the arguments about an inflationary bias and see the implications for inflation can conduct policy without an inflationary bias McCallum Still others argue that the abdication of other goals is irresponsible Fuhrer Also a good deal of empirical research using simulations of models of the US economy suggests that a focus on dual goals can reduce the variance of real GDP ie smooth the business cycle while achieving an inflation goal as well Rudebusch and Svensson While these issues are not yet resolved the experience of the past two decades provides some support to those who think dual goals that lack transparency can function successfully It is true that some countries around the world have reduced inflation over this period while putting primary emphasis on explicit inflation targeting But at the same time with its current legislative mandate the Fed also has had success in reducing inflation while maintaining the

San Francisco Chronicle December p A In the s Republicans argued that the tax cuts they proposed would make the economy grow faster because the rich would redirect energy from avoiding taxes to entrepreneurship Unfortunately the theory was wrong The most optimistic serious assessment of the effects from the tax cuts by supplysider Larry Lindsay show supplyside benefits of the tax cut far lower than the burden of the debt they generated Now Republicans are again proposing tax cuts Today skepticism infects even the core of the Republican coalition The Wall Street Journals editorial pages attacked the tax cuts as being the kind that former Democratic Congressman Rostenkowski might have producedsurely the worst insult they can imagine Principled Republican economic advisers are silent There is not even a theory under which the Republicans capital gains tax cut child credit and increase in taxes on families that qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit EITC could boost growth Start with the capital gains tax cut It provides no incentives to boost investment No manager deciding whether to build a factory buy a computer or engage in research and development changes his or her calculation of expected profit because of a reduction in capital gains taxes Some proponents believe the tax cut will boost investment and growth indirectly by increasing savings They note that the tax cut raises the aftertax returns on savings placed in risky assets such as shares of stock They then claim higher returns on these assets will in turn induce higher savings Higher savings will drive down interest rates which in turn will raise business investment and growth But this roundabout chain of cause and effect falls apart at the first touch Both the capital gains tax rate and the aftertax return to savings have wandered all over the place in the past generation Private savings have barely shifted in response Thus each dollar of tax cuts increases private savings by less than a dollar The net effect of the tax cut is to lower the pool of national savings available to fund investment Continued hope that lowering tax rates will boost American savings and investment is the triumph of faith over experience The problem is that this tax cut provides an enormous windfall gain to those who have unrealized capital gains on assets they acquired in the past The top one percent of American families with unrealized capital gains hold about half of these unrealized gains While many people realize a small amount of capital gains in any given year these few families hold trillions of dollars of unrealized gains Good tax policies provide incentives for people to work save and invest Bad tax policies reward a wealthy few for decisions they made in the past A capital gains tax cut may well raise revenue in its first year or two as people liquidate their unrealized gains before the next increase in capital gains rates But once the first wave of selling is over a standard guess is that the capital gains tax cut will cost about billion a year When the government decides to spend billion a year on a tax incentive shouldnt it choose one likely to boost economic growth for everyone And shouldnt it be part of a package that avoids further tilting our distribution of income in an unhealthy direction The overall effect of the Republican tax proposals on the distribution of income gives the impression that the congressional majority is waging a onesided class war the cuts in the Earned Income Tax Credit and the details of how the child credit is paid add up to roughly billion a year in tax increases on families with annual incomes less than and tax decreases of some billion or so per familyon those with incomes of more than Early in the nineteenth century Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in the introduction to Democracy in America of equality of conditions as the creative element that made America great This substantial equality of conditions was under threat once in the generation of the Gilded Age and almost turned America into a very different and worse country This years tax changes are another step in a series that places it under threat again Brad De Long and David Levine teach economics and business at the University of California Berkeley Addendum Due to space constraints the editorial omitted three sometimes offsetting issues concerning how the capital gains tax treats time The capital gains tax overtaxes gains because it taxes nominal gains including gains that are due solely to inflation Thus if inflation doubles average prices over a decade someone who sells an asset that also doubles in nominal value will face taxation although the assets real value was constant The capital gains tax undertaxes gains because the tax on unrealized gains is not collected until a sale This delay is like the federal government lending the value of the uncollected tax at zero interest at low inflation the undertaxation due to value of this loan is usually larger than the overtaxation due to the first effect Moreover if the person dies holding the gain the tax on unrealized gains is forgiven a somewhat bizarre feature of the tax system This latter feature makes the tax ineffective at collecting revenue from the very wealthy who merely delay sales of their appreciated assets A better capital gain tax should tax only real gains should not forgive taxes on inherited unrealized gains and this is trickier should try to minimize the value of lost tax due to holding appreciated assets David I Levine Associate professor Haas

US monetary policy Do you think this is appropriate for the entire class Thanks Jay Iyer econrsrchwklyltrwklyltrelhtml Economic Research FRBSF Economic Letter Number January indexhtmEconomic Letter Index The Goals of US Monetary Policy The evolution of the Feds legislative mandate The debate about the Feds current mandate References The Federal Reserve has seen its legislative mandate for monetary policy change several times since its founding in when macroeconomic policy as such was not clearly understood The most recent revisions were in and and they require the Fed to promote both price stability and full employment The past changes in the mandate appear to reflect both economic events in the US and advances in understanding how the economy functions In the twenty years since the Feds mandate was last changed there have been further important economic developments as well as refinements in economic thought and these raise the issue of whether to modify the goals for US monetary policy once again Indeed a number of other countriesnotably those that adopted the Euro as a common curency at the start of this yearhave accepted price stability as the new primary goal for their monetary policies In this Letter we spell out the evolution of the legislation governing US monetary policy goals and summarize the debate about whether they could be improved The evolution of the Feds legislative mandate The Federal Reserve Act of did not incorporate any macroeconomic goals for monetary policy but instead required the Fed to provide an elastic currency This meant that the Fed should help the economy avoid the financial panics and bank runs that plagued the th century by serving as a lender of last resort which involved making loans directly to depository institutions through the discount windows of the Reserve Banks During this early period most of the actions of monetary policy that affected the macro economy were determined by the US governments adherence to the gold standard The trauma of the Great Depression coupled with the insights of Keynes led to an acknowledgment of the obligation of the federal government to prevent recessions The Employment Act of was the first legislative statement of these macroeconomic policy goals Although it did not specifically mention the Federal Reserve it required the federal government in general to foster conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment opportunities for those able willing and seeking to work and to promote maximum employment production and purchasing power The Great Inflation of the s was the next major US economic dislocation This problem was addressed in a amendment to the Federal Reserve Act which provided the first explicit recognition of price stability as a national policy goal The amended Act states that the Fed shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economys long run potential to increase production so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates The goals of stable prices and moderate longterm interest rates are related because nominal interest rates are boosted by a premium over real rates equal to expected future inflation Thus stable prices will typically produce longterm interest rates that are moderate The objective of maximum employment remained intact from the Employment Act however the interpretation of this term may have changed during the intervening years Immediately after World War II when conscription and price controls had produced a highpressure economy with very low unemployment in the US some perhaps believed that the goal of maximum employment could be taken in its mathematical sense to mean the highest possible level of employment However by the second half of the s it was well understood that some frictional unemployment which involves the search for new jobs and the transition between occupations is a necessary accompaniment to the proper functioning of the economy in the long run This understanding went hand in hand in the latter half of the s with a general acceptance of the Natural Rate Hypothesis which implies that if policy were to try to keep employment above its longrun trend permanently or equivalently the unemployment rate below its natural rate then inflation would be pushed higher and higher Policy can temporarily reduce the unemployment rate below its natural rate or equivalently boost employment above its longrun trend However persistently attempting to maintain maximum employment that is above its longrun level would not be consistent with the goal of stable prices Thus in order for maximum employment and stable prices to be mutually consistent goals maximum employment should be interpreted as meaning maximum sustainable employment referred to also as full employment Moreover although the Fed has little if any influence on the longrun level of employment it can attempt to smooth out shortrun fluctuations Accordingly promoting full employment can be interpreted as a countercyclical monetary policy in which the Fed aims to smooth out the amplitude of the business cycle This interpretation of the Feds mandate was later confirmed in the HumphreyHawkins legislation As its official titlethe Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of clearly implies this legislation mandates the federal government generally to promote full employment and production increased real income balanced growth a balanced Federal budget adequate productivity growth proper attention to national priorities achievement of an improved trade balance and reasonable price stability italics added Besides clarifying the general goal of full employment the HumphreyHawkins Act also specified numerical definitions or targets The Act specified two initial goals an unemployment rate of for full employment and a CPI inflation rate of for price stability These were only interim goals to be achieved by and followed by a further reduction in inflation to by however the disinflation policies during this period were not to impede the achievement of the fullemployment goal Thereafter the timetable to achieve or maintain price stability and full employment was to be defined by each years Economic Report of the President The debate about the Feds current mandate The Fed then has two main legislated goals for monetary policy promoting full employment and promoting stable prices With this mandate the Fed has helped foster the exceptional performance of the US economy during the past decade Still some have argued that the Feds mandate could be improved especially in looking ahead to future attempts to maintain or institutionalize recent low inflation Much discussion has centered on two topics the transparency of the goals and their dual nature The transparency of goals refers to the extent to which the objectives of monetary policy are clearly defined and can be easily and obviously understood by the public The goal of full employment will never be very transparent because it is not directly observed but only estimated by economists with limited precision For example the Economic Report of the President which has authority in this matter from the HumphreyHawkins Act gives a range of to for the unemployment rate consistent with full employment with a midpoint of Research suggests that there is a very wide range of uncertainty around any estimate of the natural rate with one prominent study finding a probability that it falls in the wide range of to see Walsh Price stability as a goal is also subject to some ambiguity Recent economic analysis has uncovered systematic biases say on the order of percentage point in the CPIs measurement of inflation see Motley In this case actual price stability would be consistent with measured inflation of In addition at any point in time different price indexes register different rates of inflation Over the past year for example the CPI has risen about while the GDP price index has risen about Still a transparent price stability goal could be specified as a precise numerical growth rate or range for a particular index which could take into account any biases However economists have also suggested other ways to enhance the transparency of policy For example publishing mediumterm inflation forecasts might help to clarify the direction of policy Rudebusch and Walsh Because the central bank has some control over inflation in the medium term its forecasts would contain an indication of where it wanted inflation to go A second recent proposed modification to the Feds goals involves focusing to a larger extent on price stability and deemphasizing business cycle stabilization Some economists have argued that having dual goals will lead to an inflation bias despite the Feds best attempts to control inflation This argument stresses that the temptation to engineer gains in output in the short run will overcome the central banks desire to control inflation in the long run As a result of elevated inflation expectations of the public inflation will end up being higher than the central bank intended despite its best efforts This timeinconsistency argument as economists call it coupled with the pain incurred in the s as inflation skyrocketed and in the early s as inflation was reduced to moderate levels persuaded many that the primary goal of the central bank should be to stabilize prices This view is embodied in the charter for the central bank in the new European Monetary Union The primary objective of the European System of Central Banks is to maintain price stability Without prejudice to the objective of price stability the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community Among these latter policies are a high level of employment and a balanced development of economic activities Economists remain divided on the importance of the time inconsistency problem and on the need to put primary emphasis on price stability at the expense of output stabilization Some stress the fact that the central bank is the only entity that can guarantee price stability and that this goal is not likely to be attained for long unless price stability is designated as the primary goal Others find the arguments for time inconsistency implausible because policymakers who are aware of the arguments about an inflationary bias and see the implications for inflation can conduct policy without an inflationary bias McCallum Still others argue that the abdication of other goals is irresponsible Fuhrer Also a good deal of empirical research using simulations of models of the US economy suggests that a focus on dual goals can reduce the variance of real GDP ie smooth the business cycle while achieving an inflation goal as well Rudebusch and Svensson While these issues are not yet resolved the experience of the past two decades provides some support to those who think dual goals that lack transparency can function successfully It is true that some countries around the world have reduced inflation over this period while putting primary emphasis on explicit inflation targeting But at the same time with its current legislative mandate the Fed also has had success in reducing inflation while maintaining the

D Exports Imports Also in an open economy Y D C I G NX When exports rise foreigners buy m ore of our output thus aggregate demand for domestically produced goods rises When imports rise we are buying from foreigners so imported purchases do not en ter domestic aggregate demand NX D trade surplus D trade deficit D net borrowing from abro ad When NX is negative imports exports we have a trade deficit This is finan ced by borrowing from abroad To a first approximation when the US spends mor e on exports than it earns on imports it needs to borrow to make up the difference The trade deficit is not exactly equal to borrowing from abroad because of the returns from net foreign assets When the US was a creditor nation it also made money on its investments abroadthis income permitted a modest trade deficit without borrowing Now as a debtor nation a modest trade surplus is required to avoid the need for new borrowing We are also ignoring government buying and selling of currencies The Current Account Surplus D Exports Imports interest and profits received from net foreign assets Exchange rates An exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another For example a French Franc FF costs yesterday while it was when I traveled in France in The US currently has floating exchange rates meaning that the valu e of the dollar fluctuates The is about yen today but has varied from to in the last months Thus the dollar bought fewer yeni t weakenedover much of the last year Under fixed exchange rates there would in principle be no dayto day changes in the exchange rate The Federal Reserve would buy and sell dolla rs and foreign currencies to keep the exchange rate fixed The float is a lit tle bit dirty since the Fed and other central banks intervene on currency markets ie buy and sell dollars to affect the value of the dollar Unlike the US most nations in the world fix their exchange rates with someone A few dozen use common currencies the West African Franc is used by many former French colonies and Panama uses the US Other countries such as Argentine or Hong Kong promise to keep as many US dollars or DM as they have circulating currency this currency board arrangement makes a fixed exchange rate credible because if folks want to sell the local currency th ere are always dollars or DM to redeem them The value of the dollar Many factors affect the value of the dollar US and foreign aggregate demand US and foreign interest rates speculative bubbles and so forth The dollar becomes stronger ie can buy more of a foreign currency when US real interest rates r are high If r is high then foreigners want to buy dollars in order to put them into US banks and recei ve the high interest rate When the demand for dollars goes up so does its price in terms of foreign currencies it gets stronger The net demand for dollars is low and the dollar will depreciate weaken when Foreigners dont want to buy US goods US exports low foreigne rs importing little US want to buy foreign goods US imports high foreigners exporting a lot US AD high implies leakage to foreign markets IM high Foreigners dont want to buy US assets often when US interest rates are low US wants to buy foreign assets often when foreign real interest rates are high People think will get even weaker This adds a speculative dimension so speculative bubbles sometimes appear to be important as are expectation s of foreign or US changes in policy David Levine Macroeconomics November A Morality Play of International Trade Chris and Pat were having a conversation one day upstairs at Kips Chris Pat I dont see how you can be for free trade If Taiwan grows fas ter than us we will lose Pat Chris you clearly do not understand the great economist Ricardos ide a of Comparative Advantage C Thats for sure I dont Wazzat P Comparative advantage is what you are least worst or most best at For example this great entrepreneur whose name escapes me was the worlds fast est typist but hired a secretary nevertheless He was perhaps times as productive as she was as an entrepreneur but only times as productive as a typistthus he had absolute advantage in both but she had comparative advantage in typing C So what does that have to do with free trade P An example may clarify Step over to this handy blackboard and let me write a bit First imagine a world with two countries the US and Taiwan and two goods computers and wine Further assume that labor is the only inpu t into production Each country has hours of labor First consider a case with no trade when each nations output equals their consumption USA WITH NO TRADE Product Productivity Output computers hrs PC wine hrs bottle total hours D D TAIWAN WITH NO TRADE Product Productivity Output computers hrs PC wine hrs bottle total hours D D Note that Taiwan makes computers in the US time and wine in the US time Thus Taiwan has absolute advantage at both wine and computers Tai wan has comparative advantage is most best at computers US has comparative advantage is least worse at wine Now lets see what happens if we permit trade The US will specialize in wine what it is best at The world price will be about bottles of wine per P C in the world with trade USA WITH TRADE Product Productivity Output Consumption computers hrs PC wine hrs bottle wine hrs bottle total hours D D consumption of wine D production sold to Taiwan consumption of computers D bought from Taiwan TAIWAN WITH TRADE Product Productivity Output Consumption computers hrs PC wine hrs bottle total hours D D Both countries receive at least as much of both goods after trade The ex act price with free trade and therefore the amount of consumption in each country depends on the demand elasticities in the two countries and other factors Thus in a world of comparative advantage trade helps both countries Nations should specialize in what they do best Complete specialization as in thi s example is an extreme case As Adam Smith pointed out years ago specialization permits all to grow wealthier C Your argument assumes quite a bit Implicit in your example is the assumption that when the US quits producing computers all of those Coryha ll types be magically transformed into Vit Eno majors from Davis If we are in a recession then the computer workers who lose their jobs wont get new jo bs policies to protect our domestic industry can avoid unemployment and increa se aggregate demand P You are recommending beggarthyneighbor policies since any gain in o ur demand is offset by losses to our neighbors If we get started on that ta ck the whole world loses Not everyone can increase demand by restricting imports C Even without the macroeconomic problem there is still the unemployment caused by free trade destroying industries How will all the excomputer f olk get the skills to make wine P You are correct and both US computer makers and Taiwanese wine makers both companies and employees prefer not to have trade in the short run The po int is that the winners ie US wine makers Taiwanese computer makers and consumers in both countries win more than the losers lose C If free trade brings so many benefits then it should bring enough prosperity to compensate the losers It is not fair to the computer worker s that they bear the cost of adjustment It makes sense to tax some of the winners and pay some subsidy to help the losers retrain Full employment is not your only key assumption You also assume that mark ets are competitive so that firms make no monopoly profits In fact it appea rs that some industries make big profits When we lose market share in these industries the capital flows to a less profitable industry P Again I must grant your point that there are monopolistic industries an d most Americans would rather the monopoly profits stay at home In general free trade eliminates monopoly profits and will help consumers enormously C Yes but in addition to there being highprofit industries there are highwage industries so workers care which industry they are in When we lose market share in these industries the workers move to industries with lower pay and lower productivity Autoworkers who become hamburger flippers are not making a marginal switch to their next bestpaying job For example Boeing has traditionally made big profits and paid its worker s well When Europeans subsidized Airbus and we lost airplane manufacturing jobs we lost both those high profits and the workers had to move to lowerwage employers P I agree that it is theoretically possible for subsidies to increase a nations welfare if the subsidies bring oligopoly profits and highwage jo bs Nevertheless it would be better for everyone if nobody subsidized and markets were more competitive In the US today both imports and exports are mostl y made in highwage jobs Thus we should favor the expansion of trade not restrictions C Your hypothetical situation is irrelevant since other nations are subsidizing Japan is famous for protecting its industries until they beco me big enough to compete internationallythen watch out P Do you really think that the US steel auto and computer industries are too small to compete internationally C Well I have to admit that USX GM and IBM are not what one usually thin ks of as part of infant industries But the Japanese also subsidize industrie s and dump exports below cost in order to drive competitors out of business Once they have a monopoly then they really gouge P Have the Japanese really increased prices of color TVs RAM chips or ot her goods Antidumping laws primarily mean that foreigners are not allowed to cut pricesprice cuts that would benefit US consumers Even with an uneven playing field I disagree with you As usual with protectionists you ignore consumers When European subsidies created Airb us Airbus made the market for passenger aircraft much more competitive US consumers won in terms of lower airfaressomething you forgot to stress in your arguments about Boeings loss of high profits and highwage jobs I am very suspicious of these claims that we need to protect all sorts of industries since it gives companies enormous incentives to pour money into lobbying The large firms of the US steel industry have been incredibly successful at lobbying for protection This protection has mostly protecte d an inefficient oligopoly at great cost to US consumers C But we sometimes need protection as a stick to beat foreigners into opening their markets to us P While protection can be a stick it is not easy to wield It seems most likely to lead to a trade war where retaliation by foreigners leads them t o close markets to us if we restrict trade Usually when we run protectionism it is in the form of the misnamed voluntary export restraint VER like the one that we have with the Japanese for automobiles These basically require the foreigners to form a cartel lower sales and increase price I do not know why the US government helps foreigners run cartels that hurt US consumers Antitrust policy is suppos ed to restrict cartels The auto VERs cost consumers over for each US job that is saved C Well I am not convinced All of your arguments concerning the advanta ges of free trade are based on this notion of comparative advantage which you assume is somehow granted by nature In todays hightech industries comparative advantage is won by experience in producing complicated technologies not by weather or natural resources P If comparative advantage is won by experience then experience in produc ing becomes a sort of investment Why cant US firms undertake investments tha t are profitable You cannot seriously believe that IBM is too small to comp ete with foreigners C But there are spillovers from one industry to another The experience o f Silicon Valley for example shows that when one part of hightech does wel l other parts learn from it and do well also Even your economists have always agreed that when there are positive externalities that there is a role for public subsidies For example an innovating firm rarely captures all the gains of its research and developme nt In the example above when new computer technologies are developed only th e Taiwanese will be able to develop the new products based on their expertise in PC manufacture P I agree that companies providing positive spillovers should be encourage d I think that support of university research coupled with an RD tax credit makes more sense than protectionism You on the other hand seem to be promoting an industrial policy in whi ch the government picks winners to promote Didnt the billions of dollars th at France and Britain poured into the Concorde supersonic transport as well a s wastage of the US with Synfuels synthetic gasoline teach you that industria l policy wont work C Well arent you selfrighteous The US has always had a multitude of vigorous and expensive industrial policies they have just gone under a variety of other names and have never been coordinated to work together Agricultu re receives billions in subsidies steel and textiles have quotas on imports Lockheed and Chrysler received governmentbacked loans and housing gets th e mortgage interest deduction Perhaps most importantly a vast proportion o f our research is funded by the military which has always looked to advantag es for certain industries All I want is a rational and democratic industrial policy We should coordinate our goals and choose our subsidies more democratically and in ways that do not work to crosspurposes For example any bailouts or protection from impor ts should be short run and explicitly tied to promises to invest in new machinery and new skills for workers New technologies to be promoted should be chos en by democraticallychosen representatives not by nameless bureaucrats at DA RPA the Defense Advanced Projects Research Administrationan agency almost nobody has heard of P I would just as soon cut subsidies to all those industries as adjust wha t subsidies I give Nevertheless I grant you that if subsidies are given th ey should at least include promises from the industry and its workers to inves t not just enjoy high current wages and profits C Youre starting to talk sense now We must always keep in mind that America needs high tech to maintain its competitiveness P I dont understand this word competitiveness I like you would like US productivity to grow quickly so that we are more prosperous and have more resources to care for the disadvantaged the environment and so forth I care about the absolute level of US growth not the relative level C But if the US growth more slowly than Japan we will lose our standing a s a world power P I am not thrilled about any nation being overwhelmingly powerful It is ok with me if the US must consult with its allies before invading various smal l open economies C Well I have won enough points from you that I should probably stop Yo u agree that at least in theory protectionism can help keep highprofit highwage and highspillover industries at home and raise national output P I must agree in theory and also remind you that the industries have political clout to receive protectionism are often the worstrun Furthermore any protectionist policy leads to the risk of trade wars and they make everyone worse off C Hey

Paradox at WorkF on the hour week FLatin American markets rally Getting to the Bottom of Japans Economic Blues FA French Paradox at WorkF New York Times November By SUZANNE DALEY FASTATT France Last year the Beyer family which owns a small jam and fruit preserves plant here near the Swiss border made a proposal to th eir employees Would they like a hour workweek and continue to be paid for working hours To no ones great surprise the employees said yes An hour more for yourself is an hour more said Christiane Grimm whose job includes slapp ing labels on jars sorting through crates of fruit and watching over bubbling vats of jam Theres lots you can do with it Surprisingly the Beyers ended up happy too The company one of thousands of French enterprises that have reorganized their businesses because of a monthold law creating one of the shortest workweeks in the world believes that it is far better off than before In the reshuffle Philippe Beyer split his employees into two team s and staggered their shifts His factory here in the Alsace region now operates hours a day up from And it produces percent more than it did last year with only two extra employees The promise of hours of pay for hours of work was a campaign pl ank that helped catapult Lionel Jospins leftist coalition to power in the Parliament elections And it remains the glue that keeps Socialists Communists and Greens together It was aimed at creating as many as a mill ion jobs in a country that has struggled with a doubledigit rate of unemployme nt for years But many experts think that this bold experiment which business lead ers had warned would cripple Frances economy is not going to be a cureall fo r the nearly three million unemployed Instead it could accomplish something the leftist governing coalitio n never aimed for a kind of housecleaning in the French workplace that will tear the cobwebs from French industry and lead to a more productive and flexible work force as it did at Beyer The primary goal of this policy is very unlikely said Emanuel Ferr y an economist at Banque National de Paris who is studying the policy But it seems to be having a backdoor effect It is providing a very good opportun ity to renovate the workplace And it is introducing these elements productivity flexibility quietly without triggering social unrest So ev en if the direct goal of job creation is not achieved it may still not necessarily be a bad thing for the economy That may be but there is hardly a policy that has caused as much argument in France as the hour week While labor was an early advocate o f the idea many unions have recently demonstrated against it fearing that the way it is being carried out will freeze salary levels and reverse hardfoug ht gains in employee rights Businesses have protested too Last month some industrialists and executives gathered in an empty Paris conference center to wave placards and chant slogans deploring the policy They say i t will cost too much and destroy Frances competitiveness Average citizen s also seem to be losing their appetite for it Surveys show that the idea w as very popular when first proposed but resistance grew the more the French considered it A recent poll found that less than percent of Frances citizens now believe that they are going to benefit from shorter workweeks Most people suspect that one way or another they will be inconvenienced Either way it is a subject almost sure to start a fight People feel very strongly about it Beyer said In this country we are a little retrograde we live the way we lived years ago and this is forcing change and so people are uneasy with it So far there is little proof that the hour week has created many jobs Labor Ministry officials said in Parliament recently that the plan had created or saved new jobs But one legislator called the figures thin air and most economists say a more realistic number would probably be half tha t Opponents also point out that the government has been subsidizing the transition with business tax cuts and other incentives Frances economy grew at a healthy rate of percent in and i s expected to do nearly as well this year The unemployment rate has dropped to in August from a high of percent in June But few see much connection between the new jobs and the hour policy The hours was a political decision a Finance Ministry official said but it may become a really positive thing Nothing was moving befor e Now suddenly everyone has to go back and look at the way we have been doin g business People are talking and thinking and being creative The process of carrying out this complicated law passed in June is still in its early stages This month Parliament passed a tangle of more t han amendments spelling out exactly how and when the policy should be instituted One rule All companies with employees or more must operate with a hour workweek by the year So far only about businesses or little more than percent of eligible French employers have formally made plans for the conversion Economists say the brunt of the law will be felt unevenly Some businesses like the Beyer factory will benefit Others including service industries are likely to have a much harder time George Jallerat who owns Le Grand Monarque Hotel and Restaurant in Chartres says he cannot figure out how to reduce his employees hours pa y them the same wages and not lose money In the end we will have to raise prices he said There is no other way Some entrepreneurs are already taking steps to protect themselves Dr Thierry Sandr employs people in his medical lab on the outskirts of Paris He says he will do all that he can to avoid hiring a th person and bring the hour workweek into his business But he does not trust the government to leave him alone So he has no t raised the pay of any of his employees in two years as a way of saving mo ney for the day he has to give them a hour workweek for hours of pay He says he is not alone While the hour workweek was being debated government officials beg an trying to enforce the hour limit that now exists even among managers Agents prowled garages to see what time people were actually leaving Thousands of fines were issued and in one case the director of a electronics factory owned by ThomsonRCM was hauled into court for working too hard and allowing his engineers and other managers to put in an average of hours a week In June he received an fine The action prompted some businesses to install time clocks even for managers and made the governmen t the butt of jokes Those who have jumped at the shortened workweek are often those who w ere already planning to expand their businesses For instance the Packard Bell factory in the western town of Angers which makes computers went to the hour week this year precisely because it wanted to increase production b y percent To do that it needed to reorganize its employees into more teams and more shifts Offering a hour week was a way of opening negotiations with its unions JeanLuc Bayel the director of human resources said the plan had wor ked out even better than anyone expected We have far less absenteeism Baye l said And we are seeing a better product People have to stand to do the job and standing for eight hours is hard Now they stand for only seven and we are seeing a percent reduction in problem computers We are very happy with the changes Packard Bell did not take advantage of government subsidies because i t did not want to follow government rules But others like Beyer also saw in the new law a way of getting government aid to pay for expansion plans At Beyer for instance the government aid package will pay nearly percent of the salary for the two employees he added this year Next year it will pay about percent and percent the year after that But Beyer w ho took over the business from his father two years ago wanted to expand anyway He says he might have gone ahead with his plans anyhow but the law gave h im a push Not far from Beyers factory Didier Thuet who owns a small heating installation business adopted the hour week for just the same reason I t was an opportunity to try something he said Thuets business is seasonal There is little work at all from March to May So he offered his employees a shorter workweek during those months in exchange for a longer one during peak business periods They also got an additional six to eight days off All six of the employees agreed to a sal ary freeze until the year was over and the company could see how much money it made But both Thuet and Beyer have their doubts about whether the law will work everywhere And there are complaints from the supposed beneficiaries of the new jobs At Beyer Sarah Charro who at had a series of temporary jobs was hire d because of the reorganization but she has little good to say about it Sh e says the atmosphere in the factory is tense I feel in some ways like we went backward Ms Charro said We are working only hours but they are trying to push a lot into those hours push push push We are all stressed out Thuets new employee Christoffe Foulon says the hour week is grea t if he does not lose any money But in truth he would rather work more and ea rn more He says few of his friends seem to envy him Instead he says most give him a hard time They treat me like Im lazy he said Published Monday November in the San Jose Mercury News FLatin American markets rallyF Simon Romero New York Times SAO PAULO Brazil Buoyed by fresh inflows of overseas investment money st ock markets in Latin America are staging a rally that could presage a return t o economic growth in many of the regions countries next year Over the last few weeks indexes like the Bovespa on the Sao Paulo stock exchange Latin Americas largest stock market have soared to a sixmonth high In Mexico Latin Americas secondlargest country the bolsa index reached a threemonth high On the coattails of these markets stocks in Argentina Chile and Colombia registered healthy gains Much of the rally has been fueled by relief over potential interest rate increases in the United States as recent economic reports have led some investors to believe that only one increase in rates instead of several is likely in coming months Lower interest rates in the United States Latin Americas biggest source of investment translates into more money availab le for purchases of stocks in the region However a growing consensus that Latin America is positioned for a revi val of economic growth next year is also encouraging investors to increase the ir stock holdings The recovery of some commodities prices healthy demand for Latin Americ an exports in rich industrialized nations and political and economic developments in countries like Mexico have led analysts such as Geoffrey Dennis of Salo mon Smith Barney to predict percent growth for the region as a whole next year compared with fourtenths of a percent contraction in Investors are lifting the veil from a period in which Latin America was oversold said Edmar Bacha the New Yorkbased strategist for Banco BBA Creditanstalt What theyre seeing minus the threat of higher Fed rates is a region looking a lot better next year than this year One of the best examples of this newfound optimism is Chile a nation th at was hit hard by the economic crisis suffered by some of its Pacific Rim trading partners Helped by lower domestic interest rates and a recovery in the price of copper Chiles economy is expected to grow percent in compared with a shrinkage of half a percent this year And coming presidential elections are not viewed as risky since the two leading candidates are pledging a simil ar blend of centrist economic policies said Neil Dougall an economist with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson In Mexico politics is also generating optimism over the economy with concern easing over the possibility of disruption resulting from primary presidential elections And strong growth in the United States Mexicos m ain export market contributes to positive sentiment over the countrys econom y which is increasingly viewed by economists as more linked to its northern neighbors than to the rest of Latin America Yet while prospects look better in countries like Chile and Mexico it is in Brazil Latin Americas biggest economy where most attention is focused So perhaps it is no small wonder that the rally lifting most Latin markets is nowhere as dramatic as it is here Two weeks ago Brazils currency the real was getting hammered as speculators who had been betting on weakness pushed the real beyond two to the dollar for the first time in eight months As alarm grew over the reals decline Brazil successfully sought greater flexibility to defend the currency by using money from the International Monetary Fund which has oversight o ver such matters because it is financing an economic aid package to the countr y The real began to strengthen All of a sudden there was much less pressure on the bank to raise rate s to attract foreign capital said Carlos Novis Guimaraes head of Latin American investment banking at Lehman Brothers With the likelihood larger that Brazil might lower rates rather than raise them a fresh assessment emerged Corporate profits like those from eucalyptus producers benefitting from higher pulp prices and banks prosper ing from prescient investment strategies suggested an economic recovery stron ger than once thought Most analysts are predicting Brazils economy will grow percent in compared with percent expected this year Still investors remain cautious about the potential for rebound While shocks like Ecuadors moratorium on foreign bonds seem to have been absorb ed without causing much damage to investor sentiment other factors lead some investors to remain wary For instance interest rate increases abroad like those announced Thurs day by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England could undermine Lati n Americas stock rally Reticence by Brazils Congress to approve governmen t proposals to simplify the tax system and trim pension spending may also ra ise a red flag Nevertheless an important shift in sentiment seems to be taking place It appears that global risk aversion is lowering after the collapses predicte d by some people never materialized said Ernest Brown senior Latin America economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter JAPAN ECHO Vol No February Getting to the Bottom of Japans Economic Blues KOJIMA Akira The Japanese economy found itself pushed to the edge of a precipice in by a rapid surge of deflationary pressure Obuchi Keizo who succeeded Hashimoto Ryutaro as prime minister at the end of July proclaimed his new administration an economic revitalization cabinet and policy at least shifted in the right direction however belatedly The government secured passage for legislation setting aside a huge volume of public funds to deal with the stricken financial sector and it approved fiscal outlays on an unprecedented scale to stimulate demand Thanks to these measures the econ omy managed to stop just short of the precipice During the economy should enjoy a bit of a breather as the effects of the heavy dose of government stimulus take hold But it will be no more than a breather and it will be essential for financial institutions to take advantage of this temporary respite to restructure their operations and for business corporations to undertake serious efforts to strengthen themselves If they fail to do so the economy is liable to slip back into critical condit ion as soon as the effects of the stimulus have worn off This year will be a decisive one representing as it does the last chance of the twentieth cent ury for the Japanese economy to be revitalized After achieving a recovery labeled miraculous in the years after Wo rld War II our countrys economy suddenly lost its momentum in the final decad e of the century The downturn started in and from through the growth rate was close to zero In and the economy managed to expa nd by but then in fiscal April to March it contracted by And the growth rate for fiscal is being estimated at around This will be the first time in the postwar period that the economy has recorded negative growth for two years in a row It will also mean that the average growth rate from through will fall to dipping below the mark Why did the economy suddenly lose its steam The main causes are th e speculative bubbles of the late s and the policy blunders following the ir bursting starting in Over the course of history countries around the world have experienced economic bubbles Where they differ is in the skill of their policies to deal with the aftermath Japans record on this score has clearly been a string of failures Until the authorities did virtually nothing to promote the clearing up of the large volume of loans that went b ad after the collapse of the bubble economy This huge overhang of nonperformi ng assets in the financial sector acted as a drag on the economy as a whole preventing it from regaining its forward momentum And as the recession dragged on the baddebt problem grew even greater in scale The situation deteriorated to the point where a series of major financial institutions went bankrupt i n November setting off an overall contraction of credit Earlier in the year the government had implemented a set of belttightening measures including a hike of the consumption tax from t o that produced a negative fiscal impulse on the order of trillion In other words was a year of powerful deflationary pushes from both the monetary and fiscal sides of the macroeconomic picture No economy could withstand this sort of double punch without buckling Particularly from November on the economy was obviously heade d down but even so the government dallied in shifting its fiscal stance and in dealing with the bad debts that were at the root of the financial deflation What set off the powerful deflationary contraction of credit was the first occurrence of default in the interbank market in the postwar period in earl y November Despite the smallness of the amount defaulted the market panicke d because all its transactions were premised on the absolute impossibility of default Financial institutions became leery of extending credit to each other and the interbank market ceased to function smoothly Every institution tri ed to build up its own liquidity And financial institutions whose capital was meager by comparison with the scale of their nonperforming loans found themselves coming under a fierce attack in the stock market As a result t hey moved to raise their capital adequacy ratios by cutting back on their lending This set off a classic credit crunch LENDER OF FIRST RESORT When matters reach this sort of pass the relaxation of monetary policy by the central bank fails to affect the real economy Though the Bank of Ja pan has adopted an extremely loose policy stance actual financial conditions h ave become severely tightened This can be seen most clearly in the relationshi p between the money supply and bank credit Normally when the money supply c ash and bank deposits expands the volume of lending by banks grows accordingl y and financial conditions relax But in the credit contraction that became pronounced from the end of on bank lending has shrunk in volume despi te growth of the money supply For example if we look at the figures for the socalled city banks Japans major moneycenter banks in the month period ending September we find that their deposits were up but their outstanding loans decreased by or trillion And the ratio of loans to deposits fel l by a remarkable percentage points over the same period Banks were under pressure to write off their bad loans which they had been putting off doin g the capital crunch in the financial sector was accompanied by a credit crun ch in the general economy So what have the banks been doing with their increased deposits Th ey have been avoiding risk by investing them in government bonds and as a res ult the yield on the governments year issues has fallen below This is a first for Japan of course and in fact it is unprecedented in capital mark ets around the world The problem is that even as government bond yields have been falling the yield on the corporate bond issues of big businesses has been rising In other words not only has it become harder for businesses to bor row from banks but it has also become harder for them to raise funds from the capital market Even so major corporations have been raising some funds through bond issues But smaller firms that are not in a position to issue their own bonds have felt the full brunt of banks cutbacks in lending If this situation were left untreated the Japanese economy would h ave no prospect of recovering During the course of therefore the Bank o f Japan implemented largescale purchases via banks of commercial paper wh ich are notes issued by corporations to cover their operating expenses In effe ct the central bank was stepping in to lend where regular banks would not One might even say that it became the lender not of last resort but of first resort In addition other governmentaffiliated financial institutions hav e been actively extending loans to companies and other firms The root cause of the contraction in bank lending is the remaining pile of bad loans which has still not been adequately dealt with In order to alleviate this problem the government has come up with a massive trill ion package of public funding for the financial sector But bank executives are reluctant to make use of these public funds fearing that if they do they will be expected to take responsibility for the failure of their earlier lending decisions And under these circumstances the credit crunch appears certain to continue even if it becomes somewhat less serious in degree The gravity of the baddebt problem is apparent from the volume of the asset value lost as a result of the collapse of the bubble economy In the period from through land prices fell trillion and from through stock prices dropped trillion In other words the value of assets in these two major categories plunged by over quadrillion in the postbubble period an amount equivalent to more than two years gross national product Since a large portion of the purchases of both land and stocks had been financed by bank lending the deflation in these asset values led directly to the emergence of huge amounts of bad loans STRUCTURAL FACTORS ADDING TO THE DRAG The principal causes of the Japanese economys sudden loss of momen tum in the s thus appear to have been the policy failures in dealing with t he aftermath of the bubble years in connection both with the baddebt problem and the handling of fiscal affairs These were not the only causes however Ot her factors systemic and structural account for probably to of the to tal negative change A number of problems may be cited in this connection Japan completed the decadeslong process of catching up with the West The country was tardy in coping systematically with the forces of globalization and megacompetition that picked up strength following the end of the cold war The Japanese population has been aging at a pace never experienced by any country in the world and this has heightened peoples concerns about the future The focus of technology has been shifting from manufacturing toward information software and services The end of the catchup process meant less scope for growth through the introduction of technologies and products from overseas forcing Japan to r ely on innovations of its own to achieve further economic expansion Furthermor e it had to do so within the context of the worlds highest average wage leve ls Next the advent of megacompetition meant the emergence of rivalry from the newly industrialized economies many with wages only a tenth or a fifteenth of Japans placing Japanese businesses in a highly disadvantageous positio n Population aging meanwhile is a process that has been going on in all the industrial nations but in Japans case it has been progressing at an especially rapid clip This has forced the country to scramble in order to make the required systemic adjustments in areas like pensions and employment In addition to the rise in longevity there has been a sharp decline in the birthrate which has further accelerated the rise in the elderly share of t he population Early in the twentyfirst century the total number of Japanese is expected to start declining In the years following the end of World War II the population grew by an average of about million people a year but in the years to come it is estimated that it will decline on average by half a million a year This will mean a shrinking labor force which will face an increased burden in supporting the growing numbers of elderly and it will also mean shrinking markets Various systems including pensions taxes employment and wages will have to be reformed fundamentally in order to keep them fro m collapsing Meanwhile of course the vitality of the economy will wane an d with it the capacity for economic growth The outlook is bleak Finally the paradigm shift in technology will pose a major challen ge for Japan in the period to come During the twentieth century Japan has bee n extraordinarily successful with its technology for standardized mass production which was the dominant paradigm of the century Automobiles and electric appliances are representative of the fields in which Japanese manufacturers have won strong positions But since the early s when Japanese industry was seen by many people to be victorious the focus in highvalue technology has been shifting away from standardized mass product ion in the direction of knowledgeintensive and informationintensive areas fr om hardware to software and from manufacturing to services As globalization has progressed capital technology and managemen t knowhow have been moved actively across national borders and standardized production was easily shifted to the newly industrialized economies The medium for these transfers has been crossborder direct investment which has grow n by leaps and bounds since the end of the cold war We have entered an age in which comparative advantage in standard mass production can be imported This produces a tendency toward price leveling In most cases the trend is a downward one with prices being drawn to the level of the lowwage countrie s And it makes it difficult for a high wage country like Japan to sustain hig h valueadded production THE PARADOX OF SUCCESS There are two ways out of this difficulty One is to shift manufacturing operations overseas to take advantage of lower wage levels The other is fo r businesses to compete in nonprice areas by coming up with their own technologies and products Corporations that shift their operations offshor e can continue to enjoy growth in their consolidated results on a global basi s but meanwhile they are promoting the hollowing out of the domestic manufacturing sector For Japan as a whole the second alternative nonprice competition is more desirable especially now that the goal of catching up with the West has been accomplished But in order to succeed at this endeav or it will be necessary to recast the whole set of systems that were designed for the catchup period The new systems will have to shift their focus from th e achievement of equality of results to support of those who take risks and display creativity The system of automatic wage hikes in line with increas ing seniority will have to be overhauled and the egalitarianism of the school system will also have to be modified Making such reforms will mean fundamentally changing the social val ues to which we have become accustomed Resistance is likely to be great Peopl e will be quick to agree with the need for reform in principle but will resis t the particulars that affect their own areas of activity Already over the p ast decade we have witnessed many loud calls for reform leading to numerous reports and recommendations but there has been little by way of implementation One reason for this lack of followthrough is the fantastic success that Japan enjoyed in the economic sphere for the previous several decades Sinc e the existing systems and practices were so successful for so long they hav e become quite hard to change This is the paradox of success or reward of success to which Peter Drucker refers It may be possible for the Japanese economy to get out of its curre nt hole by overcoming the credit crunch arising out of the baddebt problem an d correcting the earlier mistakes in fiscal policy This however will amoun t to no more than the righting of earlier wrongs In order for our economy and society to demonstrate vigor and creatively produce new value and new technologies in the century to come we must overcome the paradox of succe ss and remake our longstanding systems and practices The lack of progress toward this goal is the source of our current sense of being at an impasse The massive dose of financial and fiscal stimulus that the government is now administering should halt the severe downturn that started in November and in we can hope to see at least faint signs of a recovery Bu t it is essential that this respite be used to achieve progress toward systemic reform Unless this is accomplished the s will be a lost decade for Japan and our economic outlook for the twentyfirst century will be a gloo my one David I Levine Associate professor Haas School of Business ph University of California fax

questions were relevant in a given year thus the year of the exam is sometimes included in brackets Short Answer True False or Uncertain and Why The grade you receive depends solely on the quality of your explanation If you are not sure of what the question assumes simply state your own assumptions clearly and answer based on these assumptions The US unemployment rate would decline rapidly if unemployment insurance were cut The rate of growth of M and M have both been fairly rapid recently Assume this sentence is true Thus we can expect that the inflation rate will soon increase rapidly In the late seventies the US had both high inflation and relatively high unemployment Thus the Phillips curve theory is wrong since it predicts that inflation and unemployment are negatively related Recently Canada has informally maintained a fixed exchange rate with the US This sentence is true As long as they target exchange rates monetary policy will not be effective in Canada You may want to refer to Canadian and US dollars as Cs and USs in your answer If the Japanese would lower their interest rates to expand their aggregate demand then Japanese purchases of US goods would increase Hint Consider the exchange rate Why is our money ever less valuable Perhaps it is simply that we have inflation because we expect inflation and we expect inflation because weve had it Robert M Solow Technology Review DecJan The current US Federal Government Budget Deficit BD is not a problem in the short run ie this year Fiscal policy is less effective in France than in the United States Hint Consider differences both in the openeconomy multiplier and the exchange rate regime Lowwage countries such Greece and Portugal will gain more from the creation on a common market than will highwage countries such as Germany and Denmark True unemployment is above measured unemployment We should not worry much about inflation The multiplier is higher when marginal tax rates marginal savings rates and marginal propensity to import are all high Budget deficits in a recession are a good thing For each dollar of revenue lost to the government capital gains tax cuts are less effective at spurring investment than are increases in the investment tax credit The federal government should increase spending on education Unions are responsible for a significant fraction of US unemployment Free trade hurts American workers but helps workers in lowwage nations It is good for the nation when monetary policy accommodates fiscal policy Frictional unemployment represents people rationally choosing to search for a job Thus no government policy is called for to address it European unemployment rates and unionization rates are both above US levels proving unions cause unemployment In class we assumed money demand depended on output and interest rates L kY hi In the ISLM framework when the demand for money k increases at any given level of output output and interest rates will rise A balanced budget rule so long as it corrected for cyclical factors would be a good thing Increasing consumption increases output Hint Is this a trick question In an open economy monetary policy is less effective than in a closed economy No policy can costeffectively reduce the rate of longterm unemployment Because the stock market falls when output and employment rise the market is not a good predictor of future output growth Japan will grow faster than Russia next year Japan will grow faster than Russia over the next years Russian inflation will decline next year The creation of the EMU will reduce Italian longterm interest rates The process of qualifying for the EMU has reduced French economic growth A Booming Economy Made it All Much Easier For the Shrinking Deficit Thank the Economy New York Times The recent actions of the Labour government concerning the Central Bank should lower expected inflation in the United Kingdom The recent appreciation of the US dollar is bad for Argentine Ireland should join the European Monetary Union Hints Irelands economy is closely tied to Europe but most closely to the United Kingdom Irish inflation has historically been above the EC average the Irish economy has been growing rapidly for several years and is likely approaching the output level associated with the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment and the Irish currency has been near the top of its permissible band of fluctuation against other European countries Investors give East Europe a miss Problems with legal system taxes crime and corruption deter foreign funds Financial Times The EMU should include Italy The multiplier is higher when marginal tax rates marginal savings rates the marginal propensity to import are all low and the investment accelerator is high The government should subsidize private savings The capital gains tax should cut but only if it is reformed The government should subsidize student loans for college Longer answers

Money supply A Derive the formulae for the IS curve and the LM curves Dont use numbers for this question B What are the equilibrium levels of income and interest rate Do use numbers for this question While in class we focussed on fixed vs flexible exchange rates many nations have intermediate cases For example some nations have band where rates are fixed plus or minus some percent For example a nation may fix its rates at pesos per dollar plus or minus percent thus fixing between and pesos per dollar In other cases the fixed rate has a crawl built into it We fix at pesos to the dollar depreciating percent per month Other nations combine the two a band each month with builtin depreciation over time What are the advantages and disadvantages of these hybrid systems compared to pure fixed rates After evaluating all other relevant arguments for and against adoption of a fixed currency policymakers in the small open economy of Haasland are still undecided The costs seem to exactly equal the benefits The last piece of information they are to consider is that Haasland has historically been subject to more shocks of consumer and investor confidence than supply or price shocks Given this fact and the desire of Haasland policymakers to stabilize output what exchange rate policy would you recommend Hint Make reference to ISLM diagrams in which you show the effect on output and interest rates of a negative shock to the IS curve consumer or investor confidence and a negative shock to the LM curve supply or price shock under both fixed and floating exchange rates In the small open economy of New Zealand had a policy of maintaining a fixed exchange rate Suddenly due to a political crisis the risk premium for investment in New Zealand increased dramatically Policymakers were left with two options raise interest rates or devalue the currency Recommend a response based on an analysis of the impact of these policies on output interest rates and inflation

<23510454.1075843091085.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,levine@haas.berkeley.edu,1999-11-04 17:19:00,A reading on inflationalso contributed this article from the Economist Sep A new economy for the New World Inflation may not be as dead as it seems ONCE upon a time sailors went to sea in the belief that the earth was flat putting them at risk of dropping off the edge Fortunately the discovery that it was round solved that problem Economic thinking about monetary policy and inflation has undergon e a similar aboutturn In the s the conventional economic wisdom was that monetary policy could reduce unemployment The theoretical underpinning for this was the Phillips curve named after Bill Phillips an economist from New Zealand based at the London School of Economics Mr Phillips also a trained engineer constructed a machine to demonstrate the workings of the economy using water to represent liquidity In he published a study showing that between and some kind of tradeoff between wage inflation an d unemployment seemed to have been operating in Britain when unemployment wa s high inflation was low and vice versa This seemed to suggest that centra l banks could permanently reduce unemployment by tolerating a bit more inflation A decade later however two American economists Milton Friedman and Edmun d Phelps challenged this theory The tradeoff between inflation and unemployment they argued was only shortterm because once people came to expect higher inflation they would demand higher wages and unemployment would rise back to its Fnatural rateF which depended on the efficien cy of the labour market There was no longterm tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the long run monetary policy could influence only inflation If policymakers tried to hold unemployment below its natural rat e also known by an acronym NAIRU the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment inflation would be pushed ever higher Just as Messrs Friedman and Phelps had predicted the level of inflation associated with a given level of unemployment rose through the s and policymakers had to abandon the Phillips curve Today there is a broad consensus that monetary policy should focus on holding down inflation But this does not mean as is often claimed that central banks are Finflati on nuttersF cruelly indifferent towards unemployment If there is no longterm tradeoff low inflation does not permanently chok e growth Moreover by keeping inflation low and stable a central bank in effect stabilises output and jobs Don Brash governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand explains how this happens using The straight line represents the growth in output that the economy can sustain over the long run the wavy line represents actual output When the economy is producing below potential ie unemployment is above the NAIRU at point A inflation will fall until the Foutput gapF is eliminated When output is above potential at point B inflation will rise for as long as demand is above capacity If inflation is falling point A then a central bank wil l cut interest rates helping to boost growth in output and jobs when inflation is rising point B it will raise interest rates dampening dow n growth Thus if monetary policy focuses on keeping inflation low and stable it will automatically help to stabilise employment and growth The Fed clearly understands this relationship between inflation and the output gap but initial signs suggest that the ECB may underestimate the extent to which it can safely hold interest rates low in the short run to boost output and jobs It has repeatedly said that lower interest rates cannot reduce unemployment That is undoubtedly true in the long run but i f an economy is operating below potential and the jobless rate is above the NAIRU then interest rates can safely be cut and hence output boosted without pushing up inflation Statements by ECB officials often appear to suggest that all of the unemployment rate in the euro area is structura l and none of it cyclical However estimates from the IMF suggest that outpu t in the area is currently almost below potential ie the economy is operating at point A With growth in the euro area starting to pick up th e ECB is already muttering about a rise in interest rates But it is far too soon the area still has a significant output gap that will continue to hol d down inflation Is a bit of inflation good for you When inflation was in double digits central banks had a simple rule bring it down But now that the rate in almost all rich economies is or less they are being forced to ask how low This is hotly debated because some economists believe that inflation has economic benefits as well as costs Consider first the costs When inflation is high people find it difficul t to distinguish between changes in average prices and changes in relative prices For example a firm cannot tell if a rise in the price of copper reflects general inflation or a scarcity of the metal This distorts important price signals leading to a misallocation of resources Inflation also creates uncertainty about the future which reduces investment And lastly because of the way inflation interacts with tax systems which are never fully indexed for inflation it reduces the real return on saving and hence reduces future growth Inflation in double digits clearly does considerable harm but what about lower rates And does inflation do more damage than or zero Yes answers Martin Feldstein president of the National Bureau of Economic Research He believes that even modest inflation can do significant damage through its effect on saving Tax is levied on nominal interest income so as inflation rises the real aftertax return on savings comes down and people save less which depresses future growth rates Mr Feldstein estimates that in America a cut in inflation from to zero would permanently increase the level of GDP by To reduce inflation by two percentage points would involve a oneoff loss in output of of GDP but the discounted present value of the future annual gains of around of GDP would far outweigh the loss Zero inflation he concludes is a worth y goal Yet there is little empirical evidence that lower inflation rates do noticeably improve growth performance once inflation is below say A scatter plot of inflation against growth for a range of countries shows no clear trend see A study by Robert Barro an economist at Harvard University found that a reduction in inflation of one percentage point increases the annual growth rate by a paltry of a percentage point Some economists go much further arguing that modest inflation of perhaps is good for growth and employment Nominal wages they say tend to b e rigid downwards Workers may be prepared to put up with flat wages when the inflation rate is which amounts to a decline in real income but they are reluctant to accept a pay cut in money terms So if the inflation rate is zero real wages cannot be adjusted downwards in declining industries or regions which means that unemployment will rise Inflation the argument runs greases the wheels of the labour market allowing real wages to adjus t more smoothly A widely cited study by the Brookings InstitutionF which examined pay i n America since confirmed that very few people take nominal wage cuts i n any year However the problem of wage FstickinessF may be overstated There have been few periods in the past when inflation has been less than for an extended period so it is not surprising that falling wages are rare If inflation were to remain low resistance to wage cuts might fade Indeed i n Japan wages have been falling over the past two years And as long as productivity is rising allowing unit labour costs to fall there may be no need for nominal pay cuts anyway AmericaFs recent experience certainly suggests that nominal wage rigidities are no cause for concern unemploymen t has continued to fall even though average inflation over the past three years has been only A second common worry about zero inflation is that interest rates cannot fall below zero so there is no way of allowing real interest rates to become negative to help the economy out of a recession But the need for negative real interest rates may be exaggerated Mervyn King a deputy governor of the Bank of England argues that negative real interest rates have been rare in America during the past halfcenturyF During most recessions low real interest rates have been enough to boost demand The only time when there might be a problem is if the economy suffers a shock when the output gap is already large and inflation below target because policymakers have failed to react to a previous slump in demand A preemptive policy which aims to prevent inflation going below target as well as above argues Mr King minimises the need for negative real interes t rates The final and most serious concern is that if central banks aim for zero inflation prices are more likely to fall for brief periods and the experiences of the s and Japan today show that deflation can be more dangerous than modest inflation But falling prices are not necessarily a problem Before the first world war a decline in the average price level was quite common during periods of rapid technological change such as the late th century yet these were also periods of strong growth This is quite different from the harmful sort of deflation seen during the Great Depression Moreover the odd year of falling prices does not matter so lon g as it does not feed expectations that they will continue to fall causing households to delay spending On balance the benefits of retaining some inflation are probably overstated Price stability reduces uncertainty and so offers the best economic environment for firms and households So why do central banks not invariably aim for zero inflation The answer is that official consumerprice indices tend to overstate the true rate of inflation in all countries because they do not adjust fully for improvements over time in the quality of goods and services Estimates suggest that in most countries the official consumerprice index overstates inflation by around a year This is the best reason why central banks should aim for a slightly positive inflation rate Flatearth economics With rates of consumerprice inflation of or under most rich countries have therefore more or less achieved Fprice stabilityF However that does not mean that central bankers can go out on the town and celebrate Despite subdued inflation the big three central banks all face their own particula r dilemmas JapanFs economy is still at risk from deflation The ECB is ha ving to deal with the added uncertainty of a completely new currency which has made the bankFs monetary policy extra cautious at a time when output in the euro area is stuck below its potential As for the American economy the Fe d is baffled because inflation is currently lower than any economic model would have predicted Under the old economic rules if unemployment fell below the NAIRU thought to be around inflation would start to rise This in turn implied that the maximum rate of growth the American economy could safely sustain adding up growth in the labour force and in productivity was about Today AmericaFs jobless rate stands at a year low of and GDP has grown at an average rate of almost a year over the past three years According to the textbooks inflation should be rising Instead AmericaFs underlying inflation rate has remained subdued Hence all the talk about the Goldilocks economyFneither too hot nor too cold One popular explanation of why strong growth has not pushed up inflation is that the American economy is undergoing a paradigm shift In this Fnew economyF it is argued information technology and increased global competition have opened up new investment opportunities and boosted productivity growth Mr Greenspan himself frequently sings the praises of the IT revolution and talks of a Fonceacentury phenomenonF Other economists go further and argue that in this new era of low inflation the Fed can throw away its rulebook the notions of a NAIRU and a maximum sustainable rate of growth have become redundant Inflation is dead Then again perhaps not AmericaFs productivity growth in the nonfarm sector has indeed increased to an annual average of over the past three years twice the average over the previous years The big question is whether this is just a cyclical blip or a permanent increase in trend growth If a big if this increase is maintained it may raise the economy F s noninflationary speed limit to a year say But that does not mean there are no limits to growth if it continues at its recent pace and the labour market continues to tighten inflation is bound to rise Some people may want to believe in economic miracles but there is an alternative explanation for AmericaFs low rate of inflation The country has benefited from four favourable factors First weak oil and commodity price s until earlier this year and a strong dollar and weak overseas demand especially in Asia have held down import prices Second an investment boo m has created excess capacity which has made it hard for firms to pass on wag e increases in higher prices Although unemployment is at a year low AmericaFs capacity utilisation is well below its historical average Thi rd nonwage labour costs have been curbed by a booming stockmarket which has allowed firms to reduce their contributions to employee pension plans And fourth the inflation rate has been nudged down by changes in the way of measuring it By holding down prices these factors have in turn helped to restrain wages But the old relationship between a tight labour market and wage growth remains alive and well real wage growth has accelerated over the past few years as you would expect when the unemployment rate is below the NAIRU This may have been temporarily offset by the favourable factors but as these effects wear off inflation is likely to creep up again Oil prices are already rising the dollar has slipped and recovery in the rest of the world will push up import prices There are also signs that nominal wage costs are now starting to pick up Goldilocks is in danger of burning her tongue and the Fed may come to regret that it did not raise interest rates sooner Despite the increases this summer real interest rates still remain lower than a year ago Reports of the death of inflation are therefore much

very high inflation andor on very high or longterm unemployment Later in the course we will examine changes in unemployment and inflation and their relation in the short run this week we focus on definitions and longrun determinants and costs Hint for unemployment what has happened to the workweek in France Concerning growth you might want to look at Report Corruption Ruining Economies Of South Asia hnmwlasiaunhtml a Reuters story Concerning measurement of The New Economy a fellow student recommends the Economist article at editorialfreeforallcurrentindexfnhtml will all the pretty pics and graphs or the plain text version below Exaggeration The digital economy is much smaller than you think NEWSPAPERS and magazines are packed with stories about the digital economy the informationtechnology IT revolution and the Internet age That their pages are filled with advertising from IT firms presumably has nothing to do with it Such firms account for a quarter of the total value of the SP and this week Dow Jones announced that Microsoft Intel and SBC Communications will be included in its industrial average from November st Not before time many say for hightechnology businesses now account for a huge chunk of the economy Actually they dont New figures published on October th by Americas Department of Commerce appear to support the view that IT is very important to the American economy The department now counts all business spending on software as investment previously it was a cost This has both increased the apparent size of IT investment and boosted Americas rate of growth in recent years But measuring the size of the new economy is a statistical minefield The most generous estimate comes from the OECD which tracks the knowledgebased economy It estimates that this accounts for of total business output in the developed economiesup from in But this definition which tries to capture all industries that are relatively intensive in their inputs of technology and human capital is implausibly wide As well as computers and telecoms it also includes cars chemicals health education and so forth It would be a stretch to call many of these businesses new A study published in June by the Department of Commerce estimates that the digital economythe hardware and software of the computer and telecoms industriesamounts to of Americas GDP this year If that sounds rather disappointing then a second findingthat IT has accounted for of total real GDP growth since should keep efanatics happy Perhaps unwisely A new analysis by Richard Sherlund and Ed McKelvey of Goldman Sachs argues that even this definition of technology is too wide They argue that since such things as basic telecoms services television radio and consumer electronics have been around for ages they should be excluded As a result they estimate the computing and communicationstechnology sector at a more modest of GDPup from in This would make it bigger than the car industry but smaller than health care or finance In most other economies the share is lower for the world as a whole therefore the technology sector might be only of GDP But what you might ask about the Internet Goldman Sachss estimate includes Internet service providers such as America Online and the technology and software used by online retailers such as Amazoncom It does not however include transactions over the Internet Should it Ebusiness is tiny at present but Forrester Research an Internet consultancy estimates that this will increase to more than trillion in America by Internet bulls calculate that this would be equivalent to about of GDP Yet it is misleading to take the total value of such goods and services whose production owes nothing to the Internet The value added of Internet salesie its contribution to GDPwould be much less probably little more than of GDP This is not to deny that the Internet is changing the way that many firms do businessby for example enabling them to slim inventoriesbut in the near future as a proportion of GDP it is likely to remain small A Luddites lament If measuring the size of the technology sector is hard calculating its contribution to real economic growth is trickier still because the prices of IT goods and services adjusted for quality have fallen sharply relative to the prices of other goods and services For example official figures show that Americas spending on IT has risen by a year in nominal terms since but by more than a year in real terms This figure is so high partly because it is extremely sensitive to assumptions about the rate at which the price and quality of IT is changing The Commerce Department calculates that the technology sector has contributed to overall economic growth over the past four years But because such figures are based on spending in real terms the Goldman Sachs study reckons they are misleading In nominal terms IT has accounted for a more modest of GDP growth in the past four years Another popularly quoted figure is that business spending on IT has risen from of firms total capitalequipment investment in to today But again this is based on constantdollar figures and so it hugely exaggerates the true increase In terms of current dollars and before the latest revisions Goldman Sachs calcuate that business investment in computers accounts for of total capital spending not And even this exaggerates the importance of IT because much of the money goes to replace equipment which becomes obsolete ever more quickly The share of IT in additional net investment is much smaller Computers still account for only of Americas total net capital stock For years economists have been seeking in vain for evidence that computers have dramatically raised productivity One explanation for the failure of productivity to surge may be that official statistics are understating its growth Another is that much investment in IT has been wasted hours spent checking email surfing the Net or playing games reduce not increase productivity A third may simply be that IT is still too small to make a difference for the moment appropriately enough you can count the digital economy on the fingers of one hand That is changing and firms are learning And note this if you add in all computer software and telecoms on the widest definition the share of IT in the capital stock rises to As it happens this is almost the same as railways at the peak of Americas railway age in the late th century Railways boosted productivity and changed the face of Victorian commerce Hype is hypebut the new economy may yet happen anyway LINKS The Commerce Departments statistics on information technology spending are summarised in a press release PressReleasewwwcbhtml The complete text of

is using marginal incentives Should California Media Firms Get State Funds for Training By SHEILA MUTO From The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition For years the state Employment Training Panel gave little attention to two renowned California enterprises multimedia and entertainment But then both industries started complaining of a tight labor market and stiff competition from outside the state As a result a raft of companies including Seagram Cos Universal Studios Walt Disney Co and USWebCKS Corp have been the beneficiaries of million from the Employment Training Panel The eightmember board metes out about million annually to attract and retain businesses and jobs by improving workers skills And while California clearly has an interest in promoting a healthy climate for business including an able work force some are questioning whether multimedia and entertainment are really the kind of struggling industries that couldnt make it without state assistance The funds doled out by the Training Panel amount to corporate welfare says Naomi Lopez a policy analyst at the Pacific Research Institute a freemarketoriented think tank in San Francisco And just because theres a labor shortage in entertainment and multimedia doesnt mean we need to be using government resources to alleviate it According to Brady Bevis director of San Franciscos Bay Area Multimedia Partnership thats exactly what the Training Panel should be doing to ensure the health of the states economy These industries and jobs can go anywhere she adds noting they are already moving to Canada India and Japan Training Panel funds come from a special tax collected from businesses which amount to a maximum of about per employee Businesses or training agencies apply to the panel to underwrite their training programs and can be reimbursed for them after employees complete the training and stay with their jobs for days The bulk of panel funds between and go to manufacturers Kathleen Milnes a senior vice president at the Entertainment Industry Development Corp in Los Angeles estimates that entertainment companies fork over about million annually to the panel fund but until recently hadnt benefited from it We were subsidizing other industries she says So in Ms Milness and Ms Beviss organizations prompted the Training Panels venture into the celluloid and digital realms The two economicdevelopment nonprofits devised a program called SkillsNet which aims to keep cuttingedge highpaying entertainment and multimedia jobs in the state The effort has received about from the panel to study which skills companies are looking for set up a Web page and help firms tap into state training funds among other things Later this month SkillsNet plans to unveil a new report on the postproduction industry plus an online posting of internships But misgivings about the panels new focus are being unveiled as well Though he hasnt looked at the impact of state training dollars spent on multimedia and entertainment companies Richard W Moore a management professor at California State UniversityNorthridge says that panel funds are most effective when used as an incentive for employers who typically underinvest in training In contrast entertainment and multimedia companies tend to invest in training anyway says Prof Moore who was commissioned by the panel to assess its effectiveness He released reports in and his next study is set to come out later this summer In general he says the panel works Based on his report Prof Moore found that the training provided by panel funds meant that after two years employees who received retraining increased their salary by and new hires increased theirs by Considering the panel spends only about a participant he says thats a healthy payoff Still Sen Patrick Johnston the Stockton Democrat who wrote the legislation that created the Employment Training Panel in is attempting to reel in the agency through Senate Bill Among other things the bill which has already passed the Senate reduces the panel from a grantmaking agency to an advisory commission to the state Employment Development Department While the panel has helped some workers and boosted some businesses that are important to the California economy in other instances it has made less than stellar funding decisions Sen Johnston says pointing to funds given to hotels law firms and other service industries that clearly werent going anywhere But he believes that the agencys focus on multimedia and entertainment will prove to be an effective use of state funds During the past three years the panel has awarded million for retraining about workers and training new hires on the latest computer systems software and techniques in the multimedia and entertainment fields For example state records show that Universal Studios was granted million last year to retrain employees in management and computer skills And Video Symphony Entertraining Inc in Los Angeles received million to retrain workers from companies including Walt Disney on techniques such as video editing and digital animation The entertainment and multimedia industries need the funds says Charles Lundberg the panels marketing director because competition keeps getting tougher and the software and hardware keeps getting upgraded Indeed Paul Sidlo chief executive of REZN Productions Inc which does everything from Web design to visual effects for film and television says his Los Angeles firm has lost out to Canadian companies on a handful of contracts because they underbid him by nearly thanks to government subsidies Given that the D animation training that of his employees received last year through funding from the state which he estimates was worth about in instruction costs and employees time went a long way toward reducing the he spends annually on retraining workers The training subsidy he says really helped My comments Trainin funds are most useful it they go to folks who would not pay for the training themselves perhaps due to difficulties borrowing Also if the skills are useful at many employers no single employer wants to pay for the skills that workers walk away with to competitors Do you think the multimedia training subsidies meets these critera If not how could one target the training better David I Levine Associate professor Haas

<19682438.1075843091500.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,levine@haas.berkeley.edu,1999-11-01 11:14:00,A recent BusinessWeek article on measuring GDP and productivityHari sent the following BusinessWeek ANALYSIS COMMENTARY I thought others might want to read Software A New Calculus for the New Economy How reclassifying it as an investment boosts growth The US truly has seen the birth of a New Economy over the past several years Thats one way to read the results of a comprehensive revision of historical data on the gross domestic product released on Oct by the Commerce Depts Bureau of Economic Analysis The most stunning data in the report are about the acceleration of productivity in the s Official revisions of productivity data incorporating the latest output figures from Commerce wont be released by the Labor Dept until Nov But a BUSINESS WEEK analysis of the new data from the Commerce Dept shows that nonfarm business productivity growth in this decade will likely be revised upward to roughly a year from Productivity growth will be boosted for the s as well but not by as much chart Whats even more striking is the upward revision in productivity growth for the last three years from to a stunning rate That explains how the US has been able to grow at a rate over that stretch without creating inflationary pressures KEEPS ON TICKING While the rate of increase in economic output in the s isnt as impressive as the growth in productivity it is not as low as the old statistics indicated From through the Commerce Dept statisticians say the economy grew at an annual rate of about even with the s growth rate of And the report confirms what everyone senses Growth has accelerated recently Commerce revised the economys growth rate for upward to an average of from a previously reported By comparison annual average GDP growth for the entire year span covered by the revisions was pushed upward to from The implication of the revisions The US economy may now be able to sustain a higher rate of growth without inflation than was previously believed The Commerce Dept now says that the GDP last year was trillion which is about billionor higher than previously believed A new calculus for software investments accounted for about twothirds of the upward revision in GDP And since software sales are growing far faster than the economy as a whole adding them into the GDP raises the economys official growth rateand will likely continue doing so for years to come Indeed the biggest factor in the Commerce Depts revisions is the new way of accounting for software the poster product of the New Economy The government now treats software purchases by business and government as investments which are part of GDP Until now the only software sales that counted toward GDP were sales to consumers and the sale of software that came bundled with computers and was included in the computers purchase price Now all software sales are factored into the GDP figures The new treatment of software isnt just some statistical trick Until now software spending by business and government was considered an expense and expenses are left out of GDP to avoid doublecounting For instance it would be doublecounting to list the steel that goes into a car as part of GDP and count the car too But software is not consumed in the production of new goods and services And the government is acknowledging now that software shouldnt be considered an expense such as steel or stationery Its being reclassified as an investment like a machine tool in recognition that it has a useful life of at least a year PIGGYBANK BLOAT By recognizing software as an investment instead of an expense the Commerce Dept also increases the national savings rate Savings are the mirror image of investment While the national savings rate was revised downward for it was revised upward for the years since The biggest revision was for the most recent year covered The government now says that total national savings were of gross national product last year a jump of percentage points from the previous calculation Of that increase fully was accounted for by the governments recognition of business and government software purchases as an investment The Commerce Dept also rejiggered the composition of the national savings accounts raising personal savings while lowering government savings by an equal amount Thats because of a new way of accounting for government pension plans contributions to which are now considered a form of personal rather than governmental savings The reshuffling means that the personal savings rate is now calculated as for instead of a previously reported The new methodology will undoubtedly turn the current personal savings rate from negative to positive But since the governments savings fell by a corresponding amount the reshuffling had no impact on the overall national savings rate And the downward trend in personal savings is still in place By the new measure the personal savings rate declined from in to last year instead of from to as had been previously reported KINDER HINDSIGHT The GDP revisions were wideranging and included hundreds of large and small tweaks For instance the government is now using a better way to measure the value of banking services such as automated teller machines and electronic funds transfers That increases the sectors official output and productivity Also new inflation measures developed by the Labor Dept are being incorporated all the way back to not just since One footnote The government now says the recession of was milder than previously thought From its peak in the second quarter of to its trough in the first quarter of GDP fell The old figure was a drop The Commerce Depts rewrite of economic history doesnt mean that the Federal Reserve can afford to be any less vigilant about inflation Regardless of the official growth rate Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has to keep his eye on the same warning signs tight job markets busy factories rising commodity prices The real significance is that government statistics are finally reflecting the reality of the highgrowth highproductivity lowinflation New Economy By Peter Coy in Washington My comments The article is a bit unclear on whether software was ever counted The key point is that the value of software not yet depreciated is a percent or of GDP Thus GDP is a few larger than the old accounting system that expensed all software immediately Consider your own desktop What of your salary is the market value of the software you have on the machine Not the original cost as Word has a very low market cost even if it was years ago David I Levine Associate professor Haas School of Business ph University of California fax Berkeley CA email wwwlevine
<18676142.1075843091569.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,levine@haas.berkeley.edu,1999-10-21 19:42:00,Capital gains tax editorial for next weekSuch a Capital Idea by Brad De Long and David Levine Appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle December p A In the s Republicans argued that the tax cuts they proposed would make the economy grow faster because the rich would redirect energy from avoiding taxes to entrepreneurship Unfortunately the theory was wrong The most optimistic serious assessment of the effects from the tax cuts by supplysider Larry Lindsay show supplyside benefits of the tax cut far lower than the burden of the debt they generated Now Republicans are again proposing tax cuts Today skepticism infects even the core of the Republican coalition The Wall Street Journals editorial pages attacked the tax cuts as being the kind that former Democratic Congressman Rostenkowski might have producedsurely the worst insult they can imagine Principled Republican economic advisers are silent There is not even a theory under which the Republicans capital gains tax cut child credit and increase in taxes on families that qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit EITC could boost growth Start with the capital gains tax cut It provides no incentives to boost investment No manager deciding whether to build a factory buy a computer or engage in research and development changes his or her calculation of expected profit because of a reduction in capital gains taxes Some proponents believe the tax cut will boost investment and growth indirectly by increasing savings They note that the tax cut raises the aftertax returns on savings placed in risky assets such as shares of stock They then claim higher returns on these assets will in turn induce higher savings Higher savings will drive down interest rates which in turn will raise business investment and growth But this roundabout chain of cause and effect falls apart at the first touch Both the capital gains tax rate and the aftertax return to savings have wandered all over the place in the past generation Private savings have barely shifted in response Thus each dollar of tax cuts increases private savings by less than a dollar The net effect of the tax cut is to lower the pool of national savings available to fund investment Continued hope that lowering tax rates will boost American savings and investment is the triumph of faith over experience The problem is that this tax cut provides an enormous windfall gain to those who have unrealized capital gains on assets they acquired in the past The top one percent of American families with unrealized capital gains hold about half of these unrealized gains While many people realize a small amount of capital gains in any given year these few families hold trillions of dollars of unrealized gains Good tax policies provide incentives for people to work save and invest Bad tax policies reward a wealthy few for decisions they made in the past A capital gains tax cut may well raise revenue in its first year or two as people liquidate their unrealized gains before the next increase in capital gains rates But once the first wave of selling is over a standard guess is that the capital gains tax cut will cost about billion a year When the government decides to spend billion a year on a tax incentive shouldnt it choose one likely to boost economic growth for everyone And shouldnt it be part of a package that avoids further tilting our distribution of income in an unhealthy direction The overall effect of the Republican tax proposals on the distribution of income gives the impression that the congressional majority is waging a onesided class war the cuts in the Earned Income Tax Credit and the details of how the child credit is paid add up to roughly billion a year in tax increases on families with annual incomes less than and tax decreases of some billion or so per familyon those with incomes of more than Early in the nineteenth century Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in the introduction to Democracy in America of equality of conditions as the creative element that made America great This substantial equality of conditions was under threat once in the generation of the Gilded Age and almost turned America into a very different and worse country This years tax changes are another step in a series that places it under threat again Brad De Long and David Levine teach economics and business at the University of California Berkeley Addendum Due to space constraints the editorial omitted three sometimes offsetting issues concerning how the capital gains tax treats time The capital gains tax overtaxes gains because it taxes nominal gains including gains that are due solely to inflation Thus if inflation doubles average prices over a decade someone who sells an asset that also doubles in nominal value will face taxation although the assets real value was constant The capital gains tax undertaxes gains because the tax on unrealized gains is not collected until a sale This delay is like the federal government lending the value of the uncollected tax at zero interest at low inflation the undertaxation due to value of this loan is usually larger than the overtaxation due to the first effect Moreover if the person dies holding the gain the tax on unrealized gains is forgiven a somewhat bizarre feature of the tax system This latter feature makes the tax ineffective at collecting revenue from the very wealthy who merely delay sales of their appreciated assets A better capital gain tax should tax only real gains should not forgive taxes on inherited unrealized gains and this is trickier should try to minimize the value of lost tax due to holding appreciated assets David I Levine Associate professor Haas
