Stoler Lou Sent Monday October AM To Murray Julia Subject RE Material Contract Review ASAP I reviewed the following deals Duferco closed September A Merger Event would constitute an Event of Default on the part of ENA if the surviving entity did not assume ENAs obligations or the creditworthiness of the surviving entity or transferee is materially weaker than its predecessor immediately prior to the mergerBut there are the basic exceptions for an affilitate transaction Huntco closed June Under the Inventory Management structure ENAs rights under all Transactions inventory purchases and sales may be assigned under a sale to an affiliate an spv we manage a successor to all or substantially all our assets or an assignment in connection with a financing or other financial arrangement without Huntcos consent Under the Loan we made to Huntco we may assign the Loan to anyone after notice to Huntco or to an affilitate without notice to Huntco There are no change of control provisions which impact ENAs position Under the LLC which owns the cold mill a steel processing plant ENA owns the Class B Interest and a disposition of that interest which requires the initial Class A Members consent includes a merger or consolidation other than where ENA is the surviving entity To my knowledge the Class A Member is still the initial Class A Member Long Lane Master Trust IVa Fleet National Bank
