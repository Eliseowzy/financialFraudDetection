NRONDEVELOPMENT lek trocombr ENRONDEVELOPMENTcc Subject Your p articipation in the Wholesale Market Implementation MAEMAE detailed imp lementation is gaining momentum Given the breadth and scope of the requir ed efforts several Task Forces have been created or are about to be creat ed The Task Forces are in general responsible for further detailing the market rules andor project management of specific implementation efforts Some of those task forces are joint ONSMAE efforts Regulatory Affair s from both Enron and Elektro has participated in some of the Task Forces but many of them are not being covered We think Enron should have a broa der coverage in more ot the workstreams However Regulatory Affairs does not have sufficient resources to participate more actively in all the requ ired workstreamsBroader participation is important for three reasonsa It is easier to influence and change directions at the early stages of th e processb The Technical Commitee does not have a good coordination mech anisms across all Task Forces Unless one participates directly we lose touch with the subjects being discussedc It is an opportunity to get in close contact with ONS Enron does not have a seat at the ONS BoardThe refore we are requesting your support to help Enron participate more acti vely by assigning specific professionals from your departent to the Task Forces more related to your current or future responsibilities We assume that the average workload is about day a week for each Task ForceThe P roject Charters and responsibilities are described as follows As an initi al thought we think the most relevant groups are Trading b l Legal d m Integrated Projects a f n Elektro b f gOnce we have a few suggested names Regulatory Affairs will be in charge of making sure the participants hit the ground running and for coordinating the efforts across teams a Optimization and Pricing Mode ls led by Sheilly Contente Coelba It is a joint task force MAEONS examining in detail all existing and future optimization models most of them black boxes produced by CEPEL Those models will also be key to s et the MAE spot price on a halfhourly basis Jos Lucio Reis is participa ting b AMPs Authorized Market Procedures led by Alexandre Magno Cachoeira Dourada it is a Task Force working with PriceCoopers to detai l all future procedures to be used by the MAE Those procedures include Co ntract Register Data Submission Energy Accounting and many others This group is also examining the interim procedures to be adopted as soon as t he MAE starts to develop the settlement and accounting functions formerly developed by GCOI this Task Force is responsible for updating the GCOI rules taking into acount the breakdown of the supply contracts into T and G components Initial Contracts and some other recommendations on settle ment being made by ANEEL Enron has had an ad hoc participation in some me etings This is an area particularly important to the Trading activities c Implementation led by Jean Thebault Light This Task Force is examining the overall work plan to implement the MAE to make sure all the pieces fit together MAE implementation requires a good orchestration betw een MAE Rules ONS System Development Metering and Metering Protocols A ccounting and Settlment Systems and many others There is a general feeling that many of those pieces are dangling Dates and responsibilities are al so very fragmented No one from Enron is participatingd Legal led by Rosane Magalhes CERJ this task forces examines all legal and tax as pects on the MAE implementation It also supports other task forces when legal issues are involved Currently no one from Enron participating We think that having a lawyer from Enron or Elektro engaged in this Task Forc e is essentiale Capacity Fee led by Luiz Maurer Enron this Task F orce is further detailing the implementation of this subject already appr oved by COEX Work involves the setting of a capacity fee for peaking plan ts as well as the establishment of criteria on who should pay who and ho w should receive CEPEL and PSRI have been hired to support the quantitati ve analysis Fred Sampaio Elektro has also participated f MAE Algebr aic Rules led by Sureck Gerasul this Task Force has examined in deta il the MAE algebraic rules proposed by Price Coopers and proposed some mod ifications This task force is now also involved in proposing how the Init ial Contracts energy should be profiled on a halfhourly basis Luiz Maure r has participated in the initial phased in charge of examining the propo sed the rules for International Interconnections Fred Sampaio is now the Enron representativeg Allocation of Transmission Surplus led by Paul o Born Metropolitana this Task Force need to quantify the US volumes involved in the surplus and propose ways to distribute it Some general g uidelines have already been proposed while the Initial Contracts are effec tive No guidelines exist afterwards Initial analysis revealed that a lot of money may be at stake and generators are eager to use those funds to limit their contract risk exposure No one from Enron is participatingh MRE Energy Reallocation Mechanism led by Sylvia Celestino Furnas The purpose of this Task Force is to work on the details of the MRE For example how the assured energy and the secondary energy will be profiled over time and compared to the Initial Contracts Subject is important for hydro generators or to assess the value of hydro generation No one fro m Enron is participating in this Task Forcei Demand Side Bidding l ed by Ana Pimenta Light the purpose of this Task Force is to evaluate and expand the proposals made by Price Coopers regarding the participatio n of large users in the MAE price setting process The Task Force has als o considered the possibility of creating additional market rules to foster the demand side management No one from Enron is participatingj Cost of Capital led by Danilo Dias BNDES this Task Force is reviewing t he traditional discount rate used by the electric sector and developi ng sensitivity analysis on the impact of higher rates on the optimization decisions Kleinworth Benson and CEPEL have been hired to support the effo rt Luiz Maurer is participatingk Cost of Rationing led by Wellingto n ANEEL this Task Force is reviewing the traditional cost of energy d eficit used by electric sector which is currently US MWh Studies ar e being developed to define the energy deficit as a step function whose c ost of deficit will depend on the magnitude of the energy rationing CEPEL has been hired to support the quantitative analysis The group will also tangencially revisit the Value of Lost Load VLL which is a key parameter to calculate the capacity fee No one from Enron is currently in this tas k forcel Financial Settlement led by Gilberto Pimenta CEMIG thi s Task Force has to make interim and definitive recommendation on how the financial settlement should occur The possibility to use financial instit utions as clearing agents has been examined and in principle the idea look s attractive Special efforts are being assigned to the interim period a s of Oct all the accounting and settlement has to be developed by ANEE L This Task Force is related to Task Forces b and c Therefore it ma y be relevant to Trading as wellm Chain of Accountability led by Fre d Sampaio Elektro this joint Task Force involving ABRADE MAE ONS ABRAGE and others has the responsibility to better define accountability i ssues in case of failure It has provided inputs to the Initial Contracts and to the Transmission Contracts as welln Optimization and Pricing Pr ocedures led by Miranda Chesf this Task Force has the objective of a nalyzing and double checking the assumptions used to run the optimization and pricing models Discount Rate expansion plan plant comissioning date s and expected delays are being revised This group has a strong interface with Task Force a In additon to those Task Forces I hope I did not m iss any there are also some adhoc efforts such as MAE Budget a Task F orce to hire consultants to develop MAE processes and systems and a few o thers Those are important ones as well but they have basically being dis cussed at the Technical Commiitte level Where both Enron and Elektro ha ve participatedLM

NRONDEVELOPMENT Maria Ines GranadoENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT David S ReinfeldENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Brazilian Regulations for Swaps Prepays Antonio Felix As Enron is finding several opportunities involving financial derivatives in Brazil we would like to get from Tozzini Freire Law Firm a summarized but concise read on the cans and cannots of these type of transactions in Brazil Here is my understanding of the regulations from the memo you have already sent to us regarding swaps and prepays as well as a list of the most common examples of deals that Enron would be encountering in the marketplace I would appreciate if you could comment on what is written here and also add further information so Enron can have some sort of menu of deals of this nature that can be pursued I would like to ask you to add your comment in this same message to make the review process a little easier Thank you inadvance for your attention Swaps Pulp Paper Petrochem Power OTC Swaps The Central Bank regulates swap transactions involving local financial institutions acting either as dealers for their own account or as intermediaries to the contracting parties When the financial institutions act as intermediaries the agreements are in fact private agreements negotiated by two nonfinancial companies but become subject to the requirements and regulations normally applicable to swaps involving financial institutions According to regulations currently in force such swaps can relate to exchange rates interest rates gold and price indices All of the swap agreements involving financial institutions must be registered with CETIP or with another custody and clearing system authorized by the Central Bank or the CVM Brazilian SEC As a matter of practice the agreements used by the banks that participate in the swap market do not follow a standard form since normally each bank has a particular sample form with which it feels more comfortable Derivatives In addition to exchangetraded derivatives and OTC swaps involving financial institutions there is no legal impediment in principle to derivatives transactions being privately negotiated and entered into between two interested parties As a general rule in Brazil as long as no specific prohibition is found in the law parties are free to negotiate agreements that best suit their interests International Hedge Central Bank regulations authorize that Brazilian companies enter into transactions abroad either in exchanges or having a financial institution as their counterpart to hedge against the fluctuation of interest rates exchange rates or commodity prices in the international markets Such hedge transactions must refer to payments in foreign currency scheduled to be made by or to the Brazilian company in respect of commercial or financial rights or obligations or to payments in local currency arising out of certain financial obligations subject to the variation of exchange rates and payments relating to imports exports or local transactions involving commodities priced according to their valuation in foreign exchanges The commercial market exchange rates are applicable to foreign exchange agreements referring to remittances of currency in connection with hedge transactions When the underlying obligationright is registered with the Central Bank the corresponding hedge transaction must be informed to the Central Bank within days of its execution When there is no registration with the Central Bank the banks executing the foreign exchange agreements relating to the hedge transaction must verify the existence of the obligationright being hedged Examples Commodity swap between two Brazilian companies As per what has been said above there is nothing that precludes Enron Brazil of entering into a swap with another Brazilian company regarding any commodity traded by Enron Pulp Paper Petrochem products Power Gas Enron does not need to be a financial institutions to provide swaps transactions On the other hand I am not sure yet on the following points Does such swap agreement should be registered with CETIP or any other clearing system to be valid under Brazilian regulations What are the taxes involved in a swap Commodity swap between a Brazilian company and an offshore company This kind of deal seems to be also available in the Brazilian market and the only difference from example would be the fact that it must be registered with the Central Bank and it would involved transfer of foreign currency Commodity swap between two offshore companies but involving Brazilian exports I am not sure if Brazilian regulations would have anything to do with a transaction like this one I would assume that a Brazilian exporter would sell to their offshore subsidiary and such subsidiary would sell to their end customer Enron would step in and offer a swap agreement for the offshore subsidiary of the Brazilian company therefore Enron would not have any involvement with Brazilian regulations because it would not be dealing with Brazil Prepays Pulp Paper Petrochem Power The regulations currently in force governing export prepayments especially Central Bank of Brazils CartaCircular of February establish that all repayments of principal under such transactions must necessarily be made by means of shipments of the relevant exported goods CartaCircular allows cash remittances abroad only in regard to payments of interest under the facility Therefore it is not possible to structure a transaction where the repayment of principal will be made only in cash or where the borrower has the ability to choose between paying cash or exporting the goods A transaction that involves structuring a direct loan to the Brazilian company where the value of the principal of which would be tied to the price of the relevant commodity is very difficult to be approved Under a direct loan registered with the Central Bank the borrower may remit all due amounts of principal and interest in accordance with the schedule of payments attached to the certificate of registration The problem with such alternative is that although there are no express regulations preventing it to do so the Central Bank will most probably not issue a prior authorization for such type of loan as it only normally issues authorizations for normal loans where the principal is a fixed amount and the interest rate is either a fixed rate or a floating rate normally based on LIBOR or US Treasury It should also be noted that generally speaking all interest payments under such an agreement are subject to withholding tax at the rate of pa CC Account A possible alternative way to structure a prepay would be by using a nonregistered loan with the Central Bank Under such alternative the funds disbursed by Enron under the loan would be remitted to Brazil through an international transfer of Brazilian currency as allowed by Circular of the Central Bank of Brazil The international transfer of Brazilian currency International Transfer is a system which uses a nonresident current account in Brazil and the Brazilian interbank foreign exchange market to effect remittances of funds to and from Brazil Under such system a lender that wishes to disburse funds to a Brazilian borrower makes a foreign currency deposit with a bank located outside of Brazil offshore bank and instructs the offshore bank to deliver such dollars to a Brazilian bank in exchange for Brazilian currency Such Brazilian currency is then deposited in a nonresident account held by the offshore bank in Brazil and thereafter transferred to the borrower The repayments follow the inverse procedure ie the borrower deposits the amount in a nonresident account of an offshore bank and instructs it to exchange the funds into foreign currency and deliver them to the lender abroad The main differences between the registered loans and the nonregistered loans are that the nonregistered loans are not subject to prior approval by the Central Bank of Brazil and therefore not subject to scrutiny as to their minimum tenors and applicable interest rates and the applicable foreign exchange rate to nonregistered loans is the floating rate as opposed to the commercial rate of exchange All transfers of funds to Brazil as International Transfers are subject to a Financial Transactions Tax IOF at the rate of on the amount transferred plus a bank fee that normally ranges from to of such amount Any interest payments under a nonregistered loan are subject to withholding tax at the rate of or if the lender is located in a taxhaven jurisdiction I dont think this type of transaction is the best way to circumvent some of the Brazilian regulations regarding prepayment given the bad press that deals via the CC Account mechanism would bring to Enron but I have it addressed just in case someone does not share the same opinion Examples Financial prepay between two Brazilian companies Not allowed unless the company providing the prepay qualifies as a financial institution as per Brazilian law Since it will not be the case in Enrons cases we should not focus in these kind of transactions Financial prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company As it has been mentioned before it is allowed as long as Enron can structure the prepay in way where there is a preestablished amortization schedule for principal and interest It is very hard to structure a prepay with specific split between principal and interest because the objective of the prepay is to lock on a certain volume of a product and not on a specific price Therefore if Enron prepays for a specific product on a floating basis the attached value of that commodity can go up or down as the market fluctuates as well as the total value associate to the deal Such value can be either principal or interest and it is impossible to determine what it will be Financial prepay between two offshore companies but one being a subsidiary of a Brazilian entity I think there is no restrictions in this case given the whole deal will be closed offshore and the Brazilian authorities are not going to be involved It will most likely be a deal involving three parties a company in Brazil its offshore subsidiary and Enron Physical prepay between two Brazilian companies No restrictions Physical prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company No restrictions as long as there is physical deliveries Physical prepay between two offshore companies but involving Brazilian exports No restrictions It would also involve three parties a company in Brazil its offshore subsidiary and Enron Thanks Gustavo

because it would not be dealing with Brazil Prepays Pulp Paper Petrochem Power The regulations currently in force governing export prepayments especially Central Bank of Brazils CartaCircular of February establish that all repayments of principal under such transactions must necessarily be made by means of shipments of the relevant exported goods CartaCircular allows cash remittances abroad only in regard to payments of interest under the facility Therefore it is not possible to structure a transaction where the repayment of principal will be made only in cash or where the borrower has the ability to choose between paying cash or exporting the goods A transaction that involves structuring a direct loan to the Brazilian company where the value of the principal of which would be tied to the price of the relevant commodity is very difficult to be approved Under a direct loan registered with the Central Bank the borrower may remit all due amounts of principal and interest in accordance with the schedule of payments attached to the certificate of registration The problem with such alternative is that although there are no express regulations preventing it to do so the Central Bank will most probably not issue a prior authorization for such type of loan as it only normally issues authorizations for normal loans where the principal is a fixed amount and the interest rate is either a fixed rate or a floating rate normally based on LIBOR or US Treasury It should also be noted that generally speaking all interest payments under such an agreement are subject to withholding tax at the rate of pa CC Account A possible alternative way to structure a prepay would be by using a nonregistered loan with the Central Bank Under such alternative the funds disbursed by Enron under the loan would be remitted to Brazil through an international transfer of Brazilian currency as allowed by Circular of the Central Bank of Brazil The international transfer of Brazilian currency International Transfer is a system which uses a nonresident current account in Brazil and the Brazilian interbank foreign exchange market to effect remittances of funds to and from Brazil Under such system a lender that wishes to disburse funds to a Brazilian borrower makes a foreign currency deposit with a bank located outside of Brazil offshore bank and instructs the offshore bank to deliver such dollars to a Brazilian bank in exchange for Brazilian currency Such Brazilian currency is then deposited in a nonresident account held by the offshore bank in Brazil and thereafter transferred to the borrower The repayments follow the inverse procedure ie the borrower deposits the amount in a nonresident account of an offshore bank and instructs it to exchange the funds into foreign currency and deliver them to the lender abroad The main differences between the registered loans and the nonregistered loans are that the nonregistered loans are not subject to prior approval by the Central Bank of Brazil and therefore not subject to scrutiny as to their minimum tenors and applicable interest rates and the applicable foreign exchange rate to nonregistered loans is the floating rate as opposed to the commercial rate of exchange All transfers of funds to Brazil as International Transfers are subject to a Financial Transactions Tax IOF at the rate of on the amount transferred plus a bank fee that normally ranges from to of such amount Any interest payments under a nonregistered loan are subject to withholding tax at the rate of or if the lender is located in a taxhaven jurisdiction I dont think this type of transaction is the best way to circumvent some of the Brazilian regulations regarding prepayment given the bad press that deals via the CC Account mechanism would bring to Enron but I have it addressed just in case someone does not share the same opinion Examples Financial prepay between two Brazilian companies Not allowed unless the company providing the prepay qualifies as a financial institution as per Brazilian law Since it will not be the case in Enrons cases we should not focus in these kind of transactions Financial prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company As it has been mentioned before it is allowed as long as Enron can structure the prepay in way where there is a preestablished amortization schedule for principal and interest It is very hard to structure a prepay with specific split between principal and interest because the objective of the prepay is to lock on a certain volume of a product and not on a specific price Therefore if Enron prepays for a specific product on a floating basis the attached value of that commodity can go up or down as the market fluctuates as well as the total value associate to the deal Such value can be either principal or interest and it is impossible to determine what it will be Financial prepay between two offshore companies but one being a subsidiary of a Brazilian entity I think there is no restrictions in this case given the whole deal will be closed offshore and the Brazilian authorities are not going to be involved It will most likely be a deal involving three parties a company in Brazil its offshore subsidiary and Enron Physical prepay between two Brazilian companies No restrictions Physical prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company No restrictions as long as there is physical deliveries Physical prepay between two offshore companies but involving Brazilian exports No restrictions It would also involve three parties a company in Brazil its offshore subsidiary and Enron Thanks Gustavo

the requir ed efforts several Task Forces have been created or are about to be creat ed The Task Forces are in general responsible for further detailing the market rules andor project management of specific implementation efforts Some of those task forces are joint ONSMAE efforts Regulatory Affair s from both Enron and Elektro has participated in some of the Task Forces but many of them are not being covered We think Enron should have a broa der coverage in more ot the workstreams However Regulatory Affairs does not have sufficient resources to participate more actively in all the requ ired workstreamsBroader participation is important for three reasonsa It is easier to influence and change directions at the early stages of th e processb The Technical Commitee does not have a good coordination mech anisms across all Task Forces Unless one participates directly we lose touch with the subjects being discussedc It is an opportunity to get in close contact with ONS Enron does not have a seat at the ONS BoardThe refore we are requesting your support to help Enron participate more acti vely by assigning specific professionals from your departent to the Task Forces more related to your current or future responsibilities We assume that the average workload is about day a week for each Task ForceThe P roject Charters and responsibilities are described as follows As an initi al thought we think the most relevant groups are Trading b l Legal d m Integrated Projects a f n Elektro b f gOnce we have a few suggested names Regulatory Affairs will be in charge of making sure the participants hit the ground running and for coordinating the efforts across teams a Optimization and Pricing Mode ls led by Sheilly Contente Coelba It is a joint task force MAEONS examining in detail all existing and future optimization models most of them black boxes produced by CEPEL Those models will also be key to s et the MAE spot price on a halfhourly basis Jos Lucio Reis is participa ting b AMPs Authorized Market Procedures led by Alexandre Magno Cachoeira Dourada it is a Task Force working with PriceCoopers to detai l all future procedures to be used by the MAE Those procedures include Co ntract Register Data Submission Energy Accounting and many others This group is also examining the interim procedures to be adopted as soon as t he MAE starts to develop the settlement and accounting functions formerly developed by GCOI this Task Force is responsible for updating the GCOI rules taking into acount the breakdown of the supply contracts into T and G components Initial Contracts and some other recommendations on settle ment being made by ANEEL Enron has had an ad hoc participation in some me etings This is an area particularly important to the Trading activities c Implementation led by Jean Thebault Light This Task Force is examining the overall work plan to implement the MAE to make sure all the pieces fit together MAE implementation requires a good orchestration betw een MAE Rules ONS System Development Metering and Metering Protocols A ccounting and Settlment Systems and many others There is a general feeling that many of those pieces are dangling Dates and responsibilities are al so very fragmented No one from Enron is participatingd Legal led by Rosane Magalhes CERJ this task forces examines all legal and tax as pects on the MAE implementation It also supports other task forces when legal issues are involved Currently no one from Enron participating We think that having a lawyer from Enron or Elektro engaged in this Task Forc e is essentiale Capacity Fee led by Luiz Maurer Enron this Task F orce is further detailing the implementation of this subject already appr oved by COEX Work involves the setting of a capacity fee for peaking plan ts as well as the establishment of criteria on who should pay who and ho w should receive CEPEL and PSRI have been hired to support the quantitati ve analysis Fred Sampaio Elektro has also participated f MAE Algebr aic Rules led by Sureck Gerasul this Task Force has examined in deta il the MAE algebraic rules proposed by Price Coopers and proposed some mod ifications This task force is now also involved in proposing how the Init ial Contracts energy should be profiled on a halfhourly basis Luiz Maure r has participated in the initial phased in charge of examining the propo sed the rules for International Interconnections Fred Sampaio is now the Enron representativeg Allocation of Transmission Surplus led by Paul o Born Metropolitana this Task Force need to quantify the US volumes involved in the surplus and propose ways to distribute it Some general g uidelines have already been proposed while the Initial Contracts are effec tive No guidelines exist afterwards Initial analysis revealed that a lot of money may be at stake and generators are eager to use those funds to limit their contract risk exposure No one from Enron is participatingh MRE Energy Reallocation Mechanism led by Sylvia Celestino Furnas The purpose of this Task Force is to work on the details of the MRE For example how the assured energy and the secondary energy will be profiled over time and compared to the Initial Contracts Subject is important for hydro generators or to assess the value of hydro generation No one fro m Enron is participating in this Task Forcei Demand Side Bidding l ed by Ana Pimenta Light the purpose of this Task Force is to evaluate and expand the proposals made by Price Coopers regarding the participatio n of large users in the MAE price setting process The Task Force has als o considered the possibility of creating additional market rules to foster the demand side management No one from Enron is participatingj Cost of Capital led by Danilo Dias BNDES this Task Force is reviewing t he traditional discount rate used by the electric sector and developi ng sensitivity analysis on the impact of higher rates on the optimization decisions Kleinworth Benson and CEPEL have been hired to support the effo rt Luiz Maurer is participatingk Cost of Rationing led by Wellingto n ANEEL this Task Force is reviewing the traditional cost of energy d eficit used by electric sector which is currently US MWh Studies ar e being developed to define the energy deficit as a step function whose c ost of deficit will depend on the magnitude of the energy rationing CEPEL has been hired to support the quantitative analysis The group will also tangencially revisit the Value of Lost Load VLL which is a key parameter to calculate the capacity fee No one from Enron is currently in this tas k forcel Financial Settlement led by Gilberto Pimenta CEMIG thi s Task Force has to make interim and definitive recommendation on how the financial settlement should occur The possibility to use financial instit utions as clearing agents has been examined and in principle the idea look s attractive Special efforts are being assigned to the interim period a s of Oct all the accounting and settlement has to be developed by ANEE L This Task Force is related to Task Forces b and c Therefore it ma y be relevant to Trading as wellm Chain of Accountability led by Fre d Sampaio Elektro this joint Task Force involving ABRADE MAE ONS ABRAGE and others has the responsibility to better define accountability i ssues in case of failure It has provided inputs to the Initial Contracts and to the Transmission Contracts as welln Optimization and Pricing Pr ocedures led by Miranda Chesf this Task Force has the objective of a nalyzing and double checking the assumptions used to run the optimization and pricing models Discount Rate expansion plan plant comissioning date s and expected delays are being revised This group has a strong interface with Task Force a In additon to those Task Forces I hope I did not m iss any there are also some adhoc efforts such as MAE Budget a Task F orce to hire consultants to develop MAE processes and systems and a few o thers Those are important ones as well but they have basically being dis cussed at the Technical Commiitte level Where both Enron and Elektro ha ve participatedLM
