Director Electric Industry Analysis Eni the Italian oil and gas group is expected to complete the sale of its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus on its core activities of naturalgas and oil production Vittorio Mincato Enis chief executive confirmed that the group is on the verge of finalizing the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary Enis real estate company with assets valued between million and billion Enis decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many observers of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with another company Enron Corp has been among those on a rumored short list of merger prospects for Eni ANALYSIS Is the foundation being established for a megamerger between Eni and Enron It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument in that direction Eni is Italys stateowned multifaceted energy company operating in the oil and gas power generation petrochemicals oilfield services and engineering industries The company has a market capitalization of about billion euros approximately billion is present in over countries and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day Across the European energy marketwhich once it has fully privatized will represent an arguably larger market than the United StatesEni is unquestionably one of the Continents leading champions Illustrating this point Eni has taken several important steps within Europe to as it says play an increasingly important role in the Continents competitive energy market For instance earlier this month Eni inked a deal to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell billion cubic meters of natural gas to Italys largest private energy supplier Edison With both agreements Eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the European naturalgas market CEO Mincato has said that Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy by focusing on international markets One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month Eni made a bid for Australias Petroz NL which wields an percent stake in BayuUndan the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of Australia Eni already owns percent of BayuUndan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project It is no wonder whythe BayuUndan field has recoverable reserves of million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of trillion cubic feet Petroz has not yet accepted Enis offer but a favorable decision is expected shortly Thus whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world In fact Mincato recently confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of million barrels to million barrels by Moreover Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion both within Europe and beyond Along with that expansion comes the development of merger strategy Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong Net income for the company for the first half of was millions of euros equivalent to approximately billion representing a percent increase Eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company As consolidation of the oil industry continues Eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage Enron may be at the top of Enis list of merger partners Negotiations with Spains largest oil company Repsol appear to have stalled as was confirmed when Mincato stated that any linkup with Repsol would not be a merger of equals French oil company TotalFina is also interested but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips Petroleum It is quite obvious that Enis merger prospects are predominantly oil companies which is quite clearly the companys intention Thus it may seem odd that Enron is also included as a top prospect Enron while unquestionably a world player is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets Put succinctly Enron believes that it doesnt need to own physical assets in order to be a major player but rather it only needs to rely on strategic contractual agreements However if Eni wants to continue to expand globally it arguably could not find a better partner than Enron generally considered North Americas biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas Enrons gas trading and distribution activities in particularalong with its electricity production raw material trading and broadband expansionwould all appear to be good compliments to Enis portfolio Reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole Ore based on input from an unnamed source The report indicated that Enron is being targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger Mincato as recently as Tuesday of this week continues to adamantly deny that any deal with Enron is being studied Not surprisingly Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures However the incorporation of Enis power production portfolio would support Enrons expansion into new markets such as Japan for example Back in March the Japanese government began allowing nonutility firms to supply power to industrial and commercial endusers Almost simultaneously Enron established a new subsidiary Enron Japan Corp to capitalize on new opportunities in the country Enron Japans first offer is a percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years Operating against its North American strategy Enron also plans to build a power station in northern Japan beating to the punch several of its key rivals including Vivendi Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country Enrons proposed power plant should give the company prime access to companies in the Tohoku and Kanto regions as well as Tokyo the big catch of the Japanese market In my opinion herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both companies As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets Japan seems like a natural location and Ive seen no reports that indicate Eni is moving into Japan on its own The fact that Enron is already there along with most other lucrative international markets must certainly be appealing to Eni Regarding Enrons perspective on any potential partnering Enis substantial oil and naturalgas generation assets along with its current lock on the European market must be very attractive Enrons current market capitalization is about billion which actually makes it larger than Eni This raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place All of the rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron but it could just as easily be the other way around Those of us who follow Enron closely may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger In any case the rumors continue to fly as Eni responds to claims of thou doth protest too much Whether or not any such merger between Eni and Enron which appears smart on paper will materialize remains to be seen However it certainly seems like Eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple

meters of natural gas to Italys largest private energy supplier Edison With both agreements Eni has given a substantial kick start to the opening of the European naturalgas market CEO Mincato has said that Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy by focusing on international markets One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month Eni made a bid for Australias Petroz NL which wields an percent stake in BayuUndan the giant gas and liquids project located off the northern coast of Australia Eni already owns percent of BayuUndan and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project It is no wonder whythe BayuUndan field has recoverable reserves of million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of trillion cubic feet Petroz has not yet accepted Enis offer but a favorable decision is expected shortly Thus whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is trying to regain in other key areas of the world In fact Mincato recently confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current level of million barrels to million barrels by Moreover Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion both within Europe and beyond Along with that expansion comes the development of merger strategy Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover which could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact that its profits remain strong Net income for the company for the first half of was millions of euros equivalent to approximately billion representing a percent increase Eni is largely considered one of the best buys among the big oil stocks but it would rather merge with an equal partner than be sold to another company As consolidation of the oil industry continues Eni reportedly believes that the only way to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world stage Enron may be at the top of Enis list of merger partners Negotiations with Spains largest oil company Repsol appear to have stalled as was confirmed when Mincato stated that any linkup with Repsol would not be a merger of equals French oil company TotalFina is also interested but is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips Petroleum It is quite obvious that Enis merger prospects are predominantly oil companies which is quite clearly the companys intention Thus it may seem odd that Enron is also included as a top prospect Enron while unquestionably a world player is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets Put succinctly Enron believes that it doesnt need to own physical assets in order to be a major player but rather it only needs to rely on strategic contractual agreements However if Eni wants to continue to expand globally it arguably could not find a better partner than Enron generally considered North Americas biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas Enrons gas trading and distribution activities in particularalong with its electricity production raw material trading and broadband expansionwould all appear to be good compliments to Enis portfolio Reports of talks between the two companies first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole Ore based on input from an unnamed source The report indicated that Enron is being targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger Mincato as recently as Tuesday of this week continues to adamantly deny that any deal with Enron is being studied Not surprisingly Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures However the incorporation of Enis power production portfolio would support Enrons expansion into new markets such as Japan for example Back in March the Japanese government began allowing nonutility firms to supply power to industrial and commercial endusers Almost simultaneously Enron established a new subsidiary Enron Japan Corp to capitalize on new opportunities in the country Enron Japans first offer is a percent discount off current electricity prices for customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years Operating against its North American strategy Enron also plans to build a power station in northern Japan beating to the punch several of its key rivals including Vivendi Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell which also have expressed interest in establishing operations in the country Enrons proposed power plant should give the company prime access to companies in the Tohoku and Kanto regions as well as Tokyo the big catch of the Japanese market In my opinion herein lies the primary synergy that would make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both companies As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets Japan seems like a natural location and Ive seen no reports that indicate Eni is moving into Japan on its own The fact that Enron is already there along with most other lucrative international markets must certainly be appealing to Eni Regarding Enrons perspective on any potential partnering Enis substantial oil and naturalgas generation assets along with its current lock on the European market must be very attractive Enrons current market capitalization is about billion which actually makes it larger than Eni This raises the question of which company would be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place All of the rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron but it could just as easily be the other way around Those of us who follow Enron closely may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the target for a takeover or even a merger In any case the rumors continue to fly as Eni responds to claims of thou doth protest too much Whether or not any such merger between Eni and Enron which appears smart on paper will materialize remains to be seen However it certainly seems like Eni is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the very near future SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you need From simple
