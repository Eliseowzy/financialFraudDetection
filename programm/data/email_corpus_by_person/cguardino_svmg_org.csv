solely o n Energy Legislation during this special session of the State Legislature A s an organization SVMG is working to provide feedback on the more relevant bills to ensure that Silicon Valleys voice is heard in this critical debate Since the process is moving so quickly with bills being voted on daily th e SVMG Working Council and Operations Committee approved a mechanism so that we could provide a timely response to key pieces of legislation A special Task Force of Energy Experts from Member Companies and several of our seasoned policy professionals from member firms are meeting weekly to review bills and respond With that in mind SVMGs actions to date on key bills appear below I would like to offer my special thanks to Derek Naten of Roche for Chairin g our Energy Legislation Task Force and each member of his team for the significant amount of time they are investing in this effort If you have any questions or comments on the bills referenced below or SVMGs positions to date please let me know This information also appears on our web site at wwwsvmgorg Sincerely Carl SVMG Positions on Key Energy Legislation Energy Legislative Subcommittee March State Legislation There are more than bills in the extraordinary session focused on energ y reform The legislative subcommittee recognizes that there are very few that are viable in the current climate Furthermore of the principle vehicles for fundamental change SBX ABX et al there is usually so much flux in the process as to make it difficult to respond except in principle eg oppose bills where the state takes over transmission lines as it commits the state as utility for many years and impedes market restoration For that reason the LS has recommended SVMG jointly draft a letter expressing principles and criteria for assessing and responding to legislation primarily focused on the goal for the state to develop a visio n for its energy future ie total reregulation or deregulation with dir ect access and customer choice incentivize private money to primarily fuel infrastructure improvements and a stepbystep blueprint to carry out the vision We also want to recommend a consolidated or omnibus approach to streamline legislative resolution and eliminate duplication and confusion However there are some key bills on which we have taken a position ABX Migden Community Aggregation Position Oppose pro rata share language AB X authorizes any municipality to aggregate the electrical load of interested electricity customers within its borders The bill also include s a provision however section i p line that entitles every municipality to a pro rata share of the energy efficiency and renewable energy funds contributed by its customers to Californias public benefits programs at least million annually funded through a small surcharge on utility bills Provides shared administration of EE programs between municipality and utility and provides for sale of street lighting at book value ABX Hertzberg Solvency of Utilities State Position Watch This is the vehicle for the Governors plan to address the utilitys insolvency Waiting for major text changes SVMG is very concerned about approaches floated for this bill particularly state purchase of the Transmission grid and the risk to politicize electricity delivery Our message is that we prefer paying for the undercollection through rates shared by all customers rather than through the tax base But if the State is determined to own the grid SVMG recommends that California become a member of a Regional Transmission Organization RTO ABX Wright Interruptibles Program Position Support Requires the CPUC to adopt by April regulations to permit demand metered customers to participate in energy and ancillary services markets o f the PX and ISO allows for the continued operation of interruptible program s with heavy industrial customers until and provides for an optout in the event rate increases above the systemwide average are imposed and requires the CPUC to implement a Bridge Interruptible Program for customers who have met their annual cap hours or events of curtailment SBX BattenKeeley Restructure Q F ContractsPosition Support Restructures QF contracts to longterm from approximately cents per kilowatthour to approximately centskwh and additionally enables Many QF facilities are offline because of the high price of natural gas This allows QF facilities to sell power onto the market to defray high natural gas costs The following Sher bills are conjoined SBX Sher Conservation Programs Position Support Appropriates from the General Fund to implement various energy efficiency programs CARE and LIHEAP funding and new generation initiatives SBX Sher Facilitates siting of Power Generation Facilities Position Support Requires the Air Resources Board ARB to implement an expedited retrofit program for generation facilities requires the ARB to implement a program to identify emission reduction credits expedited siting process for standb y facilities and distributed generation as well as air pollution retrofit of existing plants Final report of CEC is to include discussion of any publi c benefits from new facility including economic environmental and reliabilit y benefits from repowering of facility ABX Nation Tiered Residential RatesProportional Position Support Requires the CPUC to establish a tier rate structure rd tier at of baseline Also provides CPUC to ensure installation of time of use meters for at least of nonresidential customers Establishes proportional burden of rate increases between residential and nonresidential customers no crosssubsidization of rates SBX Escutia CoreNonCore customers for State Power Position Oppose Dedicates retained generation to serve core customers limit core at kW svc Concerned that noncore larger employers will be left to fend for themselves to buy on the spot market This bill would hurt job providers and their workers throughout California which in turn could severely undermine the California economy ABX Cohn Demand Management Programs Position Support Provides additional M for peak electricity demand programs called for i n AB of last year as modeled on the Blackout Busters approach

are not would receive the same percentage increase Timeofuse increases would be allocated only to the peak and midpeak rates in an effort to encourage more intensive conservation at times when it is most needed The Governor also supports a direct access option for business customers that ensures the financial stability of the bridge loan and revenue bonds that are needed to back the states power

solely o n Energy Legislation during this special session of the State Legislature A s an organization SVMG is working to provide feedback on the more relevant bills to ensure that Silicon Valleys voice is heard in this critical debate Since the process is moving so quickly with bills being voted on daily th e SVMG Working Council and Operations Committee approved a mechanism so that we could provide a timely response to key pieces of legislation A special Task Force of Energy Experts from Member Companies and several of our seasoned policy professionals from member firms are meeting weekly to review bills and respond With that in mind SVMGs actions to date on key bills appear below I would like to offer my special thanks to Derek Naten of Roche for Chairin g our Energy Legislation Task Force and each member of his team for the significant amount of time they are investing in this effort If you have any questions or comments on the bills referenced below or SVMGs positions to date please let me know This information also appears on our web site at wwwsvmgorg Sincerely Carl SVMG Positions on Key Energy Legislation Energy Legislative Subcommittee March State Legislation There are more than bills in the extraordinary session focused on energ y reform The legislative subcommittee recognizes that there are very few that are viable in the current climate Furthermore of the principle vehicles for fundamental change SBX ABX et al there is usually so much flux in the process as to make it difficult to respond except in principle eg oppose bills where the state takes over transmission lines as it commits the state as utility for many years and impedes market restoration For that reason the LS has recommended SVMG jointly draft a letter expressing principles and criteria for assessing and responding to legislation primarily focused on the goal for the state to develop a visio n for its energy future ie total reregulation or deregulation with dir ect access and customer choice incentivize private money to primarily fuel infrastructure improvements and a stepbystep blueprint to carry out the vision We also want to recommend a consolidated or omnibus approach to streamline legislative resolution and eliminate duplication and confusion However there are some key bills on which we have taken a position ABX Migden Community Aggregation Position Oppose pro rata share language AB X authorizes any municipality to aggregate the electrical load of interested electricity customers within its borders The bill also include s a provision however section i p line that entitles every municipality to a pro rata share of the energy efficiency and renewable energy funds contributed by its customers to Californias public benefits programs at least million annually funded through a small surcharge on utility bills Provides shared administration of EE programs between municipality and utility and provides for sale of street lighting at book value ABX Hertzberg Solvency of Utilities State Position Watch This is the vehicle for the Governors plan to address the utilitys insolvency Waiting for major text changes SVMG is very concerned about approaches floated for this bill particularly state purchase of the Transmission grid and the risk to politicize electricity delivery Our message is that we prefer paying for the undercollection through rates shared by all customers rather than through the tax base But if the State is determined to own the grid SVMG recommends that California become a member of a Regional Transmission Organization RTO ABX Wright Interruptibles Program Position Support Requires the CPUC to adopt by April regulations to permit demand metered customers to participate in energy and ancillary services markets o f the PX and ISO allows for the continued operation of interruptible program s with heavy industrial customers until and provides for an optout in the event rate increases above the systemwide average are imposed and requires the CPUC to implement a Bridge Interruptible Program for customers who have met their annual cap hours or events of curtailment SBX BattenKeeley Restructure Q F ContractsPosition Support Restructures QF contracts to longterm from approximately cents per kilowatthour to approximately centskwh and additionally enables Many QF facilities are offline because of the high price of natural gas This allows QF facilities to sell power onto the market to defray high natural gas costs The following Sher bills are conjoined SBX Sher Conservation Programs Position Support Appropriates from the General Fund to implement various energy efficiency programs CARE and LIHEAP funding and new generation initiatives SBX Sher Facilitates siting of Power Generation Facilities Position Support Requires the Air Resources Board ARB to implement an expedited retrofit program for generation facilities requires the ARB to implement a program to identify emission reduction credits expedited siting process for standb y facilities and distributed generation as well as air pollution retrofit of existing plants Final report of CEC is to include discussion of any publi c benefits from new facility including economic environmental and reliabilit y benefits from repowering of facility ABX Nation Tiered Residential RatesProportional Position Support Requires the CPUC to establish a tier rate structure rd tier at of baseline Also provides CPUC to ensure installation of time of use meters for at least of nonresidential customers Establishes proportional burden of rate increases between residential and nonresidential customers no crosssubsidization of rates SBX Escutia CoreNonCore customers for State Power Position Oppose Dedicates retained generation to serve core customers limit core at kW svc Concerned that noncore larger employers will be left to fend for themselves to buy on the spot market This bill would hurt job providers and their workers throughout California which in turn could severely undermine the California economy ABX Cohn Demand Management Programs Position Support Provides additional M for peak electricity demand programs called for i n AB of last year as modeled on the Blackout Busters approach
