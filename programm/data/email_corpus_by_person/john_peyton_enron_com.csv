Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones Mutualfund giant Vanguard Group is seeking regulatory permission to offfer a new type of share class for five of its nine stockindex funds that would act like exchangetraded funds Vanguard which has thrived for years by offering lowcost stock funds said the share class called Viper shares for Vanguard Index Participation Equity Receipts will be listed on the American Stock Exchange The funds which filed to register a Viper class of exchangetraded shares are Vanguard Index Fund Vanguard Growth Index Fund Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Vanguard Value Index Fund and Vanguard SmallCap Index Fund Index mutual funds traditionally the lowest cost provider of mutual fund portfolios are being challenged by exchangetraded funds which are mutualfundlike vehicles that trade over an exchange like a stock Exchangetraded funds cost less than index funds because the assetmanagement firms that sponsor them dont deal directly with the individual investor through expensive telephone centers and retail offices The Viper shares differ from conventional mutual fund shares in that they trade continuously at market prices on the American Stock Exchange rather than the calculated net asset value of the fund determined at the end of the trading day Given this flexibility Vipers shares are expected to appeal primarily to shortterm investors Vanguard has yet to determine the expense ratios for the Viper shares The move by Vanguard the second largest mutual fund company comes amid heightened competition in the marketplace for index investors Barclays Global Investors a huge presence in the pensioninvesting world is preparing over the next four weeks to unveil new index funds that will also trade on the American Stock Exchange The exchangetraded funds will track everything from the total US stock market to industrial and Internet sectors The flagship Barclays product iShares SP Fund will mirror the bigcompany

Corp unit has filed a lawsuit in federal court charging the Vanguard Group Inc with breach of contract and trademark infringement in connection with the mutual fund companys proposed new Vipers exchangetraded funds or ETFs McGrawHills suit alleges Vanguard breached the companies license agreement by using Standard Poors proprietary indices and trademarks for the Vipers exchangetraded products without permission Officials from Vanguard the nations second largest fund firm werent immediately available to comment on the lawsuit Exchangetraded funds are a hybrid version of index mutual funds that can be bought or sold during the day at market prices instead of at the oncedaily pm price used by traditional mutual funds ETFs are single shares of stock that replicate an index such as the Standard Poors Standard Poors currently has more than license agreements for uses of its indices and trademarks including agreements related to ETFs according to McGrawHill McGrawHill wants to prevent Vanguard from using SPs indices and trademarks in connection with Vipers or any other exchangetraded security The complaint also seeks an order requiring Vanguard to withdraw its Securities and Exchange Commission application for Vipers and seeks an order declaring Vanguard liable for unspecified damages and attorneys fees Liberty Financial Cos confirmed it is in talks to acquire Wanger Asset Management LP which operates the Acorn mutual funds The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Liberty L a Bostonbased assetmanagement company would pay about million for Wanger a Chicago investment company that has been on the SELLING block for several months The Journal said the reported price of the transaction which equals about of Wangers billion of assets under

even as the firms management was being sharply criticized by shareholders and its funds were suffering big withdrawals The typical price for a fund firm had been about of assets depending on how the assets were invested Wanger was considered attractive because most of its assets are in highly profitable stock mutual funds Liberty majority owned by Liberty Mutual Insurance Co has about billion in assets and mutual funds Midwest bank National City Corp will sell about billion in student loans as part of a restructuring of its balance sheet The company said the sale expected to close in the second quarter will result in a pretax gain of about million In addition to the student loan sale National City is also evaluating other alternatives Some would require the recognition of losses given current market conditions Clevelandbased National City NCC reported a decline in first quarter net income as borrowing costs rose more than loan rates Last November the bank warned analysts to reduce profit estimates as the spread between its borrowing costs and lending rates shrank The problem for National City and many banks is the failure of deposit growth to keep pace with loan demand That forces them to fund loans with money borrowed at higher rates in the capital markets National City expects its balance sheet reorganization to be complete by the end of the third quarter Led by a fall
