will seek to prove Lateral Larry wrong and that there is more than one right answer Let me know if you have any luck Readers Comments Hi Janie For what its worth the answer to the riddle you published was correct The calculation is called a geometric series which can be summated over an infinite number of terms Just as it is impossible for the rabbit to stick its head out of both sides of the box simultaneously so is it impossible for it to do anything in an infinitely small measure of time However THEORETICALLY and thats all were talking here if you could keep splitting minute by halves down to an infinitely small measure your last measure would be after an infinity of splits Therefore the sum of these times would be the initial minute plus the half minute quarter minute and so on to infinity As Buzz Lightyear might say To infinity AND BEYOND Cheers PS Whats more of a puzzle is why your readers dont know the difference between its and its The rabbit in the log tease is a direct reference to one of Zeno of Eleas four paradoxes Zenos first parodox was that all motion was impossible because in order to reach your destination you must first reach the halfway point Then treat the halfway point as the new starting point and repeat the logic ie the next step you must reach the pont then the point ect using this logic it is impossible for anything to ever move anywhere Whats the problem with this logic It dosnt allow for a fundamental aspect of calculus that of infinity and zero So if you were in calculus class and they gave you the rabbit in the log tease as a home work problem you whold know to take limit of the sum of n as n goes to infinity and come up with the answer that the rabbit will have its head out of both sides of the log as a time of minutes Its some how good to know that a selftaught counrty boy who proposed his paradoxes around BC is still baffleing people years later love the teases Cris Cute pun but a rabbit and a hare are different animals The defining difference being that a hares young are born with their eyes open with hair and able to hop a little shortly after birth whereas a rabbit is born hairless hareless sorry couldnt resist blind

Various monetary prizes for different achievements were awarded I was very shocked that I received an award be cause I had what they call a sweeper which means that I scored the highest over my

because at one time we were in last place After the prizes were distributed we did a cosmic bowl which means that all the lights are turned off and different fluorescent lights are turned on to light up the lanes Then we had to do all sorts of crazy things like bowling between your part ners legs and skipping down the lane and throwing with the opposite hand Each time one person had to throw and

out of each hole at the same time Not only because rabbits generally only have head but because the fractions are tending towards infinity There will never be two fractions the same and they will never reach first it takes minute then etcif you add all them up youll get something like and if you keep going itll only become something like Jon In your answer to the daily tease about the rabbit in the box you said it would take two minutes for the rabbit to stick its head out of both ends of the box Actually in theory the rabbit would never stick its head out of both ends of the box even without taking into account the fact the rabbit only has one head If you kept splitting the time in half you would still end up with an amount of time in beween each event of the rabbit sticking its head out of the box so even if it were one billionth of a second if you were to cut that in half it would be one two billionth of a second then one four billionth of a second then one eight billionth of a secondand so on So what im saying is you cant cut any amount of time in half and get zero Nick I dont understand your answer of two minutes Where do you draw the line minute th minute th minute th minute As i see it there isnt even a theoretical answer to this one Reverend Swede Actually I didnt think there was a possible answer for this puzzle and it was just meant to be a joke Sorry for

Various monetary prizes for different achievements were awarded I was very shocked that I received an award be cause I had what they call a sweeper which means that I scored the highest over my handicap on both lanes on a specific night My prize wasnt a lot of money but it was still pretty awesome that I actually won something As a whole our team placed th out of which was an achieve ment because at one time we were in last place After the prizes were distributed we did a cosmic bowl which means that all the lights are turned off and different fluorescent lights are turned on to light up the lanes Then we had to do all sorts of crazy things like bowling between your part ners legs and skipping down the lane and throwing with the opposite hand Each time one person had to throw and

out of each hole at the same time Not only because rabbits generally only have head but because the fractions are tending towards infinity There will never be two fractions the same and they will never reach first it takes minute then etcif you add all them up youll get something like and if you keep going itll only become something like Jon In your answer to the daily tease about the rabbit in the box you said it would take two minutes for the rabbit to stick its head out of both ends of the box Actually in theory the rabbit would never stick its head out of both ends of the box even without taking into account the fact the rabbit only has one head If you kept splitting the time in half you would still end up with an amount of time in beween each event of the rabbit sticking its head out of the box so even if it were one billionth of a second if you were to cut that in half it would be one two billionth of a second then one four billionth of a second then one eight billionth of a secondand so on So what im saying is you cant cut any amount of time in half and get zero Nick I dont understand your answer of two minutes Where do you draw the line minute th minute th minute

will seek to prove Lateral Larry wrong and that there is more than one right answer Let me know if you have any luck Readers Comments Hi Janie For what its worth the answer to the riddle you published was correct The calculation is called a geometric series which can be summated over an infinite number of terms Just as it is impossible for the rabbit to stick its head out of both sides of the box simultaneously so is it impossible for it to do anything in an infinitely small measure of time However THEORETICALLY and thats all were talking here if you could keep splitting minute by halves down to an infinitely small measure your last measure would be after an infinity of splits Therefore the sum of these times would be the initial minute plus the half minute quarter minute and so on to infinity As Buzz Lightyear might say To infinity AND BEYOND Cheers PS Whats more of a puzzle is why your readers dont know the difference between its and its The rabbit in the log tease is a direct reference to one of Zeno of Eleas four paradoxes Zenos first parodox was that all motion was impossible because in order to reach your destination you must first reach the halfway point Then treat the halfway point as the new starting point and repeat the logic ie the next step you must reach the pont then the point ect using this logic it is impossible for anything to ever move anywhere Whats the problem with this logic It dosnt allow for a fundamental aspect of calculus that of infinity and zero So if you were in calculus class and they gave you the rabbit in the log tease as a home work problem you whold know to take limit of the sum of n as n goes to infinity and come up with the answer that the rabbit will have its head out of both sides of the log as a time of minutes Its some how good to know that a selftaught counrty boy who proposed his paradoxes around BC is still baffleing people years later love the teases Cris Cute pun but a rabbit and a hare are different animals The

Various monetary prizes for different achievements were awarded I was very shocked that I received an award be cause I had what they call a sweeper which means that I scored the highest over my handicap on both lanes on a specific night My prize wasnt a lot of money but it was still pretty awesome that I actually won something As a whole our team placed th out of which was an achieve ment because at one time we were in last place After the prizes were distributed we did a cosmic bowl which means that all the lights are turned off and different fluorescent lights are turned on to light up the lanes Then we had to do all sorts of crazy things like bowling between your part ners legs and skipping down the lane and throwing with the opposite hand Each time one person had to throw and

out of each hole at the same time Not only because rabbits generally only have head but because the fractions are tending towards infinity There will never be two fractions the same and they will never reach first it takes minute then etcif you add all them up youll get something like and if you keep going itll only become something like Jon In your answer to the daily tease about the rabbit in the box you said it would take two minutes for the rabbit to stick its head out of both ends of the box Actually in theory the rabbit would never stick its head out of both ends of the box even without taking into account the fact the rabbit only has one head If you kept splitting the time in half you would still end up with an amount of time in beween each event of the rabbit sticking its head out of the box so even if it were one billionth of a second if you were to cut that in half it would be one two billionth of a second then one four billionth of a second then one eight billionth of a secondand so on So what im saying is you cant cut any amount of time in half and get zero Nick I dont understand your answer of two minutes Where do you draw the line minute th minute th minute
