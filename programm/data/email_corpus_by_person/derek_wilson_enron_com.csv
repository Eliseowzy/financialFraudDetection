Tuesday November AM To Wilson Derek Friedman Mark Keenan Sean Wharton Marc Subject FW Highlights from this mornings ENEDYN analyst conference call The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements Watson spoke for c minutes Bergstrom for and Whalley spoke for perhaps seconds Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold MM shares out of a total MM shares of the postmerger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true Dynegy owed Enron MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its day facility believe this is the Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next weeks BBBflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model uhoh They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT sure that no surprises remain in Enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have materialadversechange outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to yearend had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enronrelated earnings accretion at which represents a haircut to Enron internal estimates Doty says that this is all operating earningsfigure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively shortterm in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENEthere will be more of an assetbacked trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial marketmaking trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well

mailtoIMCEANOTESDrEBobSportsCfootballdrbobsportsEcomE NRONcom Sent Thursday September AM To Wilson Derek Subject College Football Best Bets Dear Member This week I have College Football Best Bets and Strong Opinions Remember I only play the Best Bets The Strong Opinions are games that were close to being Best Bets Opinions usually win around of of the time Good luck Star Selection OHIO Iowa St Ohio University returned starters from last years team but they stand at after road losses at Akron and West Virginia I expect the Bobcats to bounce back with a strong effort here at home where they are ATS the last years and straight up recently Ohio runs an option offense that returns starters from a unit that averaged rushing yards at ypr last season That offense will prosper against an Iowa State defense that allowed yards per rush to Northern Iowa in their only game this season The Cyclones have historically been horrible defending the run and they even allowed ypr last season despite having two defensive lineman that were taken in the rd and th round of the NFL draft last spring With only returning starters and no stars on defense the Cyclones will once again allow teams to run on them and Ohio should easily rack up over rushing yards at about yards per rush in this game The Bobcats can also throw the ball when needed as they averaged yards per pass last year and have thrown for yards per pass this season While the Bobcats offense figures to flourish the defense is good enough to contain a Cyclones attack that tallied just total yards against Northern Iowa Dont be fooled by the points that Iowa State put on the scoreboard in that game as Northern Iowa turned the ball over times leading to short drives of just yards yards and yards Iowa State will be a good running team again this season with the quick Seneca Wallace at quarterback and Ennis Haywood as the featured back yards at ypr last season However Wallace is not a good passing quarterback and he completed just of passes for a paltry yards in the opener while the other Cyclones quarterbacks could muster only yards on passes Ohio returns starters to a defense that allowed just points per game last year and held Iowa State to points and Minnesota to points in two road games against good offensive teams from major conferences Iowa State is not as good offensively this year with quarterback Sage Rosenfels in the NFL so I see no reason why the experienced Bobcats defense wont be able to limit the Cyclones again this season here at home Ohio qualifies in a ATS early season indicator that is already ATS this season and they also qualify in a ATS statistical indicator that plays on good running teams against teams that cant stop the run Iowa State is also just ATS as a road underdog in coach Dan McCarneys years at the helm and that record will be even worse after today Star Selection Michigan St NOTRE DAME Michigan State has won and covered the spread with room to spare in each of the last years in this series with wins coming as an underdog Ill look for another possible upset here as the Irish continue to be overrated The Irish offense is better than average both running and passing and they should be able to run the ball pretty well against a Spartans defense that is just average defending the run However quarterback Matt LoVecchio struggled last week against Nebraska yards per pass and I dont see the Irish doing much damage through the air against a Michigan State secondary that is still very good even without injured star CB Cedric Henry Michigan States offense is loaded with talent at the skill positions with two solid quarterbacks a Heisman candidate at running back in TJ Duckett and budding superstar wide receiver Charles Rogers Notre Dame has an outstanding defensive front and they should have their way with an inexperienced Michigan State offensive line with new starters However quarterback Smoker should be able to exploit a questionable Notre Dame secondary that allowed yards per pass last year and lose NFL draft choices from their secondary Notre Dame is only ATS as a favorite of more than points under coach Davies and my ratings favor them by only points in this game The Spartans meanwhile qualify in a ATS road underdog situation that won for me in a Best Bet on Utah at Oregon two weeks ago and they also qualify in a ATS early season road underdog situation that is ATS the last years With those angles qualifying Ill call for an even closer margin than my ratings project and make the Spartans a Best Bet Star Selection WAKE FOREST Maryland Wake Forest is the nations most experienced team with of last years starters returning for new head coach Jim Grobe The Demon Deacons veterans have bought into Grobes demanding work ethic and the results are a start that includes an impressive road win at East Carolina a probable bowl team in which the Deacons outgained the Pirates yards to yards Wake Forest also won at home against Appalachian State a very good Division AA team that had beaten Wake straight times Wake Forest has more talent than is indicated by last years record and it looks like Jim Grobe has started to get this team to play to their potential Wake Forest runs an option offense much like Grobe ran successfully at Ohio University and thus far the Deacons are averaging total yards per game Marylands defense has faced two troubled offensive teams so far and has allowed just points total to North Carolina and Eastern Michigan Aside from a yard touchdown run the Terps held Carolina to just yards at yards per play Maryland then allowed just total yards to a horrible Eastern Michigan team two weeks ago The Terrapins strength is their pass defense as they have limited their two opponents to just yards per pass play including sacks while picking off passes That strength will not be much of a factor in this game since Wake Forest only throws the ball on of their plays and theyve been very successful doing so averaging yards per pass play The key for Maryland is their defense of the option rush plays and the Terrapins have allowed only yards per rushing play not including sacks which is a very good number the national average this year is yprp However their opponents North Carolina and Eastern Michigan are both poor running teams and my ratings suggest than an average run defense would hold those two teams to just yards per rushing play Thus Maryland is about yards per rush play better than average and I expect them to do a pretty good job of defending the option yards per rush is my projection Wake Forest has done an excellent job of throwing from the option this year averaging yards per pass but I project them at about yards per pass play including sacks which is the number that Grobes team averaged at Ohio University last season running the same offense Maryland has allowed only yards per pass play in their two games against bad offensive teams and I calculate that they would have allowed yards per pass play if they played at that same level against a pair of averaging throwing teams In this game I expect the Terps defense to limit Wake Forest to about yards per pass play Putting all of that math together I project Wake Forest to score points That should be enough to cover the number against a Maryland offense that the Deacons defense should be able to handle The Terrapins have struggled a bit in picking up the nuances of Ralph Friedgens system but they have performed a bit better than average both running and passing Maryland has averaged yards per rushing play not including sacks in their first two games while averaging yards per pass play including sacks with quarterback Shaun Hill in the game An average offense would have averaged yards per rushing play and yards per pass play against the defenses of North Carolina very good and Eastern Michigan very bad so the Terps are a bit better than average both running and passing so far this season The Wake Forest defense should be up to the task of defending that offense as they have performed very well thus far allowing only yards per rushing play and yards per pass play Especially impressive is the yards at yards per rushing play that they held a good running East Carolina team to Using the same methods of compensation for Wakes defensive stats suggests that the Demon Deacons have been especially good at defending the run and about average defending the pass Using those compensated number I predict Maryland to run for about yards per rushing play and yards per pass play and that translates into points In addition to all of that painstaking math Maryland is also in a letdown situation as teams that start the season straight up with no spread losses are just ATS as a road favorite of points or less in game ATS for road favorites of points or less Wake Forest meanwhile qualifies in a ATS early season home underdog situation that has been very good to me over the years While both of these teams are vastly improved with their new coaches it appears as if Wake Forest is more improved and a bit underrated With that being the case and with good situations supporting the Demon Deacons as well I will call for the upset Strong Opinion Florida St NORTH CAROLINA North Carolina has faced the toughest schedule in the nation so far this year with trips to Oklahoma Maryland and Texas Thats of the top teams in the nation and a Maryland team that will probably make it to a bowl game this year The Tarheels have been outscored by an average of in those games but they have really been much more competitive than the scoreboard has shown North Carolina has averaged total yards per game and allowed just total yards per contest Such play would normally lead to about an average loss of just points but a in turnover margin and some special teams blunders have kept the Tarheels from keeping those games close Carolinas opponents have outgained their opposition by an average of yards to yards this season so the fact that North Carolina has stayed within total yards per game of those teams is admirable The truth is that North Carolina is just a bit below average offensively and very good defensively In this game the Heels are once again up against one of the top teams in the nation and I suspect that they will lose the turnover battle again since Florida State has not committed a turnover this season The Seminoles now have just starters from last years team but they are still outstanding on both sides of the ball On offense the rushing attack looks good once again this season and new quarterback Chris Rix is doing a good job throwing the football averaging yards per pass with no interceptions Rix averaged over yards per pass against a very good UAB defense in the Noles last game and I expect him to perform pretty well against the very good North Carolina stop unit Florida States defense has only returning starters but they are once again dominating on that side of the ball allowing only yards per rush and yards per pass North Carolina will once again struggle against a great defense and I expect some more costly mistakes in the form of turnovers from the Heels I actually predict a touchdown by Florida States defense or special teams in this game While I respect North Carolinas defense and usually like to take big home underdogs with a strong stop unit I will side with the Seminoles in this game on the basis of a ATS statistical indicator Florida State also has a tendency to step up when challenged a bit and they are ATS in all regular season games since when they are not favored by points or more Strong Opinion Buffalo CONNECTICUT The Huskies looked like the superior team heading into the season but the retirement of starting quarterback Ryan Tracey has hurt Connecticut who gained just total yards of offense against Division AA Eastern Washington in their last game after getting just yards against Virginia Tech Buffalo has played pretty well defensively in games against other bad offensive teams Rutgers and Bowling Green allowing just yards per play and they should be able to contain the Huskies in this game Buffalos offense is also bad but Connecticut is a horrible defensive team that has allowed total yards per game including yards to Eastern Washington Buffalo tallied yards against U Conn last year and returns starters to that offense My ratings predict points for the Bulls in this game and they should cover the number if they can top points Buffalo has failed to cover in both of their games this year while Connecticut covered in their point loss as a point dog at Virginia Tech It appears as if those pointspread results have given us line value on the side of the Bulls in this game and teams that start out the season straight up and ATS have a history of covering the spread in game when facing a team that is also not off spread loss and is not undefeated ATS Buffalo is just ATS on the road since they became a Division A team years ago so I will hold off on making a play on them here despite the good value and the good situation Strong Opinion TULSA Fresno St Tulsa has had full weeks off since their win over Indiana State on August th and the Hurricanes believe that they can win this game over this years Cinderella Fresno State has opened the season with straight upset wins and you might think that this would be a letdown spot for them However teams that start the season straight up are actually pretty good plays as road favorites in game and Fresno is as good as theyve shown in beating future bowl teams Colorado Oregon State and Wisconsin There have been only teams that have won straight up as an underdog in consecutive games in the last years and those teams are just ATS in their next game However the week off gave Fresno a chance to collect themselves and come down from the high of winning at Wisconsin which brought their record to and catapulted them into the top Of the teams that won straight as an underdog of them had a week off before their next game and all of those teams covered the spread making teams ATS if they won their rd straight as a dog the previous week So perhaps Fresno State is not in a letdown situation after all Tulsa however is full of confidence and qualifies in a number of high percentage situations and they are capable of competing with the Bulldogs in this game Fresno State is not a good running team but quarterback David Carr is one of the nations best and is averaging yards per pass with just interception against very good secondaries Tulsa blanked a horrible Indiana State offense and allowed just total yards in doing so but their defense is still questionable defending the run and only average in the secondary The veteran Hurricane secondary is a positive matchup for them here against a Fresno offense that gets of their yards through the air but my ratings still forecast points for the Dogs in this game Tulsas offense also depends on the pass although featured back Eric Richardson ran for nearly yards at ypr in his starts to end last season but only had yards at ypr against Indiana State Fresno has yielded just ypr this season and shut down Heisman candidate Ken Simonton in their win over Oregon State Tulsa should have some success in the air with talented rd year starter Josh Blankenship throwing to a good corps of receivers Fresno has a good secondary allowing yards per pass with interceptions this season against good passing teams that combine to average yards per pass on offense Tulsa threw for yards at yards per pass last year against Fresno and they were only outgained in that game by total yards But a in turnover margin led to a loss at Fresno Things should be pretty competitive in this game as Tulsa was ATS at home last year while Fresno is just ATS as a road favorite since including ATS the last years Strong Opinion COLORADO Kansas Colorado is one of the nations most improved teams as they rate among my top teams overall after recording a mark last season The Buffaloes are good both running and throwing the football and they defend the run and pass effectively In games against average overall opposition Fresno State Colorado State and San Jose State the Buffs are averaging rushing yards at ypr pass yards at ypp and are allowing just total yards per game at ypr and ypp Colorado should have an easy time scoring against a Jayhawks defense that allowed UCLA to run for yards at ypr and thrown for yards at ypp Following their opening day loss to Fresno State the Buffaloes have scored an average of points in two games and I expect another strong offensive showing in this game The Kansas offense was worse than expected in their loss to UCLA as they gained just yards at ypr on the ground while throwing for just yards at ypp However things could be just as bad today as the Jayhawks lost their top playmaker on offense in receiver Harrison Hill who was injured in the UCLA game Kansas is worse than average running the ball and throwing it while Colorado is solid against the run and among the best in the nation at defending the pass Aside from the fundamental edges Kansas is just ATS in their last road games and Colorado has covered all times as a favorite of points or more under coach Barnett This looks like another big win for the Buffaloes Strong Opinion SMU No Carolina St SMU is not nearly as bad as they appear to be after losing to Louisiana Tech and to TCU The Mustangs outgained Louisiana Tech total yards to total yards but a fumble return for a touchdown and an interception return for a touchdown by Tech blew open the game SMU then held TCU to just total yards but the Horned Frogs had fumble returns for touchdowns in that game While SMU would have lost both games without the offense allowing those touchdowns they are not as bad as perceived and should only be an point underdog in this game based on my ratings SMU returns starters from last years team and I expected them to be improved on both sides of the ball While the Mustangs are clearly improved on the stop side of the ball yards per game allowed at ypr and ypp their offense seems to be worse than a year ago NC State opened the season with an impressive win over Indiana and their offense looks a bit better than it was a year ago However I think NC States offense is overrated as they averaged just yards per rush and yards per pass last season against a schedule of teams that combined to allow an average of ypr and ypp on defense My ratings forecast only points for the Wolfpack in this game against a solid Mustangs defense The key to covering the spread in this game is for SMU to score a couple of times against an NC State defense that is good defending both the run and the pass SMU was horrible against a similarly good TCU defense and my ratings predict only points for the Mustangs in this game SMU does qualify in a couple of strong early season indicators a ATS underdog bounceback situation and a ATS home underdog angle so I will add a couple of points to their total Also NC State is straight up in their last games as a road favorite and they may be looking ahead to next weeks big game with rival North Carolina Your subsciption to this package ends on Feb

mailtoIMCEANOTESDrEBobSportsCfootballdrbobsportsEcomE NRONcom Sent Thursday September AM To Wilson Derek Subject College Football Best Bets Dear Member I have Best Bets this week in College football after going last week I counted South Carolina as a loss since of the people surveyed took a loss on that game The Strong Opinions were last week but remember I DO NOT BET THE STRONG OPINIONS Strong Opinions have won more than they have lost over the years about to but play them at your own risk I dont want to here about if they lose Or win for that matter There are Strong Opinions this week listed below the Best Bets Good luck on the Best Bets this week Star Selection IOWA Miami Ohio After suffering through a record the last seasons the Hawkeyes will be in the hunt for a bowl bid this year Iowa returns starters from a team that was hit hard by injuries last season and they are eager to flex their muscles on lesser teams as they did last week in beating Kent State MiamiOhio is certainly a tougher test than Kent but the Hawkeyes should have no trouble disposing of the Redhawks Iowa has a well rounded offense that is anchored by a veteran offensive line and that possesses a quality quarterback in Kyle McCann a talented running back in Ladell Betts and a gamebreaking receiver in Kahill Hill that is due for a breakout season Iowa ran for yards at yards per rush last week against a Kent State defensive front that I rate the same as MiamiOhios so I expect another good performance from the Iowa rush attack in this game while McCann picks apart a subpar Miami secondary when he needs to MiamiOhio possesses a pretty solid rush attack and they ran for yards at ypr against Michigan last week but Iowa is solid up front on defense and the Redhawks dont have the passing prowess to take advantage of a mediocre Hawkeyes secondary Miami averaged just yards per pass last season with a seasoned quarterback and new starter redshirt freshman Ben Roethlisberger averaged just yards per pass last week against Michigan while getting picked off times Iowa held Kents poor pass attack to just yards in passes last week ypp so they are capable of shutting down poor passing teams Teams that were or worse the previous year usually perform very well in game after a victory in their opener so expect Iowa to be very enthusiastic for this game The Hawkeyes also qualify in a ATS home favorite momentum situation as long as they remain favored by points or lessp bDowngrade Iowa to a Star if they become a favorite of more than points Pass if Iowa is favored by more than pointsb Star Selection PITTSBURGH S Florida Pittsburgh will have one of the best defenses in the nation this year as they return starters from a unit that gave up just ypr and ypp last season The Panthers opened the season with a win over Division AA East Tennessee State and now take on a South Florida team that played Division AA last season South Florida was a pretty decent in the lower division last year but they return just starters for their move to Division A The Bulls are led by talented quarterback Marquel Blackwell who threw for a mediocre yards per pass last year but tossed only interceptions while running for yards at ypr Blackwell threw for ypp last week against a poor Northern Illinois secondary and lost yardage on the ground While Blackwell is a decent Division AA quarterback he will not fare so well against a tougher schedule and will be harassed by fierce Pittsburgh pass rush that registered sacks last week Without much time to throw I doubt that Blackwell will be able to find open receivers against a sticky Pitt secondary South Florida doesnt have a rush attack and yards on rushes last week against Northern Illinois Pitt only allowed ypr so Blackwell will be put in some unfavorable passing situations in this game and I doubt that hell lead his team to more than one score if they score at all Pittsburghs offense is hurt by the absence of AllAmerican WR Antonio Bryant who missed last weeks game and is listed as doubtful this week Pitt is still a better than average offense without Bryant as quarterback David Priestly has put up solid numbers in his two years as a parttime starter yards per pass and he should perform well enough in this game to put up enough points to cover the favorable pointspread opened at and has come down Pitt beat East Tennessee State last week outgaining them yards to yards East Tennessee was rated about points worse than South Florida last season and South Florida is not as good this year with just returning starters In other words Pitt is laying just points against a team that is very similar talentwise to the East Tennessee State team that they beat by points last week Perhaps the spread dropped when it was reported that Bryant would not play again this week However that news was already in the opening line and I would have played the Panthers at that higher number The Pitt defense will dominate again this week and winning by touchdowns or more should not be a problem Star Selection TEMPLE Toledo Temple returns an amazing starters from a team that took major strides last season and I expect them to make it to a bowl game this year The Owls were last year and lost games by points or less all their wins were by comfortable margins so they were actually better than last years record indicates Toledo meanwhile returns starters from a team that was last year and they destroyed Minnesota last week at home That big win will give us some line value here and I have no problem taking a Temple team that is capable of containing Toledos Chester Taylor who is coming off a year in which he rushed for yards at ypr and ran for yards last week against Minnesota Temple has an outstanding defensive front that yielded just ypr last year and will be even better this year with starters back on defense The Owls were dominating up front last week holding Navys option rush attack to just yards on rushes and they are good enough to limit Taylors yardage today Toledo quarterback Tavares Bolden averaged just yards per pass last season and just ypp last week against a poor Minnesota secondary so limiting the run ought to be enough to limit the Rockets offense Last season Toledo averaged just points against the good defensive teams that they faced Penn State and Western Michigan and Temple should be able to hold them in that range today The Owls offense will have a tough time against a very good Toledo defense but Temple ran for yards at ypr last week against a decent Navy run defense and they did that without star running back Tanardo Sharps who was nursing an injury in order to be ready for this weeks game hes listed as probable Sharps ran for over yards last year at a very healthy ypr clip and he will be eager to play well with another top running back on the opposite sideline Toledo allowed just ypr last season but they faced only one better than average rushing team last season and that team Northern Illinois ran averaged ypr and scored points against the Rockets Last week Toledo allowed ypr to a mediocre Minnesota rush attack so I expect Temple to run the ball fairly well in this game Temple wont have to score too many points to cover the generous pointspread since their defense ought to keep Toledos scoring down and the Owls qualify in a number of great situations today Temple qualifies in a ATS home underdog momentum situation and a ATS statistical indicator My ratings favor Toledo by points but Ill call for the outright upset by Temple given the great situations that they are in pb Downgrade Temple to a Star Best Bet if they become an underdog of less than pointsb Star Selection Washington St BOISE ST The Cougars gave us an easy Star Best Bet winner last week in their win over Idaho and I will call on them again to deliver another winner tonight Washington States balanced potent offense should have another easy time moving the football as they face a Boise State defense that returns just starters from a unit that is just average against the run and terrible defending the pass Boise faced just average or better passing attacks last season and they allowed passing yards per game at ypp in those games including allowing Washington State to throw for yards at ypp in a loss Boise is even worse in the secondary this year with the loss of AllConference defensive backs from that unit South Carolina completed of their passes against Boise last week for yards per pass and I expect similar results from Gesser this week Boise State scored points in their loss to the Cougars last season but the Broncos are far less dangerous on offense with the departure of year starting quarterback Bart Hendricks who averaged an incredible yards per pass last year with a TD to interception ratio New quarterback Ryan Dinwiddle averaged just yards per pass against South Carolina last week and this week faces another great pass defense The Cougars allowed yards per pass last year against a schedule of good passing teams that combined to average ypp on offense for the season With threefourths of the secondary returning including possible AllPac caliber players the Cougars will be considerably tougher to throw on this year Last week veteran Idaho quarterback John Welsh who averaged ypp in was held to passing yards in attempts for ypp I doubt that Washington State can be that good again this week against the pass but I certainly dont see Dinwiddle doing much damage with his arm The Broncos do have a good rushing attack and they will probably pick up enough yards on the ground to score some points They just wont score enough to keep up with what their inexperienced defense gives up I am aware of Boise States straight spread wins at home but all of those wins were with Hendricks at quarterback and with Dirk Koetter as head coach neither of which is with the team anymore Also most of those big victories at home came against lowly Big West teams I am not concerned at all with Boises home field advantage as my ratings favor Washington State by points and they also qualify in a solid ATS early season indicator that pegged them as a play last week also Star Selection OREGON Utah The Ducks are an overrated team and I have no problem going against them with an always competitive Utes squad that is ATS as a road underdog under coach McBride including ATS recently as a road dog of points or more Oregon meanwhile is now just ATS when favored by points or more I maintained most of last season that quarterback Joey Harrington was overrated and I stated that again last week The Harrington for Heisman campaign is a joke Harrington completed only of his passes last season for yards per pass while tossing interceptions While those numbers are certainly better than average ypp is the national average they are hardly worthy of such praise Last week Harrington completed just of passes for only ypp while throwing interceptions Utah loses all starting defensive backs from a unit that allowed just ypp last season but McBride has always fielded very good secondaries In fact Utah has not allowed more than completions in any of the last seasons including a few years when the secondary lost or more starters Last week Utah allowed just yards per pass and intercepted passes in their win over Utah State indicating that the Utes will be better than average defending the pass once again Utah is also good defending the run as they allowed just ypr last season and should be just as good this year in that department Oregons RB Maurice Morris also gets plenty of press but he averaged a subpar ypr last season the national average is for running backs and had just yards on rushes last week Dont expect too many points from the Ducks in this one Oregon also has some trouble spots on defense that Utah can take advantage of While the Ducks have one of the nations best secondaries the front is vulnerable Only of Oregons defensive front is a returning starter and the loss of players that accounted for of the Ducks tackles for loss are now gone Teams that lose such a high percentage of impact players on defense usually struggle early in the season and Oregon qualifies in a negative ATS indicator based on that high percentage of sacks and tackles for loss from players that have graduated Wisconsin ran for a healthy ypr against the rebuilt Ducks front last week and McBride will be smart enough to attack the Ducks on the ground with an offensive line that did not lose a starter to graduation although G Taamu is serving a suspension Utah ran behind that experienced line for yards last week and will do a solid job rushing again this week I really dont expect much from the Utes pass attack against a very good Oregon secondary but I am fond of defensive solid underdogs that can run the ball and you should be too pb Pass if Utah becomes an underdog of less than pointsb Star Selection RICE Duke The loss of starting quarterback Jeremy Hurd may actually have been a blessing for the Owls as it allowed sophomore Kyle Herm to lead the offense in last weeks win at Houston Herm had limited action in his freshman campaign and proved to be a good running quarterback for the option gaining rushing yards at yards per rush Herm ran for yards on carries last week solidifying his spot as the starter Herm appears to be the best fit to run the ball with but he has had problems throwing it and managed only yards in passes last week That should not be a problem when Rice faces teams that cant defend the run very well Last week the Owls ran for yards at a healthy ypr behind an offensive line with returning starters at every position Running for that many yards on grass against a Houston defense that allowed only ypr last year is a good indication of things to come Option teams usually perform better when playing on the same surface that they play on at home since a different surface can affect the timing of their offense Rice plays on artificial turf at home and they are ATS on the fake stuff the last few years while going just ATS on natural grass under coach Hatfield Now Rice comes home to face a Duke team that surrendered ypr last season and gave up rushing yards at ypr to Florida State last week While the Blue Devils should be better defending the run this year I still rate them as worse than average and dont see them handling the option very well A horrible Wake Forest offense ran some option against Duke last season and the Blue Devils surrendered rushing yards at ypr and points to a Demon Deacons squad that averaged only ypr and points for the season I forecast Rice to rack up over rushing yards again today Dukes offense will be unable to keep up against a solid Rice defense that is better than average against both the run and the pass with returning starters coming back to a unit that was solid a year ago Rice allowed points per game but faced great offensive teams Michigan Oklahoma San Jose State Fresno State TCU and UTEP last season Dukes offense should be better than last years unit that averaged just points but they still look pretty bad this year even with returning starters Rice qualifies in a ATS statistical indicator I see no reason not to ride that angle for a Best Bet since that indicator plays on good rushing teams facing teams that statistically dont stop the run well That is certainly the case here Strong Opinion Indiana NO CAROLINA ST In last years opener the Hoosiers led the Wolfpack by points with minutes left but could not hold the lead and lost by points one of losses by points or less during their disappointing season Indiana had no trouble scoring ppg they just couldnt stop teams from scoring more ppg allowed The big news in Bloomington is the switch of exciting year starting quarterback Antwaan Randle El to wide receiver Randle El ran for yards at ypr but had a bad year throwing the football completing only of his passes Junior Tommy Jones steps in to play quarterback and should do at least as well throwing the football You might think that the running stats would take a hit with the loss of Randle Els yards and ypr but a great offensive line returns intact along with super running back Levron Williams ypr in seasons and the running backs as a unit averaged ypr last season Overall Indiana should once again be a good offensive team NC State put up pretty good offensive numbers themselves last season with freshman quarterback Phillip Rivers and receiver Koren Robinson doing most of the damage for a unit that averaged points per contest Robinson was the draft choice of the Seattle Seahawks and he will be sorely missed after hauling in yards and scoring touchdowns Also missed will be offensive coordinator Norm Chow who transformed the offense in his one year here in Raleigh While Rivers should be better in his sophomore season I really dont see him having much better numbers without Robinson to throw to Rivers was also aided last year with a schedule of opponents that couldnt stop the pass Rivers averaged a solid yards per pass but NC States opponents combined to allow an average of yards per pass so the Wolfpack actually had a below average pass attack last year The only team that NC State faced that was better than average defending the pass was Florida State and Rivers threw for only ypp in that game Indiana allowed a horrid yards per pass last season after losing starters in the preseason but they will much improved in that area although still below average this season with of starters returning and an upgrade in talent The Hoosiers will certainly improve upon the ypr that they allowed last season and I expect NC State to mount an average rush attack in this game after running for only ypr last season as they appear improved along the offensive line While NC State will have a decent offensive performance in this game I will call for the Hoosiers to control matters with their offense against a solid Wolfpack defense that will improve on the mediocre yards per play that they surrendered last season NC States strength on that unit was defending the pass but they were susceptible to good running teams last year and allowed Indiana to rush for yards at ypr in last years meeting Indianas returning starters have been focused on this revenge game all summer long and teams with that many returning starters usually get their revenge in their opener In fact Indiana qualifies in a ATS game revenge situation and they are capable of the upset tonight Strong Opinion TEXAS North Carolina Carolina scored on a yard run early in the first quarter at Maryland last week but gained just total yards for the entire game in their loss The lack of offense and a in turnover margin masked another very good defensive effort by the Tarheels defense who allowed just total yards to the Terps after yielding just yards to Oklahoma the week before The Tarheels have outgained their two opponents by an average of yards to yards per game but are in turnover margin I doubt that Carolina will even come close to outgaining the Longhorns in this game and I see them getting beaten soundly even if turnovers are not a problem for them they were also in turnover margin last season Texas didnt look too good on offense in last weeks win over New Mexico State averaging just yards per play but the Longhorns have plenty of firepower and I expect a better performance from that unit today Texas averaged in impressive yards per play on offense last season and return of starters from that side of the ball and will be even better this year with Chris Simms as the undisputed starting quarterback North Carolina does have a very good defense and they are especially tough to run on but I dont see them keeping Texas from moving the ball through the air The Tarheels actually have an above average secondary but they allowed good passing teams Florida State Georgia Tech Clemson and Pittsburgh to average yards per pass against them last season Simms averaged yards per pass last season and should have a very effective outing today North Carolina meanwhile will have few chances to score against a Texas defense that rates among the best in the nation The Horns allowed just ypr and ypp last season and return starters to the defense and should be even better this season North Carolina has a poor rushing attack and throwing into the Texas secondary will only lead to trouble as Texas picked off passes last year and returned of them for touchdowns Texas has the best secondary in the nation and Ronald Curry has not proven capable of consistently beating any team through the air Texas has covered straight home games when not laying points or more and this looks like a game that will add to that tally Strong Opinion Georgia Tech NAVY Georgia Tech has whipped the Middies the last two years at home last year and here in Annapolis in Navys once great rush attack yards per game at ypr from through has disappeared Last year the Midshipmen averaged just yards at ypr and last week managed only yards on rushes in their point loss at Temple The preseason injury to great running quarterback Brian Madden hurt them last year and Madden is expected to be out again this week due to a suspension Starting quarterback Ed Malinowski is a better throwing quarterback than Madden but Malinowski averaged just ypr last year and had just yards rushing last week By contrast Madden ran for yards at ypr in just starts in Without Madden in the lineup and with new starters on the offensive line I dont see Navy having any success running against a very good Georgia Tech front that allowed just ypr last year and held the Syracuse option to just yards rushing on carries two weeks ago and allowed just yards on rushes last week to the Citadel Malinowski while better than Manning throwing the ball is still a below average passer and I just dont think hell be able to beat a sound Yellow Jackets secondary through the air Georgia Tech has held both of their opponents to points and thats about all Navy will muster today The Yellow Jackets offense struggled a bit in their first game without former offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen but that was against a very good Syracuse defense The offense looked great in scoring first half points last week and quarterback George Godsey is now averaging yards per pass with zero interceptions in two games and ought to have another big day throwing into a poor Navy secondary that surrendered yards per pass last season The Middies are stronger in the secondary this year but I still rate them considerably below average and they will have no answer for Godsey Navy does stop the run pretty well and Georgia Tech still has not established a good rushing attack ypr in games but they will convert on most of their rd down passes and move the ball even without the benefit of a good rush attack Navy is just ATS as a home underdog of more than points over the years and Georgia Tech should administer another beating today even if they are peeking ahead towards next weeks showdown with Florida State Strong Opinion Fresno St WISCONSIN Fresno State is for real A narrow win at Colorado and a whipping of highly ranked Oregon State have the Bulldogs believing in themselves and Ill call for another upset win this week here in Madison The Bulldogs are led by future NFL quarterback David Carr who has thrown for yards in two games at yards per pass with zero interceptions against two very good defensive backfields Wisconsin has a good secondary as well and they held Oregons Joey Harrington to just yards per pass last week However Carr is better than Harrington and should put up pretty decent numbers again this week after beating one of the nations best secondaries for yards on just tosses last week While Carr gets the press it is the Bulldogs defense that is the key here Fresno State has limited two explosive offensive teams to just total yards per game at ypr and ypp Leading Heisman Trophy candidate Ken Simonton from Oregon State had just yards on carries against the Bulldogs last week and Fresno is quite capable of shutting down Wisconsins rush attack as well The yards per pass that Fresno has allowed is also very good when you consider that Colorado quarterback Ochs and Oregon State quarterback Smith will both average around yards per pass this season Fresno returned all starters to a secondary that yielded just yards per pass last year so there is no question that the Dogs can stop the pass Wisconsins Jim Sorgi has once again done a good job filling in for injured starter Brooks Bollinger and Sorgi is capable of putting up decent numbers in this game However the Badgers are a running team and Fresno will not make it easy to move the ball on the ground Fresnos offense wont have much of a rush attack either but Carr should move the ball through the air well enough to get the Bulldogs into the end zone a few times Fresno has not been a great road team in recent years ATS when not getting at least points but this year but the Bulldogs qualify in a ATS early season indicator that has worked well for me over the years Strong Opinion MIDDLE TENN Troy State Middle Tennessee racked up rushing yards and passing yards in their win at Vanderbilt last week and they should rack up more huge chunks of yardage this week if they can avoid the letdown after their big win over and SEC school The Blue Raiders were just as potent last year on offense and they should have good success against a Troy State defense that was very good by Division AA standards but will be below par in Division A The Troy State offense will be well below average in Division A ball and they dont appear capable of taking full advantage of a soft Middle Tennessee defense that allowed Vanderbilt to roll up yards last week MTS qualifies in a ATS early season momentum situation so I will consider them a strong opinion in this game based on that angle Strong Opinion TCU SMU The Mustangs lost at Louisiana Tech last week but that was a VERY misleading final and gives us plenty of line value on them this week SMUs solid defense held Tech to just total yards but two defensive touchdowns by the Bulldogs and a third TD set up by another Mustangs miscue led to gift points While the defense was as good as expected the offense was horrible SMU was expected to be better offensively this year with returning starters on that side of the ball but the Mustangs averaged a pathetic yards per play against a soft Louisiana Tech defense I do expect a better offensive performance from SMU this year but they will not be good enough to score much against a TCU defense that is playing better than last years outstanding unit TCU opened the season by limiting a powerful Nebraska offense to just points on total yards and then shut down North Texas last week holding them to just yards and a lone field goal TCUs offense has gone from great to poor without star RB Tomlinson and the loss of starting offensive lineman The Horned Frogs were held to total yards by Nebraska which certainly can be forgiven But TCU could tally just total yards against a North Texas defense that is not as good as SMUs stop unit This ought to be a very low scoring game and the points look worth taking Strong Opinion GEORGIA South Carolina Last year I pegged South Carolina to upset Georgia as a point home underdog a week after the Gamecocks broke a game losing streak A win ensued and I rode the Lou Holtz team to a number of Best Bet wins as they remained underrated all season long Last week I used South Carolina as a Star Best Bet and missed extra points one kicking and one twopointer attempt and a late Boise touchdown cost me the win in that game Now it looks like all the value in taking South Carolina has ended as they went from an opening point underdog in this game to a point favorite despite numerous injuries My ratings show that Georgia by is exactly what the line should be and Im favoring Georgia to win by even more due to those Carolina injuries and a ATS home momentum situation favoring Georgia in this game These two teams are eerily similar on both sides of the ball with South Carolina being a better running team and Georgia perhaps a better passing team with young David Greene completing of passes for yards in his debut rewarding coach Richts choice to start him over the more experienced Cory Phillips Defensively both teams are very good defending the run and extremely good against the pass South Carolina is no longer a pointspread value so I will side with a vengeful Georgia team in a good situation Also the Gamecocks were straight up on the road against good teams last year losing at Alabama Florida and Clemson They also barely beat a weak Kentucky team on the road last year The fact that Bulldogs QB Greene is so inexperienced is the only reason Im not taking Georgia as a Best Bet in this game Strong Opinion ARIZONA ST San Diego St The Sun Devils new offense will get a stiff test against a veteran San Diego State defense that held Arizona to just total yards last week The Aztecs are very good defending both the run and the pass and I expect Arizona State to be just average offensively across the board this year at least until they get comfortable with the new offense San Diego States offense had the unenviable task of dealing with a dominating Arizona defense and they could manage just yards and points in their loss to the Wildcats San Diego State doesnt have much of a running attack but quarterback Lon Sheriff averaged yards per pass last year and returns his entire offense with him this year Sheriff should put up pretty decent numbers against a good but not great ASU secondary and the running game could contribute for once since the Devils should be just average defending the run Its tough to know exactly how the Sun Devils will perform in new coach Koettners offense but I do know that San Diego State has a great defense and taking points with them looks like a solid play especially after their disappointing loss to Arizona in which the Wildcats returned a fumble for a touchdown San Diego State has returning starters and teams with an abundance of veteran starters usually bounce back from a subpar opening game performance especially in the underdog role Strong Opinion VIRGINIA TECH Western Mich The Hokies are now without their two biggest offensive weapons from a year ago draft pick QB Michael Vick and future NFL draft pick RB Lee Suggs who was injured last week and is out for the season Hokies fans need not panic Grant Noel did an excellent job in his first start last week completing of passes for yards and touchdowns and appears to be a lot more accurate than Vick was last year I also dont think the rushing attack will drop off much with Keith Burnell getting the load of the work Burnell is just as fast as Suggs and has averaged nearly yards per carry in his carries the last two seasons including for yards last week Virginia Tech averaged yards per rush last year with Vick and Suggs as their top two rushers Aside from those two the rest of the Hokies backs averaged ypr so the rush attack will still be good this season Western Michigan will put up some resistance as they are a very good defensive team The Broncos allowed just ypr and ypp last year and performed well outside of the MAC limiting Wisconsin and Iowa to an average of points they also allowed just points to Toledo Western Michigan will be just as tough defensively this year although not quite as good against the rush with the loss of two outstanding linebackers the secondary will be better though My ratings still forecast points for the Hokies as they should run for over yards per rush and throw for close to yards per pass Western Michigans offense returns QB Jeff Welsh ypp last year but only other offensive starters return and Welsh will not have a running attack to support him in this game Virginia Tech also has one of the nations top secondaries and I dont see Welsh doing too much damage in the air The line has been adjusted down due to the injury to Suggs but I dont see that as being too much of a factor so I will use the line value and lean with the Hokies who are ATS at home when not laying points or more The Under is worth a look here Strong Opinion Tennessee ARKANSAS This is a lot of points to be giving in what should be a game dominated by the defenses The Vols looked impressive on the scoreboard in last weeks win over Syracuse but Tennessees offense struggled against a solid Syracuse stop unit The Volunteers ran the ball better than I expected last week yards at ypr but they had trouble throwing into a good Syracuse secondary and Clausen completed just over of his passes for an average of just yards per pass I expect Tennessee to be able to run the ball pretty well again this week against a mediocre Arkansas defensive front that allowed UNLV to rush for yards at ypr However Clausens difficulties should continue as well against a Hogs secondary that is among the very best in the nation Arkansas allowed just yards per pass last season against good competition and return all starters to their secondary Last week the Razorbacks limited UNLVs star quarterback Jason Thomas to of passing for just aerial yards with interceptions Thomas averaged ypp last year and over yards per pass against Arkansas in Vegas Bowl last December Tennessee will not be able to move the ball consistently without a good pass attack and I dont see them scoring much more than points if that Tennessee is also very good defensively and the defend both the run and pass equally well Stopping the run is the key for the Vols in this game since Arkansas only has one quarterback that can throw and he is unable to play Last year Robbie Hampton got most of the playing time despite some nagging injuries and he averaged just yards per pass The other quarterbacks combined to average a pathetic yards per pass in attempts while tossing interceptions Last week with Hampton not available Zak Clark and Ryan Sorahan combined to go of passing for just yards ypp Without a pass attack it will be up to talented backs Talley and Cobbs to carry the offense However Tennessee allowed just ypr last season and appears to be even better this year holding a pretty good Syracuse rush attack to just yards per rush last week The Arkansas backs combined for just yards on carries last week against a UNLV defense that stacked the line to stop the run knowing that Arkansas could not beat them in the air Tennessee can do the same thing today and the Razorbacks will have trouble scoring Id stay away from the side in this one but the UNDER looks appealing Your subsciption to this package ends on Jan

mailtoIMCEANOTESDrEBobSportsCfootballdrbobsportsEcomE NRONcom Sent Thursday September AM To Wilson Derek Subject College Football Best Bets Dear Member I had a rare losing week in College Football as the Best Bets were just my worst week in more than years I havent been games below any week since I am now for the season on the College Best Bets but of the losses have been by less than points and I expect those close games to even out I have Best Bets this week one Star and three Stars and I also list Strong Opinions below including the Thursday Night ESPN game Remember I only play the Best Bets but Strong Opinions have won more than they have lost over the years Good Luck this week Star Selection MARYLAND West Virginia Ralph Friedgen has turned around the Terps and has them headed for a bowl game after a start That start is no mirage as Maryland has plenty of talent and has posted solid wins of over a good North Carolina team and win on the road against a solid Wake Forest team last week Marylands offense is averaging a robust true rushing yards per game at yards per rushing play without sacks and true passing yards at yards per pass play with sacks included They will have no trouble today moving the ball on a West Virginia defense that yields yards per rush play and allowed lowly Kent State to compile true rushing yards at yprp on them last week West Virginia does defend the pass well and I dont expect much of a contribution from Maryland quarterback Hill in this game However all Hill will have to do is hand the ball off and Maryland will be able to move down the field The Terrapins defense will make it tough for a sluggish West Virginia offense to keep up The Mountaineers average just yards per rushing play and a decent yards per pass play yprp and yppp are the national averages but they have put up those numbers against teams that combine to allow an average of yprp and yppp on defense In other words the Mounties have put up mediocre offensive numbers against teams that have allowed other offenses to move at will Marylands defense has allowed only yprp and yppp against teams not known for their offense NC E Mich and WF but and average defense would hold those teams an average of about yprp and yppp Thus Marylands defense has performed better than average thus far and will have no problem limiting West Virginias offense in this game West Virginia was blown out at Boston College and they are just ATS on the road since the last few years Maryland qualifies in a ATS statistical indicator that has been money in the bank for me over the years This is a solid Star Best Bet Star Selection BOSTON COLLEGE Army Boston College could have beaten Navy by more than the but after leading after quarters coach Tom OBrien a former coach at Navy may have eased up a bit rather than embarrass the Middies on their home turf on an emotional day The Eagles still ended up tallying rushing yards at ypr and pass yards at ypp against a poor Navy defense Armys defense is also bad and I doubt that they will be shown much mercy here at Alumni Stadium where the Eagles have covered the spread consecutive times The BC offense will have another huge day against an Army defense that allowed total yards per game last season and is surrendering total yards per game this year Boston College averaged yards per rush last year and theyre rushing for yards per game at an even better ypr this season Superstar back William Green will have another huge game against a Cadets defense that has allowed ypr last season and has yielded ypr this season to Cincinnati and UAB teams that combine to average just ypr on offense Quarterback Brian St Pierre struggled in the first games of the season against the good pass defenses of West Virginia and Stanford but he blossomed last week against a soft Navy defense or for yards and will have comparable success this week against an Army secondary that allowed yards per pass last year and has allowed completions for ypp this season The Army offense is better this season but Boston College has a solid defensive unit that has allowed an average of just yards per play against a schedule of teams that has averaged yards per play on offense Army has averaged just total yards in their games while tossing interceptions Boston College gave up a few big pass plays to Navy but they allowed just yards per pass last season and should be just as good this year Army lost at UAB last week and this should be another beating My ratings math system predicts a win for Boston College in this game and they have shown that they do not let up at home BC is a perfect ATS as a home favorite of more than points in coach OBriens first years winning those games by an average score of while laying an average of points In addition to Boston Colleges strong history at home and my math system also favoring them the Cadets qualify in a negative ATS early season big road underdog situation Army lost at home to BC last year and Ill take the Eagles to administer another whipping to the Cadets todayp bPass if Boston College is favored by more than pointsb Star Selection LSU TENNESSEE In what should be a defensive battle I will gladly take the generous points with a well balanced LSU squad that runs and throws well on offense while defending the run and pass well on defense Tennessee does all of those things well also but the Tigers qualify in a ATS early season indicator if they are getting points or more Aside from the angle that applies to LSU the Tigers also can match up with Tennessee LSU is led on offense by mistakefree quarterback Rohan Davey who has averaged yards per pass with just interception in passes since the beginning of last season and guided the Tigers to upsets of Tennessee and Georgia Tech last season I rate the Tigers as just an average rushing team but they are good enough to keep the Vols defense honest Tennessees defense is very good in all areas and they had no trouble shutting down the mediocre Syracuse offense and a bad Arkansas attack unit LSU racked up total yards and scored points against the Vols last year even though Davey was hobbled for most of the second half they scored points in the first half I expect LSU to once again be able to move the ball on Tennessee well enough to stay within the big number Tennessees offense is good both running and throwing but have averaged just ypr and ypp in their first two games against the tough stop units of Syracuse and Arkansas Tennessee will struggle even more offensively in this game against an LSU defense that has allowed just ypr and ypp against two decent offensive teams Tulane and Utah State with much of the damage in those games coming in garbage time after the Tigers had built huge leads Tennesee has been good at home in recent years ATS since but LSU coach Nick Saban is ATS as an underdog going back to his days at Michigan State and my ratings favor the Volunteers by only points in this game LSU also qualifies in a ATS road underdog situation and a ATS early season indicator if they remain and underdog of points or more Ill take the points with an LSU squad that is very good on both sides of the ball Star Selection TCU HOUSTON The Horned Frogs have been great defensively again this year but have really struggled on offense with an inexperience offensive line and without LaDainian Tomlinson TCU is averaging only yards per rushing play this season a far cry from the yprp that they averaged last year I expect the Frogs to have some success running the ball in this game against a Houston defense that has allowed yprp against Rice and Texas Rice and Texas are pretty decent running teams but Houston has allowed more to those teams than an average defense would and I rate the Cougars as below average in that area Houston is about average defending the pass but TCU quarterback Casey Printers is a better than average passer and should put up pretty good numbers in this game While TCUs offense should perk up a bit against a soft Houston defense the Horned Frogs defense will put the clamps on the Cougars offense Houston gained just total yards at home against Rice but somehow managed to collect yards on the road against a very good Texas defense Overall I rate the Houston rush attack as nonexistent and the pass attack better than average with Kelly Robertson blossoming last week with a very good effort although he was horrible against Rice TCU has allowed just yards per rushing play and yards per pass play this season and were very impressive in holding Nebraska to just points in their opener last month TCU gave up points in their surprising home loss to Northwestern State last week but I will consider that an aberration and look for the Frogs to shut down Houstons attack today by dominating the Cougars offensive line and putting pressure on Robertson TCU has registered sacks in just pass plays in their games thats sacks while Houston has allowed sacks in games at a rate of of their pass plays The national average is sacks per game or of all pass plays so you can expect a sack on about of Houstons pass plays in this game With Robertson not having ample time to find his quality receivers the Horned Frogs should come away with a solid victory My ratings favor TCU to win this game by points which is right on the number but the Horned Frogs qualify in a ATS statistical indicator and a ATS subset of that angle also applies That indicator has been VERY good to me in recent years as it is ATS since Ive been on most of those games as Best Bets and have been sorry when I wasnt So Ill take TCU for a Star Best Bet Strong Opinion PITTSBURGH Miami Fla Miami looks like a deserved team right now with an easy win at Penn State and a roasting of Rutgers weeks ago Pittsburgh meanwhile inexplicably lost at home to South Florida as a point favorite I consider that game to be a fluke and expect the Panthers to as good as the team that won games last season The Pitt offense is led by an experienced David Priestly at quarterback who has averaged over yards per pass in over passes in his career Priestly has struggled some this year without injured AllAmerican receiver Antonio Bryant who is listed as probable for his return this game Pitt doesnt have much of a rush attack this year without graduated star Kevan Barlow now with the ers so the Priestly will have to be at his best in this game against a secondary that is among the nations best My ratings project points for Pitt if Bryant plays and points if he does not Miamis offense is also one of the best units in the nation with quarterback Ken Dorsey leading an offense that is averaging pass yards per game at an incredible yards per pass and rushing yards per game at a robust yards per rush Pitts defense did not play as poorly against South Florida as it appears The Panthers did allow total yards in that game but South Florida ran plays Pitt allowed yards per rush and just yards per pass both good numbers With returning starters on that side of the ball I expect the Panthers to be better than last years unit that allowed only yards per rush and yards per pass Last year Pittsburghs defense limited Miami to yards per play almost a full yard per play less than the yards per play that the Hurricanes averaged for the season A in turnover margin led to a misleading loss for Pitt down in Miami and I expect the Panthers to be just as competitive with Miami this year at home Pittsburgh is ATS as a home underdog in recent years and their defense is good enough to slow down Miamis offense a bit while their offense is good enough to score a couple of times especially if Bryant is able to contribute Consider Pittsburgh a Strong Opinion if Byrant plays and a lean if he does not Strong Opinion TEXAS AM Notre Dame The Irish are now with losses to Nebraska and Michigan State and it appears as if they will go after their visit to Kyle Field where the Aggies are ATS the last years and ATS in coach Slocums years at the helm Notre Dame is averaging just yards per play this season and I rate them as just average both running and passing after compensating their statistics for the high level of opposition faced The problem for them here is that an average offense is not good enough to score many points here in College Station against an AM defense that is yielding just yards per play this season after allowing only yards per play last year Texas AM is good defending the run ypr last year and is even better against the pass so I expect the Irish to struggle once again throwing the football against another good secondary The Aggies offense has been mediocre so far but quarterback Mark Farris averaged yards per pass last season and will take advantage of a mediocre Notre Dame secondary that allowed yards per pass last year and ypp in games this season I dont see the Aggies running very well but they will get enough plays through the air to reach the endzone a few times Teams that struggle offensively and lose straight up as a favorite at home have proven to be bad plays on the road the next week so this is not a great situation for the Irish to right their ship Strong Opinion TEXAS Texas Tech Texas is playing below last years high standards despite returning starters on offense and starters on defense The Longhorns are averaging just yards per play on offense while allowing yards per play and theyve done so against a fairly weak schedule Last year by contrast the Horns averaged yards per play on offense and yielded just yards per play against a tough schedule I suspect Texas has been bored by the opposition theyve had to face as they are certainly no worse than they were a year ago They should not have a problem getting up for this conference game against an improved Texas Tech team The Red Raiders were not a very good offensive team last year in the first season in coach Mike Leachs Air Raid offense but quarterback Kingsbury and the rest of the offense appear to be much more comfortable this season as Tech is averaging a solid yards per play Texas had the second best pass defense in the nation last year yards per pass play allowed including sacks and they return of starters from that secondary The Red Raiders were limited to just yards by Texas last year and I expect similar results this season Texas Tech does have a solid defensive unit again this year and they are particularly tough to throw on However Texas will be able to establish their running game against a soft Red Raiders defensive front and quarterback Simms should have plenty of time to throw the football Simms will need to step up his play against this Texas Tech defense and I suspect that he will Texas qualifies in a solid ATS early season indicator and they have been able to outscore their opponents by an average of points per game despite not playing very well If the Horns play up to their potential they will have no problem here and that strong indicator suggests that they will play better than they have thus far Strong Opinion ARIZONA ST San Jose St The Sun Devils took a beating at Stanford against a very good Cardinal squad but they will bounce back here at home against a defenseless Spartans squad Arizona State coach Koettner hails from Boise State where his Broncos were among the highest scoring teams in the nation last year points per Sophomore quarterback Jeff Krohn has picked up the offense very well and the Sun Devils averaged yards per pass play in their first games against two good defensive teams San Diego State and Stanford San Jose State is not a good defensive they are a bad one and ASU will have no trouble scoring points tonight The Spartans are actually not bad defending the run as they have allowed yards per rushing play to USC and Colorado teams that would rush for that average against an average defense San Jose however can not stop the pass as they have surrendered yards per pass play this season against USC and Colorado teams that I project at a combined yards per pass play on offense against an average defense With ASU averaging yppp against two good defensive teams you can imagine how easy it will be for them to throw against the Spartans tonight and the Sun Devils are also a decent running team San Jose State does have a good offense that averaged yards per rushing play and yards per pass play last season and returns starters to that unit The Spartans attack has been slowed by two very good defensive teams in USC and Colorado but they should be able to run the ball against a Sun Devils defense that allowed yprp last year and yprp this season Arizona State does have an excellent secondary so I dont expect Marcus Arroyo to have too much of a positive impact today ASU coach Koettner loves to entertain the home fans and his teams have covered the spread consecutive times at home straight at Boise and a win over San Diego State In Koettners last games as a home favorite his teams have won by an average score of while being favored by an average of points Koettner is also ATS in games following a loss the last years and will be looking for a big win to atone for last weeks loss at Stanford He will get it Your subsciption to this package ends on Feb
