and Legal comments to Catequil Partners LP markup of the ISDA Master This is for internal discussion only and is not to be sent to the counterparty The highlighted issues need further discussion between credit and legal or otherwise need some research Based on the sheer number of comments the counterparty has made I would recommend that after we have discussed andor researched our open issues that I prepare a blackline with those changes we can accept and send it back to the counterparty for their further review After they have had a chance to determine what they want to continue pursuing we can then get on the phone to discuss a more narrowed list of open issues Let me know if this is how you want to proceed Rider A to be discussed between credit and legal Counterparty has agreed to leave definition of Threshold Amount as originally written Rider B and Rider C and the deletion of the phrase resulting surviving or transferee entity is agreed Rider D to be discussed between credit and legal Counterparty has agreed to leave in the Additional Events of Default Paul as agreed to reduce the Net Asset Valuation amount to Paul insists that we retain the full definition of Part he Paul has also agreed to specify an additional Event of Default for EnronIf the credit rating of Enron Corp falls below BBB Rider Dato be discussed between credit and legal Rider E Rider F and Rider G need to be approved by Tax The deletion of Master in the documents to be delivered is correct The changes to the last documents to be delivered section on page should be OK if the documents mentioned are for the correct counterparty We will require an opinion of counsel so we cannot delete the requirement We can delete the requirement of a Letter from Manager unless credit has something they want to include in such letter Counterparty agrees to retain the definition of the Monthly Account Statements set out in the last document to be delivered on page pending their deliver for credit approval of a different form provided by the counterparty Rider H to be discussed between credit and legal Rider I and other comments to Governing Law are accepted We prefer to keep our arbitration clause We prefer to keep Part a This is to the benefit of a party that only buys options or only has an option on its books at the time of an Event of Default Rather than amend Part bg this provision can be removed We will include a representation that both parties qualify as eligible contract participants and eligible commercial entities in lieu of Part bh We will not agree to modify Part bi Rider K is acceptable Rider L is acceptable in lieu of Part cii The deletion of Part d needs to be discussed between credit and legal We have new language we can propose in lieu of Part e We do not agree to remove the last part of Part f This language provides certainty regarding what terms govern a particular transaction It is also in line with the New York Statutes of Fraud We prefer to not change Part g and Rider P is under review The deletion of or deemed designation in Part h is acceptable Rider Q and Rider R need to be discussed between credit and legal The capitalization of setoff is acceptable Rider S is under review All changes to Part j are acceptable Rider U to be discussed between credit and legal We do not agree to delete Part l We do not agree to delete Part n We agree to the change to Part o We agree to add Rider V to the agreement Counterparty has agreed to keep Part pa and b The changes to Part pc appear to be OK The first section of Rider W is accepted The deletion of Part pd needs to be discussed between credit and legal Credit wants to ensure that the definition of Manager is tied to individuals not just a management company The second section of Rider W is not necessary since it is covered in Part f The third section of Rider W is not needed since the issue is covered under Part m The fourth section of Rider W is a credit call The fifth section of Rider W is not relevant since we require arbitration The sixth section of Rider W is under review All of the changes the counterparty requests to Part need to be reviewed in light of Enrons new changes to Part references Credit wants to discuss the counterparty changes on Relevant Price The counterparty wants an explanation of the last paragraph of the schedule We will attempt to draft one Comments to the Credit Support Annex Counterparty agrees to retain our definition of Credit Support Amount Credit is OK with accepting treasuries with a maturity of not more than one year with a valuation percentage The definitions of Independent Amount Threshold Minimum Transfer Amount and rounding are still under discussion and review by credit Rider AA to be discussed between credit and legal Credit and Counterparty have agreed to an AM Notification Time Credit and Legal need to discuss the ramifications of the changes to Specified Condition Credit and Legal need to discuss the changes to the Dispute Resolution section Credit has agreed to modify Paragraph gi relating to Party A to reflect the change to the Additional Event of Default Credit has agreed to modify Paragraph gi relating to Party B to

Becky SpencerHOUECT on AM Brent Hendry PM To Paul RadousCorpEnron cc William S nronXGate Tanya nronXGate Caroline nron Subject Draft Response to Catequil Comments Here is a rough draft of the Credit and Legal comments to Catequil Partners LP markup of the ISDA Master This is for internal discussion only and is not to be sent to the counterparty The highlighted issues need further discussion between credit and legal or otherwise need some research Based on the sheer number of comments the counterparty has made I would recommend that after we have discussed andor researched our open issues that I prepare a blackline with those changes we can accept and send it back to the counterparty for their further review After they have had a chance to determine what they want to continue pursuing we can then get on the phone to discuss a more narrowed list of open issues Let me know if this is how you want to proceed Rider A to be discussed between credit and legal Counterparty has agreed to leave definition of Threshold Amount as originally written Rider B and Rider C and the deletion of the phrase resulting surviving or transferee entity is agreed Rider D to be discussed between credit and legal Counterparty has agreed to leave in the Additional Events of Default Paul as agreed to reduce the Net Asset Valuation amount to Paul insists that we retain the full definition of Part he Paul has also agreed to specify an additional Event of Default for EnronIf the credit rating of Enron Corp falls below BBB Rider Dato be discussed between credit and legal Rider E Rider F and Rider G need to be approved by Tax The deletion of Master in the documents to be delivered is correct The changes to the last documents to be delivered section on page should be OK if the documents mentioned are for the correct counterparty We will require an opinion of counsel so we cannot delete the requirement We can delete the requirement of a Letter from Manager unless credit has something they want to include in such letter Counterparty agrees to retain the definition of the Monthly Account Statements set out in the last document to be delivered on page pending their deliver for credit approval of a different form provided by the counterparty Rider H to be discussed between credit and legal Rider I and other comments to Governing Law are accepted We prefer to keep our arbitration clause We prefer to keep Part a This is to the benefit of a party that only buys options or only has an option on its books at the time of an Event of Default Rather than amend Part bg this provision can be removed We will include a representation that both parties qualify as eligible contract participants and eligible commercial entities in lieu of Part bh We will not agree to modify Part bi Rider K is acceptable Rider L is acceptable in lieu of Part cii The deletion of Part d needs to be discussed between credit and legal We have new language we can propose in lieu of Part e We do not agree to remove the last part of Part f This language provides certainty regarding what terms govern a particular transaction It is also in line with the New York Statutes of Fraud We prefer to not change Part g and Rider P is under review The deletion of or deemed designation in Part h is acceptable Rider Q and Rider R need to be discussed between credit and legal The capitalization of setoff is acceptable Rider S is under review All changes to Part j are acceptable Rider U to be discussed between credit and legal We do not agree to delete Part l We do not agree to delete Part n We agree to the change to Part o We agree to add Rider V to the agreement Counterparty has agreed to keep Part pa and b The changes to Part pc appear to be OK The first section of Rider W is accepted The deletion of Part pd needs to be discussed between credit and legal Credit wants to ensure that the definition of Manager is tied to individuals not just a management company The second section of Rider W is not necessary since it is covered in Part f The third section of Rider W is not needed since the issue is covered under Part m The fourth section of Rider W is a credit call The fifth section of Rider W is not relevant since we require arbitration The sixth section of Rider W is under review All of the changes the counterparty requests to Part need to be reviewed in light of Enrons new changes to Part references Credit wants to discuss the counterparty changes on Relevant Price The counterparty wants an explanation of the last paragraph of the schedule We will attempt to draft one Comments to the Credit Support Annex Counterparty agrees to retain our definition of Credit Support Amount Credit is OK with accepting treasuries with a maturity of not more than one year with a valuation percentage The definitions of Independent Amount Threshold Minimum Transfer Amount and rounding are still under discussion and review by credit Rider AA to be discussed between credit and legal Credit and Counterparty have agreed to an AM Notification Time Credit and Legal need to discuss the ramifications of the changes to Specified Condition Credit and Legal need to discuss the changes to the Dispute Resolution section Credit has agreed to modify Paragraph gi relating to Party A to reflect the change to the Additional Event of Default Credit has agreed to modify Paragraph gi relating to Party B to reflect the change to the Additional Event of Default Credit and Legal need to review the changes to Paragraph gii Counterparty agrees to remove its Rider BB

temporary so we can work around it I agree with you that your f iles are highly confidential and no one should have access unless you so de signate My message was a general one that went out to everyone in the dep artment Its up to each individual to give access or not to whatever th ey would like a temp to use in order to support them in their Assistants a bsence We have set up the temporary IDs as per Mark Haedickes office to give access mainly to calendars only in order to help the temp field phone calls make appointments and to generally let the temp know where everyon e is

Temp IDs Becky Given the nature of what I do no one in my group will be able to provide t hese types of temporary rights to documents or calendar entries I do not believe that any of the other temporary IDs have access to our stuff so I would think that these new IDs would be the same I hope that does not pose a problem but I believe that the confidentiality considerations should outweigh
