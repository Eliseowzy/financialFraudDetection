<26818569.1075859880630.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,scott.sefton@enron.com,1999-01-21 07:35:00,Helsinki Oil TradingTuesday of this week I visited our Helsinki oil trading office Set out below are some general observations There are about people in the office traders logistics people accountingrisk management person and a couple secretaries The office is headed by Ilkka Kokko a fairly young Finn We bought the business in September of last year The basic activity is the purchase of various oil products from Russian refineries the transportation of the products by RTC railroad tank car from the refinery to various Baltic ports the storage of the products at the ports and the loading of the products onto vessels for sale in other markets Many of the vessels are oceangoing because the products are sold in nonEuropean markets The products are normally purchased on a DAF delivered at frontier basis which means that title passes to Enron when the RTC crosses the Russian border As a result Enron must arrange for the transport of the products from the border to the port This is arranged for us by the company that will store the products at the port In other words the contract we have with the terminal operator provides for transportation of the products from the Russian border to the port the unloading from the RTCs into storage storage the unloading from storage into our vessels and all related customs measurement and testing services We have these deals with about different Baltic companies About vessels a month are chartered About product purchases a month are done some of which are term deals up to one year About tonnes a month is purchased Payments and settlements are done from London We pay in dollars The money is almost always paid into accounts outside of Russia Because the business results in a long position the Helsinki office hedges its position by doing deals with Enrons book in London no hedging is done with anyone else The business experienced some earnings volatility late last year had a negative gross margin of in November and a positive gross margin of in December This was largely because the position wasnt effectively hedged Hedging is difficult because the hedges are dirty due to basis and to product differences and because it is difficult to predict the amount of product that will be delivered in any given time period due to transportation bottlenecks and to flexibility in the Russians delivery obligations to us The business historically prepaid for part of the products it purchased The financing was historically arranged through a bank that would require a margin on funds it advanced million deposited with the bank would mean up to million advanced to the Russians The bank also insisted on having recourse against Greenergy the company we acquired for all amounts outstanding Enron has given Ilkka a million limit on our exposure on these prepaid deals Because the bank wants to have recourse against Enron for all amounts outstanding the old method of financing these prepaid deals no longer works given the amount of prepaid financing Ilkka would like to do Ilkka is trying to come up with another financing structure where the banks look solely to the Russians for payment for at least part of the outstanding amount Ilkka is also thinking about buying products from the Russians at the refinery gate This would require Enron to arrange transportation from the refinery not just from the Russian border under the current DAF deals Ilkka thinks this will help him control the deliveries more and as a result facilitate his hedging program Ilkka is also looking at buying some terminal assets in Estonia The London corporate development team is looking at this Ilkka confirmed to me that he has never paid any bribes in connection with the business even before the acquisition by Enron and that he understands the FCPA restrictions Robert Quick has made about three visits to the office and is working on a variety of issues related to this business Robert please correct me if Ive made any errors or add something if Ive left it out Thanks

Finance legal will be your contact person on everything other than the swap Mark Taylor or his designee will handle the swap We will rely heavily on Ron Astin and Trena Chandler of VE to assist us on the Whitewing issues In case you didnt know Ron and Trena represented us in the creation of Whitewing and its holding company Condor and have been involved in all the subsequent CondorWhitewing transactions Because Jeff Eldredge has a significant role in Margaux I hope having VE involved here and in London will facilitate coordination on these issues Cheers Scott Mark Evans AM To Scott CT cc Stuart CT Subject MargauxWhitewing Scott in Cynthias absence can you allocate someone else from your group to oversee this As you can see we are in need of some immediate assistance on Whitewing Did you get the chance to speak to Mike Jakubik about Margaux Can you help out with Houston coordination or shall I just get on with it with Mark Taylor and Jeff Hodge Thanks Mark Forwarded by Mark EvansLONECT on Stuart Schardin To Ben F GlisanHOUECT cc Donette CT Anne CT Mark CT Maroun J CT Subject MargauxWhitewing RonTrinaBen I wanted to touch base with you on some Margauxrelated issues for Whitewing and determine what the appropriate course of action is As a brief description of the Margaux transaction in case you have not been updated recently the Margaux transaction will now occur through the synthetic transfer of risk to the NoteholdersMargaux equity The method by which this occurs is as follows Whitewing continues to hold the equity interests in the assets excluding of Trakya ETOL approx of Sutton Bridge of Nowa Sarzyna and approx of Teesside all of which are held by Enron Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with ENA with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things happen at the various projects thereby transferring certain of the risks of the projects through the floating leg Concurrently Margaux the Issuer raises approx mm of capital and through a wholllyowned subsidiary purchases the floating leg receiveable from Whitewing for MM In other words Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its receiveable to Margaux The net result is that Whitewing receives cash proceeds up front and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA and ENA has a floating payment obligation to Margaux Ive attached a structure diagram below With this in mind the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution see attached note from Donette Dewar below My question is how do we achieve this result First is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself or does it need to occur at a subsidiary level In other words does the swap fall under the definition of Indebtedness clause viii perhaps in the Whitewing LP Agreement which is prohibited at the Whitewing level If it cannot is SE Acquisition the best candidate to be ENAs counterparty or do we run into issues with the Natwest facility although theyd likely consent since they will get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction Once the issue of who is the appropriate counterparty has been determined we need to discuss the mechanics by which we effect the transaction If we are indeed going to open up the Whitewing LP Agreement I suspect that AnnMarie will need to revisit the Allocation and Distribution sections which is probably no easy task If not and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level we need to determine where Also Im sure this transaction will require Certificateholder approval as it is in excess of the mm threshold A final logistical issue that Donette raises in her note is who will be responsible for the legal work required at the Whitewing level More generally are there any other legal or other issues that you see with respect to this transaction from a Whitewing

SeftonLONECT Subject Internet Trading Dear Justin We refer to our meeting with you and the rest of the project team of July and our subsequent phone call of July We thought it may be useful for us to set out in writing our advice in relation to a number of the issues that we discussed at the above meeting and conference call On that basis please find below the following advice on the following issues Legal and Privacy Statement We believe that the Legal and Privacy statement should be available on the first entry page for the Enron website and on each of the main trading pages in the same form and style as the other navigational links The Legal and Privacy statement contains important legal protections for Enron that we think should be displayed at the earliest opportunity and in a prominent fashion The more prominent the display the easier it will be for Enron to argue that a user of the website was aware of this statement and therefore that it is binding on them Bid Box When a trader clicks on a bid or offer price in the trading section of the website a bid box appears It is important that this box contains wording that indicates that at the underlying legal level the trader is making an offer that Enron is free to accept or reject On that basis we recommend that the main wording in the bid box be I want to buy quantity or I want to sell quantity Availability of PA and ETA There is little case law to guide us as to the best approach for ensuring that agreements formed online are sufficiently executed to be enforced by courts in England To improve Enrons argument that the ETA has been sufficiently executed and agreed to by the counterparty we advise that the ETA be available for viewing and printing at all times through a hotlink in the trading section of the website This will assist our argument that the ETA is incorporated by reference when a counterparty signs the PA If for some reason for example the ETA is not available at the time of signing the PA the direct incorporation of the ETA argument fails the hotlink to the ETA may help to establish a course of dealing argument That is an argument that over time the counterparty has been trading on the same terms and conditions for each trade and has therefore affirmed its initial acceptance of those terms and conditions Registration Forms We look forward to an opportunity to review the online registration form for new customers We also look forward to reviewing the online registration form for view only users of the website Prior to our review of the view only registration form can you please confirm whether or not Enron will be vetting view only applications If view only users are issued passwords automatically without a confirmation of identity or other verification or clearance by Enron then we should discuss the possible risks and legal issues that may arise Master Agreements We understand that Enron is internally discussing the relationship between Master Agreement NBP terms and NBP side letters The conclusion of these discussion may require an amendment to the ETA in particular clause a Changes to the GTCs and ETA It is clear from an English law perspective and the bulk of overseas jurisdictions consulted by us that an change to the GTCs or ETA will require the counterparty to accept the change by executing a new version of the agreement Three issues have arisen in implementing this process a Marking up Changes From a legal as well as a public relations perspective it is preferable that amended agreements contain a process for indicating what changes have been made This process could take the form of a list of changes or double underline or other markup procedure Changes should be indicated against the previous version All versions should be dated Similarly the ticker tape screen should indicate that there is a new version until that new version is accepted That said this position is advisable only if Enron can be certain that all changes to amended agreements are identified If amended agreements are presented for execution that are improperly markedup or do not markup certain changes then Enron would have a lesser chance of enforcing these unmarked changes than if no markingup was shown Therefore this process is advisable only if Enron can ensure that all changes are identified b Notice of changes We have previously discussed with you what procedure should be adopted by Enron to notify counterparties of the change in the ETA or GTCs To improve any argument that a counterparty has freely consented to an amended agreement we would advise that Enron adopt a procedure for notifying counterparties of the altered agreements in advance of them taking effect This notice should not be a contractual obligation rather an internal Enron procedure That said we understand from our meeting that there may be emergency situations requiring an immediate change to an agreement with the result that trading is suspended under the old agreement If those circumstances are likely to be the bulk of cases when amendments are to be made then the notice process may not necessarily be appropriate If notice is not given then Enron would be relying on the following elements as asserting that a counterparty freely accepted the amended agreement i that the counterparty was prompted that the agreement had been amended and if markups are provided that the changes were indicated and ii that the counterparty is a professional organisation with experience in the speed and pace of the commodities trading industry These elements are not conclusive but would give Enron an argument that the counterparty is bound to any accepted amended agreement c Overseas Counsel Advice from overseas counsel on amendment of the ETA and GTCs did not specify that Enron would not be giving the counterparty a period of notice of changes to the agreements during which the counterparty could continue to trade Therefore if it is ultimately decided that no notice period will be used then we may need to seek further advice from overseas counsel ETA Termination Under your recent instructions we have amended the ETA so that it can only be terminated for convenience by Enron That is there is no express termination for convenience right for a counterparty We have previously noted that this means that an ETA may continue to be in force with a counterparty that has ceased to trade or wishes to cease trading with Enron Advice from overseas counsel on the drafting of the ETA and GTCs was sought based on a reciprocal right to terminate with notice We will seek further advice from overseas counsel on this issue Website Text Review We look forward to an opportunity to review the text and layout of the website to assess the final impact of the layout and text on the contractual obligations formed using the website Data Protection Since our meetings and conference call we have discussed further our recent advice to you on data protection We are currently seeking the further advice of overseas counsel of this issue and will provide further advice to you shortly German digital signatures Further advice is being sought from German counsel We will provide you with a response on this issue shortly We hope the above provides a useful summary of our advice on a number of issues Please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss any

Finance legal will be your contact person on everything other than the swap Mark Taylor or his designee will handle the swap We will rely heavily on Ron Astin and Trena Chandler of VE to assist us on the Whitewing issues In case you didnt know Ron and Trena represented us in the creation of Whitewing and its holding company Condor and have been involved in all the subsequent CondorWhitewing transactions Because Jeff Eldredge has a significant role in Margaux I hope having VE involved here and in London will facilitate coordination on these issues Cheers Scott Mark Evans AM To Scott CT cc Stuart CT Subject MargauxWhitewing Scott in Cynthias absence can you allocate someone else from your group to oversee this As you can see we are in need of some immediate assistance on Whitewing Did you get the chance to speak to Mike Jakubik about Margaux Can you help out with Houston coordination or shall I just get on with it with Mark Taylor and Jeff Hodge Thanks Mark Forwarded by Mark EvansLONECT on Stuart Schardin To Ben F GlisanHOUECT cc Donette CT Anne CT Mark CT Maroun J CT Subject MargauxWhitewing RonTrinaBen I wanted to touch base with you on some Margauxrelated issues for Whitewing and determine what the appropriate course of action is As a brief description of the Margaux transaction in case you have not been updated recently the Margaux transaction will now occur through the synthetic transfer of risk to the NoteholdersMargaux equity The method by which this occurs is as follows Whitewing continues to hold the equity interests in the assets excluding of Trakya ETOL approx of Sutton Bridge of Nowa Sarzyna and approx of Teesside all of which are held by Enron Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with ENA with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things happen at the various projects thereby transferring certain of the risks of the projects through the floating leg Concurrently Margaux the Issuer raises approx mm of capital and through a wholllyowned subsidiary purchases the floating leg receiveable from Whitewing for MM In other words Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its receiveable to Margaux The net result is that Whitewing receives cash proceeds up front and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA and ENA has a floating payment obligation to Margaux Ive attached a structure diagram below With this in mind the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution see attached note from Donette Dewar below My question is how do we achieve this result First is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself or does it need to occur at a subsidiary level In other words does the swap fall under the definition of Indebtedness clause viii perhaps in the Whitewing LP Agreement which is prohibited at the Whitewing level If it cannot is SE Acquisition the best candidate to be ENAs counterparty or do we run into issues with the Natwest facility although theyd likely consent since they will get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction Once the issue of who is the appropriate counterparty has been determined we need to discuss the mechanics by which we effect the transaction If we are indeed going to open up the Whitewing LP Agreement I suspect that AnnMarie will need to revisit the Allocation and Distribution sections which is probably no easy task If not and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level we need to determine where Also Im sure this transaction will require Certificateholder approval as it is in excess of the mm threshold A final logistical issue that Donette raises in her note is who will be responsible for the legal work required at the Whitewing level More generally are there any other legal or other issues that you see with respect to this transaction from a Whitewing perspective If youd like to discuss the transaction further please let me know Ill be in Houston the early part of next week so perhaps we can spend some time discussing these issues then Thanks and I
