working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically I will let you know the time line soon I have a question What does the Wood report mean See you Anne Original Message From Grigsby Mike Sent Tuesday September PM To Bike Anne Subject RE Palo Alto historical loads Disregard attachments How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal i will never understand is it just me Also i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies By the way you are doing a great job It seems like your group is getting their books run early Also have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about PL andor positions Just a reminder You may want to talk to them about confidentiality You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy Right Original Message From Bike Anne Sent Tue PM To
