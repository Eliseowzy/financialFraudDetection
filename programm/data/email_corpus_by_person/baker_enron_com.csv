<32473345.1075858461459.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,baker@enron.com,2001-05-22 16:20:25,RE Pricing of restriction on Enron stock Cc I just spoke with Rakesh I believe that there is some confusion regarding which part of that Raptor transaction we are talking about There are actually two different sets of forwards one for up to MM shares contingently based on price as an offset to the Whitewing forward shortfall and the other was for MM shares which was more of a straight restricted forward contract on ENE shares We all went over the valuations on both sets of forwards pretty thoroughly back in March and Im certain that the valuations that were put together included the contingent nature of the forwards on the MM shares In fact I believe that we had a meeting with a couple of managers from Arthur Andersen to discuss the general methodology Of course the valuations on the MM shares had no such component Let me know if you have more questions or concerns Thanks Vince Ron Original Message From Kaminski Vince J Sent Tuesday May PM To Baker Ron Cc Bharati Rakesh Kaminski Vince J Subject Pricing of restriction on Enron stock Ron Rakesh mentioned that there is an additional conditionality that will result in an adjustment of our valuation of the restrictions imposed on the forwards going into the Raptor vehicles We were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project We can however easily incorporate it in our valuation model This omission makes our valuation more conservative form the Enrons point of view Please let us know if this is required Vince
