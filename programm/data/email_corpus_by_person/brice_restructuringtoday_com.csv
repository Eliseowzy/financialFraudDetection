team This FERC isnt like any FERC youve known or worked with recently If you dont like markets heres the very bad news This FERC is all about markets and everything we do is going to be guided by that Nora Mead Brownell reminded She intends being a one term five years member who has her work cut out for her building market infrastructure Not retrenching and not recreating we are going to be defining and directing and collaborating to transform ourselves as we make the markets work creating policies that make markets work Look for some very specific business planning and strategy so there will be no doubt about whats coming It wont be the surprise of the hour or I dont know what that FERC is all about What does she think of the MORC room the market observation resource center at FERC where five people can watch transactions and prices real time Its a good first step but it needs further development she replied The agency needs people whove worked in markets and have real world experience on energy trading floors Brownell noted Brownell is not much for rulemaking but early on youve got to set the guideposts especially where the power of the incumbent is very very strong If you dont have any rules in place you cant find anybody guilty she noted cause theres no crime Its been noticed that the marketbased rates were not conditioned on certain behavior such as If you engage in the following behavior its a nono There may have been behavior in the market of which you and I would disapprove but if its not in the Ten Commandments its hard to take somebody out to the woodshed Meanwhile we expect the White House to give FERC a fifth member who will provide a marketoriented vote Is there any doubt in Brownells mind Not in mine President Bush has been very very clear about his philosophy on markets for a long time she said Brownell is excited about the opportunity the new commission has to make a difference We better make a difference For her the issues are bigger than jurisdiction and even markets Whats at stake in her mind is creating an economic environment in which people invest in infrastructure If we dont really begin to take advantage of that opportunity theres going to be an enormous price to pay We saw it in the West and were about to see it in lots of other places Its what drove me to feel so strongly about those RTOs I know thats complicated and we have work to do but when I see unnecessary costs in the price of electricity I know what happens to the end user the small businessman the big users and the retail customers on limited income If we can solve the problem and we can focus on the problem the jurisdiction answers will come or theyll be so clear that it will be unavoidable Rather than start with whos going to do what we should start with what do we need to do to build the backbone for this country to continue to grow she explained Its her goal to recast the debate on what this is all about Her view is that its about economic development plain and simple How about making progress in bringing market forces to bear on transmission costs Maybe an auction of capacity as with gas capacity Brownell wants to know more about the proposal before expressing a view Without RTOs and transparency in the market shes skeptical that that can happen How can you bring market forces into transmission we asked She sees RTOs fostering market forces to bear because the market will have confidence that there will be equity and opportunity Until we resolve the issue of access and structural management no capital will flow For her the capital flow is the proof that a market is working Those two issues if unresolved prevent innovation she added Brownell cited congestion pricing that rewards congestion if you happen to be the guy who owns the line thats creating it Brownell explained having the opposite effect The massive structural changes that cause some consternation in the community are whats necessary She doesnt want to wake up two years from now and realize either weve totally destroyed the markets and therefore totally put our countrys development back five years because we have no investment and no plants and no real reliability oversight nor do I want to create a system in which we have unregulated monopolies as in the telecom industry You saw that wonderful burst of new technologies and the long distance prices dropping that no one ever imagined Brownell expects that kind of technological explosion in energy but we havent seen it yet When a market really drives the energy field she predicted fuel cells that work in a short period of time or well see new things Those who believe the old system works just fine win no brownie points with Brownell It wasnt supporting growth It wasnt terribly efficient I didnt notice a lot of innovation Frankly I dont miss my old black rotary phone Im not going to miss my clunky year old plant Id like to have distributed generation right at my back door And then it became more and more clear that the telecom market was not working to everyones advantage was not equitable and you had this meltdown and you now have unregulated monopolies In electricity that would be a tragedy and the cost would be even greater than with regulated ones she said What kind of changes would Brownell like to see at FERC New ways of problem solving Markets do not wait months or months while you go through the ritualized process Not just with FERC but anybody that has to observe due process But when the Pennsylvania PUC implemented the retail power marketing stakeholder from the marketers the incumbent operations people not lawyers ran into problems daily The PUC created a team under Kevin Cadden whos joined FERC as external affairs director The Cadden team met three times a week in the first couple of weeks to deal with problems of multiple scheduling coordinators and Cadden had the authority to make decisions at the meetings Where there was a huge policy impact he would go to commissioners for notational voting That meant that stakeholders couldnt go commissioner shopping a big sport in Pennsylvania people got real serious about it and they solved the problems Brownell wants to see that methodology in Washington We need to find ways to build up the trust here The best thing in the world that could have happened in the California situation or the western mitigation is for all those people to get in a room and settle Brownell advised Her fear is that FERC will make a decision and it will be litigated for five years leaving everyone the agency the companies and the customers exposed to the vicissitudes of the courts We noted that its been about five years in New Hampshire from enactment to implementation Brownell favors nontraditional ways of solving problems the use of swat teams of people starting with say real smart state commissioners to get in a room to come up with options to prevent congestion pricing for example and then well have an open hearing and talk about it Brownell is a big supporter of Chairman Pat Woods operational switch away from the method of recent FERC leaders whereby members staffs carry around notes and ideas from commissioner to commissioner until an accord is struck Then the decision is presented as a done deal with writteninadvance speeches read at voting The commission in effect says here is the right answer Brownell claims Woods plan is to have open debate Its a great idea Brownell said It encourages our staffs to think in a safe environment instead of just being told what the answer is FERC members have talented staffers who need to be encouraged to come up with and get out imaginative solutions she observed The open debate lets us signal to people how were thinking and where were going Were talking at meetings because we want ideas We want to explore all the options and not come in and say here is the right answer There are probably right answers Brownell reminded Many sacrifices so far On a personal note leaving Pennsylvania when she did Brownell lost a newly enacted pension for state government employees Had she hung on three more weeks she would have gotten a pension but the urgency of big votes on California and the RTOs was such that she thought it wrong to sit around in Harrisburg waiting for the money The last thing I wanted was to have the lights go out in California and have me sitting there in Harrisburg she observed While the FERC pay of is greater than the PUCs the cost of living in the Nations Capitol is much much higher The PUC provides a car and doesnt charge commissioners monthly parking Brownell bought a home on Capitol Hill and will be able to walk in good weather but will still have to pay the monthly parking The is part two of a two part series
