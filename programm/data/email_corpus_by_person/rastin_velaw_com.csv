Fastow The finance chief who was replaced Wednesday came under scrutiny as the executive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour saddling Enron with a billion charge to equity As details of this deal and marketsdetoxhtml others have emerged over the past two weeks Enron stock has collapsed falling in just seven days tsccgif jumpthestreetcommarketsabriemktsdetoxpti leszxord border height width tsccgif Wednesday the stock fell a further on enormous volume signifying that oncefaithful mutual fund holders were bailing Also Wednesday a raft of oncefriendly analysts downgraded the stock Faced with betrayal on that scale Enron management at last felt compelled to act a press release says Fastow is taking a leave of absence Hes been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon formerly CEO of Enrons industrial markets group How might the Enron bulls spin this Likely they will point to McMahons alleged opposition to Fastows role in the big hedging deal called LJM to show that the Fastow era is over The Wall Street Journal citing anonymous sources reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained about Fastows possible conflict of interest Probably the fear was that Fastow couldnt serve Enron and LJM equally especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from LJM Clearly if McMahon turns out to be a new broom thats a positive for Enron An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journals account of McMahons stance on LJM was correct Plunging Investors not liking Enron here marketsdetoxgif Not much else is encouraging however Fastows departure shows that it took massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action On a difficult marketsdetoxhtml conference call Tuesday CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding backing It took Wednesdays plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO In other words Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers How much further does the stock have to fall to bring further muchneeded reforms at the company The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastows replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery People got upset by one shadowy deal but no one knows exactly how the companys core energy trading business makes money Its hard to believe the LJM deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board In fact the chatter is that Fastow and Skilling proposed the LJM transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business The board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM as a way to hedge that volatility away This meant LJM entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from the downside Should the whole board be on the hook too The spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the LJM transaction if it had not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the markets views Arguably thats downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish shortterm financing Letting things get this bad has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers It shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until theyre unavoidable The spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated but is it any wonder people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management Know any companies that the market may be misvaluing Detox would like to hear about them

Currencies imagesmiscspacergif imagesmiscspacergif imagesmiscspacergif W imagesdropcapwgif hat really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen Wall Street has been puzzling over that since Enron newsquote redirectmarketwatchredirectctxMW arketwatchcomcustomnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbENE released its quarterly earnings a week ago Yesterday shares in Enron plunged to after the company said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions The reaction was in some ways puzzling Given the questions that have been raised since the earnings announcement some of them prominently featured in The Wall Street Journal it was likely that the SEC would begin a preliminary inquiry Whether it will go farther than that is not clear but if nothing else the slide in Enron shares over the last week shows the hazards that can confront a company that allows word of a major reduction in its balance sheet value to dribble out Enrons shares rose cents to last Tuesday as investors first reacted to the earnings announcement But since then they have fallen or percent The billion reduction in shareholders equity was not mentioned in a news release Enron issued on its quarterly earnings last Tuesday It was briefly mentioned in a conference call with analysts but many of the listeners seem to have not noticed that wrongly thinking Kenneth L Lay Enrons chairman and chief executive was referring to a billion writeoff that was disclosed in the earnings release When questions were asked in the following days the explanations were less than thorough Enron explained that the reduction in shareholders equity was related to the termination of structured finance vehicles involving partnerships that had been controlled by the companys chief financial officer Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more clarity about how the company goes about its business said Ralph Pellecchia a credit analyst at Fitch Investors Service He added that the issue of the companys credibility related to this transaction really seems to have a life of its own Enron declined yesterday to allow any officials to be interviewed about its financial reports But last night it said Mr Lay would hold another conference call with investors at am today The companys earlier disclosures regarding the partnerships baffled many analysts They referred to such things as share settled costless collar arrangements and derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts The disclosures said the company entered into the transactions to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them even though the underlying assets included investments that declined in value The Wall Street Journal citing reports the partnerships made to institutional investors has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash distributions to their investors Enron officials in recent days have refused to discuss the arrangements in any detail One of the questions that the SEC may look into is whether the termination of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earnings An SEC spokesman declined to comment Under accounting rules a companys transactions in its own shares cannot produce profits or losses whatever the effect on cash flow So a company that sells its shares for each and buys them back at or at will report no earnings effect Enron said that the reduction to shareholders equity and a related reduction in notes receivable is the result of Enrons termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods Stephen Moore an analyst with Moodys Investors Service who has put Enrons debt on review for a possible downgrade said that while some of the details were not clear Essentially Enrons promise was that a certain amount of Enrons shares would be worth billion The shares plummeted and they were not worth that much Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings which leaves out some expenses and directs attention away from its balance sheet which is disclosed only in SEC filings not in the earnings news release The reduction in shareholders equity would be shown only on the thirdquarter balance sheet which has yet to be released Earlier this year Jeffrey Skilling then Enrons chief executive reacted strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to provide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released He called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners Mr Skilling later resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr Lay the chairman and former chief executive took back the latter title While Enron was riding high its often difficulttounderstand reports were generally seen as not being a problem The company appeared to be the dominant force in the business of energy trading and to be able to produce phenomenal profits When Mr Lay was reported as having played an important role in formulating the Bush administrations energy policies the aura was only enhanced In January the shares traded for But now with some of the companys ventures clearly having run into problems it appears that investors are growing less willing to accept the companys reports That the partnership transactions were disclosed at all was because of the involvement of the chief financial officer and some have wondered if there might have been similar deals with others Mr Lay has promised to make the companys financial reports easier to understand and last weeks report was at first praised by some analysts for doing just that In a news release yesterday Mr Lay said the company welcomed the SECs request for information We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest he said Home Back pagesbusinessindexhtml to Business Search search Help subscribehelp Back to Top
