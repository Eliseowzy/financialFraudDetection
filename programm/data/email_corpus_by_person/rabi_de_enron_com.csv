<20798173.1075863405025.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,rabi.de@enron.com,2001-07-15 22:08:41,Revised version of the VAR paperAll You will find attached the revised paper Most of the changes are cosmetic editorial in nature except for the following Tanya please check material changes The CPU time for SORM grows with n nn and not with n I rewrote Appendix I corrected two equations to make the calculated Hermite coefficients and the expression for the binnormal density function consistent with the definition of the Hermite polynomials used in this work which have variances equal to n for the nth order polynomial Also I changed many symbols in Appendix I to harmonize and especially to avoid using alpha and beta which have special meanings in FORMSORM literature I will post the version in the O drive tomorrow Regards Rabi De
