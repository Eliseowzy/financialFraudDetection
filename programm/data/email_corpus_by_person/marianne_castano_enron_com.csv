clarified some issues for me regar ding the DASRing of customers in California Unfortunately it wasnt what we wanted to hear On the easy side of things all residential customers PGE SCE SDGE wer e turned back to the utilities starting May th DASRs were submitted and they are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles etc These customers received a letter letting them know about it On the commercial side of things Diann had no distinctions between small c ommercial large commercial industrial customers SDGE customers have been ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed In PGE SCE IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu ously received our product All other PGE SCE customers were originally submitted for DASRing back to the utilities on January That prov ides enough issues of its own but Ill get to that PGE did a virtual swi tch so as of Jan all these customers became PGEs again but with SCE w hen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles etc All deDASRed customers were then reDASRed back to us starting June and Di ann indicated that not only all of our old customers were reDASRed but ne w contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS Red to us No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome rs but as we discussed some personal basis notice may have been given to our larger customers through the reps So Im not worried about the residential side well have to send them a n annual historical label next April with perhaps a letter explaining why theyre still receiving info from us As far as the commercialindustrial No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers Bolt on Stacey We or PR should prepare a customer letter as discussed with

we actually delivered The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual and you dont have to show an extra column w the difference if you are win del ta band between projection and actual We can change the projection for t hird quarter and include this information in the customer letter What are the new customers those as being DASRed to us the first time as of June being told they are receiving Are they being marketed BIZM IX Bolton Stacey We should ensure this is not the case with originati on Someone in Jeremy Bs shop will most likely know As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes will we just use those given as the date of submission ie Jan May June as it is impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred Bolto n Stacey We should discuss
