ski resorts I have visited Banff is definitely one of the most beautiful However to call Banff a ski resort is a bit of a misnomer The area is made up of ski areas Lake Louise Sunshine Village and Banff Norquay the mountain hamlet known as Lake Louise and the town of Banff itself Each of these lies within Banff National Park in Alberta Canada This fact is what makes Banff the special place that it is Being in a national park means uncluttered natural scenic beauty It also means you dont have many of the traditional ski resort amenities like sprawling base areas McTaco joints or condos as far as the eye can see much less skiin skiout condos P Instead most lodging is in the town of Banff with a few lodges in Lake Louise including the fabulous Chateau Lake Louise What this means to the skier is a lively social scene in town an array of lodging options and a scenic drive or shuttle to the slopes each day What you wont find are slopeside condos gridlock traffic or mere fleeting patches of nature A ski vacation in Banff is definitely unlike skiing anywhere else Read on to learn more br clearallbr div classtitlebA NAMETHE RESORTS OF BANFFAbdivbr img srcimagesnlLakeLouiseLodgejpg altThe Resorts of Banff border alignright The resorts of Banff offer a variety of skiing options Lake Louise is one of Canadas largest resorts with over acres of terrain For expert terrain this is the place Of course there is plenty of beginner and intermediate terrain as well The highalpine resort Sunshine Village has a European feel Well known for great intermediate terrain Sunshine now boasts some excellent expert terrain on Goats Eye and Lookout Mountains New this year at Sunshine is a modern gondola with increased comfort and capacity With acres Banff Norquay is the feisty little sister of the three Just minutes from the town of Banff Norquay is the closest skiing to Banff This hometown hill is a locals favorite offering something for everyone in the family P In planning a trip to Banff it helps to understand the layout of the area For most visitors the town of Banff is home base From there Norquay is minutes away Sunshine Village minutes and Lake Louise minutes If you prefer your own vehicle the drive is easy on the wellmaintained fourlane highway If you would rather leave the driving to the professionals shuttle service to each of the resorts is included in the price of your lift tickets Shuttles pick up at or near all lodging in the Banff area Either way the drive is so pretty that the time flies by If the drive from Banff really discourages you consider staying at Lake
