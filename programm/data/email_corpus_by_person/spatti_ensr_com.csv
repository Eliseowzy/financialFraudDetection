his numbers but that MMmile for ROW would be extremely steep He said that he has heard about the rumored price Kinder Morgan Sonoran might have to pay said it was pretty astronomical but not near that expensive We still havent spoken directly to eachother just voice mail He said that he was down meeting with Octar last week and will be meeting with Octar again Tuesday in Gallup He acted as though most anyone Im speaking with at Transwestern should know who Octar is I have another call back into him is there anything specific you would like me to ask him He said that most folks at Transwestern should have a pretty good idea of what ROW costs should be on Navajo Ed just called He said that Octar is the Navajo Director of Minerals and that Ed Louis Soldano and Johnny McGee just finished negotiating the renewal of the twin mainlines and the San Juan Lateral through with Octar it was MM He said that they brought up the possibility of a new line with Octar and that he thought it would

Jon Sent Friday September PM To Shafer John Cc Patti Scott Subject RE Agencies and NGOs already contacted for Sun Devil THat is ROW cost he quoted Scott does our Navajo consultant have any experience about what the tribe will ask for on the ROW This cost is not for cult res work As for schedule if we go the informal collaborative approach FERC wont take a year from the time we file but more like months thereby giving them some more time on the back end But to do this requires getting land permits in for federal easements and yes that does require some survey detail j Original Message From

Larry McGee Johnny Subject RE Agencies and NGOs already contacted for Sun Devil To All I have done a cursory review of the requirements of the agencies contacted and significant itmes leap out New Mexico BLM Permitting Cultural Resources David Simmons Archeologist Farmington BLM office quoted Navajo ROW costs usually approximately MMmile THIS COULD MAKE AN UNECONOMICAL PROJECT FROM DAY Longest permit times are year which means that with a tentative schedule as follows FERC Filing Sept to March FERC Approval April April year Construction April Jan mos In order to start construction by April to achieve an in service in early application for specific long lead permits will need to be made April This will require significant field work and design details prior to April I doubt we will be

Region a couple of different times today It turns out that what they really were expecting to see was something more like a formal Biological Assessment BA for CS and CS not a biological survey report like we provided According to the Endangered Species Act ESA the lead Federal agency in a Federal Action is responsible for preparing the BA but a BA is typically only required when the action may affect a listed species which is not the case here EPA Region and based on our experience across the country apparently only Region is interpreting their responsibilities under the ESA very strictly and somewhat oddly Regardless the bottom line is that it appears we could argue with them ad nauseum and still end up right back here So we have begun working very quickly and diligently to put together a BAlike document that according to Roger will give them what they need to put in their files to cover themselves for satisfying the ESA I told him that the USFWS typically under normal circumstances receives a BA from the lead federal agency and then issues their Biological Opinion BO I asked him if they EPA were going to still feel like they needed any kind of concurrence from the USFWS He said that only if we were going to have any findings of may affect would they maybe feel the need to get additional concurrence from the USFWS I told him that you Larry already have a verbal concurrence from USFWS that there are no issues in addition to the fact that our surveys confirmed that I told him that our BAlike document is going to come to the same conclusions that our Survey Report did ie No Effect He said that he understands and will likely just receive the document assure himself that it says what it needs to say and is formatted in the manner he feels it needs to be formatted put it in his files and put out the Public Notice for a day comment period If this all happens by early next week we should still have permits by the beginning of November I will continue to hammer home the importance of that schedule Some of us will be on a conference call with Roger and one of the EPA attorneys tomorrow to try to get inside their heads a little bit better regarding why they are the only Region interpreting their ESA responsibilities so strictly We will debrief you after the call Scott Scott J Patti Senior Project Manager ENSR International Prospect Parkway Fort

<24932096.1075851905913.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,spatti@ensr.com,2001-09-19 14:05:00,TE species update Red Rock Mainline Expansion Cc update to many of you I have been on the phone with Roger Kohn of EPA Region a couple of different times today It turns out that what they really were expecting to see was something more like a formal Biological Assessment BA for CS and CS not a biological survey report like we provided According to the Endangered Species Act ESA the lead Federal agency in a Federal Action is responsible for preparing the BA but a BA is typically only required when the action may affect a listed species which is not the case here EPA Region and based on our experience across the country apparently only Region is interpreting their responsibilities under the ESA very strictly and somewhat oddly Regardless the bottom line is that it appears we could argue with them ad nauseum and still end up right back here So we have begun working very quickly and diligently to put together a BAlike document that according to Roger will give them what they need to put in their files to cover themselves for satisfying the ESA I told him that the USFWS typically under normal circumstances receives a BA from the lead federal agency and then issues their Biological Opinion BO I asked him if they EPA were going to still feel like they needed any kind of concurrence from the USFWS He said that only if we were going to have any findings of may affect would they maybe feel the need to get additional concurrence from the USFWS I told him that you Larry already have a verbal concurrence from USFWS that there are no issues in addition to the fact that our surveys confirmed that I told him that our BAlike document is going to come to the same conclusions that our Survey Report did ie No Effect He said that he understands and will likely just receive the document assure himself that it says what it needs to say and is formatted in the manner he feels it needs to be formatted put it in his files and put out the Public Notice for a day comment period If this all happens by early next week we should still have permits by the beginning of November I will continue to hammer home the importance of that schedule Some of us will be on a conference call with Roger and one of the EPA attorneys tomorrow to try to get inside their heads a little bit better regarding why they are the only Region interpreting their ESA responsibilities so strictly We will debrief you after the call Scott Scott J Patti Senior Project Manager ENSR International Prospect Parkway Fort
