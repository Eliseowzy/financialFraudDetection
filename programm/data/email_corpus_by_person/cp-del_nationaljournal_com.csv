OUTLOOK Senate Returns To More Recriminations Over Priorities The weeklong Thanksgiving break appears to have had little salutary effect on relations between the two parties in the Senate where Republicans and Democrats again locked horns today on tax and FY spending bills Majority Leader Daschle told colleagues on the Senate floor he intends to drop the stalled economic stimulus bill and turn to controversial legislation to aid retired railroad workers and the farm bill That provoked charges and countercharges from Republicans and Democrats that the other party was stalling the stimulus bill We shouldnt be doing anything else until we get an agreement worked out on a stimulus bill said Minority Leader Lott Daschle said Republicans were filibustering the stimulus bill as we speak leaving him no choice but to bring up other measures He invited Republicans to convene bipartisan negotiations on the bill but insisted those include discussions on a billion Democratic homeland security spending package He expressed a willingness to convene two separate negotiations but said the spending proposals had to be part of the talks We ought to be able to find some middle ground between zero and billion he said but the Republicans are refusing to even meet Lott charged Democrats were pushing for new spending that President Bush has not requested because they do not really want to pass a stimulus bill Your interest is to shovel the stimulus bill off to the side he said Meanwhile a proposal by Sen Pete Domenici RNM to provide a temporary payroll tax holiday appears to be gaining currency among some Republicans Daschles plan to move to the bill to increase benefits to survivors of retired railroad workers did not win him any points with Republicans There will be strenuous opposition to the railroad retirement bill using procedural devices that are available to all members vowed Minority Whip Nickles during the floor exchange Nickles called the bill a billion giveaway and also warned that the farm bill which has also drawn objections from budget hawks is not going to pass in a day or two Daschle tried to head off GOP plans to attach energy legislation to either the farm bill or the railroad retirement bill by committing to bring up energy legislation after Congress returns Jan But Lott criticized Daschle for planning to bring a Democratic energy package straight to the floor rather than going through committee and for failing to commit to completing an energy bill As for the FY Defense appropriations bill which Lott also urged Daschle to put on the floor Daschle said the Senate would take it up after the House acts and once the Senate Appropriations Committee has a chance to mark it up A Senate Appropriations spokesman said action is likely early next week On Wednesday the House plans to consider the billion spending measure which also carries the billion terrorism supplemental The House Rules Committee plans to meet on that bill at pm today and Democrats will press their case to offer amendments to increase the supplemental Although GOP leaders have indicated their opposition New York GOP Rep John Sweeney plans to break with them and join Rep Nita Lowey D NY to push for an amendment to add billion in recovery aid to the supplemental by Geoff Earle and Lisa Caruso OUTLOOK Armey Sees Two More Weeks Needed To Finish Up House Majority Leader Armey said this afternoon that Congress needs at least two more weeks to complete the FY spending bills and economic stimulus legislation while suggesting that lawmakers could go home without the latter Armey said the economic stimulus debate has gotten caught up in philosophical differences commenting If you want to attach a dateline to the end of the session attach it to that Armey who has placed tax relief at the heart of a stimulus bill said he does not want a bill that does not stimulate business investment If you cant get a real economic stimulus package that makes sense then youre better off doing nothing he said Armey also suggested that Congress would have to approve a sixth continuing resolution when the current CR expires Dec Im personally planning on another he said Were looking at this trade bill on the th Were still trying to get through the impasse with the Senate on stimulus Armey said he remains committed to the Dec date to consider renewal of presidential trade negotiating authority and said it is forcing undecided members to make up their minds The only thing was announce a date and make everyone get off the dime Armey said predicting The votes will be there This week Armey said the House would consider the FY Defense appropriations bill Wednesday and terrorism reinsurance legislation Thursday or Friday also mentioning conference reports on the FY Foreign Operations and District of Columbia spending bills as possibilities Armey said jurisdictional disputes on the reinsurance bill would likely be sorted out in the Rules Committee singling out liability language from the Judiciary Committee Looking beyond this week Armey said he might schedule election reform next week and said he was he was hopeful an education conference committee report would be ready before the end of the session by Mark Wegner ECONOMY White House Shows No Sign Of Budging Over Spending The White House today showed no sign of budging on its desire to hold the line on spending despite continuing Democratic demands for more money to combat terrorism and aid areas affected by the Sept attacks Referring to an earlier deal between congressional appropriators and the White House to hold FY spending to billion and keep the supplemental at billion White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer today declared A deal is a deal is a deal Fleischer reiterated President Bushs threat to veto legislation that breaches the agreedupon totals And the White House will continue its campaign to pressure the Senate to pass a stimulus package Bush will make the point during his weekly breakfast meeting Wednesday with House Speaker Hastert Senate Majority Leader Daschle Senate Minority Leader Lott and House Minority Leader Gephardt Fleischer said And the president will urge movement on stimulus legislation in a speech to be delivered later Wednesday House Majority Leader Armey today continued to press the Senate to act on stimulus legislation There is in fact a recession and that obviously gives us some sense of urgency Armey said chiding Daschle for scheduling Senate votes on railroad retirement legislation and the farm bill instead of continuing to work on a stimulus package Armey said public opinion over the Thanksgiving break could in part determine whether the Senate acts on a stimulus plan Have they communicated to the Senate in the past days that this is an important thing in their lives Armey asked House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas also continued to blast Daschle for failing to move a stimulus bill through the Senate dismissing as hogwash the suggestion that no tax bill could garner votes to overcome a budget point of order Thomas also charged that Daschle deliberately helped create a partisan measure in the Senate Finance Committee Thomas continued to refuse to negotiate any bicameral agreement so long as the billion package of domestic security spending items remains on the table Without those items Thomas said the leaders of the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees could put together a compromise over a weekend He declined to offer specific views on the package put together by Senate moderates However he acknowledged that a final bill could contain items not approved by either House Also while he continued to vigorously defend full repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax he said he would look at other options assuming there is a middle ground Meanwhile the National Federation of Independent Business Monday urged congressional leaders to pass a stimulus bill including expanded Section expensing provisions acceleration and permanent enactment of the tax cuts passed earlier this year allowing small business owners to depreciate vehicles within a reasonable time frame and expanding the availability of tax refunds for net operating losses to five years from the current twoyear limit In a letter NFIB said these provisions would be the most beneficial for small business and urged Congress to focus on real benefits for small businesses while avoiding placing costly mandates on employers that will slow economic development by Keith Koffler Mark Wegner and Stephen Norton HEALTH Brownback Fails To Get Floor Debate On Human Cloning The debate over human cloning found its way to the Senate floor today as Sen Sam Brownback RKan followed through on his vow to try to bring up for debate a cloningban bill that passed the House in July and has been endorsed by President Bush But Democratic leaders blocked the move by objecting to its consideration Brownback and allies who oppose human cloning intended to produce a live birth as well as the creation of embryos intended to be destroyed for research said Sundays announcement by a Massachusetts biotech firm that it has successfully cloned a sixcell embryo means the Senate should act immediately Ive been telling this body for months that this issue was going to be here and now its here said Brownback We now have the first human clone Majority Whip Reid objected to immediate consideration noting that Majority Leader Daschle has promised a full debate in February or March on both the Housepassed bill and a proposal by Sen Arlen Specter RPa on the related issue of expanding federal funding for research on human embryonic stem cells Brownback then proposed a fallback position for a sixmonth moratorium on human cloning research People are very uncomfortable with human cloning he said so much so that we should hit the pause button at this point But Reid rejected that proposal as well While Reid acknowledged that Brownback feels strongly about the issue he said there are those who feel just as strongly on the other side They believe therapeutic cloning is something that will lead very quickly to the abolishment of diabetes Parkinsons and other diseases Reid said For those people he added a moratorium for six months for two months or for two days represents an unacceptable delay Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif suggested Democrats could quickly reach agreement on legislation that would ban the implantation of a cloned embryo into a womans uterus a proposal Brownback rejected And Specter said he would be happy to see an immediate debate and vote on the matter although he prefers to wait to have a chance for scientists interested in research on cloning to make their case Specter said at a news conference that his willingness to proceed does not necessarily signal that his side has the votes to defeat Brownback but that Im just not disposed to duck the matter I think there are too many delays in the Senate by Julie Rovner FINANCE Consumer Activists Opposing Rent To Own Legislation Consumer activists are up in arms over plans by the House Financial Services Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee to resume marking up Wednesday a controversial rent to own bill action on which was postponed in September In a letter today activists urged lawmakers to oppose the markup vehicle a proposal by Rep Walter Jones RNC which they claim will roll back strong protections against predatory rent toown practices in a handful of states The Jones bill pre empts the strongest state laws in Minnesota New Jersey Wisconsin and Vermont that treat renttoown as a credit transaction as opposed to a lease which does not afford consumers the same level of protection from abuse the activists said Industry supporters of the measure said they simply want legal certainty that their transactions will be treated as leases and claim that certainty will work to consumers benefit If all such transactions were treated as sales we would be put out of business said one industry lobbyist who noted that rental purchase agreements often are the only way lowincome individuals can secure appliances and luxury items The protest letter is signed by officials with the US Public Interest Research Group the Consumer Federation of America Consumers Union and the National Consumer Law Center among others who added This wolfinsheeps clothing is not a pro consumer bill as its industry proponents allege It is cleverly designed for one purpose and one purpose only to eliminate existing stronger state law protections against industry abuses At a time when the American people want the Congress to focus on legislation to rebuild the nations economy and security we are frankly both surprised and disappointed that attempts are being made to move this unnecessary extremely controversial special interest legislation The House measure which has nearly equally bipartisan sponsorship is expected to pass easily in committee and on the House floor as well Its fate in the Senate is less certain however by Pamela Barnett JUDICIARY High Court Decides To Pass On Affirmative Action Case The Supreme Court abandoned its plan to rule on a major reverse discrimination case today concluding the case involving a whiteowned contractor from Colorado was not a good vehicle for deciding whether federal affirmative action rules amount to reverse discrimination the Associated Press reported The courts action came in a unanimous unsigned ruling and is an anticlimactic end to what had been billed as an important case Opponents of racial preferences had hoped the court would use the year fight over government highway contracts to effectively declare federal affirmative action programs unconstitutional The case Adarand Constructors Inc v Mineta had developed procedural problems that several justices suggested last month were too messy to fix The court flirted with overturning affirmative action programs in its decision involving the same case The court also ruled today that Indian tribes must pay federal gambling taxes on pulltab lottery cards and other forms of betting States are not required to pay federal excise taxes on wagers and two Oklahoma tribes argued that Congress also intended to exempt them The language of the statute is too strong to bend as the tribes would wish Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the courts majority The case involves pulltab lottery cards which are sold to finance reservation activities The Chickasaw and Choctaw nations argued that the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was unclear on whether lottery cards can be taxed Justice Sandra Day OConnor in a dissent joined by Justice David Souter said the court should have relied on the longestablished precedent requiring governments to interpret ambiguity in tax laws favorably to the tribes TECHNOLOGY Cantwell To Introduce The Reclaim Your Identity Act Of Sen Maria Cantwell DWash promised Monday to try to amend federal law to help curb identity theft the Seattle Times reported Cantwell said she was introducing the Reclaim Your Identity Act of as the holiday shopping season begins because as credit card usage peaks consumers deserve the tools they need to protect their identity Cantwells proposal which is based on a Washington state law that went into effect in July would require businesses to give copies of records reflecting fraudulent transactions to identitytheft victims require consumer credit reporting agencies to block information that appears on a victims credit report as a result of identity theft and change the statute of limitations for identitytheft victims to file a claim Cantwell said the chances are not good that her proposal would get a hearing this year but she hopes it will raise awareness now and lead to reform next year AGRICULTURE Bush Slated To Deliver Farm Journal Forum Speech Wednesday President Bush is scheduled to give a luncheon speech to the Farm Journal forum Wednesday a spokeswoman for the publication confirmed today The appearance coming just a day before the Senate is scheduled to take up the farm bill would provide Bush with an opportunity to take a formal position on farm policy At that forum today Trade Representative Zoellick said Bushs speech would show that the priority the administration puts on markets for agriculture starts at the top Agriculture Secretary Veneman also is scheduled to address the forum Wednesday on food safety POLITICS Graham Undergoes Surgery To Remove Nonlethal Skin Cancer Sen Bob Graham DFla underwent two hours of outpatient surgery Monday in Gainesville to remove a small nonlethal skin cancer from the

Consumer confidence unexpectedly fell for the fifth consecutive month in November as Americans continued to worry about layoffs and their buying power according to the Conference Board The organization reported today that its Consumer Confidence Index fell to from a revised in October Analysts had been expecting an increase to Rising unemployment and continuing layoff announcements are dampening confidence said Lynn Franco director of the Conference Boards Consumer Research Center A turnaround in confidence levels is not likely before years end nor are retailers likely to enjoy a

White House Intensifies Push For Trade Authority Bill The White House is mounting an aggressive campaign to pass presidential trade negotiating authority pushing for approval in both the House and the Senate before the end of the year Groundwork for the current effort was laid in July when it appeared the House might schedule a vote The president thinks its absolutely necessary that it gets done said one senior White House official But causing problems are President Bushs views on agriculture which several lawmakers are linking to their support for trade negotiating authority The White House rejected legislation authored by House Agriculture Chairman Combest and ranking member Charles Stenholm DTexas that was recently approved by the House Neither Combest nor Stenholm has committed to backing trade negotiating authority and protrade strategists consider their support indispensable House legislators who met with Bush on trade earlier this week decried the lack of a specific administration agriculture policy But the White House appears ready to move decisively White House senior adviser Karl Rove Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and OMB Director Daniels met behind closed doors Thursday with several commodity group officials According to sources familiar with the session the Bush aides laid out several markers for a potential Bush farm policy and indicated they would try to craft a specific proposal emphasizing they would be flexible and work with others such as Combest But sources emphasized that the meeting was also an effort separate from trade With a farm bill passed in the House and the expectation that new Democratic sponsored legislation will begin to move in the Senate as early as next week the White House wants to wade more forcefully into the agriculture debate Bush will begin to talk about trade negotiating authority much more frequently aides said Cabinet officials are being tasked both to lobby and publicly pitch the bill Secretary of State Powell wrote an oped article in The Wall Street Journal this week touting the legislation and Treasury Secretary ONeill and Commerce Secretary Evans staged an appearance on the White House driveway today to do the same Evans and Trade Representative Zoellick have already lobbied dozens of lawmakers And an interagency task force chaired by White House Legislative Affairs Director Nicholas Calio and Deputy National Security Adviser Gary Edson meets at least twice a week But despite the passage in committee last week of Ways and Means Chairman Thomas bill the outlook remains unclear the senior White House official acknowledged I think its a little up in the air between the two chambers the official said pointing to rancor among Democrats who allege that Thomas did not make sufficient effort to include them or their views in crafting his bill There are some obvious problems with the atmosphere in the House relative to this issue which we think is an absolute shame because while I think some folks could question how Chairman Thomas did it the fact of the matter is he went farther on labor and the environment than any previous trade bill in history the official said by Keith Koffler TRADE Textile State Members Convey Concerns To Thomas House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas met this week with members from textile states to discuss their concerns about moving forward with legislation to restore the presidents trade negotiating authority The textile industry has been hit hard by trade expansion in the last years as companies have shifted operations abroad to countries with lower pay scales and where textile production has become less labor intensive GOP House leaders have made passage of what they call trade promotion authority a top priority but a solid margin of victory depends on the support of as many Republicans as possible and a number of those members come from textile producing states Ways and Means has usually turned a deaf ear to the textile industry Rep Howard Coble RNC said This was not meant to suggest he said a particular antipathy for that industry but rather was a statement of the panels inclination for free trade Coble said he and many other textile state legislators want free trade laced with fair trade and stressed this to Thomas whom he described as willing to listen Coble echoed the industrys contention that the dyeing finishing and printing has to be done here Thomas legislation approved by his committee last week and awaiting action on the House floor as early as next week accommodates some of the concerns of textile state members said Rep Mac Collins RGa also a Ways and Means member He said he believes Thomas bill contains strong report language instructing negotiators to make sure there are ways to closely monitor adherence to textile provisions in future trade pacts He said there is also added emphasis in the US Customs Service to prevent transshipments a device used to skirt trade rules by misrepresenting the true source of a textile product This is the first time since I have been on the committee there has been an open ear said Collins reflecting on the way Thomas has handled the development of the bill Collins said he would vote for Thomas bill during the floor vote as he did in committee But another member from a textile state who asked not to be identified is still uneasy and will not support Thomas bill unless there are changes His aide explained that Thomas and GOP leaders must recognize that there remain serious concerns among agriculture state legislators especially after recent administration statements that were critical of the House farm bills provisions designed to stem the effects of expanding trade The aide said GOP leaders would have to accommodate these concerns in order to marshal enough votes for passage by Stephen Norton HEALTH Senate Leaders Waiting For Anthrax Sweep To Finish Health officials today continued to sweep Senate office buildings to look for traces of anthrax as the Senate stood in recess Senate Minority Leader Lott said leaders had not yet decided whether to open the Senate office buildings for business Monday That call will be made over the weekend he said Lott said it would be possible that the Dirksen and Russell buildings would be open while only the Hart building where anthrax was delivered to Majority Leader Daschles office would remain closed But that scenario could pose logistical problems for Senate officials since Hart staffers would have to be relocated to other buildings Sen Bill Frist RTenn said officials would announce the status of the buildings at pm Sunday Health officials said today that at least three of the swab tests conducted on people earlier this week have proven to be false positives The number of positive tests now stands at two from the office of Sen Russell Feingold DWis six from law enforcement agencies and from Daschles staff Health officials said a total of swabs have been conducted with results in on Most were conducted on those who worked in or visited the Hart building Monday One of the initial positive swabs that since has been found to be negative was obtained at the US Capitol Police offsite delivery center meaning all current positive swabs come from the immediate area in or adjacent to Daschles office Feingolds office is next door As a precaution Daschles staff and others in the fifth and sixth floors of the southeast quadrant of the Hart building are being kept on a day regimen of antibiotics Even those who get a negative result on a nasal swab test could have come in contact with anthrax since spores can enter the body through the lungs or through open cuts Frist and other health officials who gave a briefing today faced criticism for the Capitols response to the incident including the initial establishment of a close perimeter outside Daschles office that allowed reporters and staff access to the corridors of the Hart building In light of the circumstances were going to go back and look at our procedures again said Lt Dan Nichols a Capitol Police spokesman Frist also confirmed a report that exposed Daschle staffers were instructed to bring their exposed clothing into the Capitol for testing although it was determined there was no health hazard posed by the clothing Regardless of the state of any building closures the Senate is scheduled to be in session Tuesday when a cloture vote on the FY Foreign Operations appropriations bill is scheduled A Lott spokesman said there was still no deal on moving judicial nominees and that Republicans will try to defeat cloture as they did last week Hopefully we can come to some sort of agreement so this wont have to happen again said the spokesman by Geoff Earle HEALTH New Anthrax Reports Deemed Apparent Hoaxes Mailed envelopes containing white powder have been received by three additional lawmakers but appear to be hoaxes authorities and members said Sen Edward Kennedy DMass received a letter at his district office Thursday containing white powder but the substance tested negative for anthrax aides told the Boston Globe The envelope bore a Boston return address that turned out to be fictitious and contained a threatening letter In Arkansas GOP Sen Tim Hutchinson also received a letter Thursday in his El Dorado office from a prisoner in the Union County jail The letter included threatening language and a white substance that appeared to be dried toothpaste the Arkansas DemocratGazette And in Tennessee envelopes containing white powder were also sent to offices of Republican Sen Bill Frist and GOP Rep Ed Bryant the Memphis CommercialAppeal reported In my view most of these anthrax scares are the product of local people who are copycats pranksters or people who have relatively simple minds said Bryant Preliminary tests on the envelopes were not available Meanwhile Kennedys spokesman today told the Associated Press that Kennedy is working on bioterrorism legislation costing billion to billion that the Senate could act as early as next week The plan may include provisions that would make it easier for the government and the drug industry to cooperate to speed up research and production of new vaccines and drugs to combat bioterrorism threats Kennedy already has been working with Frist on a billion measure much of that going to local and state governments to upgrade computers help communities plan for disasters increase staffing give training to more workers and improve health laboratories Minority Leader Lott said Thursday that bioterrorism provisions could be added to the antiterrorism bill that could win approval next week In a telephone briefing to all House members this afternoon Rep Rosa DeLauro DConn said teams will sweep the Capitol complex today and Saturday allowing health officials the required hours to process the results They are doing that in a very methodical way DeLauro said A spokesman for House Speaker Hastert said this afternoon that leaders do not yet have test results back for a suspicious letter handled in Hasterts fourth floor Capitol office The FBI Wednesday collected a letter that had handwriting similar to those on anthraxtainted letters addressed to Senate Majority Leader Daschle and NBC News anchorman Tom Brokaw Nothings back yet It takes awhile the Hastert spokesman said Similarly the spokesman said that teams sweeping the Capitol complex for anthrax would need several days to process their work The House is still scheduled to return next week Tuesday the spokesman said by Mark Wegner TAXES Retailers Propose Sales Tax Holiday As Part Of Stimulus With their eye toward the Senate the nations retailers are beginning to push a proposal for the economic stimulus package that would institute a day nationwide sales tax moratorium to bolster consumer spending during the allimportant Christmas shopping season The National Retail Federation is arguing that with more than twothirds of the nations gross domestic product attributable to consumer spending the Senate bill must contain more direct stimulus than the one passed by the House Ways and Means Committee last week That is not to say the group is completely dissatisfied with the House proposal particularly the provisions that would fatten consumers pocketbooks namely the acceleration of the percent tax bracket and the tax rebate for lowincome Americans But overall the group is critical of House leaders decision to include corporate alternative minimum tax breaks and some other expensive items that may not provide an immediate boost to the economy It tends to look more like a garden variety omnibus tax bill than it does a stimulus package said Steve Pfister senior vice president of government relations at the NRF The group said that because the nations economy relies so much on spending more of the stimulus package should be focused on increasing consumer sales which fell percent in September the largest drop in years Under the NRF proposal currently being shopped around Capitol Hill and among interest groups states and localities could choose to suspend sales taxes on all items including cars during a day period likely starting the day after Thanksgiving Congress would then reimburse states for lost revenue Currently eight of the states that collect sales taxes have these holidays which the NRF claims would boost sales even during the salesheavy holiday season Pfister also noted that the cost of the proposal billion to billion is not monumental given the boost it could provide to struggling retail outlets which rely on fourthquarter sales to make up percent to percent of their annual business This is doing what the president wanted providing a temporary immediate stimulus putting money in peoples pockets said Pfister And it should be on the table as this process goes forward by Bill Ghent FINANCE Lawmakers Grapple With Crafting Reinsurance Measure With the specter of future terrorist acts looming the question before Congress is no longer whether but how to craft a legislative package aimed at correcting a market weakness resulting from reinsurers refusing to back up property and casualty insurers for such damages sources concurred today The deadline is Dec given that most insurers and reinsurers must renegotiate their contracts by Jan During the next few weeks the key will be to craft a package that adequately balances industry versus taxpayer exposure in short what makes the most economic sense said Robert Hunter director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America Members want to try to grasp the true economic ramifications of having a federal backstop and Treasury Department involvement in the area of insurance against terrorist acts added one industry observer The devils in the details said Robert Rusbuldt of the Independent Insurance Agents of America whose members sell percent of all commercial business insurance The big thing is weve got to charge a premium to the industry in return for the government aid said Hunter Some premium that is actuarily sound that hopefully would allow the taxpayer to break even over time You cant just give it away thats absurd Hunter suggested the deductible be related to an individual companys surplus That way you keep the industry whole and strong Hunter added Reasonable people across the political spectrum will rally around the idea that taxpayers need protection as much as the industry Hunter predicted Congress must also decide whether to include in the package a proposal by the life insurance community for a government study on the economic impact of future terrorist acts on that industry But there is some skepticism regarding the underlying package as well We want a backstop not a bailout said one Republican congressional source It must also be temporary in nature the source added We dont want to see the federal government in the insurance business Meanwhile the White House has effectively vetoed the property and casualty industrys proposal while the White House legislative plan has been panned by fiscal conservatives in Congress as an industry bailout In the Senate Banking ranking member Phil Gramm RTexas and Sen Christopher Dodd DConn are working together on a bill which could be ready for presentation next week The ability of those two legislators to reach a consensus would signal a plan that could satisfy a range of political ideologies Were trying to find common ground obviously mindful that the clock is ticking on this a Dodd spokesman said today In the House Financial Services Chairman Oxley and Rep Richard Baker RLa are sketching out their own ideas for legislation A Financial Services subcommittee hearing scheduled for this week on the subject had to be postponed twice because of the anthrax scare at the Capitol but the panel is aiming to reschedule it next week possibly Tuesday sources said The Senate Banking Committee also may have a hearing in the works for next week sources said by Pamela Barnett HOUSE LEADERSHIP Blue Dogs New Dems CBC Consider Leadership Races House Democrats say they are weary from the longrunning minority whip contest that elevated Rep Nancy Pelosi of California to their second highest leadership post but members from various party factions are beginning to look for their own seats at the leadership table Over the years we have discussed the fact when a leadership position opens up that we consider a race said Rep Max Sandlin of Texas a prominent member of the Blue Dog Coalition of moderate and conservative Democrats As our group has coalesced and grown it seems only right that we have a Blue Dog or New Democrat in leadership Sandlin who has compiled a moderate voting record publicly backed Pelosis election and has had ties to the partys liberal wing Some see him as a potential candidate for some Democratic leadership position I have thought of that and have been approached by some members of the Blue Dog Coalition and other members Sandlin said But space within leadership ranks already is becoming crowded Minority Leader Gephardt and Pelosi next year will occupy the partys two top posts in the minority and Reps Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut already have said they would run for the No position held by termlimited Caucus Chairman Martin Frost of Texas Currently Menendez and DeLauro hold the respective fourth and fifth leadership posts and it is unclear whether a third Democrat would join the race to succeed Frost Rep Jim Turner of Texas a Blue Dog cochairman said the group began talking about leadership opportunities even before Pelosis election last week over Rep Steny Hoyer of Maryland The Blue Dogs have informally discussed the importance of having an impact in the outcome of that race he said adding that the group has not ruled out any of the races below Democratic whip I think that all of these are a possibility Rep Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas said the Congressional Black Caucus has had similar informal discussions No leadership door is closed Jackson Lee said adding There are many good candidates in the CBC Rep James Clyburn DSC who has previously chaired the CBC said he has gotten inquiries Rep Earl Hilliard called me a couple of days ago and said I should run Clyburn said of his Alabama colleague I said Lets talk about it Clyburn who said he is looking at some entry level leadership post said it is too early to begin campaigning noting that leadership positions could change Im not too sure exactly how thats going to be defined Clyburn said What the structure is today may not be the structure the next time around For example after DeLauro lost a race against Frost to head the Caucus Gephardt created a special assistant position No leadership races are likely until after next years election which will also shape the contests A Democratic majority would promote Gephardt to speaker while minority status could lead to his departure possibly to seek the presidency in by Mark Wegner REDISTRICTING Kennedy Supporter On Redistricting Panel Challenged Government watchdog groups say the campaign treasurer for Rep Patrick Kennedy DRI has a conflict of interest in sitting on the redistricting commission that will redraw congressional district borders the Providence Journal reported State Democratic Rep William San Bento who has been Kennedys campaign treasurer since was appointed to the member commission by House Speaker John Harwood in July But his role in the Kennedy campaign only began receiving attention over the past two weeks after Kennedy himself questioned whether his former chief of staff Anthony Marcella should be on the redistricting panel H Philip West executive director of the government watchdog group Common Cause of Rhode Island said he had not known about San Bentos involvement with the Kennedy campaign until told by a reporter but he said San Bento does have a conflict of interest and should recuse himself from congressional redistricting decisions San Bento said he sees no conflict of interest since he receives no pay and is only one of votes Meanwhile an Illinois circuit court judge Thursday dismissed a lawsuit filed by Democratic Rep David Phelps challenging a new redistricting map adjusted for the loss of one congressional seat according to the Springfield State JournalReview Phelps who was redistricted into the neighboring district of GOP Rep Tim Johnson by the new map argued the new districts are not compact are politically gerrymandered and fail to protect communities of interest The judge ruled that Phelps had not raised any constitutional or federal issue and so he dismissed it Phelps has said he intends to run in the newly created th District against GOP Rep John Shimkus ECONOMY Consumer Prices Rise In September Consumer prices edged up in September pushed higher by the biggest jump in gasoline prices in months the Labor Department reported today The Consumer Price Index rose by percent last month the largest increase since May The advance came after a tiny percent increase in August Meanwhile the Commerce Department reported that the United States trade deficit shrank to billion in August percent below a July imbalance of billion The improvement reflected a percent drop in

Members of the secretive forces were supporting efforts by the intelligence community to undermine the Taliban regime in southern Afghanistan said a US official A Pakistani official said that country was told that special forces were dropped into Taliban territory Thursday The source said US forces have also been in antiTaliban northern alliance territory of Afghanistan for more than one week US warplanes eased their bombardment after dawn today Islams holy day In Pakistan a Taliban official said his side had nothing to fear from US commandos Fifteen or troops will be able to do nothing embassy spokesman Sohail Shaheen said If they want to send in soldiers they should send in Then it can be a fight between our soldiers and theirs President Bush refused to confirm the presence of US ground forces in Afghanistan but said We will use whatever means are necessary to achieve our objective THE FRIDAY BUZZ Dark Humor A week that inspired both fear and terror on Capitol Hill also prompted senators to engage in a bit of dark humor once they were assured that staff who had come in contact with spores of anthrax this week would be okay We do need humor right now we really do explained Sen John McCain RAriz who appeared Thursday night on Late Night with David Letterman A common topic was the antibiotic Cipro which many senators and staff are taking as a precaution But the funloving Sen John Breaux DLa was searching for an even better cocktail Im trying to see if I can take a combopack of Viagra and Cipro together he quipped Ill be happier and healthier Other jokes focused on the Capitol mail which posed the danger of spreading the disease Minority Whip Nickles proclaimed after the initial scare that he planned to keep opening his mail Except for my Citibank Visa and American Express Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah known for his humor on the campaign trail and gospel singing was asked whether he had received any suspicious packages I did get a CD from country artists Brooks and Dunn singing one of my CDs and it was unbelievable he said Asked whether such a recording constituted an act of terrorism Hatch replied It was counterterrorism Others riffed on the once taboo but now wacky theme of public contamination Nickles began one interview outside the Senate chamber with a series of exaggerated hacking coughs although a few scribes braved the phlegm to pursue information about the Senate schedule McCain a known jokester warned that his Commerce Committee staff director Mark Buse had a variety of communicable diseases Among them premature balding terminal illness and ugliness Buse took the ribbing in good spirit although he must have been buoyed when a reporter observed that hair loss was a sign of virility Reporters got a few laughs at the expense of Majority Leader Daschle who inspired broad support among members and staff for his handling of the situation Daschle is a known master of understatement During a recent news conference when Republicans were thwarting his legislative plans he used variations of the word disappointed a staple of his vocabulary all of six times So it was not at all unusual that when he learned Monday that someone was trying to infect him and his staff that Daschle remarked that he was very very disappointed But by the end of the week even the evenkeeled Daschles blood was up He said he was angered that this has happened The diminutive Daschle even poked fun at himself on the Senate floor late this week when Majority Whip Reid praised him for standing tall during a difficult crisis I guess I would just note that any time somebody gives me credit for standing tall I will take that as the highest compliment he said by Geoff Earle Looking For A Home While some House members this week fought the perception they were weakkneed legislators who had fled to their districts while the Senate stood tall others fumed that terrorists could interrupt their work and that no alternative workspace was available This is a hell of a strategic victory for them an animated Rep Neil Abercrombie DHawaii said in a private hallway conversation Wednesday with Democratic Caucus Chairman Martin Frost of Texas Abercrombie was also overheard suggesting that maybe we need new leadership Asked about the exchange immediately afterward Abercrombie responded Talk to the doctor before ducking into the cloakroom Frost said later Abercrombie had quickly cooled and took satisfaction with the suggestion made during a members briefing that Congress reconvene in Honolulu Mr Abercrombie is fine His concern is there needs to be an alternative location where we can meet Frost said An apologetic Abercrombie later explained his feelings in terms of offense and defense saying the nation was only reacting to terrorist threats Its been five weeks but we are still responding to Sept terrorism rather than acting he said Abercrombie said he would like Congress to have an alternative workspace in such events and has received assurances the House Administration Committee was looking for such space While many House members and staff returned to their districts others worked from makeshift offices or from home In response to media inquiries House Administration Chairman Ney Majority Whip DeLay and National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia staged a photo opportunity Thursday at NRCC headquarters Democratic Caucus Vice Chairman Robert Menendez of New Jersey borrowed a nearby townhouse from a former GOP member to convene a scheduled meeting of the Democratic Task Force on Homeland Security Prudence became the adjective of choice this week to defend the Houses early recess which allowed security teams to sweep the Capitol complex for any traces of anthrax Ney whose panel is responsible for security said in an interview he has not been tested I dont know Im going to wait and see what they find Ney said Im remaining cautious and calm by Mark Wegner THE FINAL WORD

Zoellick Seeks Specific Date For Vote On Trade Authority Trade Representative Zoellick today said the time has come for the House to set a date for a vote on a bill to restore presidential trade negotiating authority stressing The eyes of the world will be on Congress Speaking to a National Association of Manufacturers breakfast Zoellick said My own sense is that we need a date A CongressDaily survey of House members released today showed members publicly undeclared or on the fence on the issue Zoellick said setting a date is the only way to compel members to focus on the issue and make a decision House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas said he agrees completely with Zoellick and said he would have preferred to hold a floor vote just after the farm bill was approved days ago A vote on the trade negotiating authority measure is expected within the next few weeks but Thomas said he would need to confer with House leaders on setting a date Business lobbyists said a vote would increase the need for direct involvement by the president in securing votes Thomas said that would be more likely now that President Bush has returned from his recent trip to Asia Asked whether a wartime president will have the time to devote to the trade issue Thomas said A wartime president does not have to because many members are prepared to help him win passage for his priorities This afternoon House Majority Leader Armey said the timing for bringing trade negotiating authority legislation to the floor was up in the air indefinitely saying there were renewed or new concerns about the bill Armey who has long pushed for a floor vote on the trade bill referred questions about that issue to the whips office Union officials have been expressing confidence in recent days that they have the votes to defeat the trade negotiating authority bill I think we have the votes said one labor lobbyist We feel great on this one I havent met with one member of Congress whos said they wont be with us A lot of those are probably in the CongressDaily polls undecided column Zoellick acknowledged that some countries have sought changes in trade arrangements with the United States in exchange for their sustained support in the coalition effort against terrorism but he resisted characterizing them as concessions Zoellick explained that expanded trade opportunities can play a crucial role in the growth and stability of many countries most notably Pakistan and the United States has a vital interest in not repeating the isolation and retrenchment that accompanied international crises in the past by Stephen Norton and Charlie Mitchell ECONOMY Democrats Offer Stimulus Alternative Plan With Offsets House Ways and Means ranking member Charles Rangel DNY will go to the House Rules Committee this afternoon seeking time for debate on a bill Democrats contend is less skewed toward corporate America and more fiscally responsible Like the bill the Ways and Means Committee approved recently the Democratic alternative would provide an additional tax rebate for income taxpayers who did not qualify for the full rebate provided for in the trillion tax cut measure that became law this year It would extend a number of expiring provisions but only for one year The bill favored by Republicans would go a bit further and make permanent a provision known as Subpart F that aids financial services firms operating overseas Democrats contend the GOP approach on this provision is part of a payoff to big money special interests However Democrats agree with Republicans on the positive effect of extending the carryback period for net operating losses over five years and doubling what some companies can expense It also provides relief for people who had massive tax liability for exercising stock options that ended up being of little value The Democratic measure would focus much more on stimulating the economy through spending It would provide billion for interestfree financing for new school construction and repair It would also temporarily extend unemployment benefits for a full year by providing additional weeks worth of payments make benefits available to certain workers now ineligible for them and increase the payments by a week It would also allow a one year program that would provide a federal payment of percent of socalled COBRA healthcare costs To pay for these proposals Democrats would freeze the income tax rate at percent rather than phasing in a reduction as provided for in the new tax bill Finally the bill would create a trust fund for ideas that are outside the committees jurisdiction such as additional Medicaid benefits House Majority Leader Armey this afternoon said the economic stimulus bill would come to the floor Wednesday and predicted passage by a sizable margin He said he would fight to preserve capital gains cuts during an eventual conference with the Senate although he acknowledged that he had hoped the House would be able to provide more in capital gains relief than is included in the Ways and Means bill But he said the capital gains provision was probably the only element of the House bill that would be in serious danger of eventually being dropped from the package Armey said he believed an alternative minimum tax repeal although he did not mention retroactivity and the acceleration of rate reductions would survive Meanwhile several Senate Republicans issued warnings about Democratic proposals in both chambers to include major spending provisions in an economic stimulus package Unfortunately a lot of what the Democrats are advocating doesnt have much stimulative effect said Senate Minority Leader Lott Added Sen Phil Gramm RTexas I just hope we dont end up with a package that just squanders billion Gramm warned that if the package is wasteful I wont vote for it Sen John Breaux D La said that a bipartisan group of moderates would meet Wednesday with Treasury Secretary ONeill to discuss the stimulus package by Stephen Norton Charlie Mitchell and Geoff Earle CONGRESSIONAL OPERATIONS Congress Returns To Work Under Makeshift Conditions Senators and staff took a makeshift approach today as the Senate returned to session while health and security officials gathered more information about when to reopen congressional office buildings Minority Leader Lott said leaders would decide later today about whether to open up a couple of the Senate office buildings But there were indications that environmental sweeps could take more time and the process of eliminating anthrax from the four sites within the Capitol complex where it has been found has not begun Aides said a toxic gas was one of several options that could be used to eliminate the anthrax and that areas would have to be sealed off during the process Asked how many days the process might take to get the Hart Office Building suitable for reopening Rules Chairman Dodd said Try weeks In the interim Dodd said he was working to assign space to senators and staff Ive got people bunked down here together he said But he said the task would be considerably easier once the Russell and Dirksen buildings reopen Senators acknowledged the difficulties posed by their office closings I dont see how you can function really effectively said Commerce ranking member John McCain RAriz So much of the committee work is done in the Senate buildings But McCain noted the committees have already done much of their work We certainly can conduct business here and we will said Republican Policy Committee Chairman Larry Craig of Idaho Itll be a little more complicated theres no question about it Dodd said he was working to try to prioritize hearings to make efficient use of space Lott also expressed confidence in the safety of the Capitol building We do have a regular monitoring system in the Capitol he said In another show of confidence Senate Democrats met today in the Lyndon Johnson room off the Senate floor where staff for Daschle brought contaminated clothing last week at the instruction of FBI officials But a Capitol Police spokesman said Monday that no new positive hits for anthrax have occurred House Majority Leader Armey today would not give any indication when House offices may reopen saying The speaker and I had a very closely held discussion about that earlier today He said it would be up to Speaker Hastert to make an announcement Following the weekly breakast meeting at the White House today House Minority Leader Gephardt told reporters that the anthrax sent to Senate Majority Leader Daschles office was weapons grade implying other officials had not been forthcoming enough in their descriptions of the substance I think weve got to stop parsing words and trying to be anything other than accurate about what this is this is highly sophisticated material it is small in size and it aerosolizes Gephardt said Officials confirmed anthrax today as the cause of death in two local postal workers the Associated Press reported A mail employee was hospitalized in New Jersey also believed to be suffering from the inhalation form of the disease We now know the two deaths that were reported to you now are confirmed cases of inhalational anthrax District of Columbia Mayor Anthony Williams said at a news conference Amid suspicions that mail with anthrax may have made its way to the Longworth House Office Building all the mail in that building now closed may be burned as a precaution said two congressional officials speaking on condition of anonymity Over the weekend officials said a machine in another House office building that bundles mail for Longworth was found to contain anthrax Officials have not found the source of the contamination but they are concerned that it would take too many resources and be too timeconsuming to go through all the mail now in that building by Geoff Earle and Charlie Mitchell CONGRESSIONAL OPERATIONS House Prepares To Pass AntiTerrorism Legislation Following a meeting with House Speaker Hastert Majority Leader Armey today said the House will take up the conference report for the antiterrorism bill tonight and pass it either by unanimous consent or as a suspension He said the House would move ahead with the legislation as agreed to in negotiations with the Senate even though some senators are seeking to add antibioterrorism language We dont think thats within the bounds of the agreement Armey said suggesting the senators pursue that language separately Armey also said the FY defense authorization bill should be completed this week and that the FY Legislative Branch and Treasury Postal appropriations conference reports will come to the floor as well Meanwhile there are increasing signs that the logistical hurdles caused by the anthrax incident plus a continuing logjam on the Senate floor could prolong the congressional session Lott said it could take three weeks to move several bills related to terrorist attacks plus more time to move the stalled FY appropriations bills Senate Minority Leader Lott said that with some immediate movement We could get it done before the Thanksgiving recess but said it might be necessary to bring people back Im concerned that every week we stay here there seems to be another new idea of how we could spend billions of dollars he said Commerce ranking member John McCain RAriz echoed that concern even as he and other Republicans voted against a cloture motion today that would have freed up the FY Foreign Operations spending bill which Republicans are stalling to protest what they consider slow movement of judicial nominees I see us headed for one of those omnibus appropriations bills he said Itll be a bonanza Majority Whip Reid said leaders had made no decisions about adjournment Were just feeling our way through this now he said Added Rules Chairman Dodd I dont think we ought to get out of here Theres a value to being here that I think is reassuring to the American people We may not need everybody here but I think we ought to be functioning by Charlie Mitchell and Geoff Earle HEALTH Harkin Chastises CDC Chief For Poor Anthrax Reaction Senate LaborHHS Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Tom Harkin DIowa sharply questioned Centers for Disease Control Director Jeffrey Koplan today about why US Postal Service employees at a Washingtonarea mail sorting facility were not tested for anthrax exposure after evidence of exposure was found at Senate and New Jersey mail facilities Of course this has never come up before but we would hope CDC would have had some plan Harkin said While acknowledging the loss of two workers at the Brentwood facility who appear to have died in the last few days from anthrax Koplan said government officials were working under the assumption then that the risk of contracting the more deadly form of anthrax inhalation anthrax was only from opened mail Since the Brentwood facility does not open mail but processes it Koplan said no immediate danger was seen Sometimes the information cant be used on Day when you dont get it until Day Koplan said He assured senators that no favoritism was used in the governments apparently quick response to test and provide antibiotics to Senate aides reporters and lobbyists who may have been exposed to anthrax found in a letter sent to Majority Leader Daschle and the rather slow reaction to rising concerns at the Brentwood facility Koplan promised to provide the committee with a detailed list of CDCs actions to address the various areas of potential exposure since anthrax was first reported in Florida on Oct Koplan said the CDC which is charged with responding to potential biological threats and the public health system is stressed through years of neglect and underinvestment But he assured senators that CDC was working with federal and local officials to respond quickly to emerging threats Harkin and LaborHHS Appropriations Subcommittee ranking member Arlen Specter RPa have proposed a billion proposal that would include funds to acquire and stockpile medicines and vaccines million to beef up state and local public health services million to expand CDC funds for a tracking database and funds to double the inspection of imported foods by April Fulton TRANSPORTATION House Urged By Key Senators To Pass Aviation Proposal Senate Commerce Committee members asked President Bush today to increase pressure on the House to pass an aviation security bill while urging their House counterparts to move swiftly so a bill could become law Safety delayed is safety denied said Senate Commerce Chairman Hollings who along with ranking member John McCain RAriz pushed a bill through the Senate earlier this month on a vote Without a new law the American people do not have the confidence they need to have to fly on an airplane McCain said This is the cruelest kind of hoax on the American people Sen John Jay Rockefeller DWVa said Until we get an economic stimulus bill this is the economic stimulus bill Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif said Hollings said House Speaker Hastert had indicated to him that a bill could be up in the House this week but Hollings said he was unable to speak with Majority Whip DeLay who is a major opponent of the Senate bill House Majority Leader Armey said today there was some chance airline security legislation would come to the floor this week but he said it was more likely to be on the agenda next week He said the bill would probably come to the floor under a rule and that Democrats would be allowed to offer a substitute that calls for fully federalizing airport screeners The House GOP leadership supports language that would leave federalization to the presidents discretion Armey said noting that President Bush has proposed a plan that would leave contract workers in place supervised by federal officers The Senate bill would federalize most airport security workers would secure cockpit doors would deploy more sky marshals among other measures to beef up air safety Some House GOP leaders so far have been resistant to bringing up a bill because they are concerned they would not have the votes to prevent security workers from becoming federal workers Senators also dismissed arguments House Republicans have been using against federalization such as calling for the United States to follow the European model of aviation security in which there is federal oversight but private workers Sen Kay Bailey Hutchison RTexas said while European airport security workers have federal oversight and the European government pays for their benefits this would not happen in a US system McCain dismissed the concerns that have been raised about workers forming unions saying the issue should not in any way be a part of the debate Hollings noted that a provision in the Senate bill would keep workers from striking President Bush continues to oppose full federalization of airport screeners and baggage checkers calling into question whether a deal can struck on an airline security bill before the busy Thanksgiving travel season Bush raised the issue during his weekly meeting at the White House with Hastert Senate Majority Leader Daschle Senate Minority Leader Lott and House Minority Leader Gephardt White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said today Bush continues to support increasing standards for airport workers but questions the utility of putting them on the federal payroll Bush today urged the leaders to come together quickly on the bill but laid down no timetable The possibility of Bush issuing an executive order revamping airline security procedures was raised at the meeting but the president emphasized that congressional action was preferable Fleischer said by April Fulton and Keith Koffler HOUSE ADMINISTRATION Baird Seeks Support For Emergency Replacement Plan Rep Brian Baird DWash said Monday that about House Republicans and Democrats so far have cosponsored his constitutional amendment setting forth procedures for appointing House members in the event of a massive attack that kills or incapacitates at least a quarter of House lawmakers While his efforts to gain more cosponsors are hampered by the closure of congressional office buildings Baird said many more than the already committed are contemplating signing onto the bill I hope we can get this done before we convene as a full body next year Baird said Still he acknowledged members find it much more pleasant to talk about presidential trade negotiating authority and other matters because theyre much more pleasant issues His amendment which must pass Congress by a twothirds majority and be approved by threequarters of the states would give governors the authority to appoint successors for House members who are killed or incapacitated during an attack that left percent of members dead or unable to serve The temporary appointees would serve no more than days at which point special elections would be held to fill the vacancies for the remainder of the term Baird said that before introducing the amendment he decided to excise a provision that would have directed governors to appoint temporary members of the same party affiliation as the dead or incapacitated member He made his decision partly because he wanted to keep the Constitution free of reference to parties he said But that decision did not sit well with National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia While Davis said he was not familiar with the details of the Baird proposal he said it would be ridiculous not to require a governor to appoint a successor of the same political party You should not have a partisan change you subvert the will of the people when you do it that way Davis said reasoning that a partisan shift in the House majority would be too dramatic in such a crisis While Baird urged legislators to focus on his amendment first he also said we ought to look at other questions including a list of alternative locations for Congress to meet as well as an expanded line of presidential succession possibly including governors who would be more likely to survive if a nuclear weapon struck Washington DC although those questions might addressed through regular legislation rather than constitutional amendment by Louis Jacobson POLITICS Davis Campaign Themes Uncertain After Attacks National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia said today that Sept terrorist attacks have curtailed GOP fundraising and dampened political rhetoric while making it nearly impossible to predict what issues and dynamics will dominate next years midterm elections Nobody knows I could sketch different scenarios Davis said in a briefing with reporters Who knows The answer is Who knows Davis said the NRCC is focused on the variables we can control the socalled Five Rs retention recruitment redistricting resources and record Davis who recently had a long conversation with Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey of New York said incumbents are still responsible for their public statements and voting records but said both committees are presently reluctant to criticize their opponents This is an environment where you want to be very careful in comparison ads You can give them a little elbow but you have to be careful Davis said Davis said both campaign committees have similarly refrained from fundraising in the month following the terrorist attacks However Davis said the terrorist threats have motivated some reluctant potential House candidates to reevaluate their decisions People want to be relevant They want to be involved he said Davis said local offyear elections next month including gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey where Democratic candidates have the advantage would not be a referendum on congressional performance I dont think what happens Nov is going to have a thing to do with what happens with the Congress and the president Davis said There are no national issues right now that will hurt Republicans However Democrats continue to emphasize their differences with Republicans In an email sent to reporters today in advance of the NRCC briefing a DCCC spokesman suggested four questions for Tom Davis including airport security and economic stimulus questions Does he believe that Republican House candidates will pay a price at the polls if Majority Whip Tom DeLay and Majority Leader Dick Armey succeed in killing airport security improvements the spokesman asked Davis independently addressed both topics He said House Republicans simply would not rubber stamp Senate airport security legislation and stressed the importance of stimulus package It puts more pressure on a stimulus package that actually works Davis said The economy might be an issue that is front and center It might not by Mark Wegner POLITICS Republicans To Drop Filibuster Against FY Foreign Operations Senate Minority Leader Lott this afternoon said Republicans would drop their filibuster against the FY Foreign Operations appropriations bill Were going to go forward with the appropriations bills Lott told reporters Lott said Republicans are still not happy with the pace of judicial nominations under Senate Judiciary Chairman Leahy but have decided that now is not the time for them to push the issue The Senate again had failed to invoke cloture today on the motion to proceed to the Foreign Operations spending bill as senators voted along party lines Awaiting floor consideration are the Agriculture Labor HHS and District of Columbia spending bills while the Defense appropriations bill has yet to be marked up POLITICS Legislators Work Out Of Temporary Quarters House members and senators along with a selected few staff members began working out of temporary quarters today House members are using GAO headquarters at G St NW A main telephone number is not available for that location but House officials are working to post a list of legislators offices and temporary telephone numbers on the official House Web site and may send them out by email Senators and their staffs are working out of the Postal Square building near Union Station and can be reached through the main Capitol switchboard at TRADE Zoellick Reiterates The Need For Steel Industry To Restructure In the wake of Mondays announcement that the International Trade Commission had concluded that the US steel industry has suffered serious injury as a result of dumping of steel by foreign competitors Trade Representative Zoellick today reiterated the need for the industry to restructure He warned he would not go through in pressing the issue and perpetually coming to its assistance unless the industry is prepared to make needed changes Rep Phil English RPa said Monday that the ITCs ruling was no panacea but has the potential to insulate our domestic steel market from predatory dumping at a time when our domestic industry has been facing it most severe crisis in memory Similarly Rep Benjamin Cardin DMd said This ruling means that foreign producers now will need to align their capacity with domestic and global demand The ultimate objective must be to have the domestic price of steel reflect its true competitive cost of production POLITICS Largent Encouraged Not To Vacate His House Seat Rep Steve Largent ROkla who plans to resign Nov to run for governor is being encouraged not to vacate his House seat until state legislative attempts to change current law have been exhausted the Daily Oklahoman reported If Largent goes ahead with his decision to resign on that date Tulsas st District would be left without a voice in Congress during wartime conditions because under current state law the governor cannot call a special election until there is a vacancy which would trigger a process that could take as long as days Attempts to resolve the issue intensified last week when House Speaker Larry Adair gave state Reps Russ Roach a Democrat and Mark Liotta a Republican permission to work with the state Election Board on wording for an amendment that would allow Largents resignation not to become effective immediately while an election is held to replace him Largent said he will go through with his plan to resign Nov no matter what the state Legislature decides ATTACK UPDATE Britain is sending about troops to join the USled ground war in Afghanistan according to media reports today but the Defense Ministry said it had made no decisions the Associated Press reported Citing senior defense officials the British Broadcasting Corp said about Royal Marine commandos and several hundred special forces personnel currently taking part in a military exercise in Oman would be deployed to join the ground assault Four British ships participating in the exercise which ends this weekend also will stay behind to join the Afghan campaign the BBC said Meanwhile former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook suggested that there was still time for the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to hang onto power even if it handed over Osama bin Laden The government has not announced whether British troops will join the ground campaign but says it remains an option The chiefs of Britains Royal Navy and Royal Air Force were reported Monday to be drawing up plans for long term military involvement in the war against terrorism In Afghanistan US jets swooped down to strike Taliban front lines and a bin Laden stronghold north of Kabul today watched by opposition fighters hoping that the American bombardment will open the way for their advance Opposition officials also reported US attacks around the key northern city of Mazare Sharif where an opposition offensive to recapture the stronghold faltered last week Missiles set fire to critical Taliban oil supplies in the southern city of Kandahar In recent days the United States has shifted strategy drawing planes away from urban areas to target the frontline positions of the Taliban and their allies in bin Ladens alQaida network which face the opposition Northern Alliance The goal is to enable the alliance to advance toward the capital Kabul and MazareSharif to break the back of Taliban resistance From rooftops US jets could be seen as tiny white specks roaring far overhead before they swooped down to unleash their bombs A series of nine blasts from several miles away could be heard Along the Kabul front Taliban fighters were holding their ground today responding with rockets and mortars One rocket slammed into the bazaar at Charikar miles north of Kabul killing two people including a yearold vegetable vendor In Kandahar the South Asian Dispatch Agency reported US jets struck an oil depot and a fuel convoy sending a thick cloud of black smoke rising into the clear blue sky US planes also targeted an asphalt plant setting back Taliban efforts to repair the runway at Kandahar airport which has been pounded repeatedly during the air campaign the agency said The agency also reported that US jets late Monday bombed a mountain on the western outskirts of Kandahar where Taliban troops were trying to repair a radar station which had been heavily damaged earlier in the air campaign THE FINAL WORD I need to sneak some food into my office otherwise my goldfish will

ECONOMY House Heads For Partisan Vote On Stimulus Legislation Republican leaders made a strong pitch for their approach to boosting the flagging economy today but their bill faces a party line vote later this afternoon and considerable modification in the Senate House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas who crafted the bill defended the billion measures size and content He contended that in the context of a trillion economy which is basically well the bill would help companies and individuals at a crucial moment About percent of the bill would aid individuals with extra tax rebates accelerated income tax rate cuts and simplification of capital gains rules Most of the bill would go to businesses in the form of allowing more substantial writeoffs for expenses on a shortterm basis and relief from the corporate alternative minimum tax on a retroactive basis Thomas noted the Bush administration has emphasized the importance of acting quickly In fact the administration released a statement praising the timing of the bill and some components along with criticism of alternatives such as the one offered by House Ways and Means ranking member Charles Rangel DNY which would focus more on spending and pay for tax relief by freezing rate cuts for higher income people enacted earlier this year However the administration statement also praised the House for simply starting the process and expressed hope for Congress to act in a bipartisan manner House Majority Whip DeLay shrugged off the fact that the House and Senate will likely go to conference with very different approaches saying Well just have to see how the process works out With regard to a billion measure that Senate Finance Chairman Baucus laid out Tuesday and additional spending some senators are advocating DeLay chided What they are talking about is a spending program The House floor rule approved by party line vote of allows Rangel to offer an alternative and a motion to recommit Rangel said he was thankful that the rule allows for debate on the Democrats package but he complained bitterly about what he regarded as Thomas refusal to commit to a bipartisan process Democrats condemned the bill for providing billion in refundable tax credits for corporate AMT taxes paid over the last years especially they said since the companies benefiting read like a whos who of corporate influence But the GOP contends many of these companies are laying off workers and need to help to prevent further payroll hemorrhages The Blue Dog Coalition of moderate to conservative Democrats argued that the focus of congressional action should not be on either partys tax and spending priorities but the immediate needs of laidoff workers public safety and national defense To the extent additional spending is required the Blue Dogs contend these costs should be stated honestly and offset by Stephen Norton ECONOMY White House Strongly Endorses Thomas Stimulus Bill Scrapping reservations voiced just last week the Bush administration today offered a ringing endorsement of the stimulus package authored by House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas which was headed for House approval this afternoon The administration strongly supports House passage of the legislation a statement of administration policy released by OMB said today Speaking today at a small business in Glen Burnie Md President Bush urged the House to pass the Thomas legislation And then I urge the Senate to act quickly to make sure that the American people understand that in this part of our homeland defense our country and the Congress is united Bush added The president presented his tax priorities in a populist vein He called for accelerating tax relief for individuals and providing rebates to low and moderate income workers As for business Bush highlighted tax cuts he said would especially help small businesses touting proposals to eliminate the business alternative minimum tax and allow more immediate deductions for new investments Treasury Secretary ONeill last week drew the ire of House conservatives and Thomas himself by suggesting the measure was too large and by calling some of its provisions show business provisions designed to appease various constituencies looking for tax cuts White House officials today were more circumspect talking up provisions in the bill Bush agrees with but nevertheless pointing out that the Thomas measure contained proposals Bush had not suggested in his own plan The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the Thomas bill would cost billion during the current fiscal year while Bush has suggested the new package not exceed billion But with the administration expressing disappointment with the far smaller tax cut figure contained in a Senate Democratic proposal released Tuesday the White House may need as much in tax cuts as it can get from the House to get a deal Bush can accept out of a future conference The administration commends the fact that this bill is focused primarily on tax relief since Congress has already adopted adequate spending measures the OMB statement continued pledging that Bush would oppose alternative measures that contain large spending and tax increases The statement takes particular aim at plans for taxes on small businesses an apparent reference to language in the House Democratic alternative that would freeze planned reductions in the top individual tax rate which affects many small businesses OMB specifically applauded provisions in the Thomas bill that would help lowtomoderate income earners accelerate this years rate cuts increase business expensing and repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax by Keith Koffler ECONOMY Daschle Praises Baucus Alternative To House Stimulus Echoing a comment made by Treasury Secretary ONeill Senate Majority Leader Daschle today called the economic stimulus plan moving through the House this afternoon show business Daschle said Finance Chairman Baucus had done a very good job developing an alternative package and that he would be working with Appropriations Chairman Byrd on the spending side of the package but declined to say whether appropriations would be counted against a billion to billion tax cut or added on top of it Baucus said he planned to attend a meeting today with Byrd and Daschle Additionally Finance Committee Republicans plan to meet with Senate GOP leaders today on the stimulus plan Meanwhile Senate Majority Whip Reid told the US Conference of Mayors today that he would not let an economic stimulus package pass Congress without job provisions Im not going to stand aside and let this program go through unless it contains job creation Reid said Reid has proposed a major transportation improvement program for the stimulus including billion for highway infrastructure improvement billion for mass transit projects billion for Amtrak security and high speed rail development billion for airport construction and million for building marine ferries and terminals Reid criticized the House package for containing only tax provisions and said while Baucus plan contains healthcare and unemployment benefits it is not the Democrats proposal He said Senate Democrats would not likely finish their package this week The mayors have endorsed Reids transportation proposal and plan to send a broader package to newly appointed Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge Thursday Also today Senate Budget Chairman Conrad and House Budget ranking member John Spratt DSC issued a report card giving the House Ways and Means Committees billion stimulus package a failing grade on each of the five principles for a stimulus bill set out by the bipartisan chairmen and ranking members of the Budget Committees that it be temporary have an immediate impact cost roughly billion be targeted to individuals most likely to spend and hit hardest by the economic downturn and maintain fiscal discipline in the long run In contrast Conrad gave the billion stimulus legislation released by Baucus a thumbs up on all counts and called it a constructive contribution In a related development the laborliberal coalition that opposed President Bushs trillion tax cut earlier this year today urged the president to disown the billion House economic stimulus plan and vowed to pass a dramatically different stimulus in the Senate AFLCIO President John Sweeney appearing at a news conference with other leaders of the Campaign for Americas Future called the House GOPcrafted bill a total disgrace Robert Greenstein of the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities said less than percent of the GOP plan consists of aid to displaced workers and he also took aim at the socalled expensing provision in the bill which would allow companies to more quickly write off business purchases That provision has gained bipartisan support in Congress but Greenstein suggested that by making it effective for three years rather than the one year in the Baucus plan House Republicans were attempting to make this a normal part of the tax code by Geoff Earle April Fulton and Charlie Mitchell ECONOMY Debate Continues On Insurance For Recently LaidOff Even as the House prepares to vote on the economic stimulus plan debate continues unabated over the best way to help the recently laidoff keep their health insurance coverage The House GOP bill includes billion that states can use as they wish for expanded health insurance coverage The House Democratic substitute on the other hand would provide a oneyear program under which the federal government would subsidize percent of the premiums of socalled COBRA health insurance continuation for those eligible In the Senate Finance Chairman Baucus proposed Tuesday a percent COBRA subsidy for one year at an estimated cost of billion as well as a billion proposal to allow states to cover those not eligible for COBRA through the Medicaid program at an enhanced matching rate The House Democratic proposal does not include a Medicaid element because of jurisdictional reasons But Health Education Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy said that is insufficient In a floor speech this morning he called for a percent COBRA subsidy as well as an immediate percent increase in all federal Medicaid matching payments Health interest groups meanwhile are lining up with their own proposals Interestingly consumer and business groups both support COBRA subsidies noting that with average family premiums topping annually few of those losing their jobs can afford to pay that amount themselves The Healthcare Leadership Council which represents health industry and business groups wrote in a letter to President Bush earlier this month that COBRA subsidies would be a valuable necessary helping hand for workers and their families during this difficult time In a report released Monday that also calls for COBRA subsidies the Consumers Union explains the allure to business Subsidizing COBRA premiums would make coverage more attractive to healthier workers the report says This would expand the pool of covered individuals and lower the average cost of health plans for employers and insurance companies Conservative groups however have other ideas Greg Scandlen of the National Center for Policy Analysis said Congress should enact immediate tax credits to help people buy their own health coverage and make medical savings accounts currently available only to small businesses and the selfemployed universally available Rather than having to spend a month to keep their insurance intact laidoff workers might prefer a less expensive plan that will cover them in case of emergencies he wrote The Heritage Foundation agrees but adds yet another idea allow former workers to roll over unspent funds in the flexible spending accounts to pay their COBRA premiums by Julie Rovner APPROPRIATIONS Panel Approves Defense Spending Bill Puts It On Hold The House Appropriations Committee today reported out a billion FY Defense appropriations bill today but will not file the bill or put it on the House floor until the panel reconvenes to decide how to handle the presidents request for the second billion of the billion terrorism supplemental The committee also must decide when to attach that supplemental request to the Defense spending bill and make a decision about the effort by Appropriations ranking member David Obey DWis to provide even more supplemental FY funds for security and homeland defense needs In fact the markup was delayed more than a half hour as Speaker Hastert met with Appropriations Chairman Young to press him to send the Defense spending bill to the floor Thursday but Young said he could not keep to that timetable in part because the committee only got the presidents request for the second billion the day the House office buildings were evacuated to test for anthrax and has been unable to study the request But Young is also trying to work with Obey who has the backing of Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Jerry Lewis RCalif and ranking member John Murtha DPa in his effort to pump billions more into the Pentagon FBI National Security Agency Customs Service and other domestic security needs Young said he would like to get the Defense spending bill on the floor next week Obey and Young also want to preserve House appropriators prerogatives in writing the supplemental title rather than leave it to the Senate Senate appropriators have already indicated they will add the supplemental title to their version of the Defense spending bill in full committee markup while Senate Appropriations Chairman Byrd has proposed a billion homeland security and infrastructure spending package beyond the billion supplemental New York members of House Appropriations Committee also voiced their concerns that New York get the full billion that President Bush promised with Democratic Reps Jose Serrano and Maurice Hinchey worrying that the administration could fall short But Rep James Walsh RNY expressed his confidence that the White House is rock solid although some of the total might not come until next year by Lisa Caruso APPROPRIATIONS Some Appropriators Seek More Work For Boeing In a bid to boost Boeing Co congressional appropriators are working on a plan to add as many as of the companys commercial airliners to the Air Forces squadron of refueling tankers transport jets and surveillance planes congressional sources said today House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee ranking member Norman Dicks DWash a key architect of the plan said the measure could provide the company with a big boost over the next decade Were hurting here said Dicks a key Boeing ally Meanwhile the House Appropriations Committee this afternoon approved a percent increase in research and development spending for Boeing and other defense contactors The billion in RD funds proposed by the committee is a million increase over the amount requested by President Bush The bill also includes funds for the Air Force to purchase a handful of retrofitted Boeing aircraft But that could be just a down payment Dicks and other appropriators hope to approve a measure that would allow the Air Force to lease as many as Boeing airplanes over the next decade By leasing the planes Dicks said Congress would be able to acquire nearly planes without exceeding the Defense Departments budget Senate Appropriations ranking member Ted Stevens RAlaska also favors leasing the Boeing planes Dicks said Boeings congressional allies have backed a plan to equip the US military with new s since last months terrorist attacks dealt a devastating blow to the companys commercial aircraft business Most of the planes would be used to expand the Air Force fleet of refueling tankers which act as flying gas stations for fighter jets and bombers The B bombers that drop precisionguided bombs after departing their base in Missouri for example need to refuel a halfdozen times on their journey Other Boeing craft would be used to replace aging planes that house Northrop Grummanproduced surveillance equipment known as Joint Stars or JStars In an interview published in todays Washington Post Air Force Secretary James Roche said the JStars are breaking in ways we cant predict because they are so old Meanwhile Dicks today said the Bush administration has failed to build a solid case with the public for increasing defense spending as the United States fights terrorism the Associated Press reported Dicks said the world changed Sept and he believes Bush is missing an opportunity to give Americans information about the countrys eroding military capabilities I think most of the people that voted for George Bush thought he was going to do something dramatic like Ronald Reagan did to improve Americas capabilities Thus far that has not happened Dicks said I think the American people now have been shocked into the reality that we have got to reexamine our military capabilities In a letter to Congress earlier this month Bush proposed billion extra for defense beyond his original proposal of a billion defense budget by Brody Mullins CONGRESSIONAL OPERATIONS House Buildings Closed But Cannon Might Soon Open All House office buildings remained closed this afternoon as health officials await the results of environmental sweeps for anthrax according to a spokesman for House Administration Chairman Ney Earlier Ney said it was possible that the Cannon House Office Building could be reopened today but cautioned there were no guarantees Theres some talk only talk about Cannon Ney said But he noted that such a move could be problematic If you open one you have to seal off the entrances to other buildings he added The Senate took a step toward resuming normal operations with the opening today of the Russell building Senate Majority Leader Daschle told reporters he expected the Dirksen building to open no later than Friday including the mailroom which has tested positive for anthrax exposure Daschle said he hoped that technicians would be able to seal off a contaminated portion of the Hart building to allow other areas of the building to be reopened He said senators would be able to return to the building to retrieve items We want to get back to normal as quickly as we can he said Daschle gave high marks to the congressional response to the incident But noting the deaths of two District of Columbia Postal Service employees he said Clearly weve got to address the deficiencies that exist in this whole system Back on the House side House Minority Leader Gephardt indicated the Longworth House Office Building would likely take more time to reopen as investigators pursue the possibility that tainted mail reached that building from the Ford House Office Building formerly House Annex II at the foot of Capitol Hill I think Longworth because of the tests will take longer he said Gephardt also said he wanted the families of the two workers at the Brentwood Post Office who died of anthrax exposure to be covered under a previously established victims compensation fund We all failed a couple of days ago when people died in the post office Gephardt said A Gephardt spokeswoman said Congress might have to pass an amendment that would include the postal workers Meanwhile FBI Director Robert Mueller told a gathering of the nations mayors today that no link has been established between the Sept hijackings and the recent anthrax attacks the Associated Press reported At this point it is not clear if the few confirmed anthrax exposures were motivated by organized terrorism Mueller told the US Conference of Mayors But these attacks were clearly meant to terrorize a country already on the edge He said more than FBI personnel has been assigned to the hijacking and anthrax investigations And in an appearance today on ABCs Good Morning America Postmaster General John Potter warned Americans there are no guarantees the mail delivered to their homes is safe but he stressed that the risks to them are slim Were asking people to handle mail very carefully Potter said People have to be aware of everything in their daytoday life and certainly mail in our system is threatened right now There are no guarantees that that mail is safe At the White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer later said The mail is overwhelmingly safe but everybody needs to be alert by Geoff Earle and Mark Wegner TRADE Zoellick Touts Administration Support For Farm Trade Trade Representative Zoellick today issued an affirmative statement of the Bush administrations commitment to keeping the American agriculture sector strong Opening markets for US farmers and ranchers is a top priority of our trade agenda Zoellick said Zoellick also praised as formidable the skills of agriculture negotiator Allen Johnson who accompanied Zoellick on recent trip to Asia and is preparing for important talks on agricultural issues at the World Trade Organization ministerial meeting in Doha Qatar in November Zoellick also stressed the importance of renewing presidential trade negotiating authority although opposition to a bill offered by House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas remains stubborn from key groups Many Democrats even those who are protrade contend the bill is too weak on labor and environmental standards Some members from textile and agricultural states also say they are wary because previous trade pacts have hurt their industries Zoellick this week said the time had come to set a date for floor consideration of the bill and Thomas said he agrees Ultimately Congress has the final say in determining whether a trade agreement is good for American farmers Zoellick said But he insisted that trade negotiating authority is a needed first step which he characterized as vital to improving the economic environment for agriculture Agriculture negotiator Johnson stressing Bushs emphasis on opening markets for US producers said We will be in constant communication with agricultural food community and Congress throughout the negotiating process to make sure we create significant positive benefits for US agriculture In addition Zoellick and Johnson acknowledged today that many US trade partners maintain tradedistorting subsidies but said the administration is determined to defend US rights before the WTO Specifically they cited success in cases involving Canadian export subsidies of its dairy industry and barriers to Koreas market faced by beef producers GOP House leaders have been looking to get the trade authority bill on the floor since July but have postponed the vote for a variety of reasons not the least of which is that they do not have the votes House Majority Whip DeLay acknowledged today they need more time to shore up the votes but said he had no idea how much more time He said trade votes are always close and said he was not alarmed that the gap between where GOP leaders want to be and where they are at this time by Stephen Norton TRANSPORTATION Bush Vows Push For House GOP Aviation Security Bill Vice President Cheney told House Majority Leader Armey and House Majority Whip DeLay at a White House meeting Tuesday night that he will join with them to press for passage of aviation security legislation authored by House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Young White House officials confirmed today I hope to do this legislation this week if we can Armey said leadership aides indicated Tuesday that a final decision on how to move the bill had not been made but that it would likely go straight to the floor White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said President Bush wants the House measure to get to conference committee where he hopes lawmakers will improve the Senatepassed aviation security bill Fleischer said Bush opposes the Senate measure because of provisions putting airport security workers on the federal payroll and that the president remains willing to move by executive order if he does not get a bill he likes He wants a bill he can sign He still is prepared if necessary to enact this through an executive order if the result of the conference is not satisfactory Fleischer said However Bush earlier this month said he would not oppose the Senate bill and a spokesman for the key sponsor of the Senate bill Commerce Chairman Hollings said Hollings has had no indication that the president has changed his mind As for House action the spokesman said All indications are that the rank and file support the Senates approach and are ready and willing to pass that bill if given the opportunity A Young aide said the House bill would offer the president the flexibility to federalize workers if he chooses and expressed hope that a floor vote on the measure can be scheduled next week Trying to get a whip count now is almost impossible the aide said referring to the difficulty of coordination among members due to the closing of the House office buildings for anthrax screening Young Armey and DeLay are expected to hold a news conference Thursday in an effort to shore up support for the bill Meanwhile House Democrats today renewed their push for a vote on an aviation security bill that would allow for federalized security workers House Minority Leader Gephardt singled out Armey and DeLay for holding up action on the bill Here we are six weeks after the Sept terrorist attacks because of an ideological concern of a minority of the majority Gephardt said Mr DeLay and Mr Armey have make it clear they dont want this bill brought up Gephardt said it was an incredible statement for Armey to oppose federalizing airport security workers because they might join labor unions noting that many are already unionized House Transportation and Infrastructure ranking member James Oberstar DMinn who has offered his own bill said today that committee leadership met Tuesday evening but reached no consensus Oberstar said he expected floor action soon Weve been told that theyre likely to bring something up next week he said by Keith Koffler April Fulton and Mark Wegner FINANCE Gramm Industrys Reinsurance Proposal A NonStarter Senate Banking ranking member Phil Gramm RTexas whose role is key to establishing a federal reinsurance mechanism covering future property and casualty losses due to terrorist acts today labeled an industry plan as a nonstarter and took issue with aspects of a Bush administration plan on the grounds it was not sufficiently marketoriented In remarks at the first of two hearings on the topic Gramm described the insurance industry plan as a governmentsanctioned mutual insurance pool which he said was totally alien to my thinking and personally a non starter At the same time Gramm took issue with the aspect of the White Houses threeyear plan requiring the federal government to pay percent of the first billion in claims in the first year Instead Gramm advocated setting a system in which the industry would be percent liable up to a certain dollar threshold at which point the federal government would take over That would help put pressure on the industry to establish a permanent mechanism he said Treasury Secretary ONeill emphasized the administrations belief that there is a real and pressing need for a mechanism to provide terrorism insurance coverage While saying he thought the White House plan was the most workable ONeill emphasized he was open to working with Congress on alternative approaches Under questioning by Gramm ONeill agreed the industrys pool idea was a non starter Senate Banking Chairman Sarbanes who has kept his public comments on the insurance topic to a minimum in the days leading up to the hearing remained mostly noncommittal in his remarks and questions today Gramm made several pointed references to the fact that the insurance issue is squarely within the Banking Committees jurisdiction and took some veiled swipes at the Senate Commerce Committee which is claiming jurisdiction as well Sources said the Commerce Committee could convene a hearing Thursday on the subject Gramm said he believed any terrorism insurance proposal written would become an amendment to the Defense Production Act which also is under the Banking Committees jurisdiction Sen Bill Nelson DFla who served as a state insurance commissioner during the Hurricane Andrew crisis of also took issue with the prospect of putting taxpayers on the hook for the first dollar of coverage Nelson strongly urged the Congress to make sure the insurance industry has skin in the game I know from our experience in Florida that the insurance industry is more than willing to walk away from its biggest risks and then turn them over to somebody else Nelson also suggested the panel look to enact a shortterm fix no more than one year and then revisit the issue more deliberatively in January Sen Charles Schumer DNY took issue with that suggestion noting that a multiyear mechanism would be needed to provide adequate assurance to financiers of large real estate projects by Pamela Barnett AGRICULTURE Harkin Farm Bill Proposal Would Double Some Spending Senate Agriculture Chairman Harkin is considering a farm bill proposal that would more than double federal expenditures on marketing loans and loan deficiency payments but there may be a limitation on the amounts according to documents circulating among farm lobbyists and made available to CongressDaily Lobbyists who made the proposal available stressed that the Harkin plan is still in development and it could change before he issues it publicly which he probably will do by the end of the week Democratic Senate Agriculture Committee staffers have been working as best they can away from the Capitol due to the anthrax scare the lobbyists said and have been doing financial calculations by hand because they do not have normal access to CBO computers Harkins proposal would extend Freedom to Farm payments raise all loan rates from current levels except those for oilseeds and include a countercyclical proposal The Freedom to Farm payments would reflect the cost of production for different crops and would be made for oilseeds as well as traditional program crops The spending on marketing loans and loan deficiency payments would more than double from billion to billion Harkin is also studying a limitation on loan and deficiency payments based on maximum production for each crop rather than based on a dollar amount The current dollar limit is per recipient and the Housepassed farm bill changes that to The countercyclical program would be constructed cropbycrop rather than statebystate and payments would be determined by the difference between a base period of and the current year which is similar to the program proposed last year by House Agriculture ranking member Charles Stenholm DTexas Harkin is considering constructing the limit by figuring the top to percent of largest production quantity the farm has reported and excluding production in excess of to percent from the payments Harkin also is considering a payment limitation based on all programs from which the farmer receives money The source also said Harkin plans to spend billion on commodity programs over years rather than the billion in the House bill Meanwhile Bush administration officials convinced several commodity producer groups last week to send a letter Tuesday to Senate Majority Leader Daschle urging him to go slow with the farm bill But if Harkin writes a farm bill the groups like better than the Housepassed bill at least some of them will push for passage this year a key farm lobbyist told CongressDaily The lobbyist said the farm leaders invited to the White House last Thursday such as producers of corn soybean fresh fruits and vegetables and livestock were those who have expressed discontent with the Housepassed farm bill But the lobbyist said the letter was a bone to the administration and pointed out that the same groups also are advising Harkin on the development of his bill If the Harkin bill is better for their members than the House bill the groups will instead urge the Senate to move ahead quickly with the farm bill The lobbyist also noted the White House has not said what commodity income support and risk management policies it would support by Jerry Hagstrom JUDICIARY House Approves Compromise AntiTerrorism Bill The House gave overwhelming approval today to a compromise antiterrorism bill giving police new power to secretly search the homes of terrorism suspects tap all their phones and track their use of the Internet Senate Majority Leader Daschle said it is possible the Senate would pass the antiterrorism legislation by the end of the day Thursday and predicted it would pass with a pretty overwhelming vote Daschle also called bioterrorism legislation one of the key issues facing the Congress He said the legislation will coordinate the efforts of federal state and local authorities and hospitals plan a rapid response and stockpile antibiotics However there still may be a snag in the Senate Sen Ron Wyden DOre has threatened to block final approval because of a compromise that Senate negotiators made to get House approval The original Senate bill tinkered with a law known as the McDade amendment after former Rep Joseph McDade RPa whose reputation was clouded by a lengthy racketeering case before he won acquittal in It prevents federal prosecutors from using investigative techniques such as wiretaps or undercover stings that are disallowed under ethics rules enforced by state and local bar associations but not barred by federal law The Senate fix would loosen those restrictions ENVIRONMENT Jeffords Delays Action On MultiPollutant Legislation Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman Jeffords has delayed action on multipollutant legislation by a week the committee announced today The panel postponed a Thursday hearing on the legislation until Nov A vote on the bill originally scheduled for Nov has not been rescheduled The Clean Power Act introduced by Jeffords would require electric utilities to reduce the amount of harmful emissions released into the atmosphere SCHEDULE Daschle Hopes To Conclude Work By Thanksgiving Senate Majority Leader Daschle said today that he is hopeful that we can conclude all of our work by Thanksgiving despite the logistical problems posed by the closure of House and Senate office buildings for much of the past week due to anthrax screening That target also appears to be gaining currency among Senate Republicans who have called off their filibuster of appropriations bills the filibuster had been over the issue of confirmation of judicial nominees It makes some sense for us to get our essential stuff done and get out of here said Sen Wayne Allard RColo who added that once the congressional office buildings are thoroughly cleaned Congress can come back with a fresh start POLITICS Former Ganske Aide To Take Post At Insurance Association Heather EilersBowser has left her post as senior legislative assistant with Rep Greg Ganske RIowa to become director of legislative affairs at the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors EilersBowser previously served as a legislative assistant to former Rep Linda Smith RWash Eilers Bowser will handle issues relating to property and casualty insurance and financial services regulation

Senate Republicans To Embrace Bushs Stimulus Plan Senate Republicans will step into the economic stimulus debate by backing President Bushs proposals but bypassing the plan authored by House Republicans as well as proposals by Senate Finance Chairman Baucus and other Senate Democrats Sources said ideas Bush outlined three weeks ago could be put into legislative language as early as this week These include corporate alternative minimum tax relief accelerated income tax rate cuts rebates for lowto middleincome workers expanded health and unemployment benefits and more generous write offs for business investments Senate GOP sources said the meeting of Senate Republican leadership and administration officials was called so Finance Committee Republicans could clarify the details of the presidents proposal in order to produce legislation the entire GOP Conference can rally around What is most likely to unite Senate Republicans one source said is something akin to what the president proposed But ultimately weve got to write something here After meeting in Minority Leader Lotts office with key GOP ranking members Treasury Secretary ONeill and White House Director of Legislative Affairs Nicholas Calio Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah said Show me that any one of the four points the president recommended would not stimulate the economy and show me how anything the Democrats are recommending would stimulate the economy Hatch contended that the spending many Democrats want to see would be destimulative Senate Appropriations Chairman Byrd and Majority Whip Reid have proposed a billion package of homeland security and infrastructure spending that could serve as the spending component of their stimulus bill Sen Phil Gramm RTexas predicted the public would reject the piracy inherent in Democratic spending plans in contrast to Bushs simple call for a limited economic boost Gramm said Bush already has compromised by allowing up to percent of the stimulus to be allotted to spending That was for the Democrats just for being there That is the price they are going to charge Gramm said But he and Hatch said the time had come to draw a line There has got to be some give on their part too Hatch said Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley RIowa added that Bushs agreement to accept an additional rebate was also a concession to Democrats Grassley said his GOP colleagues still want him to work with Majority Leader Daschle in crafting a bipartisan agreement but time is of the essence according to a letter by IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti to Grassley Rossotti said Congress would need to act by Nov to get additional rebate checks out and make other adjustments to tax documents by the end of the year by Stephen Norton and Lisa Caruso TRANSPORTATION House To Vote On Aviation Security Measure Next Week Bolstered by a letter of support that President Bush sent to Speaker Hastert today House GOP leaders scheduled a vote on their version of an aviation security bill for next Wednesday This is later than we should have been to get this bill on the floor said Majority Leader Armey adding that it is a shame a fight has to be made The major point of dissent is over whether to make most airport security officials federal workers as the Senate bill does or merely increase government standards and supervision while letting the president decide whether to federalize workers as Bush and House Republicans prefer In the letter Bush criticized proposals to federalize workers but stopped short of saying he would veto the bill saying Such an inflexible onesizefits all requirement fails to permit security tailored to the very different circumstances that exist at airports across the country Transportation Secretary Mineta appearing with GOP leaders to endorse their approach said today there is nothing wrong with a low bid as long as you have high standards When asked why a vote has taken so long since the Senate passed its bill two weeks ago House Republicans blamed Democrats Were sorry we havent been able to reach an agreement with the Democrats on it and were sorry the issue has to be politicized said Transportation and Infrastructure Aviation Subcommittee Chairman John Mica RFla who wrote the House GOP bill with Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Young But Majority Whip DeLay told reporters earlier this month the House would not schedule a vote on the bill until it had the votes House Democrats have proposed a bill of their own that would federalize workers and say the US public supports the idea Were hopeful it will come up next week and well have a good sensible alternative Minority Leader Gephardt said Gephardt said he expects Democrats will have an opportunity to offer their alternative The speaker has been very positive and encouraging he said My belief is that if we sent Bush a reasonable bill that has bipartisan support that he would sign the bill Meanwhile Transportation Department officials are attempting to reassure the public that they are taking steps to improve security in the interim even as news organizations reported today that a man accidentally took a gun on a plane in his briefcase FAA Administrator Jane Garvey told the US Conference of Mayors which supports full federalization of airport security that the administration is considering issuing smart cards to identify passengers who do not pose a risk has deployed more sky marshals and has freed up some funds airports could use for security operations temporarily that would ordinarily go toward airport infrastructure improvements The government also intends to be able to screen all luggage and cargo by Garvey said which some mayors said was not soon enough Garvey said she was confident in the final analysis that all sides will be willing to compromise by April Fulton and Mark Wegner OUTLOOK Appropriations To Dominate Next Weeks Floor Schedule After the Senate votes on antiterrorism legislation today it is scheduled to take up the FY Agriculture appropriations bill Senate Majority Leader Daschle said he would focus on appropriations bills next week with the District of Columbia and LaborHHS appropriations bills slated to come up next He said he then would devote more attention to an economic stimulus package Daschle said he and other key Democrats have not decided whether to move stimulus items in one bill or more than one bill He said Appropriations Chairman Byrd had assembled an excellent package of spending proposals that he said met his key criteria of producing an immediate stimulative effect Meanwhile the House will reconvene next week Tuesday with votes on suspension bills scheduled for after pm A spokesman for House Majority Leader Armey said the House is scheduled to take up airline security legislation Wednesday see related story above House members also face votes next week on the FY Defense appropriations bill and conference reports for the FY TreasuryPostal and Legislative Branch appropriations bills in addition to any other available conference reports for spending bills No Friday votes next week are expected Technicians today continued to sweep congressional office buildings for anthrax after a location near the freight elevator on the Hart Senate Office Buildings first floor testified positive for anthrax exposure Daschle called the new discovery troubling because it is not known what the connection is between Daschles office suite on the fifth and sixth floors where an anthraxtainted letter was received last week and the freight elevator One possibility is that the elevator was used to deliver the contaminated letter to Daschles office Nevertheless Daschle emphasized that only a trace of anthrax was discovered at the elevator and said further cleanup efforts could allow more facilities to open soon Technicians undertook remediation efforts using a foam to eliminate anthrax from the Senate Dirksen building mailroom Wednesday Daschle said that if tests on the building turn out negative it would be open Friday He also said efforts were under way to seal off the offices in the Hart buildings southeast quadrant to allow senators and staff in other areas of the Hart building to return to work I am very confident that we will be able to seal it in a way that will provide us complete confidence that we can access the rest of the building without any hazardous exposure he said Daschle also vowed that once a new system is set up there will not be one piece of mail that will come on the Hill without an adequate test He noted that senators receive thousands of pieces of mail each week and that it is a vital way to communicate with constituents Daschle was guarded in his response to reports that the type of anthrax used in the attack in his office is highly sophisticated and likely derives from facilities either in the United States the former Soviet Union or Iraq Ive been told that this is a common variety of anthrax he said adding that it may be a little more aerosolable than usual Daschle emphasized that the anthrax used responds to treatment with antibiotics Daschle said he would try to strike a balance in the response to current or future attacks saying it is neither healthy nor helpful to exacerbate the paranoia or fear He said a group of government health officials had responded prudently to the incident Have they done it perfectly The answer of course is no he said by Geoff Earle and Mark Wegner HEALTH House Democrats Want Billion To Fight Bioterrorism House Democrats today unveiled a billion package to fight bioterrorism including far more funding for state and local preparedness than the Bush administration has proposed Cities towns and counties on the front line in this fight should have the resources to reduce the threat from biological terror said Minority Leader Gephardt who was flanked by more than a dozen members of the Democratic Homeland Security Task Force that drafted the measure which was led by House Democratic Caucus Vice Chairman Robert Menendez of New Jersey The bill would provide at least billion directly to state and local agencies to beef up their ability to plan for and respond to potential attacks compared to million proposed by the administration The Democrats bill would also authorize funds to boost the amount of drugs and vaccines in the national pharmaceutical stockpile to increase protections for the nations food and water supply and to increase the ability of the military and intelligence community to address bioterrorism Gephardt said he hoped the measure would become a bipartisan one Democrats talked about it in general terms with Bush administration Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge Wednesday he said but added We thought the first thing to do was to get our own heads together Meanwhile negotiations are continuing in the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee over a bipartisan bioterrorism bill A spokesman for Health Education Labor and Pensions Chairman Kennedy said he has reduced his funding proposal from billion to around billion but that remains too high for most Republicans The number is still the big sticking point said an aide to HELP ranking member Judd Gregg RNH Greggs spokeswoman said the policy part of the measure is starting to come together and that it will consist of three major sections One will address food safety issues a second will provide more authority for HHS and the last will provide new incentives for drug companies to develop drugs and vaccines to combat bioterrorism agents Also Senate Majority Leader Daschle said at his news conference today he would support a bioterrorism bill that focused on three elements creating as many new vaccines as possible improving the governments ability to respond to bioterrorism threats and the agricultural aspects of bioterrorism A Daschle aide later said Daschles agroterrorism priorities are increasing food inspection increasing security at USDA labs and other facilities and improving the governments ability to trace tainted food back to the source of contamination The aide said Daschle is working with Sen Pat Roberts RKan to incorporate elements of the agroterrorism bill that Roberts has introduced with legislation being developed by Kennedy and Sens Bill Frist RTenn Hillary Rodham Clinton DNY and Richard Durbin DIll Durbin this afternoon said he intends to offer an amendment to the KennedyFrist bill that would require food manufacturers to register with the FDA give the FDA authority to inspect food plant companies records grant USDA and FDA mandatory recall authority and give the FDA the authority to detain contaminated food a power USDA already has Durbin would also place further controls on imported foods and require imported foods to be labeled to indicate country of origin by Julie Rovner and Jerry Hagstrom FINANCE Insurance Industry Pleads For A Reinsurance Backstop Private sector and financial industry officials came on bended knee before the Senate Banking Committee today making a case for the creation of a two to three year federal terrorism reinsurance backstop which they described as being pivotal to preventing a disastrous ripple effect in the US economy Several committee members in turn took pains to compliment the insurance industry for stepping up to the plate and agreeing to promptly paying claims associated with the Sept terrorist attacks Todays hearing marked the second day of testimony taken by the Senate Banking panel which is attempting to reach consensus on a shortterm mechanism that will help the insurance industry and its commercial clients transition to the realities of property and casualty coverage in the postSept environment Senate Banking ranking member Phil Gramm RTexas who drew considerable attention at Wednesdays hearing by criticizing aspects both of an industry and White House plan as not being sufficiently marketoriented made remarks today which were less rhetorically combative I dont expect any insurance company to put its capital at risk on a proposition that has no hope of being a success Gramm said He and other senators including Sen Christopher Dodd DConn warmly praised the insurance industry for their response to the Sept attacks As for the mechanics of the backstop Gramm said he was leaning towards a modified version of the White Houses threeyear proposal However Gramm said he would prefer a twoyear program that effectively started with the terms contained in the second year of the White House plan Gramm also suggested that the mechanism kick in for acts of terrorism as defined not by the media but by the attorney general Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chairman Further Gramm emphasized his desire to ensure that the federal government is not the first dollar payer Overall Gramm said the White House plan was a good start and proposed that with time running so short in the session Congress use it as the base Insurance reinsurance and banking industry officials said they preferred two to three years given the multiyear nature of most largescale construction projects Some of the bluntest testimony was delivered by Thomas Donohue president and CEO of the US Chamber of Commerce Donohue said federal assistance for the industry was inevitable to counter the economic impact associated with the lack of or prohibitively priced insurance coverage He quipped You can cover me now or you can cover me later Donohue emphasized his desire to see a mechanism that keeps the private sector up to their necks without letting them go under Leslie Bud Baker chairman of Wachovia Corp one of the five largest commercial real estate lenders offered a bankers perspective Only the federal government can provide the insurance industry the breathing room it needs he said Robert Vagley of the American Insurance Association emphasized Its not a bail outThe primary beneficiaries of such legislation are our customers and the US economy Baker said No insurance no lending no lending no economy We need your help by Pamela Barnett APPROPRIATIONS House Unanimously Passes CR To Last Through Nov The House today unanimously approved its fourth FY continuing resolution to extend federal government funding at FY levels through Nov when Congress is scheduled to recess for the weeklong Thanksgiving break Although just two FY spending bills Interior and Military Construction have been conferenced and sent to the president a House Appropriations Committee spokesman said the panel is optimistic that the remaining could be finalized before this continuing resolution runs out A conference committee on the Treasury Postal spending bill is scheduled to meet this afternoon while the Energy and Water appropriations conference is for next Tuesday the VAHUD spending bill conference also expected sometime next week The House has one more FY appropriations bill yet to approve the billion Defense spending bill that was reported out of committee Wednesday But it will not be filed until sometime next week so the committee can write a separate title that Appropriations Chairman Young hopes to attach to the Defense spending bill which would allocate the second billion in emergency supplemental funds Congress appropriated last month in response to the Sept terrorist attacks While Appropriations ranking member David Obey DWis has called for adding tens of billions more to the bill to further fund defense and homeland security needs Young remained noncommittal about whether he agrees with Obey that more money should be appropriated now Whatevers needed whenever its needed will be provided Young told reporters He noted that at present the president and GOP leaders are not inclined to spend more than the billion already appropriated for the remainder of this session of Congress although most have acknowledged the president will likely have to request another FY supplemental early next year Also today Senate Budget ranking member Pete Domenici R NM introduced legislation to amend the FY budget resolution and budget law to raise the statutory cap on FY discretionary spending to billion in budget authority and billion in outlays The legislation which is needed to avert a vote point of order against legislation that exceeds the cap brings the FY spending ceiling in line with the figure negotiated last month by the White House and congressional appropriators Domenicis bill which has the administrations support would also reset the socalled paygo scorecard back to zero requiring any additional mandatory spending or tax cuts to either be offset or declared an emergency by Lisa Caruso DEFENSE Dems Push For Homeland Post Despite Bushs Protests Two key Democrats will not give up a drive to enact legislation creating a Cabinetlevel Homeland Security Department despite a direct plea from President Bush Im going to continue to push here said Rep Jane Harman DCalif who has emerged as a key player on the issue Senate Governmental Affairs Chairman Lieberman also has pledged to continue pushing the bill sources said Whether we can enact a law before November isnt clear but we can start the process Harman said The Democrats resistance comes as White House Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge signaled today a willingness to accept legislation after he has a chance to settle into the new role and said he would be very open minded to legislation at a later date But added Right now I dont believe I need statutory authority to do what the president has asked me to do On Wednesday a bipartisan group of senators and House members began working to merge a handful of related homeland security measures into a single bill Lieberman convened a closeddoor session in the Capitol and said he would not back off the effort Later that day President Bush hosted the top Democrats and Republicans on congressional Intelligence Armed Services and Government Affairs committees to give a status report on the administrations efforts to fight terrorism He also asked Congress to hold off on legislation in order to give the White House more time to set up its Office of Homeland Security After the meeting one key member Senate Intelligence Chairman Graham agreed to back off When the president of the United States has a position on that it has influence Graham said Separately the US Conference of Mayors today endorsed a plan to make the Homeland Security Office a fullfledged Cabinet level position with budgetary authority and direct control over a slew of federal agencies involved in antiterrorism efforts During a conference today in Washington the mayors also called on Ridge to create a permanent commission of mayors and local officials to advise the White House on ways to improve coordination on antiterrorism efforts We strongly support giving this office all the authority and funding that it needs New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial said Ridge speaking at the mayors conference said he has all the power he needs for now saying I certainly have access I know I have the authority by Brody Mullins POLITICS Senate Passes Legislation Giving Police Expanded Powers The Senate this afternoon sent President Bush legislation by a vote giving police new and expanded powers to track punish and detain suspected terrorists The House passed it with overwhelming support Wednesday and Bush is expected to sign it before the end of the week The legislation somewhat weakened from what Attorney General Ashcroft proposed expands the FBIs wiretapping and electronic surveillance authority and imposes stronger penalties for harboring or financing terrorists It also redefines what terrorist acts are and increases the punishment for them POLITICS Hastert Warns Patronage Appointees Should Not Run Lincoln Library House Speaker Hastert warned Wednesday that the million Abraham Lincoln Library and Museum in Springfield Ill should not be run by patronage appointees from outgoing GOP Gov George Ryans administration the Chicago Tribune reported Although Hastert did not name names his rebuke was clearly aimed at the governor and Ryans chief of staff Robert Newtson Ryan has said Newtson is eminently qualified to become the librarys director even as the governor picked a panel to conduct a nationwide search to fill the post Hastert has been perplexed by the political controversy Ryan has created over the library directors post particularly since he came to the governors defense in a dispute over the library last year with GOP Sen Peter Fitzgerald Fitzgerald raised the possibility that Ryan would steer up to million in federal construction funds for the project to cronies and attempted a filibuster to force the Senate to demand safeguards to prevent that from happening The filibuster failed but Hastert accused Fitzgerald of political grandstanding and making unfair personal attacks on Ryans integrity POLITICS Largent To Submit A Letter Of Resignation Friday Rep Steve Largent ROkla will submit a letter of resignation Friday but it will not take effect until Feb so voters in his Tulsabased st District can choose a successor without losing representation The Daily Oklahoman reported Largent who had already announced his intent to resign Nov so he can focus on his race for governor next year was able to do so after the Oklahoma Legislature rushed through a change that enables a special election to be held before he actually resigns Largent hopes to succeed GOP Gov Frank Keating whose wife Cathy is among the candidates seeking Largents seat The bill approved Tuesday and signed into law by Lt Gov Mary Fallin Wednesday sets the primary election for Dec with a runoff if needed on Jan and the special election Feb If no runoff is needed then the special election would be held Jan Besides Keating Republican state Rep John Sullivan and state Sen Scott Pruitt are seeking the seat while former Tulsa School Board member Doug Dodd seeks the Democratic nomination ATTACK UPDATE US jets bombed the front lines north of Kabul

the Taliban At the Islamic militias southern stronghold of Kandahar US strikes hit a bus near the city gates and at least civilians were killed in a fiery explosion the Taliban and residents said But the claim could not be independently verified For a fifth straight day US jets roared over the front line about miles north of the capital city of Kabul swooping down and dropping bombs on Taliban positions on the Shomali Plain The pattern of attacks suggested the United States was trying to push the Taliban back from the oppositioncontrolled Bagram airport so the Northern Alliance can use the airfield Meanwhile in New York the Secret Service is investigating two vials containing salmonella that were sent to former President Clintons office in Harlem A Secret Service spokesman said vials containing an unknown substance were in a package received at Clintons office in early October with certain writings were included in the package but he did not elaborate Clinton did not handle the package and nobody has gotten sick from it Also an employee at a State Department mail facility in Virginia has been hospitalized with anthrax it was announced this afternoon THE FINAL WORD I liked it better when Mr Obey was against the bill because he didnt talk so long House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee ranking member John Murtha DPa commenting Wednesday on the unusual and lengthy opening

Business Roundtable To Start M Trade Ad Campaign Although the bills prospects are uncertain at best the Business Roundtable is preparing a major new effort to pass presidential trade negotiating authority shelling out more than million for advertising targeted at uncommitted House legislators The BRT already has television and radio spots in the can for the new campaign which will begin this weekend and extend throughout portions of the next two weeks Depending on the timing of a vote the campaign could be extended and much more cash will be made available from the BRTs sizable kitty We will spend what it takes to counter labors message of misinformation said one BRT official Indeed the campaign is in part a direct response to recent advertising by labor groups opposed to the legislation and many of the BRT ads will appear in districts targeted by the unions Most of the legislators in the BRTs crosshairs are Democrats Democratic support for trade negotiating authority has been anemic so far and many business lobbyists are now focusing on Democrats with the expectation that the administration will be able to keep GOP ranks in line But the expenditure still could amount to a gamble House Republican leaders once eager to schedule a vote on the measure are now refusing to say when they will put it on the floor And labor operatives say they are confident they can defeat it Nevertheless other backers of the bill are ramping up their efforts President Bush was set at presstime to promote trade negotiating authority during an East Room appearance The president was planning to describe the trade bill energy legislation and the economic stimulus measure as a comprehensive package designed to bolster the economy And the US Chamber of Commerce is also planning to put up a series of radio ads touting trade negotiating authority including Spanish languageonly spots according to a Chamber official Among the legislators targeted by the BRT are Reps Dennis Moore DKan Tom Sawyer DOhio Shelley Moore Capito RWVa Bob Etheridge DNC David Price DNC and Melissa Hart R Pa Other districts on the list are in California Washington and Indiana The BRT expects spillover into radio and television markets not directly targeted to reach portions of another congressional districts The buys will supplement a print campaign that is partially underway and which is centered mainly inside the Beltway The BRT is also mobilizing its goTRADE advocacy network which has a presence in districts to visit and phone lawmakers and work the local media The Chambers radio ads will also run mainly in Democratic districts The Chambers Spanish language ads will emphasize that trade negotiating authority could help secure trade agreements with countries in Central and Latin America The Chambers campaign is designed to highlight the business communitys view that the legislation is essential for keeping the United States engaged internationally by Keith Koffler TRADE Survey Shows Public Support For Trade Expansion Even as Congress rushes to consider legislation renewing presidential trade negotiating authority four out of five Americans say they know little or nothing about the issue according to a national poll commissioned by the Association of Women in International Trade That poll was conducted among US adults Oct and released today by EPICMRA a Lansing Michbased polling firm However once trade authority formerly known as fast track was explained to the survey respondents percent said they would support it while percent said they opposed it and percent were undecided The poll has a point error margin The approval rate is exactly the same proportion of supporters found in a Pew Research Center poll conducted in September Overall support for trade and economic globalization remains strong More than half percent of those questioned nationwide said they approved of free trade agreements with the strongest support in Western states percent and the strongest disapproval in the Midwest percent As was the case in past such surveys free trade support generally grows with age income and education More than half of union members percent said they also approved of free trade deals More broadly percent said they think globalization has a positive impact on society In September the Pew poll found percent thought globalization was a good thing One sign of the appeal of antiglobalization sentiments among the young is that disapproval of free trade agreements was highest percent among generation X those born after Backhanded support for the North American Free Trade Agreement continued to grow Barely half those questioned percent think the United States should change or pull out of the trade deal with Canada and Mexico compared with percent who felt that way in As the economy has turned sour there has been a slight growth in protectionist sentiments but the public seems unwilling to put their money where their mouth is One out of two people questioned thought protecting certain companies from foreign competition was a good idea But the amount of money they were willing to spend out of their family budgets to pay for higher priced domestic goods actually declined to only per month down percent since by Bruce Stokes APPROPRIATIONS House Panel Faces Decisions On Defense Supplemental Next week the House Appropriations Committee and the GOP leadership face a number of pivotal decisions about the size and scope of the FY Defense appropriations bill as Appropriations ranking member David Obey DWis continues his determined push to add tens of billions more for the Pentagon and homeland security while New York members push just as hard to secure billions beyond what the president requested for their states needs The panel reported out the billion Defense spending bill Wednesday but will not file it until next week as it pulls together a separate title to allocate the second billion of the billion emergency supplemental Congress passed after Sept Obey wants to pump that up with more billions for the war on terrorism with added funds for the FBI CIA National Security Agency border patrol the Customs Service and public health agencies even though the president has told Congress he does not intend to request another supplemental White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer this afternoon repeated the administrations position that billion should be sufficient for this year But at Wednesdays markup as both Democrats and Republicans lamented that the bill represented a peacetime defense budget that came in below the presidents budget Obey said legislators have a patriotic duty to decide whether or not we think the administrations supplemental request is really adequate House leaders have said that until the president signals he wants more money the supplemental will have to be limited to billion An Obey spokesman said panel Democrats are working with Republicans to build support for more defense and security dollars and that if Obey is unsuccessful in committee he will take it to the floor He added There is no tactic or procedure that will be off the table We want to move forward in a bipartisan way but we are also going to do everything we can to make sure a lot of those security holes are filled Another Democratic aide questioned whether Republicans want to vote against more money for such GOP favorites as the Pentagon and national security At the same time the committee is grappling with how much to provide in the supplemental for security it will have to address New Yorks needs Of the billion supplemental New Yorkers say Bush promised their state billion And while some such as VAHUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman James Walsh R NY are willing to wait until next year to get the full billion others insist the entire billion be provided now To date the administration says billion has been released for New Yorks recovery and another billion was included in Bushs request for the second billion allotment But several New York Democrats want far more than billion in the committees supplemental title Appropriations member Maurice Hinchey DNY said That billion all should be appropriated this year for New York City and state and it should come out of the billion supplemental That was the basic understanding between the New York delegation and Bush Hinchey also rejected the notion that some of the billion could be provided in the economic stimulus package by Lisa Caruso CONGRESSIONAL OPERATIONS Dirksen Opens But Mailroom Closed Ford To Open Sat The Dirksen Senate Office Building reopened today although the buildings mailroom which tested positive for anthrax exposure remains closed A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Daschle said no final decision had been made on what method technicians would employ to conduct remediation of the Hart Senate Office Building where anthrax was discovered at three different sites Daschle has said it could take days or weeks to open the building and Hart building staff continue to make contingency plans to deal with a prolonged dislocation At the White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters that despite its virulence and sophistication the anthrax in a letter received by Daschles office Oct could be produced by a PhD microbiologist in a sophisticated laboratory Fleischer still did not rule out that the substance was manufactured by a state or some other largescale operation But he indicated the anthrax was not of the most sophisticated type that could only be produced by a state significantly broadening the universe of potential suppliers Fleischer emphasized that the new understanding of which administration officials became aware Thursday night sheds no light on who actually sent the anthrax since those who sent it and those who produced it may not be the same President Bushs suspicion that Osama bin Laden may have ordered the anthrax sent is unchanged by the new information Fleischer said Meanwhile the Ford and Longworth House office buildings remain closed but health officials expect to reopen the Ford building Saturday after completing anthrax decontamination of the buildings mailroom according to an advisory from House leadership posted on a Web site late Thursday The Longworth House Office Building is scheduled to remain closed at least throughout the weekend but could reopen as soon as Monday Investigators believe that anthrax confirmed in the Ford mailroom could have spread to Longworth which has required more extensive testing The Cannon ONeill formerly House Annex and Rayburn House office buildings reopened Thursday after they were closed a week earlier to allow for environmental sweeps for anthrax In a related development anthrax was discovered today on a filter removed from a warehouse that screens mail headed for the Supreme Court a court pokeswoman said The Supreme Court building was closed to tourists at midday today and the courts ventilation system was shut off in case any material found its way to the building Officials indicated that these steps were simply a precaution We have no evidence of any contamination in the Supreme Court building itself a statement from the court said by Geoff Earle Mark Wegner and Keith Koffler DEFENSE President Signs AntiTerrorism Legislation Into Law President Bush today signed into law antiterrorism legislation designed to give his administration new powers to track and detain potential terrorists while disrupting their moneylaundering operations The changes effective today will help counter a threat not like any other our nation has faced Bush said during an East Room signing ceremony attended by several lawmakers Bush asserted the legislation would help law enforcement officials fight modern terrorists noting existing laws were written in the days of the rotary phone The legislation while watered down during congressional debate from the administrations original plan expands the FBIs wiretapping and electronic surveillance authority and imposes stronger penalties for harboring or financing terrorists It increases the number of crimes considered terrorist acts and toughens their punishment while giving police new antiterrorism powers to secretly search peoples homes and business records and to eavesdrop on telephone and email conversations Bush sought to reassure those concerned about the new reach granted the government saying the legislation upholds and respects civil liberties guaranteed by our constitution by Keith Koffler DEFENSE Air War Continues Taliban Kills Opposition Leader US jets struck Kabul today rocking the capital with huge explosions and blasting a Red Cross compound for the second time this month the Associated Press reported while the Taliban said they captured and executed a noted opposition figure Abdul Haq a guerrilla leader in the war against the Soviet Union in the s had gone to Afghanistan with peace proposals on behalf of former King Mohammad Zaher Shah an aide to the former monarch said in Rome But the Talibans Bakhtar news agency said he was killed by the Taliban under a religious edict that decrees death for anyone spying for the United States and Great Britain Commander Haq was on a mission for peace not for war He was not going to fight anyone but to talk to tribal elders to inform them about the peace initiative of his majesty the king said the kings spokesman During late night bombing of Kabul Thursday three children were killed two from one family living in the northwest area of the city and a third from the east part of town officials at the Wazir Akbar Khan Hospital said The United States has repeatedly said it is not targeting civilians After another night of sometimes intense bombing three huge detonations shook Kabul at midday raising clouds of smoke from the direction of the airport and the Khair Khana district to the north In Moscow the Northern Alliances envoy to Russia told reporters that Russian military supplies have begun flowing to the opposition And Britain today announced it will commit special forces troops as part of a larger force to include warships and planes POLITICS Senate Could Be Dealing With LaborHHS Approps Most Of Next Week A spokesman for Senate Majority Whip Reid today said the Senate could be dealing with the FY LaborHHS appropriations bill for most of next week Majority Leader Daschle has said the FY District of Columbia spending bill could come up as well HEALTH Pharmaceutical Industry Says It Is Ready To Help Anthrax Victims Top executives from the US pharmaceutical industry emerged today from a meeting with HHS Secretary Thompson saying they stand ready to help in the countrys time of need by making antibiotics available free of charge to anthrax victims However the antibiotics being offered are not yet approved for that use so the companies pledged to work with FDA to expedite their approval for anthrax treatment Peter Dolan chairman and CEO of BristolMyers Squibb said the companies have no intention to make any profits on bioterrorism The companies today pledged to step up production of a smallpox vaccine and the flu vaccine which may help prevent people from getting the flu and mistaking it for early symptoms of anthrax Robert Essner president and CEO of American Home Products Corp said there are only about million doses of the flu vaccine available from the three US manufacturers who produce it but that there may be more that could be created from the overrun materials the companies still have TELECOMMUNICATIONS Lawmaker Calls For Possible Wireless License Intervention Senate Commerce ranking member John McCain RAriz wants Congress to intervene if ongoing negotiations between the federal government and NextWave regarding wireless licenses NextWave won but can no longer pay for fail to produce a fair price In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Daschle and Minority Leader Lott today McCain noted published reports that investors in NextWave which has been in bankruptcy proceedings since would still get billion under a proposed settlement while the federal government would get just billion of the estimated billion the licenses are worth I believe that the government can no longer afford to simply pay off a company whose only contribution to the American economy has been to manipulate for private gain the results of an improperly designed auction of a valuable public good McCain wrote He suggested that if negotiations do not produce a better deal that Congress must use its oversight authority to ensure that this matter is resolved upon terms that protect the American people from being shortchanged once again POLITICS Grand Jury Issues New Indictment Against Traficant A federal grand jury today issued a new indictment against Rep James Traficant DOhio alleging that he took bribes from a businessman in exchange for assistance in getting access to local railroad lines the Associated Press reported Traficant had previously been indicted on counts of bribery obstructing justice and tax evasion The new indictment adds an allegation that Traficant took bribes from James Sabatine of Canfield Ohio Traficant did not return calls seeking comment although the legislator repeatedly has said the charges are a result of misconduct by the FBI and the US attorneys office Sabatine pleaded guilty in August to paying Traficant in for help in getting access to a rail line near Sabatines asphalt plant Sabatine is the third businessman convicted in the investigation POLITICS American Red Cross President Resigns American Red Cross President Bernadine Healy one of the few physicians to head the nations largest charity today announced her resignation after a little more than two years on the job She later told a news conference that she had been forced out as a result of policy differences with the organizations board the Associated Press reported But Healy a former director of the National Institutes of Health who took over the Red Cross post in September after Elizabeth Dole resigned to seek the Republican presidential nomination had stirred controversy in the days following the Sept terrorist attacks The organization raised an unprecedented amount more than million in the wake of the attacks Healy rankled other charities collecting money for attack victims by refusing to participate in a coordinated effort led by the New York state attorney general to keep track of how much money was being given to each family And many blood experts argued she was wrong to encourage blood donations in the wake of Sept when they were not needed to treat victims of the terrorist attacks THE FRIDAY BUZZ Not Meeting With Lobbyists Every Minutes The Capitol has been a pretty desolate place since Sept lacking tourists lobbyists and often lawmakers But this past week it took on a new burst of activity as many members of Congress were shut out of their office buildings due to anthrax sweeps While many said they felt upended sad out of sorts and somewhat frustrated they appeared to be trying to look on the bright side Its not so bad said Rep Charlie Norwood RGa whose flaps with colleagues over the patients rights bill have been all but forgotten in the wake of the attacks Were not meeting with lobbyists every minutes he said Although he was quick to add that meeting with lobbyists is helpful to the legislative process he said what many members are probably thinking I am harder to find and thats OK Of course being harder to find has its price Press secretaries all over Capitol Hill found themselves without paper or a fax to issue press releases Everybody just wants to get in their offices We cant function we cant file said Senate Majority Leader Daschle whose office received an anthraxtainted letter earlier this month setting off the office and building closings and sending hundreds to be tested for anthrax Cell phones laptops and the ubiquitous handheld wireless communication devices known as Blackberries many staffers and members carry became even more important This is my office said Sen Debbie Stabenow DMich pointing to her cell phone on her way to the floor A freshman without the luxury more senior senators have of a Capitol hideaway Stabenow said she is actually getting more work done because her committees now meet in the Capitol where she often presides over the Senate Even those with hideaways found them cramped and ill equipped for the number of staff trying to use them One aide to a senior Senate Democrat was overheard on a cell phone in the Capitol saying that her new office space would rival the caves of Osama bin Laden We have a much greater appreciation for our offices now said House Education and the Workforce ranking member George Miller DCalif one of the four key lawmakers trying to hammer out a compromise on the elementary and secondary education reauthorization bill despite the office closings and the cancellation of several meetings If theyre working under these conditions we cant expect them to have the same work intensity said the Washington representative for a major US city But lobbyists and reporters have ways of finding lawmakers and by Thursday they were wandering the halls of the Capitol in droves looking for senators who could not hide by April Fulton Defining The Mavericks For legislators the label maverick can be highly subjective Some welcome it others deem it disparaging Some are unpredictable on some issues reliable elsewhere What may define them best is that they march to their own drummer During the past month two votes helped to define the Houses current mavericks In each case the House was largely unified behind the emergency measures sought by the Bush administration as part of its war effort and crafted largely by bipartisan majorities with party leaders support The votes were the Sept passage of the billion rescue of the commercial airline industry and this weeks approval of the conference report on the antiterrorism bill The House passed the first bill with Democrats opposed on this weeks showdown the vote was with Democrats opposed In the Senate only Sen Peter Fitzgerald RIll voted against the airline bill and only Sen Russell Feingold DWis against the law enforcement measure Perhaps the most interesting cluster were the House members who voted against both bills They included independent Rep Bernard Sanders of Vermont and two Republicans freshman Rep Butch Otter of Idaho and a perennial maverick Rep Ron Paul of Texas Plus there were Democrats Reps Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin Earl Blumenauer of Oregon Minority Whip Bonior Sherrod Brown of Ohio Eva Clayton of North Carolina William Coyne of Pennsylvania Danny Davis of Illinois Peter DeFazio of Oregon Bob Filner of California Barney Frank of Massachusetts Alcee Hastings of Florida Earl Hilliard of Alabama Jesse Jackson Jr of Illinois Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio Dennis Kucinich of Ohio Jim McDermott of Washington George Miller of California Collin Peterson of Minnesota Bobby Rush and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois Bobby Scott of Virginia Fortney Pete Stark of California Bennie Thompson of Mississippi John Tierney of Massachusetts Peter Visclosky of Indiana and Lynn Woolsey of California What is striking about the Democrats is that there is no obvious common thread by seniority by gender or by race If anything the group has a slight imbalance in the Midwest And it appears to have a disproportionate share of legislators who supported Rep Nancy Pelosi of California over Rep Steny Hoyer of Maryland in the contest for minority whip In that Oct vote Pelosi got percent of the total based on claims from the two camps at the time percent of the recent legislative mavericks also backed Pelosi by Richard E Cohen Omnipresent Bob When Rep Bob Ney ROhio assumed the chairmanship of the House Administration Committee early this year the issues of election and campaign finance reform promised him a platform larger than assigning parking spaces Last months terrorist strikes have only heightened his visibility as his panel is charged with overseeing the safety of the House its members and its buildings This week Ney has been trailed by an entourage of staff reporters and fellow legislators on and off the House floor the Capitol East Front stairs and temporary offices at GAO When a reporter suggested Ney be named mayor House Chief Deputy Majority Whip Roy Blunt RMo balked Mayor Governor Governor of Capitol Hill Ney appears to relish the job but terrorism has only marginally changed his routine In the Speakers Lobby Ney still alternates between cell phone calls and media inquiries while occasionally bumming a cigarette off Rep John Boehner ROhio Asked if he enjoys his post Ney smiled but demurred saying Im still here We have a challenge House Administration has never had before by Mark Wegner Stealth Attack Some veteran House Republican staffers are privately suggesting the current conventional wisdom that the GOP leadership cannot bring up renewal of trade negotiating authority because it lacks the votes is a ruse They think the leadership is simply biding its time and speculate the leadership plans to call for a vote late some Thursday afternoon with no debate and no amendments Further despite a strategy almost certain to inflame liberal Democrats these staff members predict the legislation would then pass by a comfortable majority At the moment the bill does not appear on next weeks tentative House agenda by Bruce Stokes THE FINAL WORD The hugs really dont transfer spores You can do that all day long and remain sporefree Majority Leader Daschle who Thursday clarified his earlier statement that members of his staff might have spread anthrax by hugging each other after the emotional day last week when they were quarantined One reporter joked that he heard Senate Minority Leader Lott who unlike Daschle failed to receive a presidential hug at a public event last month was spreading the rumor about the dangers of hugging CongressDaily

Administration Says FY Surplus B Less Than Anticipated The Bush administration today said the total surplus for FY is billion more than billion less than predicted just weeks ago and less than half the estimate made when the administration released its budget this spring Expectations for the surplus plummeted as the economy stalled this year and worsened further in the wake of the Sept terrorist attacks Circumstances have changed radically OMB Director Daniels acknowledged in a statement today We must make sure that this is not the last surplus by limiting additional spending to purposes directly related to the nations battle against terrorism The FY surplus was billion making the FY surplus the second largest on record The April OMB budget estimate for the FY surplus was billion The administrations mid session review surplus forecast late this summer was for billion At that time the administration forecast receipts of trillion and outlays of trillion Actual FY receipts were trillion and outlays were trillion The administration also announced it had paid down billion in publicly held debt during FY The billion FY surplus includes a billion reduction in anticipated spectrum auction recoveries For comparison in its most recent budget analysis released Sept CBO projected the FY budget surplus would be billion down from the billion it had projected in the mid session review that came out in late August In May CBO had expected a far larger FY surplus of billion by Keith Koffler and Lisa Caruso TRANSPORTATION Bush Still Resistant To Federalization Of Airport Security The White House said today it continues to support allowing airport screeners to remain private workers with increased federal supervision backing away from a statement White House Chief of Staff Card made over the weekend saying President Bush probably would sign legislation that fully federalizes the workers if it came to his desk in that form That may or may not be the case White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said today when asked about Cards statement Fleischer said it was premature to speculate on whether Bush would veto legislation federalizing airport workers The president continues to believe that the best way to guarantee safety is through a more flexible system where not everyone is on the federal payroll Fleischer said Bush continues to back legislation by House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Young that provides federal standards for airport workers but does not require that all become federal employees Card told NBCs Meet the Press Sunday that if Bush received a bill federalizing airport security workers I suspect that he wouldnt want to sign it but he would He wants airline security House Democrats appeared bolstered by Cards comments and are hoping for a win on a Democratic substitute that would federalize workers when the Young bill comes up for a floor vote Wednesday This shows that the White House position against making baggage screeners federal employees is rather soft said a spokesman for House Transportation and Infrastructure ranking member James Oberstar DMinn Oberstar has introduced an alternative to Youngs bill that would federalize workers like the Senate bill but place them under the Transportation Department The Senate bill places much of the oversight with the Justice Department Democratic aides said that Democrats are likely to offer the Senate bill in order to move the legislation quickly The Young bill goes before the Rules Committee Tuesday by Keith Koffler and April Fulton FINANCE House May Not Accept Senate Terrorism Insurance Plan House members may be playing catch up on federal terrorism insurance this week after an agreement was reached late Friday between key senators lawmakers and the Bush administration on the bills rough outline Senate Banking Committee members are expected this week to introduce the legislation which would have the insurance industry financing the first billion in payments following a future terrorist attack After that taxpayers would foot somewhere between percent and percent of the costs Meanwhile members of the House Financial Services Committee who have been a more difficult sell are still in the discovery phase of the process But in striking a deal with such influential and ideologically disparate members as Senate Banking Chairman Sarbanes ranking member Phil Gramm RTexas and Sen Christopher Dodd DConn the White House may have found a way to effectively circumvent a House debate sources said I dont see how and where the House plays into that mix one observer said At the same time the observer added consideration needs to be given to House Financial Services Chairman Oxley and probably some of the Democrats they shouldnt be cut out of the picture House members were prepared to dig in on the subject with a roundtable discussion organized for Wednesday by Financial Services Capital Markets Subcommittee Chairman Richard Baker R La Criticism and caution about a federal terrorism insurance backstop has been most pronounced and most bipartisan among members of the House committee Baker has been especially vocal about the need to ensure the industry does not get something for nothing while Democrats raised the specter that federal dollars would open the door for federal regulation of the insurance industry I think in general theres an appreciation of what the Senates put together so far a Baker spokesman said today However the House roundtable should be taking up several other questions House members have the spokesman added While the Senate proposal looks like a good start for the shortterm question the final legislative package may need to go a bit further specifically in addressing whether there is going to be any repayment by the industry once it finds its footing he said An Oxley spokeswoman added Our concerns remain the same as they were last week I think we want to stand firm in defense of the taxpayer and in a way that encourages the private sector to provide as much terrorism coverage as possible Sources said they believe the final Senate bill could include modest language probably crafted by Sen Jon Corzine DNJ requiring some repayment from the insurance industry in return for federal aid Corzines staff could not be reached for comment As for the substance of the SenateWhite House proposal Frank Torres of Consumers Union said the details remain to be seen Were encouraged that the first dollar losses are going to be picked up by the industry Torres said However he added the Senate plan calls for a billion threshold that sounds low to him given that the industry has some billion in reserves Moreover We understand the legitimate need for some federal assurances but it is turning out to be a subsidy Torres said Nobodys talked about the impact of insurance rates on taxpayers The government will be there to help out but why cant we have it in some form of loan guarantee We think the House folks are asking all the right questions Torres added As for the position of House Republican leaders Our sense is that they do not want a big bailout Bakers spokesman said Leadership wants the bill to be something free market conservatives can feel proud about he said by Pamela Barnett TRADE English Predicts Congress Will Restore Trade Authority Rep Phil English RPa a member of the House Ways and Means Committee predicted that the restoration of presidential trade negotiating authority will be voted on and probably approved by the House in the next few weeks He added that it is reasonable that the president will have the authority again by the end of the year Speaking at a forum on trade sponsored by the US Chamber of Commerce English endorsed a measure to renew trade authority authored by Ways and Means Chairman Thomas He said the Thomas bill was the strongest one I have seen since Ive been in Congress with regard to promoting higher labor and environmental standards and also preserving the consultative role of Congress The Thomas bill borrows heavily from a free trade agreement concluded recently between the United States and Jordan English emphasized that the Thomas bill calls on countries to be on the record as being willing to enforce their standards English said Thomas bill gives the United States flexibility to negotiate trade pacts based on the particular circumstance of various countries Meanwhile President Bush today announced the creation of a million Overseas Private Investment Corporation support facility to provide US corporations access to loans guarantees and political risk insurance for investment projects in Sub Saharan Africa Speaking to a forum on the African Growth and Opportunity Act a free trade agreement between the United States and African nations Bush said the United States would also establish a regional office in Johannesburg South Africa to coordinate trade issues between the United States and Africa The president also announced million in seed funding to launch the Trade for African Development and Enterprise Program which will establish regional hubs to help African businesses take advantage of the African Growth and Opportunity Act by Stephen Norton and Keith Koffler AGRICULTURE Dorgan Pushes For Farm Bill Approval By Years End Sen Byron Dorgan DND told CongressDaily Friday that if the Senate Agriculture Committee does not soon succeed in sending a farm bill to the floor Senate Majority Leader Daschle could bring up the Housepassed bill for amendment Dorgan said he was not suggesting that Daschle bring up the bill because he believes the responsible thing for the Senate Agriculture Committee to do is come to an agreement on it However Dorgan said he so strongly believes Congress should pass the farm bill this year that he did not rule out that option Dorgan who does not sit on the Senate Agriculture Committee appear to signal the frustration noncommittee Democrats feel toward the Senate Agriculture Committees lack of progress on the bill One Capitol Hill source working on the bill said Democrats are splintered in trying to satisfy Democrats from different regions The source said Senate Agriculture Chairman Harkins staff is circulating his concept paper which he may publicly release this week the source said among other Democratic committee members while quietly sounding out Republican staffers who work for Republican Senate Agriculture Committee members other than Senate Agriculture ranking member Richard Lugar RInd who has released his own proposal with dramatic farm program changes When the House sent its farm bill to the Senate Daschle did not assign it to a committee which left him the option of bringing it up on the Senate floor Daschle staffers have said the majority leader wants the Senate Agriculture Committee to write a bill that is better than the House bill but they also left the option of bringing up the House bill and amending it One problem with the House farm bill Dorgan said is that it does not treat wheat farmers well but he called it a step forward compared to current law On Friday Dorgan wrote Harkin and Lugar saying they should finish the bill this year and pointed out how in his view the House bill shortchanges wheat and barley growers Dorgan said his letter reflected meetings he held last week with both Daschle and Harkin Meanwhile the National Association of Wheat Growers Friday issued a new call for completion of the farm bill this year saying the uncertainty is causing problems for winter wheat farmers who are planting crops now Our agriculture lenders are increasingly nervous about committing themselves to farm loans in light of an uncertain farm policy environment We need these loans now for the operating capital on our crop NAWG Chief Executive Officer Daren Coppock said In what appeared to be a response to Dorgans letter corn soybean and livestock groups wrote Daschle saying they were so satisfied with the Bush administrations promises of funding that action could wait until next year But cotton and rice growers and the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union declined to sign the letter to Daschle and are still pushing for the bill this year by Jerry Hagstrom AGRICULTURE Administration Backs Away From Lugar Farm Plan The Bush administration is distancing itself from the farm bill proposed by Senate Agriculture ranking member Richard Lugar RInd Although there are many similarities between the Bush administrations recently issued farm policy guidelines and Lugars proposal on food stamps and other nutrition programs Agriculture Undersecretary for Nutrition and Consumer Services Eric Bost told CongressDaily Friday This is the first inning of a nine inning ball game When Lugar issued his farm bill on Oct he said he had the full backing of the administration with Agriculture Secretary Veneman even issuing a statement that praised his proposal But the Lugar proposal has not won support from any major farm groups and rumors continue swirling that farm groups told White House officials they were offended by its support of the Lugar proposal Bost told the Associated Press the administration supports Lugars plan to restore food stamp benefits to legal immigrants who have been in the country for five years or worked for four years Bost said Friday that the quarters of work requirement for food stamp eligibility is something that we feel comfortable supporting However we are continuing to work at it We dont want to say that is where the administration is Bost then dismissed those who would pigeonhole him on the issue Reporters want to box me in on the issue We are continuing to look at additional options for food stamp eligibility Bost said The options could be narrower or broader Bost also pointed out the administration is continuing to discuss the nutrition title of any new farm bill with congressional leaders and OMB and noted that last week he offered assistance in writing the nutrition title Bost said he doesnt have an opinion at the present time about making the Womens Infants and Childrens program mandatory rather than discretionary funding another issue raised in the USDA policy book by Jerry Hagstrom CONGRESSIONAL OPERATIONS House Awaits Remediation Results On Longworth Ford Although the search for anthrax contamination continued to hamper normal House operations today officials are nearing the end of their efforts to detect and destroy any harmful bacteria The Longworth and Ford House office buildings where anthrax has been detected remain closed but a spokesman for House Administration Chairman Ney said health officials have completed remediation and are waiting on test results to confirm that any trace of anthrax has been destroyed The Ney spokesman said that tunnels connecting the Capitol and the Rayburn and Cannon House offices buildings have been reopened but entrances to Longworth are blocked off and sealed Anthrax was discovered Friday in the Longworth offices of Reps John Baldacci DMaine Rush Holt D NJ and Mike Pence RInd A conference call for chiefs of staff and district directors of legislators with Longworth offices is scheduled for this afternoon Meanwhile Senate aides said leaders have still not decided what method to employ in order to eliminate anthrax from the Hart Senate Office Building as health officials from various federal agencies advise congressional officials EPA Administrator Whitman had been invited to brief senators today about cleanup efforts in the Capitol complex but the event was cancelled The Hart building remains closed as staff who work in the building make preparations for what could be a prolonged dislocation by Mark Wegner and Geoff Earle JUDICIARY Court To Decide On Federal Authority Over Drug Mixing The Supreme Court today agreed to decide if the government can regulate the mixing of drugs at local pharmacies The Bush administration had urged the court to take the case arguing there were serious health implications in allowing unregulated drugmixing The government has wide inspection authority over drugmakers in their plants but this case involves pharmacies that dilute or alter prescription drugs to make them easier to consume or for use by a child or someone with allergies Congress changed guidelines for compounding in and the government was sued in Nevada by pharmacies that frequently mix drugs The FDA contends it can regulate companies that advertise mixing services or have sales personnel The court also rejected a constitutional challenge to congressional salary increases dating back a decade Justices refused to reinstate a lawsuit filed by Rep Bob Schaffer R Colo seeking to block yearly costofliving adjustments for Congress The latest increase earlier this month bumped up congressional salaries to about Schaffer contends the increases violate the th Amendment which forbids members of congress from increasing their salary during their term Congress can block the adjustments which it has done five times in the last eight years the court was told The court also agreed today to hear the case of a man who wanted an oil refinery job his own doctor said could kill him the Associated Press reported Mario Echazabal sued Chevron Corp under the Americans With Disabilities Act claiming he should have gotten the job despite a chronic case of hepatitis C Doctors who examined Echazabal said exposure to chemicals at the refinery would speed the deterioration of Echazabals liver and that a large exposure from a plant fire or other emergency could kill him Chevron appealed to the Supreme Court arguing that Echazabals medical condition puts him outside the protection of the Americans With Disabilities Act The federal antibias law mandates equal treatment for qualified workers no matter their disability A court decision in the case could help clarify what duty an employer has to potential employees with disabilities POLITICS White House To Consider Proposals Designed To Limit Liability An administration official Friday confirmed reports that the White House will consider proposals designed to limit the liability of businesses affected by the Sept terrorist attacks Owners and architects of buildings destroyed by the attacks manufacturers of airplane components and others could be sued as a result of the attacks We are open to proposals that would treat all companies that would be sued similarly to each other the administration official said The White House believes that such proposals would be fair since caps on claims against one industry the airlines are already in place and lawsuits that would have been directed at air carriers may now end up in the lap of other businesses The White House also believes that protection for other industries is needed to prevent some businesses from entering into bankruptcy and thereby ensure plaintiffs could recover damages If a deal with Congress is reached on the issue the White House would be open to adding the initiative onto legislation helping reinsurers provide coverage to insurance companies writing policies protecting businesses against future terrorist attacks the official added POLITICS Cook To Run As A Republican Former Rep Merrill Cook RUtah has decided to run as a Republican for the seat he lost last year satisfying Republicans who feared his plan to campaign as an independent would split the GOP vote the Associated Press reported Cook in announcing his change of heart Saturday said he did not want to be blamed for possibly helping Democratic Rep Jim Matheson win a second term I dont want to be called a spoiler I want to carry on with the important issues Cook said Cook said he was inspired to run again after comments Tuesday by National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis of Virginia who said he hoped Cook would not run and that a Republican should win the redrawn nd District if we can find a decent candidate Cook was enraged by Davis comments and then issued his threat to run as an independent But Cook said he spoke with Davis on the phone later in the week and was assured that Davis would stop saying negative things about him and show neutrality in the Utah Republican Partys nominating process ATTACK UPDATE US warplanes hit an area of caves and tunnels in eastern Afghanistan today known as a hideout of Osama bin Laden killing two people Reuters reported Frustrated at weeks of US bombing that have failed to budge Taliban front lines Afghanistans opposition forces plotted what they said today would be a major push on a vital Talibanheld northern stronghold the Associated Press reported To bring it off a spokesman of the Northern Alliance stressed We will need American help Afghan opposition forces are complaining increasingly that US bombing to date is too light to drive out Taliban forces defending Kabul and the northern city of MazareSharif US strategy has focused on selective strikes on Taliban positions and those of bin Ladens alQaida network rather than mass bombing Meanwhile Sen Phil Gramm RTexas said Saturday death is the only justice for anyone found responsible for aiding the Sept terrorist attacks Im interested in hunting down these people and bringing them to justice and thats killing them he told a GOP leadership training seminar in Dallas Gramm who is retiring at the end of his current term praised the leadership of Bush who has said he wants bin Laden dead or alive Gramm offered his own homespun directive We have an old Texas Rangers principle that if you ride with thieves you die with thieves The modern incantation is if you ride with terrorists you die with terrorists THE FINAL WORD They would have to be living in a cave not to know White House Homeland Security Chief Tom Ridge speaking last week while saying that terrorists seriously misjudged the US public by thinking they

Thompson Proposes Plan To Compare Health Options HHS Secretary Thompson announced an initiative today to provide Medicare and Medicaid recipients with better comparative information to help them choose nursing homes hospitals and other sources of health care Our efforts today will help beneficiaries all across the country to compare the performance of their local nursing homes and will provide the recognition that high quality nursing homes deserve Thompson said in unveiling the plan Starting in January the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will initiate a fivestate demonstration to identify collect and publish nursing home quality information in Colorado Maryland Ohio Rhode Island and Washington CMS will begin publishing the information in April and the information will be available online at wwwmedicaregov It will also be promoted through local Quality Improvement Organizations If the pilot program is successful it would be expanded to include nursing home quality information from all states beginning next October CMS will also eventually work to develop similar information for home health agencies hospitals and other types of providers At the same time Senate Finance ranking member Charles Grassley RIowa and Rep Henry Waxman DCalif are raising questions about the quality of nursing home information New nursing home quality inspection standards the administration proposed in September would require violations to affect percent of residents in order to be considered widespread which could make it almost impossible to determine whether violations are widespread based on the samples inspectors use now The semantical change you seek brings an Orwellian result By lumping all violations affecting between four residents and percent of residents in the same category the CMS proposal lessens the usefulness of these classifications and limits public information about nursing home conditions Grasssley and Waxman said in a letter to CMS Administrator Thomas Scully Your change will mean the appearance of widespread violations will reduce appreciably yet the inexcusable reality of widespread harm will remain the same the letter continues A CMS spokesman said the agencys proposal which was an informal communique to industry and interest groups was only an effort to get advice on how to simplify the inspectors manual It doesnt change any of the standards he said The inspectors manual overhaul is a separate initiative from the nursing home data publication pilot announced today by April Fulton HEALTH AMA Seeking To Revive Collective Bargaining Bill The American Medical Association today attempted to revive legislation to allow physicians to collectively negotiate with insurance companies The original controversial bill died in after the House passed it but the Senate chose to do nothing with it The AMA is hoping that a study it unveiled today will spur new interest in legislation and Donald Palmisano an AMA board member said the association is talking to House and Senate lawmakers whom he hopes will take the lead He also said the AMA has talked to Bush administration officials but he declined to discuss the outcome of those talks The new legislation might be different from its original form said Palmisano Whatever restores discussions well be happy with said Palmisano who added he was optimistic despite the fact that Congress is focusing almost entirely on terrorismrelated issues The original bill would have allowed physicians to bypass antitrust laws and collectively negotiate their contracts with insurance companies It would not have allowed physicians to stage a strike The study concludes that a significant number of insurance markets across the country are highly concentrated impeding competition and that in a large number of the markets a single insurer has a market share over percent It also cites some markets where a single insurer has a market share as high as percent to percent This vast consolidation of health plans puts physicians who are their patients primary healthcare advocates at a severe disadvantage especially when negotiating patient care issues Palmisano said Physicians have long complained that managed care companies present them with contracts that include provisions they might oppose such as having to participate in the companys HMO if they want to participate in the PPO Physicians sometimes want to participate just in the PPO when they believe that the HMO is too restrictive in the care it allows The AMA called for stricter scrutiny of healthplan mergers and acquisitions Since there have been announced health insurer mergers and acquisitions according to the AMA With the exception of the US Department of Justice challenge of the AetnaPrudential merger the consolidation of the health insurance marketplace has gone virtually unchecked by federal regulators the AMA said in a statement by Marilyn Werber Serafini TRANSPORTATION Bush Signs Hails Bipartisan Aviation Security Measure President Bush today signed the aviation security bill at an appearance at Reagan National Airport hailing it as a bipartisan measure On hand for the event were House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Young ranking member James Oberstar DMinn and Aviation Subcommittee Chairman John Mica RFla White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer today said that because Bush sees so much that is good in the legislation the president could be enthusiastic about it despite the bills failure in the short term to allow some airport security workers to remain private sector employees as the president wished Bush applauded the bills provision establishing a new undersecretary of Transportation for security The new security force will be welltrained made up of US citizens Bush said And if any of its members do not perform the new undersecretary will have full authority to discipline them or remove them The White House has not decided who it will nominate for the undersecretary job according to Fleischer saying Bush was particularly pleased the DOT had received the assignment instead of the Justice Department Although Fleischer said Bush had directed the agency to move rapidly to enforce the legislation Fleischer did not indicate that noticeable new improvements resulting from the bill would be in place in time to reassure travelers during the holiday travel season He indicated the DOT had not yet devised a timetable for implementing the bill noting it had just been adopted Bush himself pointed to several actions the administration has already taken to improve air safety The government has made more funds available to the aviation industry to fortify cockpit doors placed more air marshals on airplanes and instituted a zero policy crackdown on security breaches Under the new law the FAA must test the security benefits of biometric technologies in at least airports National Journals Technology Daily reported The biometrics language requires the FAA to consider the deployment of technologies that identify individuals and to test it in a pilot program Groups such as the American Association of Airport Executives recently touted biometrics technologies in testimony before Congress and the group also has called for the Defense Department to re evaluate classified technologies to see if they can be put to use in airports The aviation security law also directs the Transportation secretary to explore using wireless or wireline data technologies to transmit potential aviation threats to a common database of suspected terrorists The database would be connected to other federal and state agencies The law also requires all airlines to secure their computer reservation systems against unauthorized access The FAA must periodically review potential aviation threats and analyze its systems to weigh the possibility of cyber attacks that could disrupt their operations Air carriers also must expand their use of the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System to cover all passengers The law authorizes money for the FAA to conduct research and development on and testing and evaluation of security technologies And it authorizes the FAA to issue research grants for longerterm airport security improvements secure networking and the sharing of information about aviation threats among federal agencies and law enforcement The statute also calls for the use of video monitors voicestress analysis and other technologies to pinpoint disturbances the electronic transmission of the names birth dates passport numbers and other relevant information of each airline passenger and crew member and the use of technology to allow trusted passengers to bypass long security checkpoints by Keith Koffler and Liza Porteus ECONOMY White House Pushes For Stimulus Ads Attack Daschle White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer today sought to ratchet up the pressure on Senate Democratic leaders to pass a stimulus bill calling the question of whether a measure will move a real test of the new Senate Pointing to recent job losses Fleischer said The president thinks it would be a grave mistake for the Senate to leave town without passing an economic stimulus package He added that President Bush still prefers a bill by the end of November The House of Representatives has passed an economic stimulus Now its time for the Senate to do the same Fleischer said The new White House rhetoric meshes with that offered in recent days by House Ways and Means Chairman Thomas although Thomas criticism of the Senate has been far more scathing Despite todays call for the Senate to act Bush would also support Thomas suggestion that if the Senate cannot pass a bill negotiations should begin immediately between members of the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees Meanwhile the businessbased Tax Relief Coalition this weekend unleashed a substantial radio ad buy in South Dakota urging Senate Majority Leader Daschle to quickly move an economic stimulus package according to an executive close to the TRC The ad hits Daschle and House Minority Leader Gephardt for visiting Mexico over the weekend while the stimulus plan was languishing Thats right Mexico an announcer says in the ad adding It just doesnt make sense when our priority is jump starting Americas economy House Republican Conference Chairman JC Watts of Oklahoma late last week linked inaction on the stimulus to Daschles Mexico trip in comments that drew a rebuke from some Hispanic Democratic House members A Daschle spokeswoman said the majority leader made three separate offers Thursday to begin negotiations on the stimulus but received no response from Republicans We are ready and willing to negotiate an economic recovery package but the Republicans refuse to come to the table the spokeswoman said adding that Daschle and Gephardt were in Mexico at the invitation of that countrys president But another TRC executive said Theres widespread frustration on K Street that the Senate has chosen a path that will not result in a bill I dont know if running the ads will change Daschles actions but it makes us feel better by Keith Koffler and Charlie Mitchell OUTLOOK Two Senate Buildings Reopen Hart Facing More Work The Russell and Dirksen Senate office buildings reopened today after undergoing environmental testing over the weekend for traces of anthrax Officials ordered the tests after the discovery of an additional anthrax contaminated letter addressed to Sen Patrick Leahy DVt It is not known whether the letter ever entered one of the Senate office buildings where Leahy has office space Test results are expected to become available Wednesday but health officials believe there is no public health risk posed by reopening the buildings according to a memo released by the office of the Senate sergeant at arms EPA officials briefed top Senate staff Friday about the ongoing cleanup efforts Officials estimate that it could take three to four weeks to decontaminate the Hart Senate Office Building offices besides Majority Leader Daschles where traces of anthrax have been detected Additionally health officials need to seal off Daschles office to remediate it a process that will require the temporary closing of Dirksen as well as Hart Technicians are using foam liquid and gas forms of chlorine dioxide to eliminate the anthrax Officials declined at Fridays briefing to predict how long the entire process would take The Senate office buildings were reopened today with lawmakers have begun their Thanksgiving holiday Minority Leader Lott plans to spend Thanksgiving with his family in Mississippi Daschles family is coming to Washington to spend the holiday with him House Speaker Hastert and Majority Leader Armey have returned to their respective Illinois and Texas districts where they are scheduled to spend their Thanksgiving break before the House reconvenes next week When the House returns the afternoon of Nov it is scheduled to take up a series of suspension bills For the remainder of next week the House is expected to vote on the FY Defense appropriations bill which could not be completed last week and any available conference reports on FY spending bills House Minority Leader Gephardt who visited Mexico this weekend on a threeday trip with Daschle returned Sunday Gephardt is expected to return to St Louis Wednesday for Thanksgiving before traveling to New York next Monday and Tuesday for Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee meetings by Geoff Earle and Mark Wegner TRANSPORTATION Senators Say They Would Oppose Efforts To Liquidate Amtrak A bipartisan group of senators Friday said they would oppose any efforts to liquidate Amtrak the nations passenger rail service despite forthcoming recommendations to do so triggered earlier this month by a vote of the Amtrak Reform Council We consider passenger rail service an essential link in Americas transportation system and a strategic asset during times of national emergency Amtrak cannot be liquidated without the Senates approval and we will oppose any effort to do so Senate Commerce Surface Transportation Subcommittee Chairman John Breaux DLa Sen Olympia Snowe RMaine and others wrote in a letter to President Bush We hope you will join us in reassuring Amtraks creditors that liquidation is not an option the letter said Under a law Amtrak was supposed to become self sufficient by December On Nov the ARC charged with overseeing the rail service voted that Amtrak would not meet this deadline The vote set in motion a series of actions including the development by ARC and the development by Amtrak of plans to liquidate the rail services within days Congress does not have to adopt either plan but the vote will likely force a renewed look at how the service operates FOREIGN AFFAIRS Four House Members Meet With Syrian President Four House members met Syrian President Bashar Assad Saturday for talks on improved relations with Syria and the Middle East peace process Rep Brian Kerns RInd told reporters after the meeting that there seems to be some opportunity for real progress in USSyrian relations the Associated Press reported The United States has long listed Syria as a country that sponsors terrorism because of its support for militant Palestinian groups such as Hezbollah which opposed Israels occupation of southern Lebanon and continues to attack Israeli troops over a tiny parcel of disputed land on Lebanons southern border The delegations leader Rep Darrell Issa RCalif whose grandparents immigrated to the United States from Lebanon told reporters that for the United States to

Syria Saturday and was expected to then leave for Beirut for talks with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud Other delegation members are Reps Nick Rahall DWVa himself of Lebanese descent and John Cooksey RLa who is seeking a Senate seat next year Cooksey ignited a furor in Louisiana earlier this year by telling local radio stations that security officials should feel free to stop and question anyone

representative today told the Associated Press A group of ethnic Pashtun tribal elders who opposed the Islamic militia persuaded the Taliban to pull out of western Farah province over the weekend said a spokesman The report could not be independently confirmed If true it would signal progress for Pashtun leaders who have been trying to remove the Taliban from the remaining areas of Afghanistan under their control We have taken over from the Taliban in a peaceful manner in Farah said the spokesman for the tribal faction led by Gul Agha Shirzai The Taliban will feel much weaker and theyll be more convinced to give up their power peacefully in Kandahar he said However he acknowledged that there were hardcore Taliban who were committed to fighting Meanwhile a judge in Spain filed formal charges against eight alleged alQaida members suspected of helping with the terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon The suspects were directly linked to the preparation and carrying out of the

supports a guest worker program but added that the US border was too porous letting in not only terrorists but other criminal illegals who end up operating such things as methamphetamine labs While
