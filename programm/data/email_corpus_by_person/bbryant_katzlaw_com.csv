<31671191.1075861357997.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bbryant@katzlaw.com,2001-11-06 11:23:58,FW Gulf Rate Docket Weather DerivativesGerald I intended to send you a copy of the attached Bill Original Message From Bill Bryant Sent Monday November PM To Marchris G Robinson Email Subject Gulf Rate Docket Weather Derivatives MR With information about Harrys testimony in Georgia and about the existing Gulf revenue sharing program Ive changed my opinion about whether Enron should intervene in the Gulf docket Enron may benefit from intervening in the Gulf rate docket both by selling the Florida Commission on its weather derivatives and by dissuading the Commission from raising the retail rates charged to ECSEES The Commissions order in the territorial dispute is due December To avoid any adverse inferences in that docket as a result of intervening in the Gulf rate docket we should not file the intervention until after that time There is a preliminary issue identification meeting in the Gulf rate docket on Nov but this may be moved because a meeting in the RTO docket has just been scheduled for the same time We will attend both meetings Enron likely has standing to intervene in this docket Both the Florida Cable Telecommunications Association and the Florida Industrial Power Users Group which has no significant member in Gulfs territory have been granted standing to intervene on the simple grounds that they are retail customers of Gulf and electricity represents one of their largest variable costs Gulf has not objected to the petitions of any persons seeking standing The Federal Executive Agencies also have standing to represent four military bases in Gulfs territory The existing and soon expiring revenue sharing mechanism makes this docket ripe for pitching weather derivatives If we petition after Dec and are granted standing to intervene it will be necessary to prepare and file Harrys direct testimony and exhibits by December The schedule of remaining activities in the Docket is issue statements due Jan second issue identification meeting Jan Prehearing statements Jan Prehearing conference Feb Hearing Feb Mar Briefs March Natalie spoke to the Rates and Tariffs Division at the PSC about the usage characteristics of the military bases As we discussed I was curious about whether they were also designated PX Large High Load Factor Power Service Because a customers designation is Gulfs proprietary and very guarded information one cannot know for sure whether the military bases have the same designation as ECS However Dave Wheeler asst director of rates said the military bases are probably designated LP large power service and not PX PX designation applies for customers whose demand is MW kw with an annual load factor of at least at any one meter The military bases take delivery at multiple delivery points and probably have different rates at the different delivery points They likely do not take more than MW at any one point The LP or LPT large power time sensitive designation is more likely because that applies to customers with a demand of kw which the military bases probably have at various delivery points Still it is very likely that the rate increase as proposed does not affect the federal executive agencies Dave Wheeler also guaranteed that Gulfs current rate proposal that leaves the PX rate unchanged will not be approved by the Commission He said that they will not permit a rate increase that affects only small customers Bad politics The level of effort required for this intervention will be greater than the RTO Docket There we had only to endorse positions asserted by others Although here we will merely be endorsing Gulfs rate methodology we will also be introducing the weather derivatives concept as relevant to Gulfs rates Gulf may be so excited by the potential of weather derivatives that they carry the burden by themselves However we cant count on that until we are sure that they understand and can sell the product to the Commission and staff Therefore the Enron budget for this intervention will have to assume that Enron carries the burden We will be expected to advocate and participate fully Based on these assumptions I think it likely that the KKH fee expense for full participation in this Docket will be about twice that in the RTO matter In the RTO Docket we billed Enron through October after writingoff at your request Therefore a planning number for this Docket no guarantee that it will be limited to this amount is Let me know what you decide Bill

<32883640.1075861363381.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bbryant@katzlaw.com,2001-11-27 09:21:15,RE Construction Expedition Letter Cc Gerald Attached are my edits to the letter Daphne will prepare a version that is without all of the deletions and additions so it is easier to read You can compare the two to see exactly what I have done My edits are in blue Comments are in bold blue and bracketed ECS may be over the barrel here and this may be the best deal that you can get But it isnt a deal because it is all illusory They agree to try to complete construction by a date certain no recourse if they dont in exchange for an ECS guarantee to reimburse Gulf for an amount that they think is fair that is the only standard they have no responsibility justify and we have no ability to verify that amount In general Gulf is allowed contributions in aid of construction and can stop construction if they dont get it If our existing agreements clearly provide for a guaranteed term and minimum load and those provisions are linked to the costs of construction so no further contribution from ECS was contemplated in those agreements then I think that ECS can hold them to the deal We have no contract with WFEC so if the PSC decides in their favor we may have to petition the PSC and ask that we not be financially damaged by their decision and Gulfs incorrect representation upon which we relied that our facility was in a territory that they could serve I think but have not researched the point that ECS would have standing as a customer I believe that the commissioners and their non lawyer staff would be sympathetic to our situation However if we agree to a capped amount of reimbursement then their may be no issue for the PSC to decide As of now Gulf has changed the deal on ECS If ECS accepts the change unless under protest then a court or the commission will probably consider the matter moot Im not sure about the legal effect of signing under protest in this context but can do some research if you think that useful In any event I think that the letter should recite more of the history of this negotiation and the early agreements or representations that are now modified I know our clients hate lawyers but we should try to have as clean a record as possible if we think that we may have to seek relief I dont have any of the agreements at issue here and there is probably more that should be included in the letter to give the context in which it is written and signed More later Call when you can Bill Original Message From Nemec Gerald mailtoGerald NRONcom Sent Monday November PM To Cc Hilgert Chris Subject FW Construction Expedition Letter Per our discussion please review and provide comments asap Original Message From Jeffrey Stone ENRON Sent Monday November PM To Nemec Gerald Cc Hilgert Chris Subject Construction Expedition Letter Here are Gulfs proposed changes to match the concept discussed earlier this afternoon Original Message From Nemec Gerald SMTPGerald NRONcom Sent Wednesday November AM To Howell Marion W Cc Hilgert Chris Owen David Alexander James C Subject Construction Expedition Letter For your review is the draft Construction Expedition Letter per our discussions Monday GulfExpediteLetterdoc This email is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient s Any review use distribution or disclosure by others is strictly prohibited If you are not the intended recipient or authorized to receive for the recipient please contact the sender or reply to Enron Corp at and delete all copies of the message This email and any attachments hereto are not intended to be an offer or an acceptance and do not create or evidence a binding and enforceable contract between Enron Corp or any of its affiliates and the intended recipient or any other party and may not be relied on by anyone as the basis of a contract by estoppel or otherwise Thank you File GulfExpediteLetterdoc GulfExpediteLetterdoc GulfExpediteLetterdoc GulfExpediteLetterdoc
<28538919.1075852330340.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bbryant@katzlaw.com,2001-09-27 12:11:33,Schedule For Territorial Dispute Cc Gerald See the attached schedule for Docket the GulfWFEC dispute There is no schedule yet for the Gulf rate hearing We expect that in early October and I will forward it to you You asked about the effect of intervention in the rate case on the territorial dispute In addressing this question it is useful to know that the FPSC rate hearing intervention rules are very liberal Enron can intervene at any time and that the rate case will not proceed rapidly For procedural purposes a prompt intervention decision is not necessary Also I think that Gulf has the stronger position in the territorial dispute Because an Enron intervention in the rate case could confuse the staff and raise questions from WFEC I think it best from ECSs perspective to await a decision in the territorial dispute before petitioning for intervention Ive reviewed the questions in Harry Kingerskis email that you forwarded Preliminarily I note two corrections First we expect a decision in the territorial dispute in early December not November Second Harry said that Gulf proposed surcharge treatment for the capital costs of Smith earlier this year but eventually withdrew the application because the PPA it was trying to get in place whereby Southern would take ownership of the plant and sell energy and capacity back to Gulf drew a lot of flack I dont know if it matters but Susan Clark was told that Gulf withdrew the application because the discovery order in the docket would have required the release of Southern Company strategic planning material that Southern considered very confidential Withdrawal was preferable to disclosure I recognize that this may be only Gulfs spin on the withdrawal and they may have withdrawn for exactly the reason Harry suggests The strategic questions posed in Harrys email are complex and involve more than one Enron entity His questions defy a prompt response at least from us We suggest that it would be useful to convene a meeting in Houston including us and a representative from each whollyowned and potentially affected Enron entity That would facilitate the development and handicapping of a regulatory stance that is best for Enron Susans experience as a Florida Commissioner for nine years and General Counsel for years before that is useful in understanding the factors that inform staffs recommendations as well as a Commissioners decisions in this context Ive attached Susans information Let me know what you would like us to do Bill The information in this and related pages was automatically generated from the Case Management Systemdoc SFC BIOdoc
