Credit Derivs Mkt A Bit Askew Dow Jones International News Service via Dow Jones By Brian Fowler A Dow Jones Newswires Column TOKYO Dow JonesPricing levels in Tokyos credit derivatives market show its cheaper to buy protection on some toprated Japanese issuers these days than on US names with similar ratings a clear sign that recordhigh bankruptcies and bad debts in the banking system arent shaking the markets faith in this nations top companies Take for example Ford Motor Co F and Honda Motor Co HMC or Both have solid A credit ratings from Moodys Investors Service And yet as of last week the cost of credit default protection on fiveyear Honda US dollardenominated debt stood around basis points while protection on fiveyear debt issued by Ford Motor Credit Fords financing arm was around basis points Bankers and institutional investors use the credit derivatives market either to shed risk on loans and bonds or to take on risk as an investment In a credit default swap the most commonlyused credit derivative one party pays a fee measured in basis points on a notional value The recipient of the fee the risktaker is considered the investor In the case of Honda Motor Japanese banks looking to reduce the exposure in their portfolios to that companys debt would benefit from the relatively low cost of doing so But hedge funds nonlife insurers and other investors seeking exposure to Honda as a way of picking up revenue would get stuck with lower returns One of Hondas main markets is the US market so if an investor wants exposure to the US auto market Ford offers better spreads said Joseph Slankas assistant vice president in the Global Credit Derivatives division at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo The pricing distortions in Tokyos credit derivatives market can be linked to two main factors the low interest rate environment here and skewed supplydemand dynamics In the last two years markets have swung from a focus on hedging to being totally dominated by investors said Malcolm Perry managing director at JP Morgan Securities Asia Pet Limited in Tokyo Not surprisingly heavy demand to sell protection reduces the premium on that service More than anything else however the narrow spreads in Japans credit derivatives market underscore the relatively underdeveloped state of the nations corporate bond market and the effect this has on liquidity For decades Japanese companies have tended to rely heavily on bank financing rather than directly tapping capital markets As a result while Japans government bond market is as big or bigger than the Treasurys market the corporate bond market here remains relatively small The value of outstanding Japanese corporate bonds was around Y trillion at the end of February according to the Japan Securities Dealers Association Thats less than oneeighth the size of the US market where the value of outstanding issues stood at trillion at the end of December according to the US Bond Market Association A small market means a dearth of liquidity which inhibits trading in secondary markets On top of that the lack of an indigenous Japanese highyield market all of Japans highyield issuers are socalled fallen angels leaves investors with few opportunities to diversify their portfolios As a result the bulk of trading in Tokyos credit derivatives market involves names rated A or higher To be sure there are also historical factors that tilt the supplydemand balance Despite the badloan crisis here many Japanese bankers feel that domestic toprated companies are still a relatively safe bet in the international marketplace Even if ratings are the same we tend to feel that the real distance a corporation has to fall to default is larger here said Takashi Miyauchi manager of the Derivative Products Division at Fuji Bank Ltd Its not hard to see why The US corporate landscape has been scorched recently by the likes of companies such as Xerox Corp XRX and Lucent Technologies LU both of which have struggled over the past year with heavy debt loads and credit rating downgrades after having been considered solid credits going into the year Moodys cut its domestic currency rating for Xerox to Baa in September three notches below where the rating had been at the end of Lucents fall was even steeper to Baa in February four notches below where it was in October In contrast credit derivatives players in Tokyo say they cant recall a major credit event on a traded Japanese name since late when LongTerm Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank collapsed in quick succession The sense of relative safety regarding toprated Japanese names is a key factor in the dearth of tiering or spread between different grades of double A credits according to Kazuyasu Makabe vice president credit trading at JP Morgan Securities Asia Toyota Corp with tremendous fundamentals is rated AA and trades with a credit default swap rate around basis points in yen Sony another great company is two notches lower at AA and yet only trades about two basis points over Toyota Makabe said In the US you might expect the lowerrated credit to trade at a spread of basis points or more over the higherrated company Makabe said The upshot of this is that low spreads can squeeze some investors out of the market for Japanese names We are focusing on US and euro names because spreads on Japanese names are so tight said Koji Ogawa assistant manager of the Investment and Structured Finance Group at the Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co Pricing is an increasing concern for casualty insurers like Tokio Marine and Fire because the effects of deregulation have hit profitability in core operations while sluggish stock prices and rockbottom interest rates have weighed on investment returns The core businesses for nonlife companies are becoming less profitable so its important for them to diversify earnings sources said Ayako Nakajima nonlife insurer analyst at Standard Poors in Tokyo By

<10900696.1075843905288.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,joseph.hirl@enron.com,2001-04-25 10:12:00,Re Draft Organizational Announcement about Japan Cc A couple of thoughts to follow on from yesterday If your prime motivation in completing shutting down the merchant power effort versus turning it down is to send a strong signal to the government then I believe the message will be undermined by Enrons continued efforts through EPower In order to be most effective and show commitment to the message strategy then it would be consistent to shutdown the efforts of EPower something none of us believes makes sense While METI would understand that EJ reducing its efforts is significant they will breathe a sigh of relief that Enron is not pulling out of power since EPower efforts are continuing As many in the market still believe that EPower will be marketing and retailing power as well as building power plants it will look as though not much has changed regarding Enron In fact many of the other new entrants Marubeni Ennet Nippon Steel etc have indicated to us that they will reduce efforts now and look to the future for further change in effect exactly what we are talking about doing Many of these companies are looking at building Mw stations that could be available in the next months METI is undoubtedly aware of this and is working to bring pressure on the utes and further development to the market structure as soon as they are able timing uncertain In summary I believe that you would be able to send the same message through reducing EJs efforts down to a slow boil but allow us to keep abreast of what is going on and pushing initiatives in the month range Ahlstom initiatives Ennet merchant power plant financing proposal etc Imagine EJ commercial team of approx with some percentage of senior commercial oversight While not a prime motivating factor having a small team working this effort will also allow us to manage the existing relationships with the customers As an aside Air Liquide told us that they had been warned by their people in the US that Enron often backs out of deals at the last minute I dont bring this up as a reason to do an uneconomic deal but just to give an indication of the relationship factor Backing out of this deal and reducing our power efforts are the right things to do You also mentioned that if Enron wanted to look at the month type projects then we could accomplish this through EPower Based on the midterm deals that we have reviewed to date I think successful accomplishment here is unlikely I think that you have been made aware of most of these issues If EPower was operating in isolation then these projects would be continuing without any real insight on the commodity valuerisk proposition I believe that we have agreed on this point before and that value delivered for these types of projects is effectively EJ EPower On your suggestion of leaving this as a draft I believe this makes real sense Also Id like to make the announcement formal on May Next week is a holiday week in Japan and therefore very few people will be here Also I imagine that Morten Erik should likely have made a decision by then so the note can be adjusted accordingly This will help with the Japanese staff as they will have a much better idea of what the future will look like Jonathans toing and froing a couple of months ago caused a great deal of anxiety amongst the staff up until he was ready to give formal notification I have also made a couple of comments or suggestions below as well I hope this has been helpful regards Joe

have agreed on the QAs by then and to send it out the announcement on Thursday John To be sent to All Enron Europe all employees in Japan all Global Markets and all VPs and up around the company Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year including Metals Power marketing Power Plant Development via our investment in EnCom Coal LNG Weather While we have been able to close power transactions and there is real interest from customers for Enrontype power solutions Japan has not yet removed some significant barriers to make progress towards a full scale liberalized electricity market The regulators and key politicians are very much in favor of further liberalization and the benefits this would provide but the timing in uncertain Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan we will significantly reduce our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enrons traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market Based on these changes Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team made up of Enron Japan staff that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather Oil LNG Coal and Shipping We expect to continue our general recruiting of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership for Enron Japan and this will also include recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets Morten Erik Pettersen is still evaluating possibilities inside and outside of Japan and will decide shortly on his direction if we make this announcement on May as suggested above then we can make the previous sentence more precise The EquityFXInterest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year The EnCom group which is our power plant development business with minority partners and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in Japan We are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through Enron Metals in London By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing the Credit Derivative business These employees remain in Enron Credit a part of Enron Europe EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand by year end The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo office in the next couple of months In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been transitioned to London for support and this is not changing Jane McBride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report to Mark Evans General Counsel in London The RAC function will continue to report to Ted Murphy head of RAC for Enron Europe The Risk Management and Accounting team is headed by JanErland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to Fernley Dyson in London The IT HR Tax and real estate teams will also continue to functionally report to London Nick ODay who heads both the Public Affairs group Government Regulatory Affairs and the Public Relations in Japan will report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie Genle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick Shappiro in Houston We anticipate that his teams efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but he will also continue to provide support for Global Markets EBS Industrial Markets We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this will be a major profit center for profit growth for years to come Through these current changes

Credit Derivs Mkt A Bit Askew Dow Jones International News Service via Dow Jones By Brian Fowler A Dow Jones Newswires Column TOKYO Dow JonesPricing levels in Tokyos credit derivatives market show its cheaper to buy protection on some toprated Japanese issuers these days than on US names with similar ratings a clear sign that recordhigh bankruptcies and bad debts in the banking system arent shaking the markets faith in this nations top companies Take for example Ford Motor Co F and Honda Motor Co HMC or Both have solid A credit ratings from Moodys Investors Service And yet as of last week the cost of credit default protection on fiveyear Honda US dollardenominated debt stood around basis points while protection on fiveyear debt issued by Ford Motor Credit Fords financing arm was around basis points Bankers and institutional investors use the credit derivatives market either to shed risk on loans and bonds or to take on risk as an investment In a credit default swap the most commonlyused credit derivative one party pays a fee measured in basis points on a notional value The recipient of the fee the risktaker is considered the investor In the case of Honda Motor Japanese banks looking to reduce the exposure in their portfolios to that companys debt would benefit from the relatively low cost of doing so But hedge funds nonlife insurers and other investors seeking exposure to Honda as a way of picking up revenue would get stuck with lower returns One of Hondas main markets is the US market so if an investor wants exposure to the US auto market Ford offers better spreads said Joseph Slankas assistant vice president in the Global Credit Derivatives division at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo The pricing distortions in Tokyos credit derivatives market can be linked to two main factors the low interest rate environment here and skewed supplydemand dynamics In the last two years markets have swung from a focus on hedging to being totally dominated by investors said Malcolm Perry managing director at JP Morgan Securities Asia Pet Limited in Tokyo Not surprisingly heavy demand to sell protection reduces the premium on that service More than anything else however the narrow spreads in Japans credit derivatives market underscore the relatively underdeveloped state of the nations corporate bond market and the effect this has on liquidity For decades Japanese companies have tended to rely heavily on bank financing rather than directly tapping capital markets As a result while Japans government bond market is as big or bigger than the Treasurys market the corporate bond market here remains relatively small The value of outstanding Japanese corporate bonds was around Y trillion at the end of February according to the Japan Securities Dealers Association Thats less than oneeighth the size of the US market where the value of outstanding issues stood at trillion at the end of December according to the US Bond Market Association A small market means a dearth of liquidity which inhibits trading in secondary markets On top of that the lack of an indigenous Japanese highyield market all of Japans highyield issuers are socalled fallen angels leaves investors with few opportunities to diversify their portfolios As a result the bulk of trading in Tokyos credit derivatives market involves names rated A or higher To be sure there are also historical factors that tilt the supplydemand balance Despite the badloan crisis here many Japanese bankers feel that domestic toprated companies are still a relatively safe bet in the international marketplace Even if ratings are the same we tend to feel that the real distance a corporation has to fall to default is larger here said Takashi Miyauchi manager of the Derivative Products Division at Fuji Bank Ltd Its not hard to see why The US corporate landscape has been scorched recently by the likes of companies such as Xerox Corp XRX and Lucent Technologies LU both of which have struggled over the past year with heavy debt loads and credit rating downgrades after having been considered solid credits going into the year Moodys cut its domestic currency rating for Xerox to Baa in September three notches below where the rating had been at the end of Lucents fall was even steeper to Baa in February four notches below where it was in October In contrast credit derivatives players in Tokyo say they cant recall a major credit event on a traded Japanese name since late when LongTerm Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank collapsed in quick succession The sense of relative safety regarding toprated Japanese names is a key factor in the dearth of tiering or spread between different grades of double A credits according to Kazuyasu Makabe vice president credit trading at JP Morgan Securities Asia Toyota Corp with tremendous fundamentals is rated AA and trades with a credit default swap rate around basis points in yen Sony another great company is two notches lower at AA and yet only trades about two basis points over Toyota Makabe said In the US you might expect the lowerrated credit to trade at a spread of basis points or more over the higherrated company Makabe said The upshot of this is that low spreads can squeeze some investors out of the market for Japanese names We are focusing on US and euro names because spreads on Japanese names are so tight said Koji Ogawa assistant manager of the Investment and Structured Finance Group at the Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co Pricing is an increasing concern for casualty insurers like Tokio Marine and Fire because the effects of deregulation have hit profitability in core operations while sluggish stock prices and rockbottom interest rates have weighed on investment returns The core businesses for nonlife companies are becoming less profitable so its important for them to diversify earnings sources said Ayako Nakajima nonlife insurer analyst at Standard Poors in Tokyo By

<32423289.1075843950368.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,joseph.hirl@enron.com,2001-04-25 10:12:00,Re Draft Organizational Announcement about Japan Cc A couple of thoughts to follow on from yesterday If your prime motivation in completing shutting down the merchant power effort versus turning it down is to send a strong signal to the government then I believe the message will be undermined by Enrons continued efforts through EPower In order to be most effective and show commitment to the message strategy then it would be consistent to shutdown the efforts of EPower something none of us believes makes sense While METI would understand that EJ reducing its efforts is significant they will breathe a sigh of relief that Enron is not pulling out of power since EPower efforts are continuing As many in the market still believe that EPower will be marketing and retailing power as well as building power plants it will look as though not much has changed regarding Enron In fact many of the other new entrants Marubeni Ennet Nippon Steel etc have indicated to us that they will reduce efforts now and look to the future for further change in effect exactly what we are talking about doing Many of these companies are looking at building Mw stations that could be available in the next months METI is undoubtedly aware of this and is working to bring pressure on the utes and further development to the market structure as soon as they are able timing uncertain In summary I believe that you would be able to send the same message through reducing EJs efforts down to a slow boil but allow us to keep abreast of what is going on and pushing initiatives in the month range Ahlstom initiatives Ennet merchant power plant financing proposal etc Imagine EJ commercial team of approx with some percentage of senior commercial oversight While not a prime motivating factor having a small team working this effort will also allow us to manage the existing relationships with the customers As an aside Air Liquide told us that they had been warned by their people in the US that Enron often backs out of deals at the last minute I dont bring this up as a reason to do an uneconomic deal but just to give an indication of the relationship factor Backing out of this deal and reducing our power efforts are the right things to do You also mentioned that if Enron wanted to look at the month type projects then we could accomplish this through EPower Based on the midterm deals that we have reviewed to date I think successful accomplishment here is unlikely I think that you have been made aware of most of these issues If EPower was operating in isolation then these projects would be continuing without any real insight on the commodity valuerisk proposition I believe that we have agreed on this point before and that value delivered for these types of projects is effectively EJ EPower On your suggestion of leaving this as a draft I believe this makes real sense Also Id like to make the announcement formal on May Next week is a holiday week in Japan and therefore very few people will be here Also I imagine that Morten Erik should likely have made a decision by then so the note can be adjusted accordingly This will help with the Japanese staff as they will have a much better idea of what the future will look like Jonathans toing and froing a couple of months ago caused a great deal of anxiety amongst the staff up until he was ready to give formal notification I have also made a couple of comments or suggestions below as well I hope this has been helpful regards Joe

have agreed on the QAs by then and to send it out the announcement on Thursday John To be sent to All Enron Europe all employees in Japan all Global Markets and all VPs and up around the company Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year including Metals Power marketing Power Plant Development via our investment in EnCom Coal LNG Weather While we have been able to close power transactions and there is real interest from customers for Enrontype power solutions Japan has not yet removed some significant barriers to make progress towards a full scale liberalized electricity market The regulators and key politicians are very much in favor of further liberalization and the benefits this would provide but the timing in uncertain Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan we will significantly reduce our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enrons traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market Based on these changes Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team made up of Enron Japan staff that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather Oil LNG Coal and Shipping We expect to continue our general recruiting of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership for Enron Japan and this will also include recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets Morten Erik Pettersen is still evaluating possibilities inside and outside of Japan and will decide shortly on his direction if we make this announcement on May as suggested above then we can make the previous sentence more precise The EquityFXInterest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year The EnCom group which is our power plant development business with minority partners and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in Japan We are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through Enron Metals in London By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing the Credit Derivative business These employees remain in Enron Credit a part of Enron Europe EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand by year end The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo office in the next couple of months In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been transitioned to London for support and this is not changing Jane McBride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report to Mark Evans General Counsel in London The RAC function will continue to report to Ted Murphy head of RAC for Enron Europe The Risk Management and Accounting team is headed by JanErland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to Fernley Dyson in London The IT HR Tax and real estate teams will also continue to functionally report to London Nick ODay who heads both the Public Affairs group Government Regulatory Affairs and the Public Relations in Japan will report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie Genle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick Shappiro in Houston We anticipate that his teams efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but he will also continue to provide support for Global Markets EBS Industrial Markets We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this will be a major profit center for profit growth for years to come Through these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company

names are so tight said Koji Ogawa assistant manager of the Investment and Structured Finance Group at the Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co Pricing is an increasing concern for casualty insurers like Tokio Marine and Fire because the effects of deregulation have hit profitability in core operations while sluggish stock prices and rockbottom interest rates have weighed on investment returns The core businesses for nonlife companies are becoming less profitable so its important for them to diversify earnings sources said Ayako Nakajima nonlife insurer analyst at Standard Poors in Tokyo By

Jeffrey A Subject AntiEnron rhetoric Importance High Sensitivity Confidential Robert We have been the target of a number of web based articles on a site hosted by ERex an electricity market broker ERex is owned by Mitsui and a couple of banks The website is located at wwwerexcojp with links to energy newsnet The articles are in Japanese and we have translated these below We are not the only target but certainly one of the main company targets We have not spoken with ERex or any of its owners It is generally believed that there are a number of different writers Mr Z but maintain their anonymity It seems to us as though there are clearly some inside sources that are being used Could be EPower or Enron Japan Any thoughts Joe News Behind the Scenes September E Power Practically Dissolved What was the Cause of Its Downfall MrZ A man behind the scenes E Power a power generation company which is jointly funded by Enron a US energy giant and Orix was dissolved for all intents and purposes on the th of this month On this day people including Mr Carey Sloan chairman and Mr Tatsuro Seguchi president left E Power and Mr J ODay sic who used to be the vice president of Enron Japan assumed the office of president and CEO of E Power At the same time E Powers office was moved from a building in Shinjyuku Tokyo to within Enron Japans office located in the First Square Building in Otemachi Tokyo Rumors are starting to spread amongst people in the industry that the two companies will merge together in the near future According to a source in a trading company the recent mass departure from E Power took place because Enron Corp which was irritated by E Powers poor business results fired everyone who were related to the companys generation department Moreover all of the companys power plant siting projects except for a project in Ube Yamaguchi Prefecture will apparently be brought back to square one It is looking likely that the companys largescale gasfired power plant project in Rokkashomura Aomori Prefecture which drew the attention of the energy industry will be killed off even before a piece of land was obtained for the project The greatest cause of the companys downfall was that it was unable to show any clear business strategy At the time of foundation the company was intending to conduct mainly trading and intermediation of electricity However the company changed its objective to siting its own power plants because it realized that securing of surplus electricity was difficult Furthermore because acquisition of land had not been going well for the company the company until recently had been considering energysaving service ESCO as a stopgap measure until a power plant could be constructed So far the company has not been able to conduct any business that produced a cash flow In other words the company has been operating with a loss ever since its establishment It is hardly possible for Enron which is avaricious when it comes to pursuing costeffectiveness to leave this situation as it is One could say that E Power has done well to have held out this long Another cause a hidden cause of E Powers downfall was surely the fact that the company held up high a flag that showed the fiveletter word Enron A few years ago a person related to a certain IPP turned down an offer from E Power to purchase its surplus energy saying that although he wouldnt mind selling power to E Power he had not intention of selling any power to Enron It may have been a mistake for E Power which was established mainly around electricity business specialists from trading companies such as Marubeni to have joined hands with Enron which is particularly good at using business methods that would not be accepted in Japan News Behind the Scenes Another Article Title not available Before I was able to overcome the astonishment that I felt regarding the terrorist attacks in the United States a major massacre took place on the following Monday on the th at EPower an affiliated company of a major energy trading company in the United States Enron Corp I had thought that a major restructuring would take place soon or later but the extent of which made me realize just how dry an American company could be It has been almost two years since EPower was established and for some employees including executives the term of contract was about to end In that sense it is not surprising that things happened In any case all EPower employees numbering close to were called into the office by email on the th and people were told there and then that they were fired Quite amazing EPowers office was moved immediately to where Enron Japans office is located in the First Square Building in Otemachi Chiyodaku from Shinjyuku Center Building in NishiShinjyuku Shinjyukyku Tokyo The efficient way in which everything was executed was like a wellplanned coup detat You could say that an Enron cruise missile has made a direct hit on EPower As I described above EPower was established two years ago under the auspices of Enron Corp as the standardbearer of electricity liberalization At one stage the company sent shockwaves through the electricity industry being compared to the black ships that came to Japan at the end of Tokugawa shogunate regime However despite the companys promising start the company seems to be heading towards an anticlimax It is of most peoples opinion that the companys capital subscriber Enron Corp will abandon the company in the end dissolving the company as soon as the remaining businesses are cleared up Among the people fired from EPower I hear that there is someone who joined the company in April this year There certainly was a problem with EPowers management increasing the number of staff without making much of a business progress However I question highly the way in which Enron carried out dismissal en masse Enron probably would argue its case by saying that people have no right to complain because the company had observed applicable laws and contracts However laws and contracts are only minimal obligations It seems that the company has no recognition of the fact that a higherlevel consideration is necessary for people with different cultures to work together Not unlike the US Government which does not recognize that one of the major reasons for the recent terrorist attacks on the United States was due to the shortcomings in its Middle East Islam policy Enron too does not understand the key elements in doing business in Japan News Behind the Scenes September A Black Ship Named Enron Runs Aground in Japanese Waters MrZ A man behind the scenes Enron may pull out of the Japanese market in the near future this is the opinion that is beginning to spread amongst people related to the energy industry in Japan The reason for this is that both EPower an electricity retailing company jointly funded by Enron and Orix Corp and Enron Japan a fullyowned energy trading company of Enron are being forced to fight a desperate battle in the Japanese market In particular the way EPower is running about in confusion stands out quite conspicuously The company when founded in looked to conduct electricity intermediation business but has been having a hard time trying to launch the business because of significant barriers in the liberalized electricity market In spite of the fact that the company has changed its strategy to building its own power plants in various places such as Omuta in Fukuoka Ube in Yamaguchi Rokkashomura in Aomori etc the company is still having a difficult time trying to obtain the necessary sites Within such an environment the companys CEO Mr Bruce Wrobel left EPower in February this year because his plans for the company differed from that of Enron Corps Then in August Mr Hiroo Awano who has been quite active in visible scenes such as dealing with the media as a deputy representative and the spokesman for the company was suddenly fired It seems that he was made responsible for the companys poor performances There is also information floating around that EPower has been examining the possibility of conducting energysaving service business in cooperation with large electrical appliance manufacturers automobile manufacturers general construction companies etc until its electricity retailing business gets going It is unclear whether this is a present progressive development or not However it is possible to catch a glimpse of the companys impatience as it strives to achieve whatever result possible Meanwhile there is a rumor that Enron Japan will carry out a major corporate restructuring Amalgamation with EPower could also be a possibility The US Government and USTR are making multitude of demands to the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry through USJapan Deregulation Conference so that they could somehow make Enrons advances into the Japanese market a success However it seems that Enrons solidarity with politics is producing a result opposite to what was intended Could a black ship named Enron which has run aground in the Japanese waters go to the bottom after all before too
