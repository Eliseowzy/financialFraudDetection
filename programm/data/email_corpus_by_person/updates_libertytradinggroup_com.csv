options on the SP listen to Michael Pinsons interview of James Cordier on the Market Mavens Radio Show from January Click here marketmavensradiorm High Percentage Trading on the SP By James Cordier Michael Gross Liberty Trading Group From MarketMavenscom January With the volatility and higher option premiums the SP can be an ideal market for the properly capitalized trader to write option premium for increased returns As we all know this is the king of the futures markets and thus deserves the respect of the option writer For this reason we only participate in the most conservative of trades when dealing with this contract Option sellers as well as their brokers like to sleep at night That being said the rewards can still be very attractive While we do not pretend to know what the stock market is going to do we cannot help but get caught up in the positive outlook for Barring another catastrophic terrorist attack we find it hard to imagine any reason the stock market would go below the lows set back in September For that reason we recommend the following simple high probability strategy which if successful will yield about a return within months Instead of trying to pick individual stocks or trying to guess what the SP will do tomorrow or next week a trader takes an alternate way out At the time of this writing the June SP is trading at about A trader can SELL a June SP put option and collect about for every option sold The margin to do this is around per option at this time For the option to go in the money the June SP would have to fall over points before June That is a full points below the low established in the wake of September th If the market moves higher from here it should be an easy ride as the option deteriorates and expires worthless and the option seller keeps the money If the market stays steady the option expires worthless the option seller keeps the money If the market falls but stays above the option expires worthless the option seller keeps the money Only if the market is Below at expiration does the seller have a loss However before you run out and liquidate the retirement account lets take a look at the downside possibilities of the trade First of all this trade is only recommended for the comfortably capitalized account A drop of or even points in the SP would still not put your option in the money But it may temporarily increase the value of your option and thus also your margin requirement A trader should have adequate back up capital in his account if he intends to ride out such an occurrence The other risk of course would be the futures being below at option expiration which makes the trader long the June SP at not necessarily a bad thing However if the market continues to fall down past and the trader continues to hold his position losses could be substantial Stock traders considering this strategy should ask themselves the following question What type of return do I hope to make on my stock portfolio by June of this year Is it close to What type of losses would I incur in my stock portfolio if the SP fell to In the option trade you still make In a move below the odds are good for a lot of traders that the losses they would incur in their stock portfolio would be much greater than being short the SP at In other words we think this is a good way to trade the stock market As we said in the beginning we dont know what the stock market is going to do But from a risk standpoint we like being long from If you would like to discuss trading this way for your account please feel
