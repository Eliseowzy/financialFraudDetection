<16474767.1075855808521.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,richard.causey@enron.com,2000-02-10 08:49:00,Re Trading Support Operations London Cc fully with the last sentence E mail is not an appropriate forum to discuss an issue like this This may be somewhat moot given Fernleys latest e mail but I believe this warrants direct communication Fernley I would suggest you set up a discussion that would include this group and may grow to include AA at some point to get their perspective directly As I have indicated before I believe Barry is a valuable asset but may need some more managing Ted CT PM To Fernley CT cc Rick CT Sally CT Richard NRON Subject Re Trading Support Operations London Fernley On January I had breakfast in London with a shaking Richard Sage who recounted the tail of Barry threatening his bonus and employment for doing exactly what Jeff Skilling told him to do in the previous November Subsequently Richard was moved from his position and Barry promoted If that is dealing with the situation this actually reflects on your credibility If you think that an open communication independent back office message was sent to the back and middle office in Houston and London by virtue of your promotion of Barry twice in months then you are sorely mistaken On February the Arthur Andersen team including Tom Bauer John Sorrells and Jim Brown stated that Barry was an issue in satisfactorily completing the Audit tasks from London I am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here You have dismissed my advice and you need to do what you need to do If the goal is to get me to change my view you have a big hole to dig out of I obviously cant change your point of view I still feel a responsiblity to express the views that I have and others are afraid to surface It is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere Need I go on Let us stop the email wars now They serve no productive purpose Ted Fernley Dyson AM To Ted CT cc Rick CT Sally CT Richard NRON Subject Re Trading Support Operations London Ted We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followedup on specific instances you have mentioned I believe they date back to and prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout and the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has changed since then We are not so Barrydependent We have a team of quality risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary recruiting ground for the RAC team David Port Oliver Gaylard Barrys role is much less handson now and he is not our candidate for the Global Products position this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney The role I suggest for Barry is the high level coordination of the operations team his energy enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan combined with his considerable institutional knowledge making a superior candidate difficult to find Frankly I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth but to address the relationship issue that clearly exists I do not belittle this issue and while I dont think that anyone can point to any prosecutable offences that Barry may have committed in recent history his management style doesnt help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and objective I will say that he has always been open and frank very frank with me indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a different story to tell on Helsinki As an aside I have not been involved in or consulted on the World Tour although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks back I think it is great that Brent Price is involved but we would be happy to contribute staff to this too Regards Fernley To Fernley CT cc Rick Buy Sally CT Subject Re Trading Support Operations London Fernley As we discussed earlier this year I have serious concerns about Barry that I think are both wellfounded and reasonably well documented To be fair I will say that since Q of last year I have not seen any FURTHER prosecutable offenses and he has made some attempts at being more communicative However I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his transformation particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in charge of the office Probably more to the point it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team that is not so Barrydependent Evidence to this effect are the fact that he is your only candidate for the Global Products position that someone from Houston has to be part of the World Tour in Europe Brent Price that your candidates for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David Port or Richard Sage and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve Young Further for the record I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry has a credibility issue Arthur Andersen other Global Products personnell and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me I just happen to be the most vocal Ted Fernley Dyson PM To Richard NRON cc Rick CT John CT Ted CT Sally CT Subject Trading Support Operations London Rick Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support function particularly as it relates to our Global Products business we already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more permanent solution Well nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry understands this as well as anybody If we had a more suitable candidate we would give himher the job I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last months along with the team that we have built around him Im convinced that he can add significant value by drawing the Global Products support functions in to the fold However he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and whilst I do not share Teds views I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate known and trusted within Houston who can instill confidence there Steve Young head of RAC in London may be an interesting option although Im sure he would not be easy to replace In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will be monitoring the situation very closely Regards Fernley

have the AS resources wont fix the problem Also what is the plan re SAP Mike CT PM To Richard NRON Rick CT Sally CT cc Fernley CT Michael R CT Ted CT Subject Metals Imminent Actions an update Rick Rick Sally I attach the executive summary of a note sent to the office of the chair last week detailing current operational difficulties with the Metals Merchanting business Subsequently an all hands meeting was called to discuss the operational issues and the business imperatives of Off Balance Sheet Facility OBSF renegotiation Minimising working captial SAP implementation The notes of that meeting are also attached at the bottom of this email Should you require any further information please call otherwise I will forward updates as they are completed Regards Mike ISSUE The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure OBSF pre yearend to meet Enron requirements for gearing ratios Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants these being bearer documents it does present an issue when physical metal the value o f which depends upon brand and location is placed into the facility Given t he hard deadline of yearend the operational support of this process initially took place on spreadsheets The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business should not be underestimated The process of moving material off and on balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement s particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in the AS With the specified functionality it is believed that all operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed satisfactorily The core functionality which was due prior to the yearend was released during January but was subsequently found to have introduced bugs t o the integrated business control processes Whilst an improvement on having no OBSF functionality the bugs have had an increasingly negative effe ct on the control environment compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a guaranteed delivery for the bug fixes and non core reporting functionality This has given rise to the following concerns There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at a brand location level to coordination records the global position is reconciled however It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EMCL as a PL on spread moves from Cash to months positions and related cash to months provisions can not be produced by the system and must be estimate d and b System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values These concerns are compounded by the following The most experienced AS IT developer for the EMCL business has resigned He is currently working his months notice which will expire in July The most experienced AS IT developer on the EML side of the business h as also resigned He left in January There is no documentation for the AS It is therefore difficult for experienced AS programmers to get upto speed on the system Conclusion It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the AS system and the renegotiation of the OBSF facility with Barclays The current situation has arisen due to nondelivery of IT developments and tig ht timescales on the finalisation of the OBSF facility To meet Q end requirements ie full production of the DPR and stock reconciliation IT and the OBSF deal team must make concrete commitments o n delivery timeline The business will not be able to commit to successful implementation of the facility and resubstantiation

with the situation this actually reflects on your credibility If you think that an open communication independent back office message was sent to the back and middle office in Houston and London by virtue of your promotion of Barry twice in months then you are sorely mistaken On February the Arthur Andersen team including Tom Bauer John Sorrells and Jim Brown stated that Barry was an issue in satisfactorily completing the Audit tasks from London I am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here You have dismissed my advice and you need to do what you need to do If the goal is to get me to change my view you have a big hole to dig out of I obviously cant change your point of view I still feel a responsiblity to express the views that I have and others are afraid to surface It is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere Need I go on Let us stop the email wars now They serve no productive purpose Ted Fernley Dyson AM To Ted CT cc Rick CT Sally CT Richard NRON Subject Re Trading Support Operations London Ted We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followedup on specific instances you have mentioned I believe they date back to and prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout and the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has changed since then We are not so Barrydependent We have a team of quality risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary recruiting ground for the RAC team David Port Oliver Gaylard Barrys role is much less handson now and he is not our candidate for the Global Products position this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney The role I suggest for Barry is the high level coordination of the operations team his energy enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan combined with his considerable institutional knowledge making a superior candidate difficult to find Frankly I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth but to address the relationship issue that clearly exists I do not belittle this issue and while I dont think that anyone can point to any prosecutable offences that Barry may have committed in recent history his management style doesnt help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and objective I will say that he has always been open and frank very frank with me indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a different story to tell on Helsinki As an aside I have not been involved in or consulted on the World Tour although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks back I think it is great that Brent Price is involved but we would be happy to contribute staff to this too Regards Fernley To Fernley CT cc Rick Buy Sally CT Subject Re Trading Support Operations London Fernley As we discussed earlier this year I have serious concerns about Barry that I think are both wellfounded and reasonably well documented To be fair I will say that since Q of last year I have not seen any FURTHER prosecutable offenses and he has made some attempts at being more communicative However I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his transformation particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in charge of the office Probably more to the point it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team that is not so Barrydependent Evidence to this effect are the fact that he is your only candidate for the Global Products position that someone from Houston has to be part of the World Tour in Europe Brent Price that your candidates for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David Port or Richard Sage and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve Young Further for the record I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry has a credibility issue Arthur Andersen other Global Products personnell and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me I just happen to be the most vocal Ted Fernley Dyson PM To Richard NRON cc Rick CT John CT Ted CT Sally CT Subject Trading Support Operations London Rick Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support function particularly as it relates to our Global Products business we already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more permanent solution Well nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry understands this as well as anybody If we had a more suitable candidate we would give himher the job I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last months along with the team that we have built around him Im convinced that he can add significant value by drawing the Global Products support functions in to the fold However he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and whilst I do not share Teds views I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate known and trusted within Houston who can instill confidence there Steve Young head of RAC in London may be an interesting option although Im sure he would not be easy to replace In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will be monitoring the situation very closely Regards Fernley
