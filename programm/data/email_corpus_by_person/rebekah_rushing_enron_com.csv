<2908531.1075862889009.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,rebekah.rushing@enron.com,2001-11-14 08:15:03,Mr Lay I wanted to send you a note to say I appreciate the way that you have been handling things I have alot of respect for you My name is Rebekah Rushi ng I consider myself an Enron grandbaby My mother Helena Payne worked for HNG and then Enron for a total of years She was an accounting cler k and retired in April of this year when the accounting group was outsource d Going through that process with my mother was an eye opener for me ho wever after numerous meetings with her supervisor and the human resources d epartment I feel comfortable that Enron did a good job of taking care of h er in that situation Her supervisor even made it possible for her to rece ive her year grandfather clock The one thing that does trouble me is t he fact that allot of the people that were around in Enrons beginning that well call the worker bees the people that you could count to get the jo b done behind the scenes have lost alot due to the poor decisions that upp er management have made My mother along with many others in her situatio n were the people that this company could and still can count on they are loyal to Enron and alot of them had the majority of their K invested in Enron stock This was the majority of their live savings they do not have anything to fall back on In my mothers case as is the case with many ot her retired or soon to be retired Enron employees she lost in her K and only had a little over in it to begin with I work with a lady that has been with Enron for years and was looking forward to re tiring within the next years but now shes not sure if shell be able to because she too lost alot in her K I realize that its been said m any times a K is not a sure thing but the people that Im referring to had been around for a long time knew the track record of Enron and showed their loyalty to the company The second thing that concerns me is that this same group of employees have the possibility of being faced with looki ng for a job Most of them are years or older and have been with this c ompany for many years Theyve survived all the different reorganizations because theyve had great work ethic They werent always the most innova tive but theyve always been the most loyal and dependable Instead of t heir dream of retiring theyre now faced with the possibility of having to find another job Interviewing will not be as easy for them because in s ome cases they havent had to interview for another company in quite some time I know the politically correct statement is that they will not be di scriminated against because of their age however statistics show that in s ome cases when a hiring supervisor has a younger candidate and a more matur e candidate they usually will select the younger candidate They wo uldnt admit to discrimination of age but it does happen These are the people that my heart goes out to I wish that there was some way that these loyal and dedicated employees could be taken care of I ad mire you for your decision to waive your rights to the provision that you w ould have received I realize that everyone has lost something due to the events that have occurred I just wish there was a way that the generation ahead of me that has been with Enron could recoop a portion of what theyv e lost It the least that they deserve Thank you for your time Rebekah Rushing Enron Principal Investments phone fax
