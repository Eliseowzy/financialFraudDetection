creating shareholder value He stressed that the Companys acquisition of a large shareholding in Gasco Energy Inc was the first move in its strategy of becoming a major participant in the energy sector by positioning the Company between the junior and senior players in the industry He indicated that the coming year was going to be a very active year for the Company which was now wholly focused on

its shareholders in the near and long term we announced our shift in business focus from Internet payment processing to energy He stressed that the Company would play to its strengths including the financial expertise of the board and management which will in our judgment be of enormous value to small energy companies which are often very practiced in finding the right holdings but less so when it comes to dealing with the financial aspects of being a publicly listed vehicle or dealing with large listed companies said Mr Robinson He continued by saying Operating under the name of Brek Energy Corporation the Company will continue to acquire projects in the energy sector during in addition to those we have acquired via our holding in Gasco Energy Gasco is a good example of the type of
