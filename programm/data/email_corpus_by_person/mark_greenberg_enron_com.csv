Agreement Ray Thanks for the response and the black line Below are my additional comments The reference to Hardware Products needs to be deleted as does the Schedule B It is my understanding that the hardware is provided by a different vendor If it is necessary to reference the hardware as a requirement for running the software programs this should be listed in Schedule A as a specification Paragraph the term its best efforts should be replaced with reasonable efforts and if it is Quallabys position that Enron pursue confidential treatment of the information despite legal requirements to disclosed placed on Enron the reasonable cost for pursuing this protection should be borne by Quallaby Paragraph the change made at the end of the paragraph needs to read BUT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF SECTION a AND b ABOVE Since neither of the referenced provisions are themselves warranties it is incorrect to reference them in as being warranties Paragraph the following language should be inserted after the word applications save and except for any indemnity obligations of Quallaby set forth in Section above By not having this reference it is possible that section could be read to negate Quallabys obligations as set out in Section In Section of the Agreement a new paragraph should be added as paragraph to indicate as follows The provisions of Sections and shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement This is more so important now that Quallaby has included specific provisions enabling it to terminate the agreement upon a threat of an infringement claim With changes in the areas indicated above incorporated into the agreement we are prepared to move this matter forward Thanks for your
