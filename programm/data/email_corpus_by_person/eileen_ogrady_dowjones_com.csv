Policy Make State A Magnet for Power Plants And an Island Unto Itself A Wire Enshrined in Lucite By Alexei Barrionuevo and Russell Gold Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal via Dow Jones While California struggles to keep its lights on and New York City braces for possible electricity shortages this summer Texas utilities could soon face the opposite problem a power glut Texas wideopen spaces and relatively weak zoning and environmental rules have helped make the Lone Star state a magnet for powergeneration companies as it prepares to deregulate its electricity market next year The result Texas electricityproduction capacity this summer is expected to exceed its peak power demand by megawatts nearly enough to light up New York City By the summer of the excess may be closer to megawatts enough to power million homes And with new generating plants under construction more than any other state some power producers fear that overbuilding ultimately could send Texas wholesale electricity prices into a tailspin All this sounds like good news for the electricitystarved East and West Coasts but it isnt Thats because the US is divided into three major power grids with the West on one the East on another and most of Texas on a third with very few links to the rest of the country In the world of electricity that makes Texas an island with a couple of little footpaths over to it says Larry Makovich senior director for electric power research at Cambridge Energy Research Associates a Cambridge Mass consulting firm Some Texas utility executives argue that their states island status is principally an accident of geography But no one disputes the fact that good old Texas pride and a deepseated skepticism toward federal regulation also played a role in shaping the states grid So too did a renegade utilitys desperate bid to save itself from a corporate breakup and the resulting fouryear legal battle which the industry later dubbed the Texas Range War Texas isolation isnt expected to end anytime soon If Texas became fully interconnected its big utilities say the state could become more susceptible to blackouts if other regions drew off too much power From a reliability standpoint it would be a degradation to the Texas grid says Steve Schaeffer a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Inc the former Houston Lighting Power Co Moreover the utilities estimate that building the transmission lines needed for a full connection to the nations other grids would take at least three years and cost Texas ratepayers about million They dont want to invest that much money to sell power to California or New York to ease what they view as temporary imbalances Some in the state also believe low rates and excess power could give it an advantage in persuading businesses to locate there America will be shy enough electricity that this will be one of our greatest inducements for growing Texas says Matthew Simmons president of Houston investment bank Simmons Co Texas is an extreme example of the haphazard way electricity grids developed in the US Until the s most power plants were built near the customers they served Then utilities began building larger moreefficient coal and nuclear plants connecting them with their neighbors to ensure that if one of these big plants went down there would be a backup ready to keep the power flowing But the oldline Texas utilities which have long benefited from the states plentiful supplies of fuels such as natural gas and lignite coal were reluctant to join in this wave of interconnections Back then in the mid to late s electricity outside Texas was generally more costly And surrounding states werent planning big enough plants to back up the huge new ones Texas was building to power its fastgrowing cities and energythirsty petrochemical industry There was no big money to be made by shipping power one way or the other over the lines says Reliants Mr Schaeffer By confining their grid to Texas state utilities also avoided oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Thus FERC couldnt force Texas to send power out of state in case of an emergency The states dominant utilities Texas Utilities Inc the Dallasbased predecessor of what is now TXU Corp and Houston Lighting went to great lengths to ensure there were no interstate connections The switches at a hydroelectric plant on the TexasOklahoma border were wired to prevent power from flowing between the states Elsewhere along the border a system of relays was installed to prevent unauthorized interstate transmissions Only one big utility didnt like the setup Central South West Corp a Dallas holding company that owned power plants in both Texas and Oklahoma In it faced a crisis If it couldnt show that its plants in both states were interconnected it ran the risk of being broken up under a federal law The law which barred holding companies from owning unconnected utilities in separate states was decades old But until then it hadnt been strictly enforced On May eight days before the Securities and Exchange Commission was set to consider the matter Central South West took an extraordinary step At am it sent one of its line crews to secretly rewire a substation in Vernon Texas near the Oklahoma border allowing power to flow freely between the two states For a few hours the grids were connected by a minuscule thread Later that morning officials at Central South West phoned other Texas utilities to tell them the company was engaged in interstate commerce Texas other major utilities reacted angrily The sons of bitches are trying to steal my lignite Texas Utilities Chairman Louis Austin bellowed according to former Texas Public Utility Commissioner George Cowden who recalls Mr Austin making the remark during a private meeting between the two men Around noon Houston Lighting cut its system off from the rest of the states utilities Texas Utilities followed suit hours later By days end the states utilities had broken the grid into a halfdozen pieces That same day one of Texas Utilities chief lawyers a foot former collegefootball star named JA Tiny Gooch dispatched one of his companys crews to disconnect the link Central South West had made between Vernon and Altus Okla They made it so it was physically impossible to connect it again says Mr Goochs son Gordon then a lawyer representing Houston Lighting The elder Mr Gooch who died in is considered the patron saint of Texas electrical independence At an emergency meeting of the utility commission three days later Mr Austin of Texas Utilities expressed disgust at the prospect of having to burn Texas lignite and natural gas to satisfy Yankees according to a transcript And he added I dont like federal regulations Mr Austin died in A wire reputed to have formed part of Central South Wests brief TexasOklahoma interconnection later was cut into pieces encased in Lucite and given out as

as fodder for a novel The Power Exchange in which a winter storm cripples Northeast power production and the nation turns to Texas for electricity Texas refuses to ship the electricity fearful that other regions would drain it of what little cheap fuel was left Ultimately Texas becomes a scapegoat and ends up seceding from the union In reality the outcome was less dramatic The grid conflict wound its way through many courtrooms Central South West recently acquired by American Electric Power Co of Columbus Ohio lost almost every round After about four years the utilities hashed out a compromise at the urging of the federal government Rather than link the Texas grid to the East so that electricity could flow freely across state borders through alternatingcurrent cables they agreed to build two directcurrent lines Operators could control the flow over these bridges which at peak capacity could carry a mere megawatts The parties to the deal which included the federal government agreed these links wouldnt bring the Texas grid under federal jurisdiction Today Texas power continues to be regulated in Austin not Washington Its just a Texas thing says Pat Wood III chairman of the state utility commission and a recent Bush administration nominee to FERC We want control of our own destiny That independent attitude has extended in recent years to Texas businessfriendly approach to deregulating its power industry Unlike California with its stringent emissions and zoning rules Texas has made it quick and easy for power companies to locate their plants almost anywhere they can find a place to hook up to the grid Last year Texas completed a major upgrade to alleviate bottlenecks on the grid and it has six similar projects under way Unlike most other states it decided to charge grid users a flat rate to move power anywhere in the state so they could put plants in lowcost rural areas far from their customers Those policies as well as projections that the states electricity demand would grow by a robust a year set off a flurry of powerplant construction beginning in Since then billion worth of power plants have been completed or started in Texas and more are on the drawing board By contrast to Californias approach to deregulation which largely failed to bring new plants online Texas strategy encouraged an overbuild says Mr Makovich of Cambridge Energy Research Associates Consider tiny Seguin in south central Texas where Constellation Energy Group Inc of Baltimore is building an megawatt gaspowered plant in a former cornfield Fifteen miles to the west Texas Independent Energy LP of Dallas recently finished a megawatt plant About the same distance to the north American National Power a Houstonbased unit of Britains International Power PLC is building a megawatt plant If generators dont get cold feet Texas is on track to have a capacity surplus of this summer and by summer says Cambridge Energy Research Associates Thats in addition to the surplus that most experts consider an adequate cushion Some areas of the country including parts of the Southeast Upper Midwest New York City and the West are struggling with razorthin capacity margins After factoring in a similar cushion the West has an capacity deficit and the Upper Midwest has a deficit As a result while electricity futures prices for summer are running at as much as per megawatt hour in the Northwest and around in the Northeast Texas futures prices are averaging only to per megawatt hour Calpine Corp of San Jose Calif is making the boldest wager that overcapacity and a lack of export possibilities wont sink Texas wholesale electricity prices The company has six plants under construction in the state two of which are expected to come on line next month And it plans to add an additional five plants over the next two years Altogether Calpine plans to spend about billion in the state its largest investment outside California People from day one probably thought Calpine was crazy says Darrell Hayslip a company vice president But so far we are absolutely convinced that this is the right bet He says Calpines newer gasfired plants are more efficient than older plants in the state a third of which are at least years old Calpine expects that edge to force rivals to retire older plants thus keeping electricity prices from sagging Others arent so sure After initially planning new plants in Texas Duke Energy Corp began to worry that the state was getting overbuilt Last May Duke of Charlotte NC sold its stake in a plant under construction in south Texas to Calpine We sized up the market early and then realized too many followers were doing the same thing says Jim Donnell president and CEO of Duke Energy North America If the electricity situation outside Texas grows too grim and too much supply sinks prices in the state there could be renewed pressure for Texas to study interconnection options says John Stauffacher vice president for regulatory affairs at Houstonbased Dynegy Inc which has megawatts of capacity in Texas Calpine for one wouldnt mind sharing Texas power with the East and West I would love to be able to wheel power from Texas to California says Mr Hayslip But so far the Texas utilities havent budged in their opposition to exports A few generators are trying to find the best of both worlds Tenaska Inc of Omaha Neb is building plants at the border between the Texas and eastern grids Though utilities arent allowed to be connected to both grids at once the plants are designed to allow the company to switch between grids as demand and prices warrant In rural Grimes County about miles outside Houston Tenaska plant manager Frank Carelli boasts that his megawatt plant could disconnect from one grid connect to the other and

Then utilities began building larger moreefficient coal and nuclear plants connecting them with their neighbors to ensure that if one of these big plants went down there would be a backup ready to keep the power flowing But the oldline Texas utilities which have long benefited from the states plentiful supplies of fuels such as natural gas and lignite coal were reluctant to join in this wave of interconnections Back then in the mid to late s electricity outside Texas was generally more costly And surrounding states werent planning big enough plants to back up the huge new ones Texas was building to power its fastgrowing cities and energythirsty petrochemical industry There was no big money to be made by shipping power one way or the other over the lines says Reliants Mr Schaeffer By confining their grid to Texas state utilities also avoided oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Thus FERC couldnt force Texas to send power out of state in case of an emergency The states dominant utilities Texas Utilities Inc the Dallasbased predecessor of what is now TXU Corp and Houston Lighting went to great lengths to ensure there were no interstate connections The switches at a hydroelectric plant on the TexasOklahoma border were wired to prevent power from flowing between the states Elsewhere along the border a system of relays was installed to prevent unauthorized interstate transmissions Only one big utility didnt like the setup Central South West Corp a Dallas holding company that owned power plants in both Texas and Oklahoma In it faced a crisis If it couldnt show that its plants in both states were interconnected it ran the risk of being broken up under a federal law The law which barred holding companies from owning unconnected utilities in separate states was decades old But until then it hadnt been strictly enforced On May eight days before the Securities and Exchange Commission was set to consider the matter Central South West took an extraordinary step At am it sent one of its line crews to secretly rewire a substation in Vernon Texas near the Oklahoma border allowing power to flow freely between the two states For a few hours the grids were connected by a minuscule thread Later that morning officials at Central South West phoned other Texas utilities to tell them the company was engaged in interstate commerce Texas other major utilities reacted angrily The sons of bitches are trying to steal my lignite Texas Utilities Chairman Louis Austin bellowed according to former Texas Public Utility Commissioner George Cowden who recalls Mr Austin making the remark during a private meeting between the two men Around noon Houston Lighting cut its system off from the rest of the states utilities Texas Utilities followed suit hours later By days end the states utilities had broken the grid into a halfdozen pieces That same day one of Texas Utilities chief lawyers a foot former collegefootball star named JA Tiny Gooch dispatched one of his companys crews to disconnect the link Central South West had made between Vernon and Altus Okla They made it so it was physically impossible to connect it again says Mr Goochs son Gordon then a lawyer representing Houston Lighting The elder Mr Gooch who died in is considered the patron saint of Texas electrical independence At an emergency meeting of the utility commission three days later Mr Austin of Texas Utilities expressed disgust at the prospect of having to burn Texas lignite and natural gas to satisfy Yankees according to a transcript And he added I dont like federal regulations Mr Austin died in A wire reputed to have formed part of Central South Wests brief TexasOklahoma interconnection later was cut into pieces encased in Lucite and given out as paperweights by Dallas law firm Worsham Forsythe Woolridge which represented Texas Utilities Alan Erwin a state utility commissioner in who still has the souvenir on his desk used the wiring episode as fodder for a novel The Power Exchange in which a winter storm cripples Northeast power production and the nation turns to Texas for electricity Texas refuses to ship the electricity fearful that other regions would drain it of what little cheap fuel was left Ultimately Texas becomes a scapegoat and ends up seceding from the union In reality the outcome was less dramatic The grid conflict wound its way through many courtrooms Central South West recently acquired by American Electric Power Co of Columbus Ohio lost almost every round After about four years the utilities hashed out a compromise at the urging of the federal government Rather than link the Texas grid to the East so that electricity could flow freely across state borders through alternatingcurrent cables they agreed to build two directcurrent lines Operators could control the flow over these bridges which at peak capacity could carry a mere megawatts The parties to the deal which included the federal government agreed these links wouldnt bring the Texas grid under federal jurisdiction Today Texas power continues to be regulated in Austin not Washington Its just a Texas thing says Pat Wood III chairman of the state utility commission and a recent Bush administration nominee to FERC We want control of our own destiny That independent attitude has extended in recent years to Texas businessfriendly approach to deregulating its power industry Unlike California with its stringent emissions and zoning rules Texas has made it quick and easy for power companies to locate their plants almost anywhere they can find a place to hook up to the grid Last year Texas completed a major upgrade to alleviate bottlenecks on the grid and it has six similar projects under way Unlike most other states it decided to charge grid users a flat rate to move power anywhere in the state so they could put plants in lowcost rural areas far from their customers Those policies as well as projections that the states electricity demand would grow by a robust a year set off a flurry of powerplant construction beginning in Since then billion worth of power plants have been completed or started in Texas and more are on the drawing board By contrast to Californias approach to deregulation which largely failed to bring new plants online Texas strategy encouraged an overbuild says Mr Makovich of Cambridge Energy Research Associates Consider tiny Seguin in south central Texas where Constellation Energy Group Inc of Baltimore is building an megawatt gaspowered plant in a former cornfield Fifteen miles to the west Texas Independent Energy LP of Dallas recently finished a megawatt plant About the same distance to the north American National Power a Houstonbased unit of Britains International Power PLC is building a megawatt plant If generators dont get cold feet Texas is on track to have a capacity surplus of this summer and by summer says Cambridge Energy Research Associates Thats in addition to the surplus that most experts consider an adequate cushion Some areas of the country including parts of the Southeast Upper Midwest New York City and the West are struggling with razorthin capacity margins After factoring in a similar cushion the West has an capacity deficit and the Upper Midwest has a deficit As a result while electricity futures prices for summer are running at as much as per megawatt hour in the Northwest and around in the Northeast Texas futures prices are averaging only to per megawatt hour Calpine Corp of San Jose Calif is making the boldest wager that overcapacity and a lack of export possibilities wont sink Texas wholesale electricity prices The company has six plants under construction in the state two of which are expected to come on line next month And it plans to add an additional five plants over the next two years Altogether Calpine plans to spend about billion in the state its largest investment outside California People from day one probably thought Calpine was crazy says Darrell Hayslip a company vice president But so far we are absolutely convinced that this is the right bet He says Calpines newer gasfired plants are more efficient than older plants in the state a third of which are at least years old Calpine expects that edge to force rivals to retire older plants thus keeping electricity prices from sagging Others arent so sure After initially planning new plants in Texas Duke Energy Corp began to worry that the state was getting overbuilt Last May Duke of Charlotte NC sold its stake in a plant under construction in south Texas to Calpine We sized up the market early and then realized too many followers were doing the same thing says Jim Donnell president and CEO of Duke Energy North America If the electricity situation outside Texas grows too grim and too much supply sinks prices in the state there could be renewed pressure for Texas to study interconnection options says John Stauffacher vice president for regulatory affairs at Houstonbased Dynegy Inc which has megawatts of capacity in Texas Calpine for one wouldnt mind sharing Texas power with the East and West I would love to be able to wheel power from Texas to California says Mr Hayslip But so far the Texas utilities havent budged in their opposition to exports A few generators are trying to find the best of both worlds Tenaska Inc of Omaha Neb is building plants at the border between the Texas and eastern grids Though utilities arent allowed to be connected to both grids at once the plants are designed to allow the company to switch between grids as demand and prices warrant In rural Grimes County about miles outside Houston Tenaska plant manager Frank Carelli boasts that his megawatt plant could disconnect from one grid connect to the other and be back at full power within an hour A similar Tenaska plant is slated to begin operations this month in Rusk County near the Louisiana border WSJviaNewsEDGE PAGE A TICKER CEG CPN DUK IPR REI TXU
