Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesJeff Skilling will be spending the next few years working with charities in Houston and spending time with family the former chief executive of Enron Corp ENE said in an interview The yearold Skilling who resigned abruptly from Enron after the companys board meeting Aug repeatedly said he had left as stated for personal reasons Wall Street has been skeptical of the explanation and several analysts have said theyre waiting for the other shoe to drop The companys stock price fell in response to the announcement last week a loss of about billion in shareholder value and hasnt recovered this week But the former chief executive said the stock price will recover once investors see that his departure isnt a precursor to more bad news for the company Ive spent the last years working really hard said Skilling who requested the interview with Dow Jones Newswires There are a lot of things that I havent been doing personal interests spending time with family There are a number of charitable things that I havent spent the time on that I believe I should I dont mean fundraising but hands on getting out and doing things building houses helping individuals Skilling who has been involved with a multiple sclerosis charity for years said he plans to get involved in promoting the City of Houston Its massively underrated as a place to work and live he said Its a great city and I think I can do a lot to get that across Though insistent that there is nothing more to his departure than personal reasons Skilling said little to reveal why a talented executive would surrender the top spot of the countrys largest energy trading company just six months after taking the job Skilling had been Enrons No executive from until this year and hes generally credited with the success of Enrons wholesale trading operations which comprise about of the parents earnings He confirmed theres no crisis in his family and his health is fine Skilling who assumed the chief executive title on Feb also denied that he was suffering under the strain of the job Late last week Chairman Kenneth Lay and other Enron executives in New York told Wall Street analysts that Skilling had been going kind of nuts under the pressure of being chief executive one analyst said Its not true that I was cracking up he said Do I sound like someone who is cracking up The representation of me as thickskinned is a reasonable representation When asked if his departure could have been handled more smoothly so as not to alarm investors Skilling said that perhaps the mechanics could have been better but said that is hindsight We thought it through and thought we were going about it in the right way he said I dont know what we could have done differently It will turn out in retrospect fine as soon as people see that theres nothing else About One Weeks Notice The former chief executive totally disagreed with speculation in this column last week that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay who immediately resumed the role of chief executive may have wanted to regain daytoday control of the company and pushed Skilling out I think the world of Ken You cant find a bigger fan of his than me he said I was not forced out Personal and family reasons are of the story I guess its kind of mundane and Im sorry it doesnt have as much drama and suspense as a lot of people would like it to have but thats what the deal is Skilling said he spoke with Lay about wanting to do other things many times over the years The first serious discussion of his imminent departure came about a week before the announcement said Skilling whose recollection of his giving notice to Lay was somewhat cloudy The board knew what was going on and that was the point the Aug board meeting where the decisions were going to be made he said The decisions I guess to accept my resignation Skilling said Enron refused to release a copy of the minutes of the Aug board meeting which was regularly scheduled The company doesnt generally release boardmeeting minutes spokeswoman Karen Denne said The former chief executive continues to work as a paid adviser to Enron A clause in his contract prevents him from competing with the company through the end of and he has no plans to work outside the energy industry That might sound like a big comedown from running the countrys most aggressive energy company but Skilling said the move fits Some people say Well you were working and aspiring so long to become CEO of Enron Thats not true I was working to build a business and we did said Skilling who is credited with transforming the company into a trading powerhouse The company I built is doing great My life is moving on He also said the company will do fine without him Some analysts have expressed concern about Enrons ability to retain its top talent Skillings predecessor as Enrons No executive Richard Kinder for example left the company in after Lay announced that he would be retaining the chief executive spot for another five years Kinder went on to buy Enrons small liquids pipeline business and turned that company into KinderMorgan Inc KMI Enrons current management Skilling said has a very deep bench For example he described Enron Energy Services Chief Executive Dave Delaney as awesome Dave created the Canadian business in Enron Skilling said By Mark
