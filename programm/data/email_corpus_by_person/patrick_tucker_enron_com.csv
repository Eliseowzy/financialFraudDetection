<26679872.1075862397883.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,patrick.tucker@enron.com,2001-11-14 09:44:01,Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call Here are my notes from todays call As with Monday Ive focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to reorganize them by subject Enrons business has been grouped into three buckets Core Noncore and Under Review Core Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe retail energy pipelines Noncore Broadband water and international assets ie EGAS Enron has approx Bn in investments in these assets and they have produced dismal returns Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets Under Review EGM EIM These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of longterm viability Required resource levels are being carefully studied Following review Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or noncore as the analysis dictates Approximately MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter These include a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica and our Indian EP assets Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of MMBn Given the current environment raising equity in the public markets would be inefficient McMahon says Shortterm liquidity is provided by the Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago the Bn of new debt and the Bn equity infusion from Dynegy Longerterm the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt McMahon described the major offbalancesheet vehicles Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets It was initially capitalized with MM of a debt and MM of equity raised from Enron and institutional investors The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix assets Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on the Enron topup obligation The date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated belowinvestmentgrade by any one of the three major agencies The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water As long as Wessex is worth at least Bn there will be no Enron topup required If we take a haircut to present book value Enron will have to provide MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt This MM would hit Enron cash income and equity balances Osprey contains energyrelated assets and other assets It was initially capitalized with Bn of a debt and MM in equity ENE and institutionals As with Marlin the entity is an assetbacked structure with an Enron topup guarantee The debt is supported by a the assets b Bn of convertible preferred ENE convertible into MM shares of ENE common and c additional ENE common as needed for topup Assuming the same hypothetical haircut to current book value Enron would have to deliver approx MM of topup fundswhich would hit ENE cash income and equity The debt must be retired by with the same cuttojunk early trigger provision as Marlin Yosemite and the CreditLinked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with large financial institutions The underlying transactions are already on Enrons balance sheet McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles McMahon says Our Q will be filed five days late The Q will include all of this detail regarding the offbalancesheet vehicles The special committee investigation is still ongoing The committee meets timesweek sometimes more often The outside auditors DT and external counsel hired by the committee are working virtually days a week Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation McMahon says its way too early to tell if any asset writedowns are called for That analysis is underway but it will not be complete for some time Osprey contains the European power projects Trakya and Saarlux some North American merchant investments and some Brazilian assets Under the merger agreement Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval However an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval Broadband is expected to be fully wound up sometime over the course of the next year Did not catch this part clearly The ENE topup obligation for Marlin represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level Current book value of the Osprey assets is Bn No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the Bn legal liability clause Yosemite and the CreditLinked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt this section somewhat unclear The underlying transactions represented volumes of crude oil and gas The transactions relate to the physical movement of these commodities The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longerterm products Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put longterm deals on hold last week Says that our first focus is on getting our shortterm business back up to normal levels It will be a couple of weeks before were able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding longterm deals with us McMahon There hasnt been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customerscredit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers But we have seen a return of some of the transactions some of the flows Whalley says that were hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure he says The cuts will certainly be deeper in our noncore businesses Whalley then quickly interjects some might say interrrupts with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business We will be looking at perhaps streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business McMahon The company is overlevered thats a facthence our pursuit of additional equity McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week ENE had approx Bn in cash as of which McMahon points out would be unusual for us As before give me a call at if youd like more color

minutes Bergstrom for and Whalley spoke for perhaps seconds Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right

new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true Dynegy owed Enron MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its day facility believe this is the Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next weeks BBBflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT sure that no surprises remain in Enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have materialadversechange outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to yearend had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enronrelated earnings accretion at which represents a haircut to Enron internal estimates Doty says that this is all operating earningsfigure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively shortterm in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENEthere will be more of an assetbacked trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial marketmaking trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player He does not want to see an individual

other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to

CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the

They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENEthere will be more of an assetbacked trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial marketmaking trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well Give me a call if youd like me to try to clarify any of these comments Patrick Tucker x

with this Would like to give the customer an update tomorrow Thanks Patrick Tucker Original Message From Tucker Patrick Sent Friday November AM To Perlingiere Debra Subject FW ENFOLIO Master Firm PurchaseSale Agreement with Northern States Power Company Debra Jeff said that you would be the proper person to review NSPs comments Please let me know what else I need to be doing to help the process continue Thanks Patrick Tucker x Original Message From Bransgrove Alan mailto Sent Friday November AM To Tucker Patrick Cc Carter Tim Ishee Jeff Subject ENFOLIO Master Firm PurchaseSale Agreement with Northern States Power Company Patrick At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the abovereferenced Agreement for Northern States Power Company NSP I apologize for the delay Our comments are as follows Northern States Power Company Agreement Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues We request in Section that the dollar level be applicable to each of our companies We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section be increased to as to each of our companies Confirmations In the second line please change may to shall We need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for regulatory purposes We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed and returned in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section Transactions Netting and Offset We cannot agree to the netting of payments in the normal course of business under these contracts Amounts due to and from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize when NSP acts as the Seller to Enron in a Transaction Accordingly we propose that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the Agreement Early Termination I am concerned that the date to be established for termination of Transactions is without definition I would prefer to see the language in subpart i modified to state that the Notifying Party may establish a date which shall be not less than two nor more than ten Business Days following the date of such notice Triggering Event In the th line down I dont understand the inclusion of the phrase or deemed to be repeated Unless I am missing something it doesnt make sense with the rest of the sentence Please delete this phrase in the Agreement and References to Affiliates In numerous places throughout the Agreements and in particular in Sections and reference is made to Affiliates For regulatory reasons we cannot intermingle the account status of our affiliated companies Moreover NSP is not authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated Please delete all references to Affiliates of NSP in the respective Agreement Article Force Majeure The language in this Article is not typical of most Force Majeure provisions which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period The language in your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time only for a duration of up to Days after which time Force Majeure no longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement In other words Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence involving a separate and independent Transaction This is not acceptable We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments Section Notices Prior to the language in the parenthetical please insert provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically Section Transfer We would prefer that this language be revised to the more traditional language requiring the consent rather than approval of the other Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld Please modify this provision accordingly Section Limitation of Remedies We are in general agreement with this provision however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use The gas sold and purchased under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the ordinary use to which it is intended Please modify this Section accordingly Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions The GISB Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a day confirm deadline rather than hours as reflected in your definition We request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry standard Definition of Material Adverse Change This definition needs to be expanded beyond a review of the level of each companys credit rating Please replace your definition with the following Material Adverse Change with respect to a Party means i any downgrading of any unsecured longterm senior debt of such Party or any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit support for the obligations of such Party each such entity being a Credit Support Provider for such Party such that such debt is rated below BBB or its equivalent by Standard Poors or below Baa or its equivalent by Moodys Investor Services Inc provided that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have any unsecured longterm senior debt that is rate by either Standard Poors or Moodys Investor Services Inc then a Material Adverse Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more events which in the reasonable judgment of the exposed Party constitutes a material adverse effect on the creditworthiness financial responsibility or ability of such Party or its Credit Support Provider as applicable to perform its obligations in connection herewith Definition of Replacement Price Differential Although we are in general agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential it seems preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable cost of cover should be the difference between the contract price and a or day average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred Please modify your definition accordingly Please make changes to the Northern States Power Company Agreement consistent with our comments as set forth above Should you have questions or wish to discuss any of our requested changes you may contact me via return email or at the phone number listed below Thank you for your consideration I look forward to working with you to finalize this Agreement

Here are my notes Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements Watson spoke for c minutes Bergstrom for and Whalley spoke for perhaps seconds Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold MM shares out of a total MM shares of the postmerger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true Dynegy owed Enron MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its day facility believe this is the Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next weeks BBBflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT sure that no surprises remain in Enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have materialadversechange outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to yearend had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enronrelated earnings accretion at which represents a haircut to Enron internal estimates Doty says that this is all operating earningsfigure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively shortterm in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very

energy business in North America and Europe retail energy pipelines Noncore Broadband water and international assets ie EGAS Enron has approx Bn in investments in these assets and they have produced dismal returns Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets Under Review EGM EIM These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of longterm viability Required resource levels are being carefully studied Following review Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or noncore as the analysis dictates Approximately MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter These include a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica and our Indian EP assets Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of MMBn Given the current environment raising equity in the public markets would be inefficient McMahon says Shortterm liquidity is provided by the Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago the Bn of new debt and the Bn equity infusion from Dynegy Longerterm the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt McMahon described the major offbalancesheet vehicles Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets It was initially capitalized with MM of a debt and MM of equity raised from Enron and institutional investors The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix assets Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on the Enron topup obligation The date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated belowinvestmentgrade by any one of the three major agencies The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water As long as Wessex is worth at least Bn there will be no Enron topup required If we take a haircut to present book value Enron will have to provide MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt This MM would hit Enron cash income and equity balances Osprey contains energyrelated assets and other assets It was initially capitalized with Bn of a debt

convertible into MM shares of ENE common and c additional ENE common as needed for topup Assuming the same hypothetical haircut to current book value Enron would have to deliver approx MM of topup fundswhich would hit ENE cash income and equity The debt must be retired by with the same cuttojunk early trigger provision as Marlin Yosemite and the CreditLinked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with large financial institutions The underlying transactions are already on Enrons balance sheet McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles McMahon says Our Q will be filed five days late The Q will include all of this detail regarding the offbalancesheet vehicles The special committee investigation is still ongoing The committee meets timesweek sometimes more often The outside auditors DT and external counsel hired by the committee are working virtually days a week Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation McMahon says its way too early to tell if any asset writedowns are called for That analysis is underway but it will not be complete for some time Osprey contains the European power projects Trakya and Saarlux some North American merchant investments and some Brazilian assets Under the merger agreement Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval However an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval Broadband is expected to be fully wound up sometime over the course of the next year Did not catch this part clearly The ENE topup obligation for Marlin represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level Current book value of the Osprey assets is Bn No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the Bn legal liability clause Yosemite and the CreditLinked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt this section somewhat unclear The underlying transactions represented volumes of crude oil and gas The transactions relate to the physical movement of these commodities The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longerterm products Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put longterm deals on hold last week Says that our first focus is on getting our shortterm business back up to normal levels It will be a couple of weeks before were able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding longterm deals with us McMahon There hasnt been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customerscredit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers But we have seen a return of some of the transactions some of the flows Whalley says that were hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure he says The cuts will certainly be deeper in our noncore businesses Whalley then quickly interjects some might say interrrupts with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business We will be looking at perhaps streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business McMahon The company is overlevered thats a facthence our pursuit of additional equity McMahon mentions that business was

other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with

are my notes Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements Watson spoke for c minutes Bergstrom for and Whalley spoke for perhaps seconds Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold MM shares out of a total MM shares of the postmerger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true Dynegy owed Enron MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its day facility believe this is the Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next weeks BBBflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT sure that no surprises remain in Enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have materialadversechange outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity
