voting on a project that will reduce the Amazon forest to of its size It will take min to read please put your names on the list and forward this on YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT GREENPEACE IS TODAY BOYCOTTING HARDWOOD FROM THE REGION The area to be deforested is times the size of Portugal and would be mainly used for agriculture and pastures for livestock All the wood is to be sold to international markets in the form of wood chips by multinational companies The truth is that the soil in the Amazon forest is useless without the forest itself Its quality is very acidic and the region is prone to constant floods At this time more than square kilometers deforested with the same purpose are abandoned and in the process of becoming deserts Deforestation and the subsequent processing of the woodchips on this scale will also release a huge amount of carbon which is currently locked up in the wood back into the atmosphere worsening the problem of climate change We cannot let this happen Copy the text into a new email put your complete name in the list below and send to everyone you know Dont just forward it as it will end up with rows of s If you are the th person to

<29090701.1075841683892.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,annas@cobs.edu,2001-03-26 01:43:00,REnsf See I knew it You always assume the worst when really the reasoning was kind of flattering he thinks so highly of you that he doesnt want you to see him upset I think thats a valid excuse Im totally the same way The other night I bagged on Nathans dinner party which I really wanted to go to because I was afraid I would start slurring my speech before my first cocktail You know what thats like to be working so hard that you dont feel like yourself Anyway Im glad it all worked out Michelle and I went out with Monica John Amber Marky and Johns brother Mark on Saturday night It was so insane First of all I was already exhausted and therefore drunk before we even left the first bar regardless of my am shift at Starbucks the next morning Then when we went to Nathans bar Amber and Marky SKIPPED ahead knocking the odd garbage can over along the way So they got to the bar before me and they found Nathan because Monica told them he looked just like Chandler Bing and Amber was like Are you Annas boyfriend Thanks He was really cool about it though even though I think it caught him off guard I had to explain to him that I NEVER used the word boyfriend but he said he was flattered so it was cool We were such an odd group Amber and Marky were dancing with no equilibrium Monicas boyfriend and brother sat in the corner and remained mute Michelle was telling Monica how she should really meet her bipolar cousin I was sure after that night that I would never see Nathan again but yesterday he took me to THE CUTEST little french restaurant and we had wine and two courses and dessert It was so great And some of his friends came and had a cocktail with us afterwards and he had his arm around me the whole time He is SO GREAT I dont know how accurate of a description I am giving you but I have never been so happy with a boy before He is funny and cute and he loves wine and food Anyway thats my deal Oh and Dad and Laura are not going to be here until tomorrow but he called from the Grand Canyon Im so jealous and said my car is a beautiful champagne colored Corolla Im a little worried but he said its like new so Im sure itll be great I think that on your next payday you should put a bid on pricelinecom for a ticket here We would have so much fun Or you could even go through moms travel agent and buy your ticket really far in advance she said it was only about if you do it that way Of course the later you come the sunnier it will be Anyway I REALLY want you to visit And Monica does too Okay keep me updated on the Dave situation he sounds like boyfriend material You should call me soon in case you lost it Love Anna Original Message From mailto Sent Friday March PM To Subject RE Anna Youre stoked on the song thing Youll never guess how cool mine is though Its Dont go breakin my heart by Elton John and Kiki Dee Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to watch all the time I LOVE that song Anyway I had already started a reply to your previous email so Ill just send it along with this one I love you madly and dearly Youre the only one whos managed to say anything of worth about this whole incidence Amber and Molly stared at me blankly and said something like Dont be so overly dramatic and then rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to hang out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend and blah blah blah It was really disappointing that they didnt understand the importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men It was so not fun But I was really proud of myself because I left work fuming on the verge of tears and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with Amber and Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before Then Molly and I took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food brought it home and watched the Thursday night lineup All in all it was a very successful evening WITHOUT runner man whose name by the way is Dave Take one point off for that And guess what He ended up calling at about Molly was on the other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a message so awhile later when I got a call from Jill Daves friends girlfriend who Im also friends with this all gets very complicated I was very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with us I just assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave and made up some sweet excuse about how I had just eaten and was too full to move because I was like no way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up NO WAY So that was thator so I thought At about pm runner man himself calls and basically admits that hes psycho for cancelling our date and then calling me all night long Ya think Anyway he tells me he was in this enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride and didnt want me to see him in such a bad state I still thought it was a lame excuse and that once youd reached the ripe age of you should be smart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone So I told him that and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and my roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn which he had started the other night when he was over to make it up to me I told him if he did that he might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is where he is now thats finance lingo Anyway the plan is hes going to come over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like people who we somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight although I dont remember doing that Anna you have to stay with me one night when youre home in June because its a constant riot I wont go into some of the things Amber did the other night right now but Ill tell you soon so you can swap stories when you see her By the way she snagged an armload of my clothes actually most of which were yours to wear at fancy dinners in Denver so if you see anything you want back just let her know I think its just that red Laundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt Hey guess what I have to go Ill call you tonight Take care kate Anna Symes on AM To cc Subject RE That sucks Kate I bet that isnt the last well be seeing of Mr Running Man though First of all who gets scared off by drunk roommates If anything it should be a relief to him that he doesnt need to impress any of your clan Second it sounds like the classic insecure blowoff to me If you think back youll probably remember a couple of instances in which your demeanorcommentsfacial expression may have sent him the message that he is the stupidest thing on Gods green earth I know this because I have the same habit So he probably went home mulled over those few devastating instances and came to the conclusion that youre not that into it And being a man only men and Symess do this he cancelled on you before you had the chance to crush his ego once again Am I right I think so Tentatively planning on going out with Amber and Monica on Saturday night Im mad that Im hanging out with your roommate before I get to hang out with you Monica and I are thinking of splitting your ticket since we know youll never save the money like I should talk You have to come out here though Its about degrees right now and its in the morning on a day in March I cant believe how happy this sun makes me You would love it too Okay feel better and dont sweat the stupid running guy If he thinks hes not worthy of you chances are hes not A stiff margarita will make this whole problem a lot more manageable dont you think You should go have one Love you Luego Anna Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday March PM To Subject Re Well to tell you the truth it sucks right now Work has been snowballing with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems so many that Ive basically forgotten what they all are now And on top of that runner guy stopped by last night and it happened to be the last day of Ambers finals so she and Molly had been drinking since pm Well Im not quite sure if that scared him away but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight he asked me I accepted we had a time picked out now I NEVER make plans as a rule but this was a goddamn plan So he calls minutes ago and actually CANCELS Not even just that he doesnt give a REASON I am so livid right now theres smoke coming out of my ears I need to go finish work so I can get out of here and go bomb his car Ill call you tonight Kate Anna Symes on PM To Kate Symes Email cc Subject hey poopstain Whats up I am sooooo good Dad and my car will be here on Monday isnt that great I just want to drive for the rest of my life So I get three days off next week plus Im leaving for my outward bound course next friday So basically I have like a week vacation Things are still going with the cute waiter Nathan but Ive discovered a flaw It was only a matter of time you know Actually its a nonfatal flaw its annoying at worst Basically he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and talks on it in all types of situations such as the video store a taxi cab and while eating dinner with his friends I just cant stand those things Its one thing to chat on it when youre walking down the street by yourself or in your car by yourself but when youre with other people or in the checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you I just think its so rude But Im going to try to get over it because otherwise hes great and I seem to be the only person on Gods green earth who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze So thats my life whats going on in yours love anna

BOYCOTTING HARDWOOD FROM THE REGION The area to be deforested is times the size of Portugal and would be mainly used for agriculture and pastures for livestock All the wood is to be sold to international markets in the form of wood chips by multinational companies The truth is that the soil in the Amazon forest is useless without the forest itself Its quality is very acidic and the region is prone to constant floods At this time more than square kilometers deforested with the same purpose are abandoned and in the process of becoming deserts Deforestation and the subsequent processing of the woodchips on this scale will also release a huge amount of carbon which is currently locked up in the wood back into the atmosphere worsening the problem of climate change We cannot let this happen Copy the text into a new email put your complete name in the list below and send to everyone you know Dont just forward it as it will end up with rows of s If you are the th person to

you that he doesnt want you to see him upset I think thats a valid excuse Im totally the same way The other night I bagged on Nathans dinner party which I really wanted to go to because I was afraid I would start slurring my speech before my first cocktail You know what thats like to be working so hard that you dont feel like yourself Anyway Im glad it all worked out Michelle and I went out with Monica John Amber Marky and Johns brother Mark on Saturday night It was so insane First of all I was already exhausted and therefore drunk before we even left the first bar regardless of my am shift at Starbucks the next morning Then when we went to Nathans bar Amber and Marky SKIPPED ahead knocking the odd garbage can over along the way So they got to the bar before me and they found Nathan because Monica told them he looked just like Chandler Bing and Amber was like Are you Annas boyfriend Thanks He was really cool about it though even though I think it caught him off guard I had to explain to him that I NEVER used the word boyfriend but he said he was flattered so it was cool We were such an odd group Amber and Marky were dancing with no equilibrium Monicas boyfriend and brother sat in the corner and remained mute Michelle was telling Monica how she should really meet her bipolar cousin I was sure after that night that I would never see Nathan again but yesterday he took me to THE CUTEST little french restaurant and we had wine and two courses and dessert It was so great And some of his friends came and had a cocktail with us afterwards and he had his arm around me the whole time He is SO GREAT I dont know how accurate of a description I am giving you but I have never been so happy with a boy before He is funny and cute and he loves wine and food Anyway thats my deal Oh and Dad and Laura are not going to be here until tomorrow but he called from the Grand Canyon Im so jealous and said my car is a beautiful champagne colored Corolla Im a little worried but he said its like new so Im sure itll be great I think that on your next payday you should put a bid on pricelinecom for a ticket here We would have so much fun Or you could even go through moms travel agent and buy your ticket really far in advance she said it was only about if you do it that way Of course the later you come the sunnier it will be Anyway I REALLY want you to visit And Monica does too Okay keep me updated on the Dave situation he sounds like boyfriend material You should call me soon in case you lost it Love Anna Original Message From mailto Sent Friday March PM To Subject RE Anna Youre stoked on the song thing Youll never guess how cool mine is though Its Dont go breakin my heart by Elton John and Kiki Dee Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to watch all the time I LOVE that song Anyway I had already started a reply to your previous email so Ill just send it along with this one I love you madly and dearly Youre the only one whos managed to say anything of worth about this whole incidence Amber and Molly stared at me blankly and said something like Dont be so overly dramatic and then rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to hang out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend and blah blah blah It was really disappointing that they didnt understand the importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men It was so not fun But I was really proud of myself because I left work fuming on the verge of tears and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with Amber and Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before Then Molly and I took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food brought it home and watched the Thursday night lineup All in all it was a very successful evening WITHOUT runner man whose name by the way is Dave Take one point off for that And guess what He ended up calling at about Molly was on the other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a message so awhile later when I got a call from Jill Daves friends girlfriend who Im also friends with this all gets very complicated I was very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with us I just assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave and made up some sweet excuse about how I had just eaten and was too full to move because I was like no way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up NO WAY So that was thator so I thought At about pm runner man himself calls and basically admits that hes psycho for cancelling our date and then calling me all night long Ya think Anyway he tells me he was in this enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride and didnt want me to see him in such a bad state I still thought it was a lame excuse and that once youd reached the ripe age of you should be smart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone So I told him that and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and my roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn which he had started the other night when he was over to make it up to me I told him if he did that he might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is where he is now thats finance lingo Anyway the plan is hes going to come over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like people who we somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight although I dont remember doing that Anna you have to stay with me one night when youre home in June because its a constant riot I wont go into some of the things Amber did the other night right now but Ill tell you soon so you can swap stories when you see her By the way she snagged an armload of my clothes actually most of which were yours to wear at fancy dinners in Denver so if you see anything you want back just let her know I think its just that red Laundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt Hey guess what I have to go Ill call you tonight Take care kate Anna Symes on AM To cc Subject RE That sucks Kate I bet that isnt the last well be seeing of Mr Running Man though First of all who gets scared off by drunk roommates If anything it should be a relief to him that he doesnt need to impress any of your clan Second it sounds like the classic insecure blowoff to me If you think back youll probably remember a couple of instances in which your demeanorcommentsfacial expression may have sent him the message that he is the stupidest thing on Gods green earth I know this because I have the same habit So he probably went home mulled over those few devastating instances and came to the conclusion that youre not that into it And being a man only men and Symess do this he cancelled on you before you had the chance to crush his ego once again Am I right I think so Tentatively planning on going out with Amber and Monica on Saturday night Im mad that Im hanging out with your roommate before I get to hang out with you Monica and I are thinking of splitting your ticket since we know youll never save the money like I should talk You have to come out here though Its about degrees right now and its in the morning on a day in March I cant believe how happy this sun makes me You would love it too Okay feel better and dont sweat the stupid running guy If he thinks hes not worthy of you chances are hes not A stiff margarita will make this whole problem a lot more manageable dont you think You should go have one Love you Luego Anna Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday March PM To Subject Re Well to tell you the truth it sucks right now Work has been snowballing with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems so many that Ive basically forgotten what they all are

but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight he asked me I accepted we had a time picked out now I NEVER make plans as a rule but this was a goddamn plan So he calls minutes ago and actually CANCELS Not even just that he doesnt give a REASON I am so livid right now theres smoke coming out of my ears I need to go finish work so I can get out of here and go bomb his car Ill call you tonight Kate Anna Symes on PM To Kate Symes Email cc Subject hey poopstain Whats up I am sooooo good Dad and my car will be here on Monday isnt that great I just want to drive for the rest of my life So I get three days off next week plus Im leaving for my outward bound course next friday So basically I have like a week vacation Things are still going with the cute waiter Nathan but Ive discovered a flaw It was only a matter of time you know Actually its a nonfatal flaw its annoying at worst Basically he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and talks on it in all types of situations such as the video store a taxi cab and while eating dinner with his friends I just cant stand those things Its one thing to chat on it when youre walking down the street by yourself or in your car by yourself but when youre with other people or in the checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you I just think its so rude But Im going to try to get over it because otherwise hes great and I seem to be the only person on Gods green earth who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze So thats my life whats going on in yours love anna

voting on a project that will reduce the Amazon forest to of its size It will take min to read please put your names on the list and forward this on YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT GREENPEACE IS TODAY BOYCOTTING HARDWOOD FROM THE REGION The area to be deforested is times the size of Portugal and would be mainly used for agriculture and pastures for livestock All the wood is to be sold to international markets in the form of wood chips by multinational companies The truth is that the soil in the Amazon forest is useless without the forest itself Its quality is very acidic and the region is prone to constant floods At this time more than square kilometers deforested with the same purpose are abandoned and in the process of becoming deserts Deforestation and the subsequent processing of the woodchips on this scale will also release a huge amount of carbon which is currently locked up in the wood back into the atmosphere worsening the problem of climate change We cannot let this happen Copy the text into a new email put your complete name in the list below and send to everyone you know Dont just forward it as it will end up with rows of s If you are the th person to
