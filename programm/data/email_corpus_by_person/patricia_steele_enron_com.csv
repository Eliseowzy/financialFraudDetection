<5874506.1075861860585.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,patricia.steele@enron.com,2001-11-14 14:00:24,RE Ctrc Continental CMS Cc I took the ROFR flag off Since it is expired I cant really figure out how it affects CAS Im confused But I will also look in the file Original Message From Donoho Lindy Sent Wednesday November PM To Steele Patricia Cc Frazier Perry Subject Ctrc Continental CMS Perry had asked me whether this contract had ROFR or not because he thinks it should be terminated but CAS is still reserving capacity for the contract because it has a ROFR flag on it in CBS I think that this contract does not have ROFR but could you confirm this for me If my memory is correct I thought that this agreement was always done just a month or two at a time and that at the end of each term it was negotiated with the price desk more recently TK to roll for another month or so If Im thinking of the right contract that would mean that it did not have a ROFR because it was not for a year or longer and that it terminated Could you check the contract file for me and look at the amendment history to confirm that the agreement did not have a year or longer term If not then this agreement should not have the ROFR contract on it Let me know Thanks
