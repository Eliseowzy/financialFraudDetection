<7335609.1075856237863.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,alex.huang@enron.com,2001-01-05 02:41:00,Re The consultants model for Gary Hickersons group Cc is supposed to be a real option model to capture the value of power plants of Gencos It is to give trader a better insight as to whether the market is overvaluingundervaluing certain Genco stocks and trader can act accordingly Im still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use it Modeling details The model takes in all Gencos locational power forward prices and fuel forward prices and uses GARCH model to simulate one year daily prices and then uses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices GARCH model parameters are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and are updated twice a year and it does not matter whether the simulation starts in January or September Using these prices it will determine whether a unit at a particular location will be dispatched or not depending on A spread of power and fuel prices and B whether the startup cost can be recovered during operation hours The unit can be dispatched at minimum and peak levels Fixed OM SOX and NOX I dont know what the last two stand for are taken into consideration With the simulated dispatch schedule the model calculates the value that can be generated by this unit then sums it up across all units The final value is the average of simulations And it takes about hours to run for about units After our conversation the consultant promised to look into A how to make the model more flexible say to allow a different time horizon B reduce spreadsheet overhead by doing calculation one unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information as of now it saves everything on the spreadsheet Assuming the GARCH process is modelled correctly I believe the methodology is OK though it does not capture most of the optionality My concerns are Whether the price processes are modelled correctly I have to get more details before making any conclusion simulations are way too few Unless we convert the algorithm to C I dont see how spreadsheet can handle more simulations I guess thats why they contact us But again if Enrons buying the model from the consulting company why should Enron do their job for them How traders going to use the model output For this I phoned Jeff the associate who initiated all these and am still waiting for his returning call A related questions why the model horizon is one year We can either Oversee the conversation but not doing actual coding for them Or Redo the model for them The problem still remains that how traders going to use the output But in view of the Great Wall of China separating the business units should we do it As of now I have a simulation model taking startup cost fixed OM rumpup delay into consideration It simulates monthly prices using GBM and takes minutes seconds to run simulations for one unit for ten years time steps It can use forwardforward vol and incorporate seasonality into it I understand this is debatable One interesting observation is that when using forwardforward vol simulation the standard deviation is about while standard deviation using forward vol is about Also incorporating seasonality increases the value by about Since most of the timecost occurs in price simulation and we are to simulate about price processes I hope the full model if we build it will take a couple of hours to run for units The main task will be interfacing ie getting data from data base and outputting the results This is where I need most help if I am to do it Please advice the course of action I am supposed to talk to Michelle Cisneros today ps I never promised to oversee a programmer in our group see the message below Best Alex Forwarded by Alex HuangCorpEnron on AM Jeff M Gray To cc Subject FW Project timeline Ken and I worked up the following timeline and refined the trading methodology a bit this morning We also met with Alex Huang from Vinces group and explained the model and coding tasks Ken and Alex have arranged to speak by phone on Monday and meanwhile Alex is coordinating within the research group Alex will oversee a programmer within his group

a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices GARCH model parameters are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and are updated twice a year and it does not matter whether the simulation starts in January or September Using these prices it will determine whether a unit at a particular location will be dispatched or not depending on A spread of power and fuel prices and B whether the startup cost can be recovered during operation hours The unit can be dispatched at minimum and peak levels Fixed OM SOX and NOX I dont know what the last two stand for are taken into consideration With the simulated dispatch schedule the model calculates the value that can be generated by this unit then sums it up across all units The final value is the average of simulations And it takes about hours to run for about units After our conversation the consultant promised to look into A how to make the model more flexible say to allow a different time horizon B reduce spreadsheet overhead by doing calculation one unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information as of now it saves everything on the spreadsheet Assuming the GARCH process is modelled correctly I believe the methodology is OK though it does not capture most of the optionality My concerns are Whether the price processes are modelled correctly I have to get more details before making any conclusion simulations are way too few Unless we convert the algorithm to C I dont see how spreadsheet can handle more simulations I guess thats why they contact us But again if Enrons buying the model from the consulting company why should Enron do their job for them How traders going to use the model output For this I phoned Jeff the associate who initiated all these and am still waiting for his returning call A related questions why the model horizon is one year We can either Oversee the conversation but not doing actual coding for them Or Redo the model for them The problem still remains that how traders going to use the output But in view of the Great Wall of China separating the business units should we do it As of now I have a simulation model taking startup cost fixed OM rumpup delay into consideration It simulates monthly prices using GBM and takes minutes seconds to run simulations for one unit for ten years time steps It can use forwardforward vol and incorporate seasonality into it I understand this is debatable One interesting observation is that when using forwardforward vol simulation the standard deviation is about while standard deviation using forward vol is about Also incorporating seasonality increases the value by about Since most of the timecost occurs in price simulation and we are to simulate about price processes I hope the full model if we build it will take a couple of hours to run for units The main task will be interfacing ie getting data from data base and outputting the results This is where I need most help if I am to do it Please
