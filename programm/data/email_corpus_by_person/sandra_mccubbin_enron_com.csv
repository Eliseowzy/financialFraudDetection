relieve Californias overloaded electricity grid this summer by paying businesses to run their highpolluting backup generators in advance of anticipated blackouts a top energy adviser to the governor said Wednesday The backup generators will help us get through the summer said S David Freeman who recently resigned as general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to lead Davis drive for energy conservation Freeman said he would leave it to Davis to disclose details of the plan The governor will announce what hes going to do he said Wednesday in a wideranging interview on energy issues with The Bee Roger Salazar the governors deputy press secretary would not confirm whe n or whether Davis would make such an announcement I dont know that the governor has signed off on anything like that Salazar said Under the plan participating businesses would turn on backup generators an d simultaneously disconnect from the electricity grid when power supplies are at Stage nearly depleted The state would pay the companies for the muchneeded power that would be saved by converting to diesel generation Deploying dieselpowered generators the dirtiest of internal combustion engines to forestall blackouts is another sign of the governors struggl e to get more megawatts flowing through California Earlier this week Davis lowered his estimate of the amount of new power tha t will come on line this summer from megawatts to megawatts A megawatt is enough power for to households The diesel plan also marks a significant turnabout in the Davis administrations policy The governor and his appointees at the state Air Resources Board uniformly have rejected such proposals from industries utilities and the operator of the states electricity grid arguing that routine use of the backup diesel s would endanger public health San Diego Gas Electric has one such proposal scheduled for a vote today b y the Davisappointed state Public Utilities Commission Environmentalists who have been catching word of the Davis plan this week argue that it would shatter the governors repeated promises to stand firm on air quality standards during the energy crisis A letter signed Wednesday by several of the states leading environmental organizations including the American Lung Association of California urged Davis to reconsider Given your awareness of the public health threats of diesel emissions please stop and have these proposals considered in a more thoughtful and public manner the letter states Freeman argued however that the additional health threat from nonemergen cy use of diesel generators is marginal compared with the health and safety problems triggered by power outages This is a nobrainer Freeman said Youve got human lives at stake here This is a scary situation Freeman cited for example people on lifesupport systems that could go aw ry in blackouts But Sandra Spelliscy attorney for the environmentalist Planning and Conservation League countered If the health impacts are so marginal why has the governors own air quality enforcement agency opposed this Industries ranging from hospitals to food processing plants and data management centers have dieselpowered generators some the size of locomotives that kick on when a storm or earthquake knocks out power Unlike dieselpowered trucks and buses most diesel standby generators run with little or no pollution controls because they are intended only for emergencies Though the latest models run cleaner and more efficiently most generators in use today produce about times more emissions of smogforming nitrogen oxides per megawatthour as a new natural gasfired power plant according to air board engineers Further the diesels spew high amounts of breathable soot particles that can cause cancer the engineers say Davis plan would limit the use of the generators to days when the grid operator declares a Stage alert meaning the power supplies are running l ow and rolling blackouts may be ordered to keep the states entire grid from collapsing according to Freeman Salazar the governors spokesman said only Any backup generation involving diesel will have to be used as a last resort to prevent blackouts Environmentalists who are trying to head off the plan said it would have th e state paying participating businesses at least cents per kilowatthour roughly three times the rate consumers typically pay for electricity Freem an would not confirm the pay rate The Davis administration has offered generators willing to sell new power exclusively to the state percent discounts on the air emission credits they would need to comply with smog rules For operators of existing power plants the governor has agreed to have taxpayers pay the entire cost of polluting above allowable limits in order to keep the lights on The latest plan to pay companies to run the dirty diesels during energy alerts further loosens the environmental reins The Bees Chris Bowman can be reached at or om BushDavis meeting set for energy crisis By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau Published May WASHINGTON President Bush will meet next week with Gov Gray Davis to ta lk about Californias worsening electricity crisis amid a shifting political dynamic on Capitol Hill that increasingly favors some controls on West Coas t wholesale electricity prices Details for the BushDavis meeting were still being worked out Wednesday b ut the fact that the Republican president is meeting with the Democratic governor who is often mentioned as a possible challenger in was seen as a sign that the White House is facing increasing political heat on the energy issue California is a very big state said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer It represents onesixth of the United States Its the sixthlargest econo my in the world And the president is very pleased to sit and talk with Govern or Davis Its important Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said electricity price caps will be at th e top of the governors agenda for the meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday But Fleischer did not commit the president to that kind of meeting In his first visit to the state since the campaign last year the president will spend Monday night in Los Angeles and Tuesday night in Fresno Until now the White House has steadfastly refused to meet with any elected Democrat from California about the energy crisis despite repeated pleas fro m the Democratic congressional delegation Price controls have become the mantra of California Democratic lawmakers an d a handful of Republicans but the Bush administration has flatly dismissed them as counterproductive to increasing power generation in the megawattshort state In recent weeks however there has been a developing shift in the attitude toward price controls on Capitol Hill Bushs two nominees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission whose names were forwarded to the Senate floo r Wednesday for confirmation declined to rule out price controls once they a re seated on the panel And the apparent decision by Vermont Sen James Jeffords to abandon the Republican Party would put Democrats in control of the Senate moving Sen Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico a pricecontrol advocate to the helm of the k ey Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee California Sen Dianne Feinstein a committee Democrat said Wednesday that she has talked to Bingaman and that he committed to moving her legislation to temporarily peg wholesale prices to the cost of production Four Republican House members from California have also endorsed some form of pricecontrol legislation On Wednesday Rep Doug Ose RSacramento announced that he is introducing a bill that while not technically a price cap would give greater price reli ef for West Coast consumers than federal regulators or the Bush administration have been willing to offer Ose chairman of the House Government Reform Committees energy subcommitte e said his bill would extend throughout the West a pricemitigation plan approved last month by the FERC But instead of that plan taking effect onl y during power emergencies as the commission directed it would operate aroun d the clock under Oses bill to peg spot market prices at the cost of production of the leastefficient plant selling into the California market Ose said his bill would encourage generators to sell their power through longterm contracts rather than on the volatile spot market I am looking for a middle ground Ose said The Bees David Whitney can be reached at or Energy Digest GOP unveils plan to help utility By Jim Sanders Bee Capitol Bureau Published May State Assembly efforts to develop a bipartisan proposal to help Southern California Edison pay off massive debts and avoid bankruptcy hit a dead end Wednesday when Republicans released a plan of their own The move could force Democrats to sidestep Republicans and vote along party lines on an alternative to Gov Gray Davis proposed billion state purchase of power lines Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said Wednesdays split was necessary because there are few differences between the governors plan and the Democrats plan The Republican plan rejects the notion of purchasing transmission lines or hydroelectric facilities Key components call for dedicating a portion of consumer rates to allow Edison to pay off billion in debts In return ratepayers would receiv e either an equity stake in future power plants or the right to purchase electricity at discount rates Few escape blame for crisis in poll By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief Published May Utility companies and outofstate power generators continue to get the lowest marks for their performance in Californias energy crisis but Gov Gray Davis grades have slipped dramatically over the past five months according to a Field Poll released Wednesday And Californians it turns out blame plenty of people for the states powe r woes except themselves Every player in the power drama gets poor marks except residential energy consumers which percent of poll respondents say are doing a good or ve ry good job to improve the energy situation Only percent think they are doing a poor or very poor job Public opinion of residential consumers efforts has improved since January when percent thought they were doing a poor job and only percent gave them high marks The public sees themselves as conserving energy said Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo Thats the only positive movement in the survey For Davis who faces reelection next year the movement is far from positive In the January poll the Democratic governor received good marks from percent of those surveyed average grades from percent and poor ratings from only percent But when the Field Institute conducted its recent poll between May and Sunday opinions about Davis flipflopped After months of energy angst a handful of power blackouts and two rate increases only percent think Davis is doing a good job while percent gave him failing grades The po ll also shows that Californians believe the crisis will continue by an average of a year and a half well through the upcoming reelection battle All the rhetoric Davis used with some positive effect early on is not goin g over well any more DiCamillo said The public is starting to view this a s a longterm problem not some temporary policy shift Still Davis fares far better than his adversaries in the crisis Preside nt Bush Vice President Dick Cheney and the energy industry The publics view of energy interests which was pretty dim in January dro ps even lower in the May poll Utility companies received bad ratings from hal f the public in January but percent now believe they are doing a poor or very poor job Outofstate energy generators whom Davis has accused of gouging ratepayers fell from percent low ratings in January to perce nt in the May poll Bush the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state Public Utiliti es Commission are not far behind drawing poor grades from more than half the public Cheney the architect of Bushs energy proposal received low ratin gs from percent The January Field Poll did not ask about Bush and Cheney because they had not yet taken office Davis has repeatedly bashed FERC for not imposing wholesale price caps on electricity and has called Cheney grossly misinformed on the states energy problems Cheney in turn has called Davis energy proposals harebrained and goofy The state Legislature receives poor marks from percent of those polled while only percent believe it is doing a good job The Bees Dan Smith can be reached at or New views emerging on power More elected officials support the concept of planned blackouts By John Hill Bee Capitol Bureau Published May If Californians are to be left in the dark they should at least know when to break out the candles or send the workers home Thats the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials including Gov Gray Davis who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and giving businesses and residents ample warning On Tuesday the Democratic governors office said Davis supports longer public notice than the hours called for under a proposal by the Californ ia Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno introduced a bill that would lay out a blackout schedule for the summer Businesses could make plans for the possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the light s would stay on Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which ever y day is a potential blackout day A Senate committee meanwhile discussed planned blackouts as part of a strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the state will not pay above a certain amount for power The state would ask Washington and Oregon to join the socalled buyers cartel If the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices the state woul d gut it out with planned blackouts Lets use the blackouts against the generators Michael Shames head of t he San Diegobased Utility Consumers Action Network told the Energy Utiliti es and Communications Committee But Shames and others stressed the need for warnings of at least hours and blackouts no longer than minutes Absent that management of blackouts we dont see how the buyers cartel could work Shames said On a visit to Chicago on Monday Davis said he talked to officials about th e citys system for giving the public warning days before possible power blackouts with definite notice right before There is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety i s likely to be jeopardized Davis told reporters Tuesday The governor said he plans to meet in the next few days with managers at ISO to explore the idea of a system like Chicagos The grid operator announced Monday that it will try to give the public at least a halfhour notice of outages but many officials said Tuesday the public needs even more warning Davis aides said the governors plan will g o beyond ISOs There are potential pitfalls Criminals might make their own plans taking advantage of deactivated alarms And some say that a schedule of blackouts might increase the number of outages If people have been warned that a blackout is coming and a lastminute supply of electricity makes it unnecessary grid managers would have to decide whether to call it off said Dorothy Rothrock vice president of the California Manufacturers Technology Association If they did it would add uncertainty to future warnings she said possibl y leading them to order unnecessary blackouts Obviously there are tradeoffs Rothrock said Still the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way f or the state to get back some control of the energy crisis sorely lacking in recent months It would help us as Californians to say The hell with you George Bush were going to handle this ourselves said Jim Overman of Elk Grove Overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyo ne who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyones lives easier Briggs said he has been told by constituents including irrigators and food processors that scheduled blackouts are the way to go Irrigators would know that they shouldnt plan on getting water on a day th at their electronic gates might be closed Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day or arrange fo r backup power generators he said We would be very interested in it said Ed Yates senior vice president o f the California League of Food Processors Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants Yates said requiring so me plants to be resterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day Some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout h e said losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food It doesnt solve the problem but it helps manage a very difficult situation he said Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two weeks The plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have to turned off to keep the grid operating If the electricity shortage went abo ve that amount people might still face unanticipated blackouts Briggs said One question is public safety Some are queasy about burglars knowing when blackouts will occur But pluses include the ability to arrange for tempora ry stop signs at road intersections or families being able to arrange for a sick relative to be moved If the police have only five minutes notice they cant get to difficult intersections to direct traffic they cant help paramedics fire departmen ts and ambulances get where they have to be Davis said The manufacturers association and other business groups havent endorsed t he idea yet but say its worth a look Its preferable to random rolling blackouts Rothrock said The Bees John Hill can be reached at or Californians priorities for solving the crisis are outlined in a Field Pol l Related graphic By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief Published May Californians have some clear ideas on how to solve the energy crisis build more nuclear power plants cap the wholesale price of electricity and relax airquality standards to allow older plants to be upgraded And according to a Field Poll released Tuesday theyre not so hot on the recently approved billion bond authorization to pay for electricity or the idea of Gov Gray Davis seizing power plants through eminent domain Poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by respondents unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes of the state s power woes Nearly percent said it essentially is an artificial crisis created by power companies to make money But on one longstanding issue nuclear power the poll showed a clear preference and a dramatic shift in public opinion In the highest recorded support for nuclear power in California since befor e the Three Mile Island disaster in percent say they favor more nuclear plants in the state to provide electricity Support among registered voters grows to percent with percent oppose d Among Democrats percent support more nuclear plants and threefourths of Republicans and percent of others agree The change in attitude is very significant because they know this issue Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo said Californians support for nuclear power reached nearly percent in the mids in the aftermath of a nationwide energy crisis But it plummeted to percent in after the partial meltdown at Pennsylvanias Three Mile Island plant and fell to percent in the last time Field surveyed the question In voters demanded that the Sacramento Municipal Utility Districts Rancho Seco nuclear plant be shut down The utility complied and has spent more than million decommissioning it during the past years Although the poll results are in line with some private surveys done recent ly by nuclearenergy advocates opponents say the Field Poll opinions could be misleading because the issue has been dormant for so long Not since the la te s has an application for a nuclear plant been filed in the United States Only two operate in California San Onofre in San Diego County and Diablo Canyon in San Luis Obispo When the poll questions are on issues that people havent thought about that much lately you do get some aberrant results said Bill Magavern a lobbyist for the Sierra Club People right now are obviously concerned abo ut electricity but they havent really thought about what it would be like to have a nuclear power plant in the neighborhood The Field Poll results lend support to at least one aspect in the national energy plan recently released by President Bush who called for more nuclea r power plants nationwide But poll respondents were even more insistent that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should impose caps on wholesale energy prices despite opposition from the Bush administration The poll showed percent of all adults and percent of registered voters including percent of Bush s fellow Republicans support the price controls It really does expose the Bush administration to longterm serious problem s in California if theyre perceived as not willing to help the state in this regard DiCamillo said The public really thinks price caps should be imposed Republicans in the survey support price caps despite Bush opposition and Democrats narrowly oppose the move by Democratic lawmakers and Davis to authorize the largest bond sale in national history to pay for power purchases Among all adults percent approve of the move and percent oppose it Democrats disapprove

Rep Anna Eschoo DPalo Alto said Tuesday that if the Bush administration tries to undo moratoriums protecting more than million acres off the California coast it would be like targeting a missile at us So far the Bush administration hasnt taken any direct action The energy policy he released last week calls for more oil and gas development but it s only recommendation about offshore drilling was that the secretaries of interior and commerce reexamine current laws and executive orders to determine if changes are needed Todays report is to urge selection of five of the most promising gas

states energy crisis By Finlay Lewis COPLEY NEWS SERVICE May WASHINGTON After weeks of holding California and its electricity crisi s at arms length President Bush will plunge into the problem next week during a twoday visit to the state that will include a possible energy summit with California Gov Gray Davis White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters Wednesday that the states energy crisis will be at the top of the list when the president a nd the governor meet The presidents aides said that the time and place for t he meeting are still being worked out Bushs visit to the state will be his first since last falls campaign Wit h their party enjoying only a slim majority in the US House some Californi a Republicans have expressed dismay over their states absence from the presidents extensive postinaugural travel schedule fearing that the ener gy crisis could cost some GOP lawmakers their seats in next years elections Fleischers announcement Wednesday of the meeting with Davis and its emphas is on energy caught many by surprise because the White House had given no hint until then that the president would address the issue during his upcoming trip to California However Davis called the White House on Tuesday night proposing a meeting with the president specifically to discuss energy He followed up with two letters on Wednesday expressing the need for quicke r action on the energy front Californians cant afford to wait four or five years for a permanent solution We need relief today In the longer of two letters Davis wrote You and I dont agree on everything But heres something we do have in common we both inherited an energy mess And the people that elected us expect us to clean it up Davis also offered in the letters to introduce Bush to business owners a nd everyday citizens who have been personally affected by this energy crisis Fleischer said Wednesday that Bush would meet with business leaders and energy consumers Asked who initiated the meeting with Davis Fleischer suggested the presidents schedule had been drawn up independently of Davis suggestions This is a case of they both want to meet with each other and were very pleased to be able to make it work out he said As for the meeting with the business leaders Fleischer said The presiden t has several events on his schedule that already include business leaders an d energy consumers and so it very well may happen that were each suggesting similar things which would be a healthy sign Bushs itinerary also includes a stop on Tuesday at the Camp Pendleton Mari ne Corps Base designed to showcase his order directing the military to cut the ir energy use by percent at California facilities Fleischer said that the president wanted to talk about how the federal government is going to be a strong partner to the state of California in th e cause of energy conservation to help ease the burden in California as they go through the summer months when demand is high and blackouts are most at risk The White House released an outline of the presidents California itinerary on Tuesday afternoon It indicated that the visit would not give prominent attention to the states energy woes Fleischer declined to say whether the president would expand on his energy plan in any way while in California Davis and other California Democrats have been sharply critical of the Bush administration for failing to take decisive action to help alleviate the electricity shortages toll on the state and its citizens They are backing legislation due to come to a key vote on Thursday before t he House Energy and Commerce Committee that would cap electricity rates in the state The administration and most of the states Republican lawmakers oppo se the measure Last week Bush showcased an administration task force report on the nation s energy challenges that stressed longrange solutions focused mainly on increasing the supply of fossil fuels and an expanded role for nuclear powe r The report also suggested incentives to encourage energy conservation and greater fuel efficiency Bushs trip will begin on Monday when he flies from a Memorial Day event in Arizona to Los Angeles where he will spend the night He will return to Washington on Wednesday night after a visit to the Fresno area Bush assumed office despite losing the nations most populous state by a decisive margin and then launched into the most ambitious travel schedule o f any modern president It included stops in states not California Lewis reported from Washington and Sweeney from Sacramento California Democrats seek price caps on electricity By Finlay Lewis COPLEY NEWS SERVICE May WASHINGTON Accusing power generators of price gouging a group of California House Democrats vowed Tuesday to try again this week to legislat e price caps in order to bring down the energy bills in the state Rep Henry Waxman a Los Angeles Democrat and author of the pricecap measure said he would offer the measure as an amendment on Thursday At th at time the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to complete work on a bi ll designed to reduce the number of blackouts expected in California this summ er due to shortages in the supply of electrical power Waxman and other Democrats seized on Republican fundraising events on Mond ay and Tuesday nights involving President Bush and Vice President Cheney charging the Republican administration with exacerbating the California situation by doing the bidding of the oil and gas industry in return for campaign contributions This is a contrived crisis in order to wreck our environmental protection laws Waxman said It is a contrived crisis in order to produce percent increases in profits for some of these generators On the agenda when the committee meets Thursday will be a bill by Rep Joe Barton RTexas that would allow California Gov Gray Davis to temporarily waive some air pollution limits to increase power production in the state when blackouts are imminent It also would include federal help to ease a power transmission bottleneck in the Central Valle y mandated power savings at federal facilities state discretion in adjusting daylight savings time an easing of the ties of some small independent power generators to larg e utilities Earlier this month a subcommittee chaired by Barton rejected Waxmans pricecap amendment as some California Republicans complained that the idea of limiting power rates was politically inspired and would do nothing to solve Californias crisis The Bush administration and the energy industry oppose price caps saying that such an approach would distort the market and worsen the electricity shortage in California and many other western states by discouraging exploration and production Waxmans plan would require federal regulators in many cases to tie wholesa le power rates to production costs plus a reasonable profit At the press conference Rep Bob Filner DSan Diego derided Republican opposition to price caps Referring to wholesale power generators Filner argued They were making money at a megawatt now they are charging up to Believe me Th ey can make money off the market with a costbase rate They have done it for years They can continue doing it Rep Jane Harman DRedondo Beach said that California Republicans on the energy committee would suffer politically if they give into pressure from party leaders to oppose the pricecap bill There are no party affiliations for rate payers said Harman a committee member Republicans and Democrats have both seen the gouging of their rate s in California Mexico No limit on number of new plants to be built Energy chief says anyone who requests a permit will get it By Diane Lindquist UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER May Mexican Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens said yesterday that Mexico wont s et any limit on the number of power plants in Baja California supplying electricity north of the border Since theres a window of opportunity here because of the need in Californ ia for electricity anyone who requests a permit will get it Martens said after speaking at the Institute of the Americas th annual Latin American Energy Conference in La Jolla Power plant construction in Baja California has become one of the most immediate solutions to Californias electricity shortfalls At least three plants being built in Baja California in the next four years will send electricity north of the border where blackouts have interrupted normal activity One facility a Sempra Energy Corp power plant near Mexicali will export all of its electrical output to consumers north of the border The San Dieg o companys project gained quick approval from Mexican authorities because th e facility is not subject to restrictions imposed on private companies that supply electricity to the Mexican market Other Mexican energy officials have said several other enterprises are interested in building similar facilities in Baja California Such a mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the border that the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and public health and safety In his speech Martens emphasized Mexicos commitment to preserving the environment and local communities But afterward he said Mexico will approve any number of Baja California projects to serve California consumers I dont see any limit The only limit is the ability of the interconnectin g lines to transmit the electricity that is produced he said With a capacity of only megawatts each the two transmission interconnections linking the electricity grids of California and Baja California will not be able to transmit all of the megawatts of electricity for the California market produced by the new Baja California plants let alone any additional facilities Sempra whose San Diego Gas Electric subsidiary owns both the interconnecting lines plans to upgrade the interconnector near Mexicali spokesman Michael Clark said yesterday The improvement will transmit electricity from Sempras plant in Baja California to the company substatio n in Imperial Valley The other connection links San Diego and Tijuana Clark said he doesnt know how the other companies building Baja California plants plan to transmit their electricity Representatives of the firms cou ld not be reached yesterday Even if the companies find a way to send electricity across the border the California grid system presents another obstacle To prepare for the possibility of more demands on the Southern California grid the Imperial Irrigation District is analyzing what capacity it has fo r transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess tariffs for the servic e Its become very important because of our proximity to Mexico said district spokesman Ron Hull The ability to transmit electricity is only one force limiting plant construction in Baja California Another is the supply of fuel to drive the facilities Sempra again is a key player in this area It plans to build a North Baja Pipeline that will supply natural gas to its own and two other power plants in Baja California and the proposed Otay Mesa plant in San Diego The pipeline wont provide fuel for any other facilities Its fully subscribed said Clark In the future if there is enough demand the compression could be increased Energy Secretary Martens however hinted at the possibility of new natural gas supplies in Baja California He said Mexico wants liquified natural gas facilities to be built in Rosarito Beach and Ensenada While several companies have expressed an interest in such an operation Martens comments were the first to indicate that two and not one might b e approved for Baja California Potential governor candidate launches Northern

cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchives tate EDTDTLtypeDnews PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP Over the past four months Californians have developed increasingly negativ e feelings toward state and federal officials and agencies involved in Californias energy crisis according to a Field Poll released Thursday A large number of those surveyed are also fearful that Pacific Gas Electrics bankruptcy filing will make it more difficult for the company to provide service to its customers Fiftyseven percent of those questioned in May by the Field Institute a Sa n Franciscobased nonpartisan polling organization gave Californias private electric utilities a poor rating Thats more than the percent of respondents who rated the utilities performance as poor in January The same negative feelings held true for outofstate energy providers Fiftyfive percent of respondents this month rated their performance as poo r a noticeable increase from the percent of respondents who gave them a po or rating in January Specifically those surveyed were asked to rate the job being done by officials and groups working to improve the energy situation in the state The poll found that The percentage of those surveyed who gave the state Public Utilities Commission a poor rating rose from percent in January to percent in May percent of those surveyed gave the state legislature a poor rating in May as opposed percent in January percent gave Gov Gray Davis a poor rating in May for his handling of the states energy woes a sharp increase from percent who gave him a po or rating in January The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also drew negative ratings from respondents In May percent said FERC was doing a poor job as opposed to percent who gave the commission a rating of poor in January Those surveyed were also asked if PGEs bankruptcy would make it more difficult for the company to supply electricity to customers and percen t said they thought it would The poll which questioned California adults between May

electricity And drop out of the power grid by using alternative power sources and alternatives to power sources Thats the only thing we can do in the short term In the long term you can almost see what will be coming down the pike As the states energy problems worsen as the state throws its surplus down a rathole as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across th e state someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on the ballot It will do two things First it will undo the deregulation of the states energy industry It wil l try to put everything back the way it was Second it will punish the producers of power and energy It will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a publ ic utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirely Huge amounts of money will be spent against it Opponents will outspend supporters by a substantial amount TV ads will run constantly predicting dire consequences if the initiative is approved Well be told it will be bad for business Labor leaders will tell us that it will cost jobs Experts will say it will have no effect on the problem or make the problem worse All of that will probably be true The initiative will pass easily It will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood a s the two main causes of the current energy crisis a badly bungled deregulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers It will pass because the initiatives authors will understand that most of us are furious about the way this mess was created and that were eager to tak e it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains It will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldnt are the people who got us into this disaster in the first place and we won t believe them Its much harder to say whether the energy crisis will have more immediate political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame fo r the problem such as the state Legislature and Gov Davis who could have done something about this a year ago and chose not to Yes the latest polls make it clear that Californians are furious with Davi s and the Legislature But elections for office are not yesno propositions you dont get to vo te up or down on Davis They are a contest between two major party candidates which means election s are always a matter of comparisons Davis compared with his opponent Someone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job bett er than Davis There might indeed be such people Its unlikely one of those people will appear on the ballot in however The current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in discouragement people who fearful of losing lack the nerve to run against a wellfinanced incumbent The great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that problem rather than being stuck with a wellfinanced incumbent wed for ce him out of office In reality were stuck with the wellfinanced incumbent until his term limits are up in six or eight years That does nothing to solve the problems that might arise in those six to eight years It has done nothing to embolden wouldbe candidates Now they just meekly wait their turn And it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the Capitol with people who dont know what theyre doing only where theyre going next Meanwhile the people who do know what theyre doing have been kicked out office Its no coincidence that the deregulation mess was made in a Legislature fu ll of people elected during the termlimit era A statewide initiative brave candidates ending term limits those are a ll things that will happen in the future Right now its time to tune in turn off and drop out Tune in to

easier than it appears Energy consumption has dropped in my household by more than a third by switching off some lights converting to fluorescent light bulbs turning down the refrigerator and

worked out said the administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity But any plan would have to order the ISO to give more notice of potential blackouts Davis also hopes to give hour and then hour notices of probable blackout scenarios Administration officials said the twoday notice would go to law enforcement while everyone would get a hour warning Business groups welcomed the

about employee safety issues The more notice we have the better we can accommodate the blackout Carl Guardino an ISO board member and president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group has been pushing for an advanced notification plan and working with the governor Sixty minutes is twice as good as minutes he said With little doubt that blackouts will hit this summer lawmakers have been searching for a way to make them easier on residents and businesses As much notice as possible would be helpful Its helpful to have some advance notice for planning purposes but small businesses will still be hu rt by the blackouts said Shirley Knight assistant state director of the National Federation of Independent Business Most small businesses are in the service sector so theyre open during the day which means smallbusiness owners arent going to be able to recoup those blackout costs like a manufacturer might be able to Knight said But one consumer group said Davis should be doing more

last resort t o avoid blackouts said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar Unfortunately we are in an emergency situation Everything is on the table Californias persistent power shortage has led to rolling blackouts around the state several times this year with more anticipated when hot summer weather prompts people to use air conditioning If all of the states backup generators ran full time they would produce about tons of nitrogen dioxide per day Thats more than nine times the pollution power plants produced on an average day in according to sta te Air Resources Board data And the state would get only about megawatts of electricity barely percent of the states peak power needs from the backup generators That would be enough to power about homes They could have a huge negative effect on air quality said Ellen Garve y executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management Agency Its on e thing to run these generators during blackouts and emergency conditions bu t using them for other purposes could be devastating Business groups that support the proposal include the League of Food Processors the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and San Diego Gas Electric These generators could go a long way to taking some demand off the electr ic grid and putting some supply back into the power system said Gino DiCaro spokesman for the manufacturers and technology association Most of the states backup generators are small units that run on diesel fuel and lack pollution controls Some are rentals and others can b e found at hospitals office buildings sewage treatment plants and universit y labs Unlike backup generators intended for home use which are not regulated industrialsized units are limited in the number of hours they can operate But since the states power crunch began regional airquality regulators have issued emergency rules allowing them to run more frequently Diesel engines produce carcinogenic soot and oxides of nitrogen a buildi ng block of asthmainducing smog Small generators fight for payment from utilities Posted at pm PDT Wednesday May BY JENNIFER BJORHUS Mercury News BAKERSFIELD A gray cat picks its way through the lot of Oildale Energy a small natural gasfired power plant on the citys gritty northeast edge Th e clamor of machinery and trucks sounds that meant prosperity here is gone Employees have painted Oildales machinery insulated the boilers and tweaked the motionless ton turbine Now they wait Its kind of like a skeleton says plant manager Mike Pankratz surveyi ng the octopustangle of pipes and tanks Choked by the million Pacific Gas Electric Co owes it Oildale shut down Feb taking its megawatts of badly needed electricity with it T he hush here is the sound of small generators locked in one of the most seriou s issues of Californias energy crisis one that state regulators plan to wrestle with today Oildale is part of a growing legion of small generators from geothermal to gasfired cogeneration plants battling Californias utilities and state price controls they say are crippling them These small generators owed about billion supply up to a third of Californias electricity At least have sued Southern California Edison over unpaid bills Four ha ve sued PGE And PGEs bankruptcy proceedings in San Francisco are clogged with motions from at least small generators including Oildale In many cases these companies want to end their longterm supply contracts with th e utilities so they can sell their electricity on the more lucrative open market What this is basically is the revolt of the mice said Bill Short wit h Ridgewood Power Management a New Jersey firm that has shuttered three gasfired generators in California and sued PGE Officials to weigh debt The companies are hoping for action from the California Public Utilities Commission which is scheduled today to weigh whether to order the utilitie s to pay the back debt Meanwhile US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali wades through motions filed by disgruntled generators and counter motions from PGE The deteriorating finances of some of the approximately small generator s threatens Californias fragile power supply just as the state heads into th e summer months up to megawatts short The deep and often unexpected economic impacts of Californias energy crunc h add up daily In Oildales case the shutdown not only jeopardizes the jobs of its anxious employees but those of more than employees at the refinery next door Its one of the biggest public policy botches in the energy crisis some energy experts argue California is shooting itself in the foot by not attending to the relatively clean and efficient small power suppliers in it s own back yard they say Gasfired cogeneration plants which provide powe r to nearby businesses and sell electricity to utilities are some of the mos t efficient producers in the state And many of the small generators harness renewable resources like the sun and garbage fumes lessening the states dependence on highpriced natural gas The idea that were refusing to step in and help them while were paying through the nose to pay Dynegy and Williams and everybody else this is jus t nuts said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute mentioning companies that own major power plants in the state This is really a major blunder The immediate crisis started in late January Oildales Pankratz explained Thats when PGE told the plant it was not going to pay for electricity delivered in December The news worried Oildales gas supplier Pankratz said which halted the plants supply Pankratz turned off the plants turbine The move socked Golden Bear Oil Specialties the refinery that looms over Oildale Unable to operate without the cheap steam heat Oildale supplies Golden Bear cannot heat the asphalt and industrial oils it produces Golden Bear filed for bankruptcy April Last week it announced plans to lay off employees Golden Bear Chairman Carl Soderlind said Oildale Golden Bears exclusive source of steam heat for nearly years was a key reason his group bought the refinery four years ago Having it go under was gutwrenching he said Power unavailable The California Independent System Operator keeper of the states electrici ty grid reports that megawatts of power from small generators are off line It estimates that about half of that megawatts or energy for as many as homes is due to the financial squeeze of natural gas prices money owed by the utilities or both Others say financial problems have megawatts off line Lawmakers havent been much help The state Assembly on March rejected a hastily crafted rescue bill meant to help buttress these companies The iss ue has languished in Sacramento Days later the utilities commission ordered Californias utilities to pay the generators for electricity delivered in the future which saved many of them but it did not order the utilities to pay the hefty backdue amount s It also set a new rate for what utilities should pay the generators for electricity That price is percent lower and too low for business some argue The commissions position has been that the small generators should abide b y their existing contracts said commission attorney Gary Cohen To the extent that some of them are facing financial hardship the commission may take a look at whether it can do anything to help them visavis the back debt The lack of stronger action to support these generators baffles some critic s Its like talking to a starving man on a desert island and saying How long can you hold up until the ship comes said V John White director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies Some of the companies have appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission but regulators are waiting to see if the state and the courts c an resolve the issue Were in what essentially amounts to an abusive relationship said Shor t with Ridgewood the independent generator that has sued PGE Two courts have allowed generators fighting Edison to suspend their contracts Five have lost their fights Another five have won the right to put a lien on Edisons assets In PGEs battle three of the four lawsuits are on hold because of the bankruptcy In the fourth a judge allowed a generator out of the contract it had terminated before the bankruptcy As for Oildale it wants PGE to pay the million it owes or Oildale wants to sell its electricity on the open market It also wants PGE to pay what it calls a fair market value for its electricity If Oildale cant sell on the open market soon it will be forced into bankruptcy its attorneys argue Pankratz estimates his plant can hang in limbo only three more months PGE is fighting to keep its small generators which it says are exaggerati ng their damage It reports that only a tiny fraction of its generators ar e off line Increased costs If the plants were released from their contracts PGE could not afford to pay the extra million per month it estimates electricity would cost T he state Department of Water Resources and ultimately ratepayers would have to foot that bill A fast solution isnt likely from the bankruptcy court The judge has made it clear the generators raise a host of complicated legal questions Meanwhile the clock ticks Weve all been a little tense says Judy Andreatta who has worked Oildales front desk for years and worries about her job Its just so scary watching everything happen Whod ever think wed lose power Electricity notebook FERC may renew price caps May From Register wire services Federal regulators this week announced that they might reimpose caps on the cost of transporting natural gas into southern California The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday gave the public days to comment on the possibility of reinstating caps which were temporarily suspended by the commission this year The price controls were lifted in an effort to expand the reach of deregulation This proposed action said Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif could make a real difference Since FERC engaged in this experimental lifting of the cap the price of natural gas in Southern California has climbed to three times higher than t he rest of the nation said Feinstein Currently she said the price in Southern California is per million British Thermal Units and only in the rest of the Western region Gas fuels most electricitygenerating plants in the state The commission also asked for comment on whether the caps should be limited to California or include other Western markets Legislators search for a Plan B for Edison Davis tack is politically volatile The aim still is to steer clear of bankruptcy May By HANH KIM QUACH and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO Lawmakers this week will seek to swap the deal Gov Gray Davis made to rescue the states No utility from financial ruin with something more politically palatable Davis deal some have complained is sweeter for Southern California Ediso n than for taxpayers So at least four proposals are being floated to supplan t that plan But legislators are far from a consensus on any of them Plans emerge recede and are reconfigured daily Energy experts and bankruptcy lawyers warn that too much legislative fiddli ng could result in what neither side wants bankruptcy for Edison Bankruptcy means the state would be stuck buying energy until both Edison a nd Pacific Gas Electric which is already in bankruptcy complete the Chapter process which could take years experts and lawmakers said The states wallet would shrink affecting its ability to build schools and roads Ratepayers might be on the hook for an additional billion for the companys legal fees because bankruptcy would freeze its assets said Bria n Bennett vice president of Edison International the utilitys parent company Southern California Edison has said its willing to be flexible on the governors plan which calls for the state to buy Edisons transmission gri d for billion Company officials wouldnt comment on the various alternatives We understand that the transmission deal is the subject of controversy and are open to variations on it Bennett said Steve Maviglio Davis spokesman said the governor also remained committed to his deal Edison is going to survive said Mitch Wilk a member of the state Publi c Utilities Commission from through and a past president of the agency But the question is whether it will survive via the plan that th e governor negotiated or they do the same kind of thing PGE did There is still a very real risk that SCE will be forced into bankruptcy if the Legislature tinkers too much with the deal or fails to move ahead promptly Wilk said PGE chose to file Chapter last month because it was dissatisfied with t he progress of negotiations with Davis on a state rescue of the company PGE s move was an embarrassment for Davis who had vowed to keep the states big utilities solvent One of the principal chips Edison has with the state is not filing for bankruptcy said Ed Feo a lawyer involved with the PGE case It would be a black eye for the state As long as the company stays out of bankruptcy they have something to trade Edisons creditors are still waiting to see how the utility fares with the Legislature Some have agreed to defer receiving payments until the end of June Dean Vanech president of New Jerseybased Carson Cogeneration said a lot of things need to happen before he and other creditors feel ready to drag Edis on into bankruptcy In general we would have to feel like there was absolutely no hope in a deal being made Vanech said But he admitted theres a concern that a resolution will not be put on the table in any reasonable period of timeMeanwhile Edison has vigorously lobbied the Legislature to approve the transmission deal The company has launched a publicrelations campaign to persuade the public that it is in its interest said John Bryson chief executive of Edison International Bankruptcy is a last resort Bryson said in a recent interview We believe there will be a solution But changes are necessary said Senate Leader John Burton DSan Francisco because people didnt like Plan A Lawmakers cringed at some elements of the plan which many thought was over ly generous to Edison limiting investigation of the utilitys parents compan y and guaranteeing the company an percent annual return on investment Alternatives include requiring power generators to accept up to onethird less than the collective billion theyre owed taxing Edison on its property and using the tax to pay off its debts and allowing Edison to bui ld more power plants The latest proposal would require the state to sell bond s to pay off Edisons debts and give the state the option to buy the transmission lines later Most of the proposals would require an extra surcharge on ratepayers bills to pay off debts One hurdle the legislature faces rallying twothirds of each house behind one plan necessary any time the state spends money Republicans have been philosophically opposed to acquiring transmission lines and half the alternatives include that element But Stanford University professor James Sweeney thinks compromise is possible Lawmakers and the utility will strike a deal simply because a second bankruptcy would tarnish the image of the states political leaders Sweeney believes however the outcome might be more fair in court Bankruptcies are messy but so is the political process Sweeney said Were in a situation where the leadership politically seems not willing to bite the bullet It may be better for our state to have a bankruptcy judge who is very strong and who isnt planning for a higher office Long Beach obtains lien on Edisons assets The city is the fourth small supplier with an attachment on the utility May By KATE BERRY The Orange County Register The city of Long Beach became the fourth small power supplier to get a lien against the assets of Southern California Edison a move that could push th e utility closer to bankruptcy Last week Edison was ordered to freeze at least million in bank account s to cover payments owed to Long Beach for power Edison bought from the city s trashtoenergy plant Getting a lien on the utilitys assets ensures the city will be paid even if the utility files for bankruptcy Stephen Pickett Edison Internationals general counsel said the utility plans to appeal Long Beach also is suing Edison International the utilitys parent company for breach of contract claiming the utility should not have transferred billion to its parent company over a fouryear period beginning in wh en deregulation was implemented Edison International was required to honor the debts of its subsidiary said Robert Shannon Long Beachs city attorney So far Edison has been sued by small power suppliers known as qualifyi ng facilities or QFs The lawsuits either seek to put a lien on the utilitys assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate year contracts to provide power to Edison Edison owes QFs about billion and is trying to combine the cases before a single judge in Los Angeles But Long Beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay in its contract with Edison We just want to be paid under our contract We still want to deliver them power said Shannon As a municipality Long Beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a lien as the other QFs must Ed Feo a lawyer for wind solar and biomass QFs said liens on Edisons assets could have a domino effect Two things will accelerate a bankruptcy filing by Edison Either the deal to sell its transmission lines to the state is going nowhere and alternative s are not acceptable or if attachments are made to the companys property that the utility doesnt want to run the risk of losing Three other QFs have posted bonds to obtain liens against Edison They include Caithness Energy which got a lien on Edisons percent interest in two qualifying facilities that make up the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev IMC Chemicals a unit of IMC Global Inc of Northbrook Ill and that won a million lien and Herber Geothermal Co and Second Imperi al Geothermal Co which is owned by Covanta Energy Corp a former unit of Ogden Corp based in Fairfield NJ Poll in state favor nuclear power Its a reversal of views since the Three Mile Island accident May The Associated Press Fiftynine percent of Californians now support building more nuclear plants according to a poll released Wednesday The last time the Field Institute polled Californians about nuclear energy was five years after the accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvan ia and it found percent opposed to nuclear power In my interpretation the current energy crisis has some bearing on the publics changed attitudes on nuclear power said Mark DiCamillo spokesma n for the nonpartisan polling organization The public is searching for clean ways to add to the capacity The Field poll comes as the Bush administration pushes for a renewed look a t nuclear power No utilities have ordered any new nuclear power plants in th e United States since The poll of California adults was taken May The margin of erro r was plus or minus percent Carl Zichella the Sierra Clubs regional staff director said Californians have not thought about nuclear energy for about years and do not have as much information as they did around Three Mile Island I think this number really reflects a lack of knowledge on the part of the public about the problems that drove nuclear power underground he said The more people know about nuclear power the less theyre going to like it Getting a new nuclear plant built faces two major problems financing and siting said Rich Ferguson research director for the Sacramento based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technology We have just not seen any interest in the financial community to invest th e billions of dollars he said Filing for Hayward Project Includes Request for Expedited Review PLEASANTON Calif May PRNewswire San Josebased Calpine Corporation NYSE CPN and San Franciscobased Bechtel Enterprises Holdin gs Inc today filed an Application For Certification AFC with the California Energy Commission CEC for its proposed Russell City Energy Center in Hayward Calif The filing marks the beginning of an extensive CEC licensi ng process required to build and operate an electricity generating facility in California The filing included a request for expedited review that would reduce the licensing review process period from months to months The proposed Russell City Energy Center would be a megawatt natural gasfired combinedcycle electric generating facility located on approximately acres of land zoned heavy industrial at Enterprise Avenue in Hayward The site is adjacent to the city of Haywards wastewate r treatment plant which would supply recycled water to the Energy Center Th e Russell City Energy Center would provide needed electricity for Hayward western Alameda County and the San Francisco Peninsula The modern technology used at the facility would allow for a greater than percent reduction of certain emissions and is percent more fuelefficient compared to older gasfueled facilities in the Bay Area The Russell City Energy Center will provide a vital new source of clean reliable electricity in the region said Curt Hildebrand vice president a nd general manager of the CalpineBechtel Joint Development We look forward to working with the City of Hayward Alameda County and the California Energy Commission to develop a model Energy Center Submittal of the AFC represents the culmination of more than six months of extensive engineering technical and environmental studies We are hopeful that the considerable groundwork that we have laid thus far will make this project eligible for the six month CEC review process Hildebrand added We are seeking the expedited review to do everything we can to help solve the states energy crisis as quickly as possible Once the CEC determines that the application is complete and determine whether the project qualifies for the expedited review process the officia l review will begin As lead agency the CEC will work with environmental an d government agencies in conducting its review and will hold local workshops and hearings to encourage community participation The expedited review process would require the same environmental and technical standards as the longer review period Based upon the successful licensing of the project construction could begin in summer of with commercial operation by summer of Copies of the AFC filings will be available through the CEC and

May Xinhua via COMTEX Governor of California Gra y Davis on Tuesday signed a bill to speed up the process of approving construction of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage California is in a war with energy producers and the best longterm weapo n is to build more power plants Davis said at a signing ceremony in Elk Grove California The bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power plant as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals Davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the process right now including a megawatt plant in Palm Springs and a gas storage project in Lodi that will store up to billion cubic feet of natu ral gas California has been suffering from a power crisis since last year which ha s caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling The crisis is largely blamed on the deregulation law that forces the utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than they charge the customers And the repairs of generators in some power plants an d the warming weather have made things worse After the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power anymore the state government has used more than billion dollars of tax money so far this year to buy electricity on behalf of them Among other measures to ease the power shortage the state government has called for residents to conserve electricity as much as they can especially durin g the peakhours during the dayResidents have been told to brace for a worse situation during the incoming summer From the Oakland Tribune Lockyer Probe may spark suit Criminal charges could follow evidence of price gouging By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday his investigation of alleged multibilliondollar price gouging by power generators has laid the foundation for a successful civil case that could w in huge refunds But the whole house hasnt been built Lockyer said in an interview with ANG Newspapers The attorney general said the probe he expects to complete in the next eigh t weeks also may yet yield criminal charges which could result in power company officials being locked up with my tattooed dude Lockyer a former East Bay legislator rattled electricity suppliers earlie r this week when he told the Wall Street Journal I would love to personally escort Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay to an x cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey Houstonbased Enron like other energytrading firms has denied wrongdoing in the California market It dismissed Lockyers comment as not warranting a response butquietlyprotested to the Davis administration Other power companies have expressed outrage I was trying to convey a message to the outofstate energy generators Lockyer said I decided to make the point with the energy generators that theyve got a serious fight on their hands The attorney general however conceded he has felt guilty about it ever since because Im a prosecutor and I take pride in being careful about thes e sorts of accusations or claims But I know it wont be in print unless I find some sort of colorful way to pump up the rhetoric he said We dont care if theyre multimillionaires We dont care if they run big corporations Theyre buccaneers Theyre ripping us off Now while were still in the legal analysis of whether its legal or illegal greed its clearly immoral Theres no debate about that Lockyer said his investigators are scrutinizing tens of thousands of transactions and hundreds of thousands of documents to determine the streng th of the states case I think there is strong evidence that lays the foundation for a successful civil action but the whole house hasnt been built Lockyer said A civil case could result in refunds that disgorge the obscene profits h e said The California Independent System Operator which manages the states electric transmission grid estimates that power suppliers may have overcharged California by billion since early last year The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has so far tentatively ordered California suppliers to make only tens of millions of dollars in refunds as part of that agencys ongoing probe Lockyer said criminal charges will be filed if investigators find that company officials intentionally engaged in unfair business practices The attorney general said he hopes to complete the work within the next eig ht weeks despite what he called stalling tactics such as those by three energy firms Reliant and Dynegy of Houston and Mirant of Atlanta The three companies agreed Tuesday to surrender copies of internal document s that had been subpoenaed two months ago by Lockyer as part of the probe Theyve been throwing anhour lawyers at us in high volume to drag their feet and stall our investigation Lockyer said The attorney generals comments come amid a flurry of lawsuits and allegations by California officials against power suppliers as well as ongoing probes Besides the attorney and FERC the Legislature state Public Utilities Commission CalISO and the California Electricity Oversight Board are all conducting investigations by MediaNews Group Inc and ANG Newspapers

relieve Californias overloaded electricity grid this summer by paying businesses to run their highpolluting backup generators in advance of anticipated blackouts a top energy adviser to the governor said Wednesday The backup generators will help us get through the summer said S David Freeman who recently resigned as general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to lead Davis drive for energy conservation Freeman said he would leave it to Davis to disclose details of the plan The governor will announce what hes going to do he said Wednesday in a wideranging interview on energy issues with The Bee Roger Salazar the governors deputy press secretary would not confirm whe n or whether Davis would make such an announcement I dont know that the governor has signed off on anything like that Salazar said Under the plan participating businesses would turn on backup generators an d simultaneously disconnect from the electricity grid when power supplies are at Stage nearly depleted The state would pay the companies for the muchneeded power that would be saved by converting to diesel generation Deploying dieselpowered generators the dirtiest of internal combustion engines to forestall blackouts is another sign of the governors struggl e to get more megawatts flowing through California Earlier this week Davis lowered his estimate of the amount of new power tha t will come on line this summer from megawatts to megawatts A megawatt is enough power for to households The diesel plan also marks a significant turnabout in the Davis administrations policy The governor and his appointees at the state Air Resources Board uniformly have rejected such proposals from industries utilities and the operator of the states electricity grid arguing that routine use of the backup diesel s would endanger public health San Diego Gas Electric has one such proposal scheduled for a vote today b y the Davisappointed state Public Utilities Commission Environmentalists who have been catching word of the Davis plan this week argue that it would shatter the governors repeated promises to stand firm on air quality standards during the energy crisis A letter signed Wednesday by several of the states leading environmental organizations including the American Lung Association of California urged Davis to reconsider Given your awareness of the public health threats of diesel emissions please stop and have these proposals considered in a more thoughtful and public manner the letter states Freeman argued however that the additional health threat from nonemergen cy use of diesel generators is marginal compared with the health and safety problems triggered by power outages This is a nobrainer Freeman said Youve got human lives at stake here This is a scary situation Freeman cited for example people on lifesupport systems that could go aw ry in blackouts But Sandra Spelliscy attorney for the environmentalist Planning and Conservation League countered If the health impacts are so marginal why has the governors own air quality enforcement agency opposed this Industries ranging from hospitals to food processing plants and data management centers have dieselpowered generators some the size of locomotives that kick on when a storm or earthquake knocks out power Unlike dieselpowered trucks and buses most diesel standby generators run with little or no pollution controls because they are intended only for emergencies Though the latest models run cleaner and more efficiently most generators in use today produce about times more emissions of smogforming nitrogen oxides per megawatthour as a new natural gasfired power plant according to air board engineers Further the diesels spew high amounts of breathable soot particles that can cause cancer the engineers say Davis plan would limit the use of the generators to days when the grid operator declares a Stage alert meaning the power supplies are running l ow and rolling blackouts may be ordered to keep the states entire grid from collapsing according to Freeman Salazar the governors spokesman said only Any backup generation involving diesel will have to be used as a last resort to prevent blackouts Environmentalists who are trying to head off the plan said it would have th e state paying participating businesses at least cents per kilowatthour roughly three times the rate consumers typically pay for electricity Freem an would not confirm the pay rate The Davis administration has offered generators willing to sell new power exclusively to the state percent discounts on the air emission credits they would need to comply with smog rules For operators of existing power plants the governor has agreed to have taxpayers pay the entire cost of polluting above allowable limits in order to keep the lights on The latest plan to pay companies to run the dirty diesels during energy alerts further loosens the environmental reins The Bees Chris Bowman can be reached at or om BushDavis meeting set for energy crisis By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau Published May WASHINGTON President Bush will meet next week with Gov Gray Davis to ta lk about Californias worsening electricity crisis amid a shifting political dynamic on Capitol Hill that increasingly favors some controls on West Coas t wholesale electricity prices Details for the BushDavis meeting were still being worked out Wednesday b ut the fact that the Republican president is meeting with the Democratic governor who is often mentioned as a possible challenger in was seen as a sign that the White House is facing increasing political heat on the energy issue California is a very big state said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer It represents onesixth of the United States Its the sixthlargest econo my in the world And the president is very pleased to sit and talk with Govern or Davis Its important Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said electricity price caps will be at th e top of the governors agenda for the meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday But Fleischer did not commit the president to that kind of meeting In his first visit to the state since the campaign last year the president will spend Monday night in Los Angeles and Tuesday night in Fresno Until now the White House has steadfastly refused to meet with any elected Democrat from California about the energy crisis despite repeated pleas fro m the Democratic congressional delegation Price controls have become the mantra of California Democratic lawmakers an d a handful of Republicans but the Bush administration has flatly dismissed them as counterproductive to increasing power generation in the megawattshort state In recent weeks however there has been a developing shift in the attitude toward price controls on Capitol Hill Bushs two nominees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission whose names were forwarded to the Senate floo r Wednesday for confirmation declined to rule out price controls once they a

pricecontrol advocate to the helm of the k ey Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee California Sen Dianne Feinstein a committee Democrat said Wednesday that she has talked to Bingaman and that he committed to moving her legislation to temporarily peg wholesale prices to the cost of production Four Republican House members from California have also endorsed some form of pricecontrol legislation On Wednesday Rep Doug Ose RSacramento announced that he is introducing a bill that while not technically a price cap would give greater price reli ef for West Coast consumers than federal regulators or the Bush administration have been willing to offer Ose chairman of the House Government Reform Committees energy subcommitte e said his bill would extend throughout the West a pricemitigation plan approved last month by the FERC But instead of that plan taking effect onl y during power emergencies as the commission directed it would operate aroun d the clock under Oses bill

Bee Capitol Bureau Published May State Assembly efforts to develop a bipartisan proposal to help Southern California Edison pay off massive debts and avoid bankruptcy hit a dead end Wednesday when Republicans released a plan of their own The move could force Democrats to sidestep Republicans and vote along party lines on an alternative to Gov Gray Davis proposed billion state purchase of power lines Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said Wednesdays split was necessary because there are few differences between the governors plan and the Democrats plan The Republican plan rejects the notion of purchasing transmission lines or hydroelectric facilities Key components call for dedicating a portion of consumer rates to allow Edison to pay off billion in debts In return

dramatically over the past five months according to a Field Poll released Wednesday And Californians it turns out blame plenty of people for the states powe r woes except themselves Every player in the power drama gets poor marks except residential energy consumers which percent of poll respondents say are doing a good or ve ry good job to improve the energy situation Only percent think they are doing a poor or very poor job Public opinion of residential consumers efforts has improved since January when percent thought they were doing a poor job and only percent gave them high marks The public sees themselves as conserving energy said Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo Thats the only positive movement in the survey For Davis who faces reelection next year the movement is far from positive In the January poll the Democratic governor received good marks from percent of those surveyed average grades from percent and poor ratings from only percent But when the Field Institute conducted its recent poll between May and Sunday opinions about Davis flipflopped After months of energy angst a handful of power blackouts and two rate increases only percent think Davis is doing a good job while percent gave him failing grades The po ll also shows that Californians believe the crisis will continue by an average of a year and a half well through the upcoming reelection battle All the rhetoric Davis used with some positive effect early on is not goin g over well any more DiCamillo said The public is starting to view this a s a longterm problem not some temporary policy shift Still Davis fares far better than his adversaries in the crisis Preside nt Bush Vice President Dick Cheney and the energy industry The publics view of energy interests which was pretty dim in January dro ps even lower in the May poll Utility companies received bad ratings from hal f the public in January but percent now believe they are doing a poor or very poor job Outofstate energy

about Bush and Cheney because they had not yet taken office Davis has repeatedly bashed FERC for not imposing wholesale price caps on electricity and has called Cheney grossly misinformed on the

doing a good job The Bees Dan Smith can be reached at or New views emerging on power More elected officials support the concept of planned blackouts By John Hill Bee Capitol Bureau Published May If Californians are to be left in the dark they should at least know when to break out the candles or send the workers home Thats the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials including Gov Gray Davis who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and giving businesses and residents ample warning On Tuesday the Democratic governors office said Davis supports longer public notice than the hours called for under a proposal by the Californ ia Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno introduced a bill that would lay out a blackout schedule for the summer Businesses could make plans for the possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the light s would stay on Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which ever y day is a potential blackout day A Senate committee meanwhile discussed planned blackouts as part of a strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the state will not pay above a certain amount for power The state would ask Washington and Oregon to join the socalled buyers cartel If the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices the state woul d gut it out with planned blackouts Lets use the blackouts against the generators Michael Shames head of t he San Diegobased Utility Consumers Action Network told the Energy Utiliti es and Communications Committee But Shames and others stressed the need for warnings of at least hours and blackouts no longer than minutes Absent that management of blackouts we dont see how the buyers cartel could work Shames said On a visit to Chicago on Monday Davis said he talked to officials about th e citys system for giving the public warning days before possible power blackouts with definite notice right before There is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety i s likely to be jeopardized Davis told reporters Tuesday The governor said he plans to meet in the next few days with managers at ISO to explore the idea of a system like Chicagos The grid operator announced Monday that it will try to give the public at least a halfhour notice of outages but many officials said Tuesday the public needs even more warning Davis aides said the governors plan will g o beyond ISOs There are potential pitfalls Criminals might make their own plans taking advantage of deactivated alarms And some say that a schedule of blackouts might increase the number of outages If people have been warned that a blackout is coming and a lastminute supply of electricity makes it unnecessary grid managers would have to decide whether to call it off said Dorothy Rothrock vice president of the California Manufacturers Technology Association If they did it would add uncertainty to future warnings she said possibl y leading them to order unnecessary blackouts Obviously there are tradeoffs Rothrock said Still the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way f or the state to get back some control of the energy crisis sorely lacking in recent months It would help us as Californians to say The hell with you George Bush were going to handle this ourselves said Jim Overman of Elk Grove Overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyo ne who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyones lives easier Briggs said he has been told by constituents including irrigators and food processors that scheduled blackouts are the way to go Irrigators would know that they shouldnt plan on getting water on a day th at their electronic gates might be closed Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day or arrange fo r backup power generators he said We would be very interested in it said Ed Yates senior vice president o f the California League of Food Processors Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants Yates said requiring so me plants to be resterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day Some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout h e said losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food It doesnt solve the problem but it helps manage a very difficult situation he said Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two weeks The plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have to turned off to keep the grid operating If the electricity shortage went abo ve that amount people might still face unanticipated blackouts Briggs said One question is public safety Some are queasy about burglars knowing when blackouts will occur But pluses include the ability to arrange for tempora ry stop signs at road intersections or families being able to arrange for a sick relative to be moved If the police have only five minutes notice they cant get to difficult intersections to direct traffic they cant help paramedics fire departmen ts and ambulances get where they have to be Davis said The manufacturers association and other business groups havent endorsed t he idea yet but say its worth a look Its preferable to random rolling blackouts Rothrock said The

have some clear ideas on how to solve the energy crisis build more nuclear power plants cap the wholesale price of electricity and relax airquality standards to allow older plants to be upgraded And according to a Field Poll released Tuesday theyre not so hot on the recently approved billion bond authorization to pay for electricity or the idea of Gov Gray Davis seizing power plants through eminent domain Poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by respondents unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes of the state s power woes Nearly percent said it essentially is an artificial crisis created by power companies to make money But on one longstanding issue nuclear power the poll showed a clear preference and a dramatic shift in public opinion In the highest recorded support for nuclear power in California since befor e the Three Mile Island disaster in percent say they favor more nuclear plants in the state to provide electricity Support among registered voters grows to percent with percent oppose d Among Democrats percent support more nuclear plants and threefourths of Republicans and percent of others agree The change in attitude is very significant because they know this issue Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo said Californians support for nuclear power reached nearly percent in the mids in the aftermath of a nationwide energy crisis But it plummeted to percent in after the partial meltdown at Pennsylvanias Three Mile Island plant and fell to percent in the last time Field surveyed the question In voters demanded that the Sacramento Municipal Utility Districts Rancho Seco nuclear plant be shut down The utility complied and has spent more than million decommissioning it during the past years Although the poll results are in line with some private surveys done recent ly by nuclearenergy advocates opponents say the Field Poll opinions could be misleading because the issue has been dormant for so long Not since the la te s has an application for a nuclear plant been filed in the United States Only two operate in California San Onofre in San Diego County and Diablo Canyon in San Luis Obispo When the poll questions are on issues that people havent thought about that much lately you do get some aberrant results said Bill Magavern a lobbyist for the Sierra Club People right now are obviously concerned abo ut electricity but they havent really thought about what it would be like to have a nuclear power plant in the neighborhood The Field Poll results lend support to at least one aspect in the national energy plan recently released by President Bush who called for more nuclea r power plants nationwide But poll respondents were even more insistent that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should impose caps on wholesale energy prices despite opposition from the Bush administration The poll showed percent of all adults and percent of registered voters including percent of Bush s fellow Republicans support the price controls It really does expose the Bush administration to longterm serious problem s in California if theyre perceived as not willing to help the state in this regard DiCamillo said The public really thinks price caps should be imposed Republicans in the survey support price caps despite Bush opposition and Democrats narrowly oppose the move by Democratic lawmakers and Davis to authorize the largest bond sale in national history to pay for power purchases Among all adults percent approve of the move and percent oppose it Democrats disapprove of the bonds by a percent to percent margin Californians desire for clean air is softening in the face of the energy crunch respondents said By a margin of percent to percent poll respondents say they would maintain airquality standards rather than relax them to build plants That support is down from a Field survey in January when percent said theyd rather maintain standards Moreover a majority percent say they would relax airquality standards to get older plants back in operation an increase from percent in January Slight majorities support a staterun public power authority percent a nd stateowned power transmission lines percent but DiCamillo said that some poll respondents were probably not familiar with all the implications of those moves Responses to the idea of Davis seizing power plants if prices continue to rise this summer fell somewhat down partisan lines with Democrats in favor percent to percent and Republicans opposed percent to percent Overall the idea was

week during a twoday visit to the state that will include a possible energy summit with California Gov Gray Davis White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters Wednesday that the states energy crisis will be at the top of the list when the president a nd the governor meet The presidents aides said that the time and place for t he meeting are still being worked out Bushs visit to the state will be his first since last falls campaign Wit h their party enjoying only a slim majority in the US House some Californi a Republicans have expressed dismay over their states absence from the presidents extensive postinaugural travel schedule fearing that the ener gy crisis could cost some GOP lawmakers their seats in next years elections Fleischers announcement Wednesday of the meeting with Davis and its emphas is on energy caught many by surprise because the White House had given no hint until then that the president would address the issue during his upcoming trip to California However Davis called the White House on Tuesday night proposing a meeting with the president specifically to discuss energy He followed up with two letters on Wednesday expressing the need for quicke r action on the energy front Californians cant afford to wait four or five years for a permanent solution We need relief today In the longer of two letters Davis wrote You and I dont agree on everything But heres something we do have in common we both inherited an energy mess And the people that elected us expect us to clean it up Davis also offered in the letters to introduce Bush to business owners a nd everyday citizens who have been personally affected by this energy crisis Fleischer said Wednesday that Bush would meet with business leaders and energy consumers Asked who initiated the meeting with Davis Fleischer suggested the presidents schedule had been drawn up independently of Davis suggestions This is a case of they both want to meet with each other and were very pleased to be able to make it work out he said As for the meeting with the business leaders Fleischer said The presiden t has several events on his schedule that already include business leaders an d energy consumers and so it very well may happen that were each suggesting similar things which would be a healthy sign Bushs itinerary also includes a stop on Tuesday at the Camp Pendleton Mari ne

government is going to be a strong partner to the state of California in th e cause of energy conservation to help ease the burden in California as they go through the summer months when demand is high and blackouts are most at risk The White House released an outline of the presidents California itinerary on Tuesday afternoon It indicated that the visit would not give prominent attention to

measure as an amendment on Thursday At th at time the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to complete work on a bi ll designed to reduce the number of blackouts expected in California this summ er due to shortages in the supply of electrical power Waxman and other Democrats seized on Republican fundraising events on Mond ay and Tuesday nights involving President Bush and Vice President Cheney charging the Republican administration with exacerbating the California situation by doing the bidding of the oil and gas industry in return for campaign contributions This is a contrived crisis in order to wreck our environmental protection laws Waxman said It is a contrived crisis in order to produce percent increases in profits for some of these generators On the agenda when the committee meets Thursday will be a bill by Rep Joe Barton RTexas that would allow California Gov Gray Davis to temporarily waive some air pollution limits to increase power production in the state when blackouts are imminent It also would include federal help to ease a power transmission bottleneck in the Central Valle y mandated power savings at federal facilities state discretion in adjusting daylight savings time an easing of the ties of some small independent power generators to larg e utilities Earlier this month a subcommittee chaired by Barton rejected Waxmans pricecap amendment as some California Republicans complained that the idea of limiting power rates was politically inspired and would do nothing to solve Californias crisis The Bush administration and the energy industry oppose price caps saying that such an approach would distort the market and worsen the electricity shortage in California and many other western states by discouraging exploration and production Waxmans plan would require federal regulators in many cases to tie wholesa le power rates to production costs plus a reasonable profit At the press conference Rep Bob Filner DSan Diego derided

Mexican Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens said yesterday that Mexico wont s et any limit on the number of power plants in Baja California supplying electricity north of the border Since theres a window of opportunity here because of the need in Californ ia for electricity anyone who requests a permit will get it Martens said after speaking at the Institute of the Americas th annual Latin American Energy Conference in La Jolla Power plant construction in Baja California has become one of the most immediate solutions to Californias electricity shortfalls At least three plants being built in Baja California in the next four years will send electricity north of the border where blackouts have interrupted normal activity One facility a Sempra Energy Corp power plant near Mexicali will export all of its electrical output to consumers north of the border The San Dieg o companys project gained quick approval from Mexican authorities because th e facility is not subject to restrictions imposed on private companies that supply electricity to the Mexican market Other Mexican energy officials have said several other enterprises are interested in building similar facilities in Baja California Such a mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the border that the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and public health and safety In his speech Martens emphasized Mexicos commitment to preserving the environment and local communities But afterward he said Mexico will approve any number of Baja California projects to serve California consumers I dont see any limit The only limit is the ability of the interconnectin g lines to transmit the electricity that is produced he said With a capacity of only megawatts each the two transmission interconnections linking the electricity grids of California and Baja California will not be able to transmit all of the megawatts of electricity for the California market produced by the new Baja California plants let alone any additional facilities Sempra whose San Diego Gas Electric subsidiary owns both the interconnecting lines plans to upgrade the interconnector near Mexicali spokesman Michael Clark said yesterday The improvement will transmit electricity from Sempras plant in Baja California to the company substatio n in Imperial Valley The other connection links San Diego and Tijuana Clark said he doesnt know how the other companies building Baja California plants plan to transmit their electricity Representatives of the firms cou ld not be reached yesterday Even if the companies find a way to send electricity across the border the California grid system presents another obstacle To prepare for the possibility of more demands on the Southern California grid the Imperial Irrigation District is analyzing what capacity it has fo r transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess tariffs for the servic e Its become very important because of our proximity to Mexico said district spokesman Ron Hull The ability to transmit electricity is only one force limiting plant construction in Baja California Another is the supply of fuel to drive the facilities Sempra again is a key player in this area It plans to build a North Baja Pipeline that will supply natural gas to its own and two other power plants in Baja California and the proposed Otay Mesa plant in San Diego The pipeline wont provide fuel for any other facilities Its fully subscribed said Clark In the future if there is enough demand the compression could be increased Energy Secretary Martens however hinted at the possibility of new natural gas supplies in Baja California He said Mexico wants liquified natural gas facilities to be built in Rosarito Beach and Ensenada While several companies have expressed an interest in such an operation Martens comments were the first to indicate that two and not one might b e approved for Baja California Potential governor candidate launches Northern

what will be coming down the pike As the states energy problems worsen as the state throws its surplus down a rathole as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across th e state someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on the ballot It will do two things First it will undo the deregulation of the states energy industry It wil l try to put everything back the way it was Second it will punish the producers of power and energy It will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a publ ic utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirely Huge amounts of money will be spent against it Opponents will outspend supporters by a substantial amount TV ads will run constantly predicting dire consequences if the initiative is approved Well be told it will be bad for business Labor leaders will tell us that it will cost jobs Experts will say it will have no effect on the problem or make the problem worse All of that will probably be true The initiative will pass easily It will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood a s the two main causes of the current energy crisis a badly bungled deregulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers It will pass because the initiatives authors will understand that most of us are furious about the way this mess was created and that were eager to tak e it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains It will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldnt are the people who got us into this disaster in the first place and we won t believe them Its much harder to say whether the energy crisis will have more immediate political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame fo r the problem such as the state Legislature and Gov Davis who could have done something about this a year ago and chose not to Yes the latest polls make it clear that Californians are furious with Davi s and the Legislature But elections for office are not yesno propositions you dont get to vo te up or down on Davis They are a contest between two major party candidates which means election s are always a matter of comparisons Davis compared with his opponent Someone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job bett er than Davis There might indeed be such people Its unlikely one of those people will appear on the ballot in however The current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in discouragement people who fearful of losing lack the nerve to run against a wellfinanced incumbent The great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that problem rather than being stuck with a wellfinanced incumbent wed for ce him out of office In reality were stuck with the wellfinanced incumbent until his term limits are up in six or eight years That does nothing to solve the problems that might arise in those six to eight years It has done nothing to embolden wouldbe candidates Now they just meekly wait their turn And it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the Capitol with people who dont know what theyre doing only where theyre going next Meanwhile the people who do know what theyre doing have been kicked out office Its no coincidence that the deregulation mess was made in a Legislature fu ll of people elected

and then hour notices of probable blackout scenarios Administration officials said the twoday notice would go to law enforcement while everyone would get a hour warning Business groups welcomed the executive order We need to plan we need to make adjustments in business schedules said Jeanne Cain vice president for government relations for the California Chamber of Commerce There are concerns about employee safety issues The more notice we have the better we can accommodate the blackout Carl Guardino an ISO board member and president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group has been pushing for an advanced notification plan and working with the governor Sixty minutes is twice as good as minutes he said With little doubt that blackouts will hit this summer lawmakers have been searching for a way to make them easier on residents and businesses As much notice as possible would be helpful Its helpful to have some advance notice for planning purposes but small businesses will still be hu rt by the blackouts said Shirley Knight assistant state director of the National Federation of Independent Business Most small businesses are in the service sector so theyre open during the day which means smallbusiness owners arent going to be able to recoup those blackout costs like a manufacturer might be able to Knight said But one consumer group said Davis should be doing more to stop the blackout s from happening in the first place Its like saying youre going to know a half hour earlier that an earthqua ke is coming said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights We should be stopping blackouts by standing up to the energy generators rather than giving us an extra minutes POWER WATCH The Independent System Operators proposed plan for forecasting potential blackouts envisions a system that would provide a hour notice of high demand days A Power Watch would be declared whenever a Stage or Stage alert is likely while a Power Warning would be issued whenever there is at least a percent chance of a Stage alert when electricity reserves dro p below percent Until now the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes warning of blackouts saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a lastminute purchase of power could stave off blackouts Pacific Gas and Electric Co said it would welcome the advance notice to be able to notify customers who rely on electricity for lifecritical equipmen t and large businesses We welcome advance notice from the ISO that would allow us to communicate to customers about pending rotating outages said Ron Low a spokesman for PGE The public safety aspect must be taken into account said one consumer grou p Blackouts have serious consequences not just economic said Mindy Spatt spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco They create public safety hazards and all of those issues cannot be addressed from warnings But knowing in advance is better EMAIL ALERTS The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most current information about how much electricity is being used and how much i s available It will also establish a system this summer through which that information can be sent in an hourly email This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan their operations Enlightening advice to prepare for blackouts Heres some advice from PGE a nd local utilities about how to prepare for blackouts Have a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available If you light candles observe the usual safety precautions If the lights go out check with neighbors to determine if your home alo ne is affected It may be a downed power line or some other problem in which case you should alert PGE or your city electrical bureau Unplug or turn off all appliances TVs and computers Leave one light on to warn you when the power comes back on When the power returns turn one appliance on at a time to prevent power surges Dont plug a generator into the wall when the lights return it can sen d a highvoltage current through the system that can electrocute power worker s Dont open your refrigerator so your food will remain cold Tell children who are home alone to remain calm turn off the TV and computers and not to use candles Chronicle staff writer Greg Lucas contributed to this

but a lot of others are given lower ratings when people are asked to rank how the politicians and institutions are handling the states energy situation said Mark DiCamillo director of the Field Poll Growing worries about the seriousness of the power problem have sent rating s skidding for anyone connected with the energy business Everyone has gotten tarred DiCamillo said A solid percent of those surveyed believe that Pacific Gas and Electric Co and the states other private electric utilities have done a poor or ve ry poor job with the energy problem with outofstate power providers ranked almost as low But percent also put Bushs efforts in the poorvery poor category and percent consigned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to the same level The growing disdain for the federal energy program probably can be linked with the presidents refusal to back limits on energy prices which are supported by a wide range of California residents DiCamillo said To the extent that federal officials are seen as not bending on that issue he said I suspect that their ratings will continue to be rather dismal The survey showed that Davis has had some success in his attempt to deflect the blame for Californias energy woes from his office but there are indications that that strategy may not work forever Although percent thought the governor was doing a good or very good job with the

the energy crunch More than percent believe it will be a year or mor e before the energy crisis is resolved and more than half are convinced it will take at least two years to ensure a steady supply of electricity The gravity of the situation is such that the public is bracing itself for a long haul DiCamillo said The state hasnt been able to fix the problem in a hurry and people dont believe its going to happen The survey also showed that nearly half the states residents believe that PGEs bankruptcy will make it harder to continue to supply electricity to its customers while percent say it

from a proposal being considered by Gov Gray Davis that would pa y owners of backup generators to produce electricity The proposal one of several options the governor is considering would pay for diesel power which at its dirtiest is times more polluting than the cleanest natural gas power plants when electricity supplies are stretched If backup generators were to be used it would only be as a last resort t o avoid blackouts said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar Unfortunately we are in an emergency situation Everything is on the table Californias persistent power shortage has led to rolling blackouts around the state several times this year with more anticipated when hot summer weather prompts people to use air conditioning If all of the states backup generators ran full time they would produce about tons of nitrogen dioxide per day Thats more than nine times the pollution power plants produced on an average day in according to sta te Air Resources Board data And the state would get only about megawatts of electricity barely percent of the states peak power needs from the backup generators That would be enough to power about homes They could have a huge negative effect on air quality said Ellen Garve y executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management Agency Its on e thing to run these generators during blackouts and emergency conditions bu t using them for other purposes could be devastating Business groups that support the proposal include the League of Food Processors the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and San Diego Gas Electric These generators could go a long way to taking some demand off the electr ic grid and putting some supply back into the power system said Gino DiCaro spokesman for the manufacturers and technology association Most of the states backup generators are small units that run on diesel fuel and lack pollution controls Some are rentals and others can b e found at hospitals office buildings sewage treatment plants and universit y labs Unlike backup generators intended for home use which are not regulated industrialsized units are limited in the number of hours they can operate But since the

Oildale Energy a small natural gasfired power plant on the citys gritty northeast edge Th e clamor of machinery and trucks sounds that meant prosperity here is gone Employees have painted Oildales machinery insulated the boilers and tweaked the motionless ton turbine Now they wait Its kind of like a skeleton says plant manager Mike Pankratz surveyi ng the octopustangle of pipes and tanks Choked by the million Pacific Gas Electric Co owes it Oildale shut down Feb taking its megawatts of badly needed electricity with it T he hush here is the sound of small generators locked in one of the most seriou s issues of Californias energy crisis one that state regulators plan to wrestle with today Oildale is part of a growing legion of small generators from geothermal to gasfired cogeneration plants battling Californias utilities and state price controls they say are crippling them These small generators owed about billion supply up to a third of Californias electricity At least have sued Southern California Edison over unpaid bills Four ha ve sued PGE And PGEs bankruptcy proceedings in San Francisco are clogged with motions from at least small generators including Oildale In many cases these companies want to end their longterm supply contracts with th e utilities so they can sell their electricity on the more lucrative open market What this is basically is the revolt of the mice said Bill Short wit h Ridgewood Power Management a New Jersey firm that has shuttered three gasfired generators in California and sued PGE Officials to weigh debt The companies are hoping for action from the California Public Utilities Commission which is scheduled today to weigh whether to order the utilitie s to pay the back debt Meanwhile US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali wades through motions filed by disgruntled generators and counter motions from PGE The deteriorating finances of some of the approximately small generator s threatens Californias fragile power supply just as the state heads into th e summer months up to megawatts short The deep and often unexpected economic impacts of Californias energy crunc h add up daily In Oildales case the shutdown not only jeopardizes the jobs of its anxious employees but those of more than employees at the refinery next door Its one of the biggest public policy botches in the energy crisis some energy experts argue California is shooting itself in the foot by not attending to the relatively clean and efficient small power suppliers in it s own back yard they say Gasfired cogeneration plants which provide powe r to nearby businesses and sell electricity to utilities are some of the mos t efficient producers in the state And many of the small generators harness renewable resources like the sun and garbage fumes lessening the states dependence on highpriced natural gas The idea that were refusing to step in and help them while were paying through the nose to pay Dynegy and Williams and everybody else this is jus t nuts said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute mentioning companies that own major power plants in the state This is really a major blunder The immediate crisis started in late January Oildales Pankratz explained Thats when PGE told the plant it was not going to pay for electricity delivered in December The news worried Oildales gas supplier Pankratz said which halted the plants supply Pankratz turned off the plants turbine The move socked Golden Bear Oil Specialties the refinery that looms over Oildale Unable to operate without the cheap steam heat Oildale supplies Golden Bear cannot heat the asphalt and industrial oils it produces Golden Bear filed for bankruptcy April Last week it announced plans to lay off employees Golden Bear Chairman Carl Soderlind said Oildale Golden Bears exclusive source of steam heat for nearly years was a key reason his group bought the refinery four years ago Having it go under was gutwrenching he said Power unavailable The California Independent System Operator keeper of the states electrici ty grid reports that megawatts of power from small generators are off line It estimates that about half of that megawatts or energy for as many as homes is due to the financial squeeze of natural gas prices money owed by the utilities or both Others say financial problems have megawatts off line Lawmakers havent been much help The state Assembly on March rejected a hastily crafted rescue bill meant to help buttress these companies The iss ue has languished in Sacramento Days later the utilities commission ordered Californias utilities to pay the generators for electricity delivered in the future which saved many of them but it did not order the utilities to pay the hefty backdue amount s It also set a new rate for what utilities should pay the generators for electricity That price is percent lower and too low for business some argue The commissions position has been that the small generators should abide b y their existing contracts said commission attorney Gary Cohen To the extent that some of them are facing financial hardship the commission may take a look at whether it can do anything to help them visavis the back debt The lack of stronger action to support these generators baffles some critic s Its like talking to a starving man on a desert island and saying How long can you hold up until the ship comes said V John White director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies Some of the companies have appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission but regulators are waiting to see if the state and the courts c an resolve the issue Were in what essentially amounts to an abusive relationship said Shor t with Ridgewood the independent generator that has sued PGE Two courts have allowed generators fighting Edison to suspend their contracts Five have lost their fights Another five have won the right to put a lien on Edisons assets In PGEs battle three of the four lawsuits are on hold because of the bankruptcy In the fourth a judge allowed a generator out of the contract it had terminated before the bankruptcy As for Oildale it wants PGE to pay the million it owes or Oildale wants to sell its electricity on the open market It also wants PGE to pay what it calls a fair market value for its electricity If Oildale cant sell on the open market soon it will be forced into bankruptcy its attorneys argue Pankratz estimates his plant can hang in limbo only three more months PGE is fighting to keep its small generators which it says are exaggerati ng their damage It reports that only a tiny fraction of its generators ar e off line Increased costs If the plants were released from their contracts PGE could not afford to pay the extra million per month it estimates electricity would cost T he state Department of Water Resources and ultimately ratepayers would have to foot that bill A fast solution isnt likely from the bankruptcy court The judge has made it clear the generators raise a host of complicated legal questions Meanwhile the clock ticks Weve all been a little tense says Judy Andreatta who has worked Oildales front desk for years and worries about her job Its just so scary watching everything happen Whod ever think wed lose power Electricity notebook FERC may renew price caps May From Register wire services Federal regulators this week announced that they might reimpose caps on the cost of transporting natural gas into southern California The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday gave the public days to comment on the possibility of reinstating caps which were temporarily suspended by the commission this year The price controls were lifted in an effort to expand the reach of deregulation This proposed action said Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif could make a real difference Since FERC engaged in this experimental lifting of the cap the price of natural gas in Southern California has climbed to three times higher than t he rest of the nation said Feinstein Currently she said the price in Southern California is per million British Thermal Units and only in the rest of the Western region Gas fuels most electricitygenerating plants in the state The commission also asked for comment on whether the caps should be limited to California or include other Western markets Legislators search for a Plan B for Edison Davis tack is politically volatile The aim still is to steer clear of bankruptcy May By HANH KIM QUACH and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO Lawmakers this week will seek to swap the deal Gov Gray Davis made to rescue the states No utility from financial ruin with something more politically palatable Davis deal some have complained is sweeter for Southern California Ediso n than for taxpayers So at least four proposals are being floated to supplan t that plan But legislators are far from a consensus on any of them Plans emerge recede and are reconfigured daily Energy experts and bankruptcy lawyers warn that too much legislative fiddli ng could result in what neither side wants bankruptcy for Edison Bankruptcy means the state would be stuck buying energy until both Edison a nd Pacific Gas Electric which is already in bankruptcy complete the Chapter process which could take years experts and lawmakers said The states wallet would shrink affecting its ability to build schools and roads Ratepayers might be on the hook for an additional billion for the companys legal fees because bankruptcy would freeze its assets said Bria n Bennett vice president of Edison International the utilitys parent company Southern California Edison has said its willing to be flexible on the governors plan which calls for the state to buy Edisons transmission gri d for billion Company officials wouldnt comment on the various alternatives We understand that the transmission deal is the subject of controversy and are open to variations on it Bennett said Steve Maviglio Davis spokesman said the governor also remained committed to his deal Edison is going to survive said Mitch Wilk a member of the state Publi c Utilities Commission from through and a past president of the agency But the question is whether it will survive via the plan that th e governor negotiated or they do the same kind of thing PGE did There is still a very real risk that SCE will be forced into bankruptcy if the Legislature tinkers too much with the deal or fails to move ahead promptly Wilk said PGE chose to file Chapter last month because it was dissatisfied with t he progress of negotiations with Davis on a state rescue of the company PGE s move was an embarrassment for Davis who had vowed to keep the states big utilities solvent One of the principal chips Edison has with the state is not filing for bankruptcy said Ed Feo a lawyer involved with the PGE case It would be a black eye for the state As long as the company stays out of bankruptcy they have something to trade Edisons creditors are still waiting to see how the utility fares with the Legislature Some have agreed to defer receiving payments until the end of June Dean Vanech president of New Jerseybased Carson Cogeneration said a lot of things need to happen before he and other creditors feel ready to drag Edis on into bankruptcy In general we would have to feel like there was absolutely no hope in a deal being made Vanech said But he admitted theres a concern that a resolution will not be put on the table in any reasonable period of timeMeanwhile Edison has vigorously lobbied the Legislature to approve the transmission deal The company has launched a publicrelations campaign to persuade the public that it is in its interest said John Bryson chief executive of Edison International Bankruptcy is a last resort Bryson said in a recent interview We believe there will be a solution But changes are necessary said Senate Leader John Burton DSan Francisco because people didnt like Plan A Lawmakers cringed at some elements of the plan which many thought was over ly generous to Edison limiting investigation of the utilitys parents compan y and guaranteeing the company an percent annual return on investment Alternatives include requiring power generators to accept up to onethird less than the collective billion theyre owed taxing Edison on its property and using the tax to pay off its debts and allowing Edison to bui ld more power plants The latest proposal would require the state to sell bond s to pay off Edisons debts and give the state the option to buy the transmission lines later Most of the proposals would require an extra surcharge on ratepayers bills to pay off debts One hurdle the legislature faces rallying twothirds of each house behind one plan necessary any time the state spends money Republicans have been philosophically opposed to acquiring transmission lines and half the alternatives include that element But Stanford University professor James Sweeney thinks compromise is possible Lawmakers and the utility will strike a deal simply because a second bankruptcy would tarnish the image of the states political leaders Sweeney believes however the outcome might be more fair in court Bankruptcies are messy but so is the political process Sweeney said Were in a situation where the leadership politically seems not willing to bite the bullet It may be better for our state to have a bankruptcy judge who is very strong and who isnt planning for a higher office Long Beach obtains lien on Edisons assets The city is the fourth small supplier with an attachment on the utility May By KATE BERRY The Orange County Register The city of Long Beach became the fourth small power supplier to get a lien against the assets of Southern California Edison a move that could push th e utility closer to bankruptcy Last week Edison was ordered to freeze at least million in bank account s to cover payments owed to Long Beach for power Edison bought from the city s trashtoenergy plant Getting a lien on the utilitys assets ensures the city will be paid even if the utility files for bankruptcy Stephen Pickett Edison Internationals general counsel said the utility plans to appeal Long Beach also is suing Edison International the utilitys parent company for breach of contract claiming the utility should not have transferred billion to its parent company over a fouryear period beginning in wh en deregulation was implemented Edison International was required to honor the debts of its subsidiary said Robert Shannon Long Beachs city attorney So far Edison has been sued by small power suppliers known as qualifyi ng facilities or QFs The lawsuits either seek to put a lien on the utilitys assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate year contracts to provide power to Edison Edison owes QFs about billion and is trying to combine the cases before a single judge in Los Angeles But Long Beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay in its contract with Edison We just want to be paid under our contract We still want to deliver them power said Shannon As a municipality Long Beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a lien as the other QFs must Ed Feo a lawyer for wind solar and biomass QFs said liens on Edisons assets could have a domino effect Two things will accelerate a bankruptcy filing by Edison Either the deal to sell its transmission lines to the state is going nowhere and alternative s are not acceptable or if attachments are made to the companys property that the utility doesnt want to run the risk of losing Three other QFs have posted bonds to obtain liens against Edison They include Caithness Energy which got a lien on Edisons percent interest in two qualifying facilities that make up the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev IMC Chemicals a unit of IMC Global Inc of Northbrook Ill and that won a million lien and Herber Geothermal Co and Second Imperi al Geothermal Co which is owned by Covanta Energy Corp a former unit of Ogden Corp based in Fairfield NJ Poll in state favor nuclear power

The last time the Field Institute polled Californians about nuclear energy was five years after the accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvan ia and it found percent opposed to nuclear power In my interpretation the current energy crisis has some bearing on the publics changed attitudes on nuclear power said Mark DiCamillo spokesma n for the nonpartisan polling organization The public is searching for clean ways to add to the capacity The Field poll comes as the Bush administration pushes for a renewed look a t nuclear power No utilities have ordered any new nuclear power plants in th e United States since The poll of California adults was taken May The margin of erro r was plus or minus percent Carl Zichella the Sierra Clubs regional staff director said Californians have not thought about nuclear energy for about years and do not have as much information as they did around Three Mile Island I think this number really reflects a lack of knowledge on the part of the public about the problems that drove nuclear power underground he said The more people know about nuclear power the less theyre going to like it Getting a new nuclear plant built faces two major problems

Franciscobased Bechtel Enterprises Holdin gs Inc today filed an Application For Certification AFC with the California Energy Commission CEC for its proposed Russell City Energy Center in Hayward Calif The filing marks the beginning of an extensive CEC licensi ng process required to build and operate an electricity generating facility in California The filing included a request for expedited review that would reduce the licensing review process period from months to months The proposed Russell City Energy Center would be a megawatt natural gasfired combinedcycle electric generating facility located on approximately acres of land zoned heavy industrial at Enterprise Avenue in Hayward The site is adjacent to the city of Haywards wastewate r treatment plant which would supply recycled water to the Energy Center Th e Russell City Energy Center would provide needed electricity for Hayward western Alameda County and the San Francisco Peninsula The modern technology used at the facility would allow for a greater than percent reduction of certain emissions and is percent more fuelefficient compared to older gasfueled facilities in the Bay Area The Russell City Energy Center will provide a vital new source of clean reliable electricity in the region said Curt Hildebrand vice president a nd general manager of the CalpineBechtel Joint Development We look forward to working with the City of Hayward Alameda County and the California Energy Commission to develop a model Energy Center Submittal of the AFC represents the culmination of more than six months of extensive engineering technical and environmental studies We are hopeful that the considerable groundwork that we have laid thus far will make this project eligible for the six month CEC review process Hildebrand added We are seeking the expedited review to do everything we can to help solve the states energy crisis as quickly as possible Once the CEC determines that the application is complete and determine whether the project qualifies for the expedited review process the officia l review will begin As lead agency the CEC will work with environmental an d government agencies in conducting its review and will hold local workshops and hearings to encourage community participation The expedited review process would require the same environmental and technical standards as the longer review period Based upon the successful licensing of the project construction could begin in summer of with commercial operation by summer of Copies of the AFC filings will be available through the CEC and

May Xinhua via COMTEX Governor of California Gra y Davis on Tuesday signed a bill to speed up the process of approving construction of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage California is in a war with energy producers and the best longterm weapo n is to build more power plants Davis said at a signing ceremony in Elk Grove California The bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power plant as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals Davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the process right now including a megawatt plant in Palm Springs and a gas storage project in Lodi that will store up to billion cubic feet of natu ral gas California has been suffering from a power crisis since last year which ha s caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling The crisis is largely blamed on the deregulation law that forces the utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than they charge the customers And the repairs of generators in some power plants an d the warming weather have made things worse After the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power anymore the state government has used more than billion dollars of tax money so far this year to buy electricity on behalf of them Among other measures to ease the power shortage the state government has called for residents to conserve electricity as much as they can especially durin g the peakhours during the dayResidents have been told to brace for a worse

huge refunds But the whole house hasnt been built Lockyer said in an interview with ANG Newspapers The attorney general said the probe he expects to complete in the next eigh t weeks also may yet yield criminal charges which could result in power company officials being locked up with my tattooed dude Lockyer a former East Bay legislator rattled electricity suppliers earlie r this week when he told the Wall Street Journal I would love to personally escort Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay to an x cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey Houstonbased Enron like other energytrading firms has denied wrongdoing in the California market It dismissed Lockyers comment as not warranting a response butquietlyprotested to the Davis administration Other power companies have expressed outrage I was trying to convey a message to the outofstate energy generators Lockyer said I decided to make the point with the energy generators that theyve got a serious fight on their hands The attorney general however conceded he has felt guilty about it ever since because Im a prosecutor and I take pride in being careful about thes e sorts of accusations or claims But I know it wont be in print unless I find some sort of colorful way to pump up the rhetoric he said We dont care if theyre multimillionaires We dont care if they run big corporations Theyre buccaneers Theyre ripping us off Now while were still in the legal analysis of whether its legal or illegal greed its clearly immoral Theres no debate about that Lockyer said his investigators are scrutinizing tens of thousands of transactions and hundreds of thousands of documents to determine the streng th of the states case I think there is strong evidence that lays the foundation for a successful civil action but the whole house hasnt been built Lockyer said A civil case could result in refunds that disgorge the obscene profits h e said The California Independent System Operator which manages the states electric transmission grid estimates that power suppliers may have overcharged California by billion since early last year The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has so far tentatively ordered California suppliers to make only tens of millions of dollars in refunds as part of that agencys ongoing probe Lockyer said criminal charges will be filed if investigators find that company officials intentionally engaged in unfair business practices The attorney general said he hopes to complete the work within the next eig ht weeks despite what he called stalling tactics such as those by three energy firms Reliant and Dynegy of Houston and Mirant of Atlanta The three companies agreed Tuesday to surrender copies of internal document s that had been subpoenaed two months ago by Lockyer as part of the probe Theyve been throwing anhour lawyers at us in high volume to drag their feet and stall our investigation Lockyer said The attorney generals comments come amid a flurry of lawsuits and allegations by California officials against power suppliers as well as ongoing probes Besides the attorney and FERC the Legislature state Public Utilities Commission CalISO and the California Electricity Oversight Board are all conducting investigations by MediaNews Group Inc and ANG Newspapers

relieve Californias overloaded electricity grid this summer by paying businesses to run their highpolluting backup generators in advance of anticipated blackouts a top energy adviser to the governor s aid Wednesday The backup generators will help us get through the summer said S David Freeman who recently resigned as general manager of the Lo s Angeles Department of Water and Power to lead Davis drive for energy con servation Freeman said he would leave it to Davis to disclose details of the plan The governor will announce what hes going to do he said Wedn esday in a wideranging interview on energy issues with The Bee Roger Sal azar the governors deputy press secretary would not confirm when or whet her Davis would make such an announcement I dont know that the governor has signed off on anything like that Salazar said Under the plan part icipating businesses would turn on backup generators and simultaneously dis connect from the electricity grid when power supplies are at Stage nea rly depleted The state would pay the companies for the muchneeded power that would be saved by converting to diesel generation Deploying dieselp owered generators the dirtiest of internal combustion engines to fore stall blackouts is another sign of the governors struggle to get more mega watts flowing through California Earlier this week Davis lowered his esti mate of the amount of new power that will come on line this summer from megawatts to megawatts A megawatt is enough power for to households The diesel plan also marks a significant turnabout in the Da vis administrations policy The governor and his appointees at the state Air Resources Board uniformly have rejected such proposals from industries utilities and the operator of the states electricity grid arguing that r outine use of the backup diesels would endanger public health San Diego G as Electric has one such proposal scheduled for a vote today by the Davis appointed state Public Utilities Commission Environmentalists who have b een catching word of the Davis plan this week argue that it would shatter t he governors repeated promises to stand firm on air quality standards duri ng the energy crisis A letter signed Wednesday by several of the states leading environmental organizations including the American Lung Associatio n of California urged Davis to reconsider Given your awareness of the p ublic health threats of diesel emissions please stop and have these propos als considered in a more thoughtful and public manner the letter states Freeman argued however that the additional health threat from nonemerge ncy use of diesel generators is marginal compared with the health and saf ety problems triggered by power outages This is a nobrainer Freeman s aid Youve got human lives at stake here This is a scary situation Fr eeman cited for example people on lifesupport systems that could go awry in blackouts But Sandra Spelliscy attorney for the environmentalist Pla nning and Conservation League countered If the health impacts are so mar ginal why has the governors own air quality enforcement agency opposed th is Industries ranging from hospitals to food processing plants and data management centers have dieselpowered generators some the size of locom otives that kick on when a storm or earthquake knocks out power Unlike dieselpowered trucks and buses most diesel standby generators run with l ittle or no pollution controls because they are intended only for emergenci es Though the latest models run cleaner and more efficiently most genera tors in use today produce about times more emissions of smogforming ni trogen oxides per megawatthour as a new natural gasfired power plant acc ording to air board engineers Further the diesels spew high amounts of br eathable soot particles that can cause cancer the engineers say Davis p lan would limit the use of the generators to days when the grid operator de clares a Stage alert meaning the power supplies are running low and roll ing blackouts may be ordered to keep the states entire grid from collapsin g according to Freeman Salazar the governors spokesman said only An y backup generation involving diesel will have to be used as a last resort to prevent blackouts Environmentalists who are trying to head off the pl an said it would have the state paying participating businesses at least cents per kilowatthour roughly three times the rate consumers typically pay for electricity Freeman would not confirm the pay rate The Davis adm inistration has offered generators willing to sell new power exclusively to the state percent discounts on the air emission credits they would need to comply with smog rules For operators of existing power plants the go vernor has agreed to have taxpayers pay the entire cost of polluting above allowable limits in order to keep the lights on The latest plan to pay co mpanies to run the dirty diesels during energy alerts further loosens the e nvironmental reins The Bees Chris Bowman can be reached at or BushDavis meeting set for energy crisis By David Whitney Bee Washington Bu reau Published May WASHINGTON President Bush will meet next week with Gov Gray Davis to talk about Californias worsening electricity crisis amid a shifting political dynamic on Capitol Hill that increasingly favors some controls on West Coast wholesale electricity prices Details f or the BushDavis meeting were still being worked out Wednesday but the fa ct that the Republican president is meeting with the Democratic governor w ho is often mentioned as a possible challenger in was seen as a sign that the White House is facing increasing political heat on the energy issu e California is a very big state said White House spokesman Ari Fleisc her It represents onesixth of the United States Its the sixthlargest economy in the world And the president is very pleased to sit and talk wit h Governor Davis Its important Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said electricity price caps will be at the top of the governors agenda for the meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday But Fleischer did not commit the president to that kind of meeting In his first visit to the state since the campai gn last year the president will spend Monday night in Los Angeles and Tues day night in Fresno Until now the White House has steadfastly refused to meet with any elected Democrat from California about the energy crisis des pite repeated pleas from the Democratic congressional delegation Price co ntrols have become the mantra of California Democratic lawmakers and a hand ful of Republicans but the Bush administration has flatly dismissed them a s counterproductive to increasing power generation in the megawattshort st ate In recent weeks however there has been a developing shift in the at titude toward price controls on Capitol Hill Bushs two nominees to the Fe deral Energy Regulatory Commission whose names were forwarded to the Senat e floor Wednesday for confirmation declined to rule out price controls onc e they are seated on the panel And the apparent decision by Vermont Sen James Jeffords to abandon the Republican Party would put Democrats in contr ol of the Senate moving Sen Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico a pricecontrol advocate to the helm of the key Senate Energy and Natural Resources Commit tee California Sen Dianne Feinstein a committee Democrat said Wednesda y that she has talked to Bingaman and that he committed to moving her legis lation to temporarily peg wholesale prices to the cost of production Four Republican House members from California have also endorsed some form of p ricecontrol legislation On Wednesday Rep Doug Ose RSacramento annou nced that he is introducing a bill that while not technically a price cap would give greater price relief for West Coast consumers than federal regu lators or the Bush administration have been willing to offer Ose chairma n of the House Government Reform Committees energy subcommittee said his bill would extend throughout the West a pricemitigation plan approved last month by the FERC But instead of that plan taking effect only during powe r emergencies as the commission directed it would operate around the clock under Oses bill to peg spot market prices at the cost of production of th e leastefficient plant selling into the California market Ose said his b ill would encourage generators to sell their power through longterm contra cts rather than on the volatile spot market I am looking for a middle gr ound Ose said The Bees David Whitney can be reached at or Energy Digest GOP unveils plan to help utility By Jim Sanders Bee Capitol Bureau Published May State Assembly efforts to develop a bipart isan proposal to help Southern California Edison pay off massive debts and avoid bankruptcy hit a dead end Wednesday when Republicans released a plan of their own The move could force Democrats to sidestep Republicans and v ote along party lines on an alternative to Gov Gray Davis proposed billion state purchase of power lines Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said Wednesdays split was necessary because there are few di fferences between the governors plan and the Democrats plan The Republi can plan rejects the notion of purchasing transmission lines or hydroelectr ic facilities Key components call for dedicating a portion of consumer ra tes to allow Edison to pay off billion in debts In return ratepayers would receive either an equity stake in future power plants or the right t o purchase electricity at discount rates Few escape blame for crisis in poll By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief Published May Utility companies and outofstate power ge nerators continue to get the lowest marks for their performance in Californ ias energy crisis but Gov Gray Davis grades have slipped dramatically o ver the past five months according to a Field Poll released Wednesday An d Californians it turns out blame plenty of people for the states power woes except themselves Every player in the power drama gets poor marks except residential energy consumers which percent of poll respondent s say are doing a good or very good job to improve the energy situation On ly percent think they are doing a poor or very poor job Public opinion of residential consumers efforts has improved since January when perc ent thought they were doing a poor job and only percent gave them high m arks The public sees themselves as conserving energy said Field Poll D irector Mark DiCamillo Thats the only positive movement in the survey For Davis who faces reelection next year the movement is far from posit ive In the January poll the Democratic governor received good marks from percent of those surveyed average grades from percent and poor rati ngs from only percent But when the Field Institute conducted its recen t poll between May and Sunday opinions about Davis flipflopped After months of energy angst a handful of power blackouts and two rate increases only percent think Davis is doing a good job while percent gave hi m failing grades The poll also shows that Californians believe the crisis will continue by an average of a year and a half well through the upcoming reelection battle All the rhetoric Davis used with some positive effec t early on is not going over well any more DiCamillo said The public is starting to view this as a longterm problem not some temporary policy sh ift Still Davis fares far better than his adversaries in the crisis President Bush Vice President Dick Cheney and the energy industry The pu blics view of energy interests which was pretty dim in January drops eve n lower in the May poll Utility companies received bad ratings from half t he public in January but percent now believe they are doing a poor or v ery poor job Outofstate energy generators whom Davis has accused of gou ging ratepayers fell from percent low ratings in January to percent in the May poll Bush the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the st ate Public Utilities Commission are not far behind drawing poor grades fro m more than half the public Cheney the architect of Bushs energy proposa l received low ratings from percent The January Field Poll did not ask about Bush and Cheney because they had not yet taken office Davis has re peatedly bashed FERC for not imposing wholesale price caps on electricity and has called Cheney grossly misinformed on the states energy problems Cheney in turn has called Davis energy proposals harebrained and goo fy The state Legislature receives poor marks from percent of those po lled while only percent believe it is doing a good job The Bees Dan Smith can be reached at or New views emerging on power More elected officials support the conc ept of planned blackouts By John Hill Bee Capitol Bureau Published May If Californians are to be left in the dark they should at least k now when to break out the candles or send the workers home Thats the gro wing sentiment among a range of elected officials including Gov Gray Davi s who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and giving business es and residents ample warning On Tuesday the Democratic governors offi ce said Davis supports longer public notice than the hours called for un der a proposal by the California Independent System Operator which runs th e states power grid Assemblyman Mike Briggs RFresno introduced a bill that would lay out a blackout schedule for the summer Businesses could ma ke plans for the possible blackout days and also be assured that on all oth er days the lights would stay on Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which every day is a potential blackout day A S enate committee meanwhile discussed planned blackouts as part of a strate gy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the state will not pay above a certain amount for power The state would ask Washing ton and Oregon to join the socalled buyers cartel If the power genera tors refused to sell at the lower prices the state would gut it out with p lanned blackouts Lets use the blackouts against the generators Michae l Shames head of the San Diegobased Utility Consumers Action Network to ld the Energy Utilities and Communications Committee But Shames and other s stressed the need for warnings of at least hours and blackouts no long er than minutes Absent that management of blackouts we dont see how the buyers cartel could work Shames said On a visit to Chicago on Mon day Davis said he talked to officials about the citys system for giving t he public warning days before possible power blackouts with definite notic e right before There is no reason to keep that secret from the public wh en their safety is likely to be jeopardized Davis told reporters Tuesday The governor said he plans to meet in the next few days with managers at I SO to explore the idea of a system like Chicagos The grid operator annou nced Monday that it will try to give the public at least a halfhour notice of outages but many officials said Tuesday the public needs even more war ning Davis aides said the governors plan will go beyond ISOs There are potential pitfalls Criminals might make their own plans taking advantage of deactivated alarms And some say that a schedule of blackouts might inc rease the number of outages If people have been warned that a blackout is coming and a lastminute supply of electricity makes it unnecessary grid managers would have to decide whether to call it off said Dorothy Rothroc k vice president of the California Manufacturers Technology Association If they did it would add uncertainty to future warnings she said possi bly leading them to order unnecessary blackouts Obviously there are tra deoffs Rothrock said Still the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way for the state to get back some control of the ener gy crisis sorely lacking in recent months It would help us as Californi ans to say The hell with you George Bush were going to handle this our selves said Jim Overman of Elk Grove Overman said he has been bu rning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyone who will listen that sch eduled blackouts will make everyones lives easier Briggs said he has bee n told by constituents including irrigators and food processors that sche duled blackouts are the way to go Irrigators would know that they shouldn t plan on getting water on a day that their electronic gates might be clos ed Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day or arran ge for backup power generators he said We would be very interested in i t said Ed Yates senior vice president of the California League of Food P rocessors Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants Yates said requiring some plants to be resterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day Some processors might choose to close on days when they f aced a blackout he said losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food It doesnt solve the problem but it helps manage a v ery difficult situation he said Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two weeks The plan would assume that a cer tain number of customers would have to turned off to keep the grid operatin g If the electricity shortage went above that amount people might still f ace unanticipated blackouts Briggs said One question is public safety S ome are queasy about burglars knowing when blackouts will occur But pluses include the ability to arrange for temporary stop signs at road intersecti ons or families being able to arrange for a sick relative to be moved I f the police have only five minutes notice they cant get to difficult int ersections to direct traffic they cant help paramedics fire departments and ambulances get where they have to be Davis said The manufacturers association and other business groups havent endorsed the idea yet but sa y its worth a look

and relax airquality standards to allow older plants to be upgraded And according to a Field Poll released Tuesday theyre not so hot on the recently approved billion bond authorization to pay fo r electricity or the idea of Gov Gray Davis seizing power plants through eminent domain Poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by respondents unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes of the states power woes Nearly percent said it essentially is an arti ficial crisis created by power companies to make money But on one longsta nding issue nuclear power the

Magavern a lobbyist for the Sierra Club People right now are obviously concerned abo ut electricity but they havent really thought about what it would be like to have a nuclear power plant in the neighborhood The Field Poll result s lend support to at least one aspect in the national energy plan recently released by President Bush who called for more nuclear power plants nation wide But poll respondents were even more insistent that the Federal Energ y Regulatory Commission should impose caps on wholesale energy prices despi te opposition from the Bush administration The poll showed percent of a ll adults and percent of registered voters including percent of Bu shs fellow Republicans support the price controls It really does exp ose the Bush administration to longterm serious

California and its electricity crisis at arms length Presiden t Bush will plunge into the problem next week during a twoday visit to the state that will include a possible energy summit with California Gov Gray Davis White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters Wednesday that the states energy crisis will be at the top of the list when the p resident and the governor meet The presidents aides said that the time an d place for the meeting are still being worked out Bushs visit to the st ate will be his first since last falls campaign With their party enjoying only a slim majority in the US House some California Republicans have e xpressed dismay over their states absence from the presidents extensive p ostinaugural travel schedule fearing that the energy crisis could cost so me GOP lawmakers their seats in next years elections Fleischers announcement Wednesday of the meeting with Davis and its emphas is on energy caught many by surprise because the White House had given no h int until then that the president would address the issue during his upcomi ng trip to California However Davis called the White House on Tuesday ni ght proposing a meeting with the president specifically to discuss energy He followed up with two letters on Wednesday expressing the need for quick er action on the energy front Californians cant afford to wait four or f ive years for a permanent solution We need relief today In the longer o f two letters Davis wrote You and I dont agree on everything But here s something we do have in common we both inherited an energy mess

Califo rnia itinerary on Tuesday afternoon It indicated that the visit would not give prominent attention to the states energy woes Fleischer declined to say whether the president would expand on his

SERVICE May WASHINGTON Accusing power generators of price gouging a group of Califor nia House Democrats vowed Tuesday to try again this week to legislate price caps in order to bring down the energy bills in the state Rep Henry Waxman a Los Angeles Democrat and author of the pricecap measu re said he would offer the measure as an amendment on Thursday At that ti me the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to complete work on a bill designed to reduce the number of blackouts expected in California this sum mer due to shortages in the supply of electrical power Waxman and other Democrats seized on Republican fundraising events on Mond ay and Tuesday nights involving President Bush and Vice President Cheney c harging the Republican administration with exacerbating the California situ ation by doing the bidding of the oil and gas industry in return for campai gn contributions This is a contrived crisis in order to wreck our environmental protection laws Waxman said It is a contrived crisis in order to produce perc ent increases in profits for some of these generators On the agenda when the committee meets Thursday will be a bill by Rep Joe Barton RTexas that would allow California Gov Gray Davis to temporarily waive some air pollution limits to increase power production in the state when blackouts are imminent It also would include federal help to ease a power transmission bottleneck in the Central Valle y mandated power savings at federal facilities state discretion in adjusting daylight savings time an easing of the ties of some small independent power generators to larg e utilities Earlier this month a subcommittee chaired by Barton rejected Waxmans pric ecap amendment as some California Republicans complained that the idea of limiting power rates was politically inspired and would do nothing to solve Californias crisis The Bush administration and the energy industry oppose price caps saying t hat such an approach would distort the market and worsen the electricity sh ortage in California and many other western states by discouraging explorat ion and production Waxmans plan would require federal regulators in many cases to tie wholesa le power rates to production costs plus a reasonable profit At the press conference Rep Bob Filner DSan Diego derided Republican o pposition to price caps Referring to wholesale power generators Filner argued They were making m oney at a megawatt now they are charging up to Believe me The y can make money off the market with a costbase rate They have done it fo r years They can continue doing it Rep

Mexican energy officials have said several other enterprise s are interested in building similar facilities in Baja California Such a mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the

Electric sub sidiary owns both the interconnecting lines plans to upgrade the interconn ector near Mexicali spokesman Michael Clark said yesterday The improvemen t will transmit electricity from Sempras plant in Baja California to the c ompany substation in Imperial Valley The other connection links San Diego and Tijuana Clark said he doesnt know how the other companies building B aja California plants plan to transmit their electricity Representatives o f the firms could not be reached yesterday Even if the companies find a w ay to send electricity across the border the California grid system presen ts another obstacle To prepare for the possibility of more demands on the Southern California grid the Imperial Irrigation District is analyzing wh at capacity it has for transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess tariffs for the service Its become very important because of our proxi mity to Mexico said district spokesman Ron Hull The ability to transmit electricity is only one force limiting plant construction in Baja Californ ia Another is the supply of fuel to drive the facilities Sempra again is a key player in this area It plans to build a North Baja Pipeline that wi ll supply natural gas to its own and two other power plants in Baja Califor nia and the proposed Otay Mesa plant in San Diego The pipeline wont provi de fuel for any other facilities Its fully subscribed said Clark In the future if there is enough demand the compression could be increased Energy Secretary Martens however hinted at the possibility of new natur al gas

energy crisis according to a Field Poll released Thursday A large number of those surveyed are also fearful that Pacific Gas Electr ics bankruptcy filing will make it more difficult for the company to provi de service to its customers Fiftyseven percent of those questioned in May by the Field Institute a Sa n Franciscobased nonpartisan polling organization gave Californias priva te electric utilities a poor rating Thats more than the percent of res pondents who rated the utilities performance as poor in January The same negative feelings held true for outofstate energy providers Fif tyfive percent of respondents this month rated their performance as poor a noticeable increase from the percent of respondents who gave them a po or rating in January Specifically those surveyed were asked to rate the job being done by offic ials and groups working to improve the energy situation in the state The poll found that The percentage of those surveyed who gave the state Public Utilities Comm ission a poor rating rose from percent in January to percent in May percent of those surveyed gave the state legislature a poor rating in May as opposed percent in January percent gave Gov Gray Davis a poor rating in May for his handling of the states energy woes a sharp increase from percent who gave him a po or rating in January The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also drew negative ratings from re spondents In May percent said FERC was doing a poor job as opposed to percent who gave the commission a rating of poor in January Those surveyed were also asked if PGEs bankruptcy

drop out of the power grid by using alternative power sources and alter natives to power sources Thats the only thing we can do in the short term In the long term you can almost see what will be coming down the pike As the states energy problems worsen as the state throws its surplus down a rathole as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across the state someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on the ballot It will do two things First it will undo the deregulation of the states energy industry It wil l try to put everything back the way it was Second it will punish the producers of power and energy It will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a publ ic utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirel y Huge amounts of money will be spent against it Opponents will outspend sup porters by a substantial amount TV ads will run constantly predicting dire consequences if the initiative is approved Well be told it will be bad for business Labor leaders will tell us that it will cost jobs Experts will say it will have no effect on the problem or make the problem worse All of that will probably be true The initiative will pass easily It will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood a s the two main causes of the current energy crisis a badly bungled dereg ulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers It will pass because the initiatives authors will understand that most of us are furious about the way this mess was created and that were eager to take it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains It will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldnt are the people who got us into this disaster in the first place and we wo nt believe them Its much harder to say whether the energy crisis will have more immediate political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame fo r the problem such as the state Legislature and Gov Davis who could ha ve done something about this a year ago and chose not to Yes the latest polls make it clear that Californians are furious with Davi s and the Legislature But elections for office are not yesno propositions you dont get to vo te up or down on Davis They are a contest between two major party candidates which means election s are always a matter of comparisons Davis compared with his opponent S omeone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job bette r than Davis There might indeed be such people Its unlikely one of those people will appear on the ballot in however The current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in disco uragement people who fearful of losing lack the nerve to run against a wellfinanced incumbent The great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that pr oblem rather than being stuck with a wellfinanced incumbent wed force him out of office In reality were stuck with the wellfinanced incumbent until his term lim its are up in six or eight years That does nothing to solve the problems that might arise in those six to ei ght years It has done nothing to embolden wouldbe candidates Now they j ust meekly wait their turn And it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the Cap itol with people who dont know what theyre doing only where theyre goin g next Meanwhile the people who do know what theyre doing have been kick ed out office Its no coincidence that the deregulation mess was made in a Legislature fu ll of people elected during the termlimit era A statewide initiative brave candidates ending term limits those are a ll things that will happen in the future Right now its time to tune in turn off and drop out Tune in to what you are doing as an individual consumer cast a critical eye at your own habits Turn off your appliances your lights your air conditioner and reduce your individual energy consumption Its much easier than it appears Energy consumption has dropped in my household by more than a third by swit ching off some lights converting to fluorescent light bulbs turning down the refrigerator and

Gov Gray Davis will issue an executive order today requiring that Californians be given at least one hours notice before blackouts hit according to a top administration official The onehour notice is double what the California Independent System Operat or managers of the states electrical grid proposed earlier this week Th e ISO board is scheduled to discuss its plan at a meeting today Details of Davis plan were still being worked out said the administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity But any plan would have to order the ISO to give more notice of potential blackouts Davis also hopes to give hour and then hour notices of probable black out scenarios Administration officials said the twoday notice would go to law enforcement while everyone would get a hour warning Business groups welcomed the executive order We need to plan we need to make adjustments in business schedules said Jeanne Cain vice president for government relations for the California Cha mber of Commerce There are concerns about employee safety issues The mor e notice we have the better we can accommodate the blackout Carl Guardino an ISO board member and president of the Silicon Valley Manu facturing Group has been pushing for an advanced notification plan and wor king with the governor Sixty minutes is twice as good as minutes he said With little doubt that blackouts will hit this summer lawmakers have been searching for a way to make them easier on residents and businesses As much notice as possible would be helpful Its helpful to have some adv ance notice for planning purposes but small businesses will still be hurt by the blackouts said Shirley Knight assistant state director of the Nat ional Federation of Independent Business Most small businesses are in the service sector so theyre open during the day which means smallbusiness owners arent going to be able to recoup t hose blackout costs like a manufacturer might be able to Knight said But one consumer group said Davis should be doing more to stop the blackout s from happening in the first place Its like saying youre going to know a half hour earlier that an earthqua ke is coming said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights We should be stopping blackouts by standing up to the energy gene rators rather than giving us an extra minutes POWER WATCH The Independent System Operators proposed plan for forecasting potential b lackouts envisions a system that would provide a hour notice of high de mand days A Power Watch would be declared whenever a Stage or Stage alert is likely while a Power Warning would be issued whenever there is at least a percent chance of a Stage alert when electricity reserves drop below percent Until now the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes warning of blackouts saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a lastminute purchase of power could stave off blackouts Pacific Gas and Electric Co said it would welcome the advance notice to be able to notify customers who rely on electricity for lifecritical equipme nt and large businesses We welcome advance notice from the ISO that would allow us to communicate to customers about pending rotating outages said Ron Low a spokesman for PGE The public safety aspect must be taken into account said one consumer grou p Blackouts have serious consequences not just economic said Mindy Spatt spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco They create public safety hazards and all of those issues cannot be addressed from war nings But knowing in advance is better EMAIL ALERTS The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most c urrent information about how much electricity is being used and how much is available It will also establish a system this summer through which that information can be sent in an hourly email This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan their

power and a lot of pollution from a proposal being considered by Gov Gray Davis that would pay owners of ba ckup generators to produce electricity The proposal one of several optio ns the governor is considering would pay for diesel power which at its dirtiest is times more polluting than the cleanest natural gas power pl ants when electricity supplies are stretched If backup generators we re to be used it would only be as a last resort to avoid blackouts said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar Unfortunately we are in an emergency sit uation Everything is on the table Californias persistent power shorta ge has led to rolling blackouts around the state several times this year w ith more anticipated when hot summer weather prompts people to use air cond itioning If all of the states backup generators ran full time they woul d produce about tons of nitrogen dioxide per day Thats more than nine times the pollution power plants produced on an average day in accor ding to state Air Resources Board data And the state would get only about megawatts of electricity barely percent of the states peak power needs from the backup generators That would be enough to power about homes They could have a huge negative effect on air quality s aid Ellen Garvey executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management Agency Its one thing to run these generators during blackouts and emer gency conditions but using them for other purposes could be devastating Business groups that support the proposal include the League of Food Proc essors the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and San Die go Gas Electric These generators could go a long way to taking some d emand off the electric grid and putting some supply back into the power sys tem said Gino DiCaro spokesman for the manufacturers and technology ass ociation Most of the states backup generators are small units tha t run on diesel fuel and lack pollution controls Some are rentals and oth ers can be found at hospitals office buildings sewage treatment plants an d university labs Unlike backup generators intended for home use which a re not regulated industrialsized units are limited in the number of hours

picks its way through the lot of Oildale Energy a small natural gasfired power plant on the citys gritty northeast edge The clam or of machinery and trucks sounds that meant prosperity here is gone Employees have painted Oildales machinery insulated the boilers and twea ked the motionless ton turbine Now they wait Its kind of like a s keleton says plant manager Mike Pankratz surveying the octopustangle o f pipes and tanks Choked by the million Pacific Gas Electric Co ow es it Oildale shut down Feb taking its megawatts of badly needed el ectricity with it The hush here is the sound of small generators locked in one of the most serious issues of Californias energy crisis one that s tate regulators plan to wrestle with today Oildale is part of a growing l egion of small generators from geothermal to gasfired cogeneration plant s battling Californias utilities and state price controls they say are cr ippling them These small generators owed about billion supply up to a third of Californias electricity At least have sued Southern Calif ornia Edison over unpaid bills Four have sued PGE And PGEs bankruptcy proceedings in San Francisco are clogged with motions from at least smal l generators including Oildale In many cases these companies want to end their longterm supply contracts with the utilities so they can sell their electricity on the more lucrative open market What this is basically is the revolt of the mice said Bill Short with Ridgewood Power Manageme nt a New Jersey firm that has shuttered three gasfired generators in Cali fornia and sued PGE Officials to weigh debt The companies are hoping fo r action from the California Public Utilities Commission which is schedule d today to weigh whether to order the utilities to pay the back debt Meanw hile US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali wades through motions filed by d isgruntled generators and counter motions from PGE The deteriorating fin ances of some of the approximately small generators threatens Californi as fragile power supply just as the state heads into the summer months up to megawatts short The deep and often unexpected economic impacts o f Californias energy crunch add up daily In Oildales case the shutdown not only jeopardizes the jobs of its anxious employees but those of mor e than employees at the refinery next door Its one of the biggest pu blic policy botches in the energy crisis some energy experts argue Califo rnia is shooting itself in the foot by not attending to the relatively clea n and efficient small power suppliers in its own back yard they say Gasf ired cogeneration plants which provide power to nearby businesses and sel l electricity to utilities are some of the most efficient producers in the state And many of the small generators harness renewable resources like t he sun and garbage fumes lessening the states dependence on highpriced n atural gas The idea that were refusing to step in and help them while were paying through the nose to pay Dynegy and Williams and everybody else this is just nuts said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute mentioning companies that own major power p lants in the state This is really a major blunder The immediate cris is started in late January Oildales Pankratz explained Thats when PGE told the plant it was not going to pay for electricity delivered in Decembe r The news worried Oildales gas supplier Pankratz said which halted the plants supply Pankratz turned off the plants turbine The move socked Golden Bear Oil Specialties the refinery that looms over Oildale Unable to operate without the cheap steam heat Oildale supplies Golden Bear canno t heat the asphalt and industrial oils it produces Golden Bear filed for b ankruptcy April Last week it announced plans to lay off employees Golden Bear Chairman Carl Soderlind said Oildale Golden Bears exclusive source of steam heat for nearly years was a key reason his group bought the refinery four years ago Having it go under was gutwrenching he said Power unavailable The California Independent System Operator keepe r of the states electricity grid reports that megawatts of power fr om small generators are off line It estimates that about half of that megawatts or energy for as many as homes is due to the finan cial squeeze of natural gas prices money owed by the utilities or both Ot hers say financial problems have megawatts off line Lawmakers haven t been much help The state Assembly on March rejected a hastily crafte d rescue bill meant to help buttress these companies The issue has languis hed in Sacramento Days later the utilities commission ordered California s utilities to pay the generators for electricity delivered in the future which saved many of them but it did not order the utilities to pay th e hefty backdue amounts It also set a new rate for what utilities should pay the generators for electricity That price is percent lower and too low for business some argue The commissions position has been that the small generators should abide by their existing contracts said commission attorney Gary Cohen To the extent that some of them are facing financial hardship the commission may take a look at whether it can do anything to help them visavis the back debt The lack of stronger action to suppor t these generators baffles some critics Its like talking to a starving man on a desert island and saying How long can you hold up until the shi p comes said V John White director of the Center for Energy Efficien cy and Renewable Technologies Some of the companies have appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission but regulators are waiting to see if the state and the courts can resolve the issue Were in what essentiall y amounts to an abusive relationship said Short with Ridgewood the inde pendent generator that has sued PGE Two courts have allowed generators f ighting Edison to suspend their contracts Five have lost their fights Ano ther five have won the right to put a lien on Edisons assets In PGEs b attle three of the four lawsuits are on hold because of the bankruptcy In the fourth a judge allowed a generator out of the contract it had termina ted before the bankruptcy As for Oildale it wants PGE to pay the million it owes or Oildale wants to sell its electricity on the open market It also wants PGE to pay what it calls a fair market value for its e lectricity If Oildale cant sell on the open market soon it will be forc ed into bankruptcy its attorneys argue Pankratz estimates his plant can h ang in limbo only three more months PGE is

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday gave the publi c days to comment on the possibility of reinstating caps which were tem porarily suspended by the commission this year The price controls

KATE BERRY The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO Law makers this week will seek to swap the deal Gov Gray Davis made to rescue the states No utility from financial ruin with something more political ly palatable Davis deal some have complained is sweeter for Southern C alifornia Edison than for taxpayers So at least four proposals are being f loated to supplant that plan But legislators are far from a consensus on a ny of them Plans emerge recede and are reconfigured daily Energy expert s and bankruptcy lawyers warn that too much legislative fiddling could resu lt in what neither side wants bankruptcy for Edison Bankruptcy means the state would be stuck buying energy until both Edison and Pacific Gas Ele ctric which is already in bankruptcy complete the Chapter process w hich could take years experts and lawmakers said The states wallet woul d shrink affecting its ability to build schools and roads Ratepayers migh t be on the hook for an additional billion for the companys legal fees because bankruptcy would freeze its assets said Brian Bennett vice presi dent of Edison International the utilitys parent company Southern Calif ornia Edison has said its willing to be flexible on the governors plan w hich calls for the state to buy Edisons transmission grid for billio n Company officials wouldnt comment on the various alternatives We und erstand that the transmission deal is the subject of controversy and are op en to variations on it Bennett said Steve Maviglio Davis spokesman said the governor also remained committed to his deal Edison is going to survive said Mitch Wilk a member of the state Public Utilities Commiss ion from through and a past president of the agency But the ques tion is whether it will survive via the plan that the governor negotiate d or they do the same kind of thing PGE did There is still a very real risk that SCE will be forced into bankruptcy if the Legislature tinkers to o much with the deal or fails to move ahead promptly Wilk said PGE c hose to file Chapter last month because it was dissatisfied with the pro gress of negotiations with Davis on a state rescue of the company PGEs m ove was an embarrassment for Davis who had vowed to keep the states big u tilities solvent One of the principal chips Edison has with the state is not filing for bankruptcy said Ed Feo a lawyer involved with the PGE case It would be a black eye for the state As long as the company stays out of bankruptcy they have something to trade Edisons creditors are s till waiting to see how the utility fares with the Legislature Some have a greed to defer receiving payments until the end of June Dean Vanech pres ident of New Jerseybased Carson Cogeneration said a lot of things need to happen before he and other creditors feel ready to drag Edison into bankru ptcy In general we would have to feel like there was absolutely no hope in a deal being made Vanech said But he admitted theres a concern that a resolution will not be put on the table in any reasonable period of timeMeanwhile Edison has vigorously lobbied the Legislature to approve the transmission deal The company has launched a publicrelations campaign to persuade the public that it is in its interest said John Bryson chief executive of Edison International Bankruptcy is a last resort Bryson said in a recent interview We believe there will be a solution But c hanges are necessary said Senate Leader John Burton DSan Francisco bec ause people didnt like Plan A Lawmakers cringed at some elements of th e plan which many thought was overly generous to Edison limiting investig ation of the utilitys parents company and guaranteeing the company an percent annual return on investment Alternatives include requiring pow er generators to accept up to onethird less than the collective billi on theyre owed taxing Edison on its property and using the tax to pay off its debts and allowing Edison to build more power plants The latest prop osal would require the state to sell bonds to pay off Edisons debts and gi ve the state the option to buy the transmission lines later Most of the pr oposals would require an extra surcharge on ratepayers bills to pay off deb ts One hurdle the legislature faces rallying twothirds of each house be hind one plan necessary any time the state spends money Republicans have been philosophically opposed to acquiring transmission lines and half the alternatives include that element But Stanford University professor James Sweeney thinks compromise is possible Lawmakers and the utility will stri ke a deal simply because a second bankruptcy would tarnish the image of the states political leaders Sweeney believes however the outcome might be more fair in court Bankruptcies are messy but so is the political p rocess Sweeney said Were in a situation where the leadership politic ally seems not willing to bite the bullet It may be better for our state to have a bankruptcy judge who is very strong and who isnt planning for a higher office Long Beach obtains lien on Edisons assets The city is the fourth sm all supplier with an attachment on the utility May By KATE BERR Y The Orange County Register The city of Long Beach became the fourth smal l power supplier to get a lien against the assets of Southern California Ed ison a move that could push the utility closer to bankruptcy Last week Edison was ordered to freeze at least million in bank accounts to cover payments owed to Long Beach for power Edison bought from the citys trasht oenergy plant Getting a lien on the utilitys assets ensures the city wi ll be paid even if the utility files for bankruptcy Stephen Pickett Edi son Internationals general counsel said the utility plans to appeal Lon g Beach also is suing Edison International the utilitys parent company f or breach of contract claiming the utility should not have transferred billion to its parent company over a fouryear period beginning in when deregulation was implemented Edison International was required to h onor the debts of its subsidiary said Robert Shannon Long Beachs city attorney So far Edison has been sued by small power suppliers known as qualifying facilities or QFs The lawsuits either seek to put a lien on the utilitys assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate ye ar contracts to provide power to Edison Edison owes QFs about billion and is trying to combine the cases before a single judge in Los Angeles B ut Long Beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay i n its contract with Edison We just want to be paid under our contract W e still want to deliver them power said Shannon As a municipality Lon g Beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a lien as the other QFs must Ed Feo a lawyer for wind solar and biomass QFs said liens on Edis ons assets could have a domino effect Two things will accelerate a bank ruptcy filing by Edison Either the deal to sell its transmission lines to the state is going nowhere and alternatives are not acceptable or if at tachments are made to the companys property that the utility doesnt want to run the risk of losing Three other QFs have posted bonds to obtain l iens against Edison They include Caithness Energy which got a lien on Edi sons percent interest in two qualifying facilities that make up the Moh ave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev IMC Chemicals a unit of IMC Glob al Inc of Northbrook Ill and that won a million lien and Herber Geo thermal Co and Second Imperial Geothermal Co which is owned by Covanta E nergy Corp a former unit of Ogden Corp based in Fairfield NJ Poll

Approval for Power Plants LOS ANGELES May Xinhua via COMTEX Governor of California Gra y Davis on Tuesday signed a bill to speed up the process of approving constru ction of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage California is in a war with energy producers and the best longterm weapo n is to build more power plants Davis said at a signing ceremony in Elk Grove California The bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power plant as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals Davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the process right now including a megawatt plant in Palm Springs and a gas storage project in Lodi that will store up to billion cubic feet of natu ral gas California has been suffering from a power crisis since last year which ha s caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling The crisis is largely blamed on the deregulation law that forces the utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than they charge the customers And the repairs of generators in some power plants an d the warming weather have made things worse After the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power anymore the state government has used more than billion dollars of tax m oney so far this year to buy electricity on behalf of them Among other measures to ease the power shortage the state government has c alled for residents to conserve electricity as much as they can especially durin g the peakhours during the dayResidents have been told to brace for a worse situation during the incoming summer From the Oakland Tribune Lockyer Probe may spark suit Criminal charges could follow evidence of price gouging By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday his invest igation of alleged multibilliondollar price gouging by power generators ha s laid the foundation for a successful civil case that could win huge refun ds But the whole house hasnt been built Lockyer said in an interview with ANG Newspapers The attorney general said the probe he expects to complete in the next eigh t weeks also may yet yield criminal charges which could result in power co mpany officials being locked up with my tattooed dude Lockyer a former East Bay legislator rattled electricity suppliers earlie r this week when he told the Wall Street Journal I would love to personal ly escort Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay to an x cell that he coul d share with a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey Houstonbased Enron like other energytrading firms has denied wrongdoing in the California market It dismissed Lockyers comment as not warranting a response butquietlyprotested to the Davis administration Other power co mpanies have expressed outrage I was trying to convey a message to the outofstate energy generators Lockyer said I decided to make the point with the energy generators th at theyve got a serious fight on their hands The attorney general however conceded he has felt guilty about it ever s ince because Im a prosecutor and I take pride in being careful about these sorts of accusations or claims But I know it wont be in print unless I find some sort of colorful way to pump up the rhetoric he said We dont care if theyre multimillionaires We dont care if they run big corporations Theyre buccaneers Theyre ripping us off Now while were still in the legal analysis of whether its legal or ille gal greed its clearly immoral Theres no debate about that Lockyer said his investigators are scrutinizing tens of thousands of transa ctions and hundreds of thousands of documents to determine the strength of the states case I think there is strong evidence that lays the foundation for a successful civil action but the whole house hasnt been built Lockyer said A civil case could result in refunds that disgorge the obscene profits h e said The California Independent System Operator which manages the states elect ric transmission grid estimates that power suppliers may have overcharged California by billion since early last year The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has so far tentatively ordered Cal ifornia suppliers to make only tens of millions of dollars in refunds as pa rt of that agencys ongoing probe Lockyer said criminal charges will be filed if investigators find that comp any officials intentionally engaged in unfair business practices The attorney general said he hopes to complete the work within the next eig ht weeks despite what he called stalling tactics such as those by three ene rgy firms Reliant and Dynegy of Houston and Mirant of Atlanta The three companies agreed Tuesday to surrender copies of internal document s that had been subpoenaed two months ago by Lockyer as part of the probe Theyve been throwing anhour lawyers at us in high volume to drag th eir feet and stall our investigation Lockyer said The

GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNS ELECTRICITY CONSUMER RELIEF LEGISLATION SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis continued his commitment to easing the burden of San Diego ratepayers by signing two major pieces of legislation designed to stabilize the cost of electricity and streamline the siting process for new power plants One of the major achievements of this years legislative session is our aggressive response to Californias energy challenge Governor Davis said My Administration did not create this problem but we are percent committed to solving it And now after a long hot summer of unconscionab ly high energy prices relief is finally on the way AB by Assemblywoman Susan Davis DSan Diego and Senator Deirdre Alper t DCoronado will stabilize the price of electricity for consumers and smal l business including schools and hospitals in San Diego at cents per kilowatthour These rates will be retroactive from June and extend to December In the short term this will ease the uncertainty of San Diego energy prices Governor Davis said When it comes to predicting their electric bills San Diego consumers have been in the dark long enough This is an urgency measure I am signing this bill today so that the PUC can take immediate action at its meeting tomorrow As a result of this legislation the average monthly bill for residential customers in San Diego will be reduced to Small businesses all school s and acutecare hospitals are included will pay an average monthly bill of Medium businesses consuming up to kilowatthours a month wou ld also have a price cap of cents per kilowatthour For large businesses AB would allow for a negotiated payment plan with SDGE over a longer period of time AB by Assemblywoman Denise Ducheny DSan Diego and Assemblyman Jim Battin RLa Quinta will help California overcome the inadequate supply of energy one of the biggest obstacles to lower energy prices by expediting the siting process for new power plants and streamlining permitting for upgrades of old facilities Restrictions and red tape have presented a powerful disincentive to those who would build more power generators in California Governor Davis said This bill will benefit consumers by increasing supply to meet growing demand It will also establish new programs to reduce demand Over the last three months Governor Gray Davis leadership has been demonstrated in his response to the San Diego electricity crisis On June he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all sta te facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity emergen cy and rolling blackouts On June he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission PUC to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the Sa n Francisco Bay area the previous day including a statewide perspective on t he price and delivery of electricity Report was completed submitted to the governor and released on August On July Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to take swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in California and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in refunds In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two Californiabased panels charged with overseeing Californias power market he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take strong measures to reduce power rates in both the short and longterm On August Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to reduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it take s new power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies Please go to briefingexecorderindexshtm to view copi es of Governor Davis Executive Orders On August Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission PUC to establish a twoyear plan that would cut electricity rates by near ly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas Electric The governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers Association that will save enough electricity to provide power to between and homes during periods of peak demand as grocers agreed to reduce power consumption by percent during Stage One emergencies On August Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton urgi ng him to expedite the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions investigation to determine whether current electric rates in San Diego were unjust On August Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release emergency funds from the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program LIHEAP to the state to help lowincome Californians pay their rapidlyrising electricity bills On August President Clinton responded to Governor Davis request by releasing million in emergency funds to help lowincome Southern Californians cope with the surge in their electricity bills The president also asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the operation of US power markets and urged the Small Business Administration to use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases On August Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on legislation to provide relief to San

issue ENERGY Lawmakers probably will decide if providers can recoup billions fro m users October By KATE BERRY The Orange County Register LOS ANGELES The Legislature likely will decide whether the states thre e investorowned utilities will be able to recoup billion from consumers for the high cost of purchasing wholesale electricity this summer a state assemblyman said Thursday at a meeting of the California Public Utilities Commission Assemblyman Rod Wright DLos Angeles told state regulators that because s o much money is at stake the Legislature is the best forum to determine whether the utilities should recover billions in electricity costs that consumers have not paid because of a rate freeze He said the Legislature will probably decide the issue but that it also could end up in court Wright is chairman of the Assembly Utility and Commerce Committee The utilities commission had no plans to vote on the issue Thursday Rathe r it held its regularly scheduled meeting in Los Angeles to give consumer groups the opportunity to voice concerns on a variety of issues ranging fr om electricity to telecommunications About a dozen groups appealed to regulators to solve Californias electrici ty crisis before prices escalate throughout the state They argued that lowincome and minority residents would be hardesthit if higher prices and the utilities billions in costs are passed on to consumers The commission the Legislature and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissio n are working to resolve before next summer the issues that brought the state to the brink of rolling blackouts this summer The unexpectedly high cost of power coupled with rate caps for most utilities in the state left utilities with a shortfall between the wholesa le price of power utilities paid this summer and what they were able to collec t from consumers under a rate freeze The states giant utilities Southern California Edison San Diego Gas Electric and Pacific Gas Electric have filed petitions with state regulators to recover at least billion Though Wright criticized aspects of the states yearold experiment with deregulation the constitution doesnt allow regulators to put the utilities in an upsidedow n situation he said Its of grave concern to the public that this commission seems more willin g to bail out the utilities than to represent consumers Doug Heller an assistant director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights told the utilities commission The commission voted Thursday on one issue of importance to about lar ge businesses throughout the state The companies which volunteered to recei ve reduced electricity rates in exchange for having their power cut during pea k periods of demand helped keep California from suffering rolling blackouts this summer On days during the summer state utilities called on large customers in voluntary programs to cut power use Many of the companies had planned to opt out of their contracts with utilities during a renewal period in November But the PUC citing a provision in the contracts voted to force the companies to remain in the contracts until March Only large industrial and commercial customers who signed up for the voluntary programs after can get out of their contracts in November Gary Fabrizi founder of Premier Utility Consultants in Laguna Niguel said few commercial customers will be affected by the decision because most can now opt out in March before the peak summer demand and the anticipation th at more emergencies will be called next summer But he said the vote limits the ability of businesses to make contracts wit h other service providers such as Enron Energy Services Inc of Houston before March That gives the large incumbent utilities such as Edison and PGE months to ramp up their programs to sell energy services to large businesses Its unclear if the commission is stalling or if theyre trying to make arrangements that coincide with other interruptible programs Fabrizi said In a related matter the commission approved an application by PGE to sell billion in shortterm debt which the utility said it needs to cover t he cost of wholesale power Edison was granted a similar request last month t o sell billion in shortterm debt The only residential customers affected have been confined to SDGE in San Diego and south Orange County Register staff writer

fund for San Diego rate payers Forwarded by Sandra McCubbinSFOEES on PM Joseph Alamo PM To Sandra ES cc Subject Gov Davis Press Release OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR L FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNS ELECTRICITY CONSUMER RELIEF LEGISLATION SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis continued his commitment to easing the burden of San Diego ratepayers by signing two major pieces of legislation designed to stabilize the cost of electricity and streamline the siting process for new power plants One of the major achievements of this years legislative session is our aggressive response to Californias energy challenge Governor Davis said My Administration did not create this problem but we are percent committed to solving it And now after a long hot summer of unconscionab ly high energy prices relief is finally on the way AB by Assemblywoman Susan Davis DSan Diego and Senator Deirdre Alper t DCoronado will stabilize the price of electricity for consumers and smal l business including schools and hospitals in San Diego at cents per kilowatthour These rates will be retroactive from June and extend to December In the short term this will ease the uncertainty of San Diego energy prices Governor Davis said When it comes to predicting their electric bills San Diego consumers have been in the dark long enough This is an urgency measure I am signing this bill today so that the PUC can take immediate action at its meeting tomorrow As a result of this legislation the average monthly bill for residential customers in San Diego will be reduced to Small businesses all school s and acutecare hospitals are included will pay an average monthly bill of Medium businesses consuming up to kilowatthours a month wou ld also have a price cap of cents per kilowatthour For large businesses AB would allow for a negotiated payment plan with SDGE over a longer period of time AB by Assemblywoman Denise Ducheny DSan Diego and Assemblyman Jim Battin RLa Quinta will help California overcome the inadequate supply of energy one of the biggest obstacles to lower energy prices by expediting the siting process for new power plants and streamlining permitting for upgrades of old facilities Restrictions and red tape have presented a powerful disincentive to those who would build more power generators in California Governor Davis said This bill will benefit consumers by increasing supply to meet growing demand It will also establish new programs to reduce demand Over the last three months Governor Gray Davis leadership has been demonstrated in his response to the San Diego electricity crisis On June he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all sta te facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity emergen cy and rolling blackouts On June he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission PUC to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the Sa n Francisco Bay area the previous day including a statewide perspective on t he price and delivery of electricity Report was completed submitted to the governor and released on August On July Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to take swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in California and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in refunds In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two Californiabased panels charged with overseeing Californias power market he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take strong measures to
