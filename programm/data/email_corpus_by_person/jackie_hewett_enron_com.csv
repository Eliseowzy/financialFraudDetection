Dianne UnruhET nron Gloria WierET nron Walt WilliamsET nron cc Subject The Room This is an old story maybe you havent heard or seen it before I thought it was worth passing on I think it will touch your heart About this story Here is some background on the author that you might be interested in Procrastinating as usual yearold Brian Moore had only a short time to write something for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes meeting It was his turn to lead the discussion so he sat down and wrote He showed the essay titled The Room to his mother Beth before he headed out the door I wowed em he later told his father Bruce Its a killer Its the bomb Its the best thing I ever wrote It also was the last Brians parents had forgotten about the essay when a cousin found it while cleaning out the teenagers locker at Teary Valley High School Brian had been dead only hours but his parents desperately wanted every piece of his life near them the crepe paper that had adorned his locker during his senior football season notes from classmates and teachers his homework Only two months before he had handwritten the essay about encountering Jesus in a file room full of cards detailing every moment of the teens life But it was only after Brians death that Beth and Bruce Moore realized that their son had described his view of heaven It makes such an impact that people want to share it You feel like you are there Mr Moore said Brian Moore died May the day after Memorial Day He was driving home from a friends house when his car went off BulenPierce Road in Pickaway County and struck a utility pole He emerged from the wreck unharmed but stepped on a downed power line and was electrocuted Brian seemed to excel at everything he did He was an honor student He told his parents he loved them a hundred times a day Mrs Moore said He was a star wide receiver for the Tearys Valley Football team and had earned a fouryear scholarship to Capital University in Columbus because of his athletic and academic abilities He took it upon himself to learn how to help a fellow student who used a wheelchair at school During one homecoming ceremony Brian walked on his tiptoes so that the girl he was escorting wouldnt be embarrassed about being taller than him He adored his kid brother Bruce now He often escorted his grandmother Evelyn Moore who lives in Columbus to church I always called him the deep thinker Evelyn said of her eldest grandson Two years after his death his family still struggles to understand why Brian was taken from them They find comfort at the cemetery where Brian is buried just a few blocks from their home They visit daily A candle and dozens of silk and real flowers keep vigil over the gravesite The Moores framed a copy of Brians essay and hung it among the family portraits in the living room I think God used him to make a point I think we were meant to find it and make something out of it Mrs Moore said of the essay She and her husband want to share their sons vision of life after death Im happy for Brian I know hes in heaven I know Ill see him again someday Mrs Moore said It just hurts so bad now The Room In that place between wakefulness and dreams I found myself in the room There were no distinguishing features except for the one wall covered with small index card files They were like the ones in libraries that list titles by author or subject in alphabetical order But these files which stretched from floor to ceiling and seemingly endlessly in either direction had very different headings As I drew near the wall of files the first to catch my attention was one that read Girls I have liked I opened it and began flipping through the cards I quickly shut it shocked to realize that recognized the names written on each one And then without being told I knew exactly where I was This lifeless room with its small files was a crude catalog system for my life Here were written the actions of my every moment big and small in a detail my memory couldnt match A sense of wonder and curiosity coupled with horror stirred within me as I began randomly opening files and exploring their content Some brought joy and sweet memories others a sense of shame and regret so intense that I would look over my shoulder to see if anyone was watching A file named Friends was next to one marked Friends I have betrayed The titles ranged from the mundane to the outright weird Books I Have Read Lies I Have Told Comfort I have Given Jokes I Have Laughed at Some were almost hilarious in their exactness Things Ive yelled at my brothers Others I couldnt laugh at Things I Have Done in My Anger Things I Have Muttered Under My Breath at My Parents I never ceased to be surprised by the contents Often there were many more cards than I expected Sometimes fewer than I hoped I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the life I had lived Could it be possible that I had the time in my years to write each of these thousands or even millions of cards But each card confirmed this truth Each was written in my own handwriting Each signed with my signature When I pulled out the file marked Songs I have listened to I realized the files grew to contain their contents The cards were packed tightly and yet after two or three yards I hadnt found the end of the file I shut it shamed not so much by the quality of music but more by the vast time I knew that file represented When I came to a file marked Lustful Thoughts I felt a chill run through my body I pulled the file out only an inch not willing to test its size and drew out a card I shuddered at its detailed content I felt sick to think that such a moment had been recorded An almost animal rage broke on me One thought dominated my mind No one must ever see these cards No one must ever see this room I have to destroy them In insane frenzy I yanked the file out Its size didnt matter now I had to empty it and burn the cards But as I took it at one end and began pounding it on the floor I could not dislodge a single card became desperate and pulled out a card only to find it as strong as steel when I tried to tear it Defeated and utterly helpless I returned the file to its slot Leaning my forehead against the wall I let out a long selfpitying sigh And then I saw it The title bore People I Have Shared the Gospel With The handle was brighter than those around it newer almost unused I pulled on its handle and a small box not more than three inches long fell into my hands I could count the cards it contained on one hand And then the tears came I began to weep Sobs so deep that they hurt They started in my stomach and shook through me I fell on my knees and cried I cried out of shame from the overwhelming shame of it all The rows of file shelves swirled in my tearfilled eyes No one must ever ever know of this room I must lock it up and hide the key But then as I pushed away the tears I saw Him No please not Him Not here Oh anyone but Jesus I watched helplessly as He began to open the files and read the cards I couldnt bear to watch His response And in the moments I could bring myself to look at His face I saw a sorrow deeper than my own He seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes Why did He have to read every one Finally He turned and looked at me from across the room He looked at me with pity in His eyes But this was a pity that didnt anger me I dropped my head covered my face with my hands and began to cry again He walked over and put His arm around me He could have said so many things But He didnt say a word He just cried with me Then He got up and walked back to the wall of files Starting at one end of the room He took out a file and one by one began to sign His name over mine on each card No I shouted rushing to Him All I could find to say was No no as I pulled the card from Him His name shouldnt be on these cards But there it was written in red so rich so dark so alive The name of Jesus covered mine It was written with His blood He gently took the card back He smiled a sad smile and began to sign the cards I dont think Ill ever understand how He did it so quickly but the next instant it seemed I heard Him close the last file and walk back to my side He placed His hand on my shoulder and said It is finished I stood up and He led me out of the room There was no lock on its doorThere were still cards to be written I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me Phil For God so loved the world that He gave His only son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life If you feel the same way forward it to as many people as you can so the love of Jesus will touch their lives also My People I shared the gospel with file just got bigger how about yours
