EEI filed May responding to the two appeals that the court accepted one filed by the New York Public Service Commission other state commissions and NARUC and the other by Enron attached pdf file Background on the litigation and a summary of the main points of the brief Listing of recent filings at FERC issue of FERC Orders analyses of significant FERC orders attached pdf file EEIs Supreme Court Brief Background The states claim that FERC exceeded its jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act when it held in Order No that it has jurisdiction over transmission when it is unbundled from a retail sale of energy as in states that have adopted retail competition Enron on the other hand argues that FERC incorrectly concluded in Order No that it lacks jurisdiction over transmission that is sold as part of a bundled retail sale of electricity as in states that have not adopted competition and still maintain the traditional service to bundled native load customers EEIs brief supports the position taken by FERC in Order No that when transmission is unbundled from the retail sale FERC has jurisdiction of the interstate transmission aspect but that where states maintain the traditional scheme of regulation involving bundled retail sales the states retain jurdicition over the bundled retail sale The main points in EEIs brief are The result in Order No is consistent with all of the language in the jurisdictional provisions of the FPA and with the legislative history of the Act While recognizing FERC jurisdiction over interstate transmission it comports with the statutory language by retaining state jurisdiction over any other sale of electric energy and maintains that which was subject to state regulation when the FPA was passed in that is bundled retail sales EEIs brief highlights the changes in the industry and the changing uses of the interstate grid Order No also recognizes and accommodates these changes We dispute the claim made by both the states and Enron that unbundling is just an accounting change that does not change jurisdiction The states argue that they always had jurisdiction over transmission when bundled and that unbundling cannot change that Enron argues that since FERC has jurisdiction over interstate transmission the accounting issue of whether it is bundled or unbundled cannot eliminate FERC jurisdiction Instead we explain that unbundling at the retail level is a necessary step to implement the fundamental policy made by states when they adopt retail competition Responding to the states we argued that when states make the policy choice to adopt retail competition unbundling of transmission from energy is necessary to implement that policy In order to allow access to transmission by competitive suppliers FERC jurisdiction over transmission is appropriate It is also consistent with the FPA proviso that states have jurisdiction over the retail sales of energy The sale of transmission service separately is not a sale of energy Responding to Enron our brief argues that to adopt Enrons argument that FERC should regulate all transmission even that in a bundled retail sale ignores six decades of history and judicial interpretation leaving to the states jurisdiction over any transmission sold as part of the retail electricity sale Congress has amended the FPA on several occsadions but has not altered the allocation of federalstate responsibility RECENT FERC FILINGS RTO DEVELOPMENTS CAISO SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC and SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON filed a joint Order No Compliance Filing RT Comments due by

<23043814.1075858446274.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,alliance@eei.org,2001-06-01 11:29:57,Alliance Info Alert FERC ActionFilingsEnergy SupplyPower Marketing Executive This Alliance Info Alert provides a summary of FERCs meeting and a listing of recent filings at FERC FERC Meeting Summary At Wednesdays Commission meeting FERC denied without discussion rehearing requests of its March order provisionally approving the GridSouth RTO and in a lastminute change removed several RTO proceedings from scheduled consideration including PJM PJM West ISONE NYISO and GridFlorida In other RTO developments Chairman Hebert announced that FERC will convene a technical conference on Function Interregional Coordination issues as initially requested by the Electric Power Supply Association among others Hebert hopes to hold the conference in either June or July In other notable action marked by Comm Masseys strong dissent on the issue of appropriate analytic method for evaluating marketbased rate MBR applications FERC accepted Sierra Southwest Cooperative Services Sierra request for MBR authority using the current hub and spoke method for which to evaluate market power concerns In a related proceeding FERC denied a request from the Illinois Commerce Commission ICC requesting that Exelon be directed to abandon the use of the hub and spoke method and commit to using another method in the year Commission Discussion Market Power Analysis Commissioner discussion centered around MBR authority and the method used to perform market power analysis The issues were raised within the context of two MBR cases approved yesterday involving Sierra and Exelon over Commissioner Masseys objections as noted below Comm Massey dissented from both orders expressing his dismay with the majoritys decision to continue the use of what he called oldfashioned hub and spoke analysis saying that the method does not produce meaningful conclusions While Massey allowed that it may be premature to decide on a particular analytic method for use in he argued that the current analysis is outdated Massey stated that the hub and spoke market share threshold is too simplistic In Masseys view the hub and spoke method makes assumptions about the market that ignore important factors producing unreliable results that do not protect ratepayers from unjust and unreasonable rates Massey was concerned that fears about high rates resulting from MBRs have been inadequately analyzed by FERC is leading to a slowdown in state restructurings Massey asserted that states are now delaying plans and others will not implement reforms as a result Massey expressed his desire for to conduct a generic inquiry into improving current standards for performing market power analysis He identified three focuses for such a proceeding look at market concentration ie scope of trade supply concentration in varying load periods explore use of computer modeling and simulation evaluate whether market rules create perverse incentives and encourage gaming of the system and ensure that adequate demand responsiveness exists to aid in putting a check on market power In addition Massey recommended that instances of price spikes and price abnormalities be investigated for identifying possible sources of volatility I n these cases Comm Breathitt pointed out that the generator dominance analysis performed concluded that the market share percentages for the applicants in the two orders are well below the market abuse and dominance levels In fact they are only and respectively Breathitt assured the ICC that it will have the opportunity to participate in the process in no matter what market power analysis is being used While supporting the two orders on market based rate authority Chairman Hebert pointed out that no party objected to Sierras receiving market based rate authority nor did any party request that FERC deny the Exelon application Hebert clarified that the Exelon order does not pick one method over the other but rather declines to commit to a particular method of market power analysis at this time RTO Seams Conference Announcing FERCs intention to schedule a technical conference on RTO seams issues Chairman Hebert stressed that seams issues are absolutely crucial to the RTO process Although a specific date has yet to be chosen Hebert stated that his hope is that it be held sooner rather than later Hebert also invited parties to submit comments on proposed dates for the technical conference Both Massey and Breathitt voiced strong support for the Chairmans decision to hold such a technical conference Other Notable Action GridSouth FERC denied the multiple requests for rehearing of its March order provisionally approving the GridSouth RTO RT Issued May PJM Interconnection FERC denied rehearing and provided clarification of its March Order establishing that the netting of station power is a wholesale function and thus FERC jurisdictional FERC agreed with New York State Electric and Gas and other utilities that third party sales of station power is a sale for enduse and should remain state jurisdictional However FERC denied requests to clarify whether generators owned by the same company may use station power from one another without the exchange being classified as a third party sale rather than as selfsupply ER EL EL Issued May RECENT

Generator Interconnection we would like to provide you with a few highlights of the past two weeks Interestingly generators are finding that the Transmission Owning TOs entities and ISOs have been lesscombative than one may have thought This is largely due to Daniel Larcamps Director of OMTR at FERC statement to the TOs that they can not hide behind the excuse that prior practice and their Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT prevent them from granting many of the reasonable requests of the generators Larcamp said in no uncertain terms that the current OATTs are not hard andfast anymore instead they are most likely going to be subject to revisions per recent FERC orders The generator group is working very well together We the Alliance of Energy Suppliers are present and very involved in all of the generator strategy sessions and industry meetings in addition to having Chuck Linderman of our Alliance on the process group This process group develops the issue lists for discussions and decides on logistics and procedures for the upcoming meetings The Alliance has also sponsored lunch for the generator group and continues to offer our offices and conference rooms to any generators that may need office space amenities during their extended visits here in Washington Procedural Schedule for Interconnection Meetings AM Llarger industry session convenes to receive direction from FERC staff on the days topics and process Break into sector caucuses ie Generators Transmission Owners TO RTOsISOs Transmission Dependent Utilities TDU and Others PM All caucus groups come together to express desired outcomes on certain issues and topics Caucus Group Working Lunches Larger groups convene to discuss individual caucus groups concerns and issues and attempt consensus Individual caucus groups meet again to discuss positions and find compromise or consensus on issues PM Plenary session to chart out next steps and topics for next meeting Positive Meeting Developments Scope of Service Generators were very successful in negotiating to receive an option for generators to have three product levels of Interconnection Service Optionality was a paramount issue for generators TOs conceded to offer the following services Energy Resource based on the PJM study process model Network Resource transmisison rights will be firm and comparable to TOs network resources Simple interconnection which allows for several options to be chosen but basic interconnection of the directly assigned facility is the minimum Queuing TOs recognized that the queue positioning issues were generator v generator issues so suggested that we offer suggestions to them as to how to structure and administer the queue Generators agreed and developed the rights and timing it wished Functions of the Queues identify order of studies identifies timing of projects for developers identifies and allocates costs responsibility Limited Consensus TOs suggested as generators had articulated that Best practices of te ANOPR be adopted as the minimum and build fro those principles So in essence queue position for all interconnection requests be based on the date the TP receives the request the Generator must meet reasonable milestones to retain position in the queue if a generator misses stipulated milestones it will be able to have a time period which to cure the deficiency But if after the reasonably agreeable time frame is exhausted if not cured the generator may be at risk for losing its place in the queue queue position may be at risk if a generator makes substantial material change material changes must be further defined by the generators Scope of Studies and Interceonnection Agreement and Procedures Outstanding Questions and Issues to be addressed in Later Session when is a generator included in the base case study or modeling when is a generator on the hook for costs time line for when a generator receives a feasibility study and that all developers should receives a feasibility study unlike the current practice where that is not the norm if a generator cancels a project that had been allocated costs for upgrades associated with its facilities who pays for the necessary upgrades if the generator drops out and does not complete the project Milestones Generators requested that milestones be tied into the progression of a construction project These milestones will include time lines and schedules The milestones will begin when a generator applies for interconnection Note TOs asked if generators could develop the milestones since they viewed them as a generatortogenerator issue As a result a group of generators joined a group of transmission owners to help develop the milestone language Drafting Team A drafting team was formed that contains representatives from each participatory group at the Interconnection meetings This group will draft consensus language for the final Interconnection document submittal This group takes daybyday issues and attempts to fashion language that represents broad consensus on these issues The language proposals are then vetted back through the individual caucus groups and voted on for later approval by the entire industry group FERC distributed a voting guide that helps categorize what is consensus and what is not Next Meetings Thanksgiving week Nov NO MEETINGS There will be no FERC Interconnection meetings for this week However the generators will have a caucus conference call on Monday Nov at AM to prepare for the following weeks meetings If you would like that call in number

Resolves Problem With Taxation of Generator Interconnections A new IRS tax ruling issued following a two to threeyear effort by EEI and its member companies will resolve a major problem related to the taxation of new independent power generators or merchant plants connecting to the grid the Institute reported this week The agencys action exempts the transfers of an independent generators interties used to connect their generation facilities to a utilitys grid from the Contributions in Aid of Construction CIAC tax on the connection if a longterm interconnection agreement exists We welcome the ruling made by the IRS commented EEI President Tom Kuhn This ruling helps break down a significant barrier to providing much needed new generation and will help to facilitate the development of a more competitive electricity market EEIs Alliance of Energy Suppliers which represents merchant generators worked closely with the Institute to achieve this important tax victory The group called it an important step in the development of an independent power sector Institute Alliance Ask That FERC Vacate or Stay November Orders With New Market Power Screen Exposure to Retroactive Refunds EEI and its Alliance of Energy Suppliers have requested that FERC vacate or stay recent orders establishing a revised market power screen and a new marketbased rate tariff condition raising a significant potential for retroactive refunds They asked that the Commission instead issue a single notice of proposed rulemaking explaining the proposals and providing interested parties a reasonable opportunity to comment upon the critical interrelated issues raised on both of these proceedings The parties motion was filed in response to two orders issued by FERC on November In the first Dockets ER et al the Commission proposed to apply a new Supply Management Assessment SMA screen to marketbased rate tariffs as they come up for triennial review and set out detailed remedial measures for applicants not passing the screen In the second Docket EL FERC effectively eliminated the refund effective date requirements with respect to specific complaints filed under section of the Federal Power Act raising a significant potential for retroactive refunds Both proceedings involve critical issues regarding the availability of marketbased rates and the potential remedies the Commission would apply in a marketbased rate context EEI and the Alliance underscored And they pointed out both proceedings introduce significant uncertainties about the continued availability of marketbased rates that are magnified when their potential cumulative and interactive impacts are considered US Appeals Court Rejects Challenges to Order Saying RTO Participation Voluntary Utility Decision A federal appeals court has dismissed challenges to FERCs Order in which petitioners asserted that the RTO initiative exceeded the regulators statutory authority and resulted from arbitrary and capricious action The court found that the challenged requirements were voluntary and that petitioning utilities failed to demonstrate that they were injured by the rule It accordingly dismissed the petitions for lack of jurisdiction A threejudge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit acted last week in a set of consolidated cases Public Utilities District No of Snohomish County Washington v FERC No et al EEI joined several member companies and other parties in challenging the regulators action In raising the challenges to FERCs December RTO rule petitioners contended that Order not only mandated informational filings as to expected RTO participation but also had the effect of mandating such participation In its decision the court specified that if RTO membership were mandatory utilities would suffer the immediate and concrete injury of involuntarily having to cede their claimed statutory rights But if membership was voluntary it went on utilities would not be involuntarily ceding any claimed statutory rights but rather voluntarily waiving them In view of our conclusion that Order does not mandate RTO participation the judicial panel concluded the court lacks jurisdiction to address the utilities challenges to the final rule House Energy Subcommittee Examines Electricity Bill While FERC is moving ahead aggressively toward a competitive wholesale electricity market legislation will help the panel reach this goal faster Commission Chairman Pat Wood stated last week on Capitol Hill The uncertainty of the lengthy transition is harming infrastructure investment and reliability and raising Americans electricity bills unnecessarily the chairman said It is time to finish the job Mr Wood offered his views as he testified before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality during legislative hearings on Chairman Joe Bartons RTX recentlyintroduced electricity bill HR The chairman intends to proceed to markup next week The subcommittee heard from a range of witnesses who have previously appeared before the panel on aspects of HR While many cited problems and reservations with particular aspects of the legislation Rep Barton strongly encouraged them to work with panel staff to address these issues indicating strongly that he intended send a bill to full committee next week FERC Commissioner Says Energy Legislation Critical Passage of comprehensive energy legislation is critical to US economic development FERC Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell commented this week Enactment of such a bill she emphasized would be the greatest economic stimulus this country would see creating certainty and stability in the energy arena and leading to the release of a pentup energy market While legislators are knowledgeable Ms Brownell observed at a National Energy Resources Organization NERO luncheon they are not as knowledgeable as the industry Accordingly she added it behooves us to work together on an energy bill Turning to Commission matters Ms Brownell said that the regulators are committed to delivering the evolving energy industry out of its ugly adolescence specifying that the agencys purpose is to ensure

and other parties at various venues last week Senate Republicans informed Majority Leader Tom Daschle DSD that they might offer a comprehensive energy bill as an amendment to the economic stimulus

energy supplies Current analysis suggests that it would result in a percent increase in consumer rates he reported Senate Environment plans a second hearing on S in two weeks This session will give industry and others an opportunity to testify on the Clean Power bill However with lawmakers considering a target adjournment date of November it appears that any future action on a multiemissions

<25481072.1075863288947.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,alliance@eei.org,2001-11-15 14:04:33,Update on FERC Interconnection MeetingsOverview Since many of you can not attend every meeting at FERC regarding Generator Interconnection we would like to provide you with a few highlights of the past two weeks Interestingly generators are finding that the Transmission Owning TOs entities and ISOs have been lesscombative than one may have thought This is largely due to Daniel Larcamps Director of OMTR at FERC statement to the TOs that they can not hide behind the excuse that prior practice and their Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT prevent them from granting many of the reasonable requests of the generators Larcamp said in no uncertain terms that the current OATTs are not hard andfast anymore instead they are most likely going to be subject to revisions per recent FERC orders The generator group is working very well together We the Alliance of Energy Suppliers are present and very involved in all of the generator strategy sessions and industry meetings in addition to having Chuck Linderman of our Alliance on the process group This process group develops the issue lists for discussions and decides on logistics and procedures for the upcoming meetings The Alliance has also sponsored lunch for the generator group and continues to offer our offices and conference rooms to any generators that may need office space amenities during their extended visits here in Washington Procedural Schedule for Interconnection Meetings AM Llarger industry session convenes to receive direction from FERC staff on the days topics and process Break into sector caucuses ie Generators Transmission Owners TO RTOsISOs Transmission Dependent Utilities TDU and Others PM All caucus groups come together to express desired outcomes on certain issues and topics Caucus Group Working Lunches Larger groups convene to discuss individual caucus groups concerns and issues and attempt consensus Individual caucus groups meet again to discuss positions and find compromise or consensus on issues PM Plenary session to chart out next steps and topics for next meeting Positive Meeting Developments Scope of Service Generators were very successful in negotiating to receive an option for generators to have three product levels of Interconnection Service Optionality was a paramount issue for generators TOs conceded to offer the following services Energy Resource based on the PJM study process model Network Resource transmisison rights will be firm and comparable to TOs network resources Simple interconnection which allows for several options to be chosen but basic interconnection of the directly assigned facility is the minimum Queuing TOs recognized that the queue positioning issues were generator v generator issues so suggested that we offer suggestions to them as to how to structure and administer the queue Generators agreed and developed the rights and timing it wished Functions of the Queues identify order of studies identifies timing of projects for developers identifies and allocates costs responsibility Limited Consensus TOs suggested as generators had articulated that Best practices of te ANOPR be adopted as the minimum and build fro those principles So in essence queue position for all interconnection requests be based on the date the TP receives the request the Generator must meet reasonable milestones to retain position in the queue if a generator misses stipulated milestones it will be able to have a time period which to cure the deficiency But if after the reasonably agreeable time frame is exhausted if not cured the generator may be at risk for losing its place in the queue queue position may be at risk if a generator makes substantial material change material changes must be further defined by the generators Scope of Studies and Interceonnection Agreement and Procedures Outstanding Questions and Issues to be addressed in Later Session when is a generator included in the base case study or modeling when is a generator on the hook for costs time line for when a generator receives a feasibility study and that all developers should receives a feasibility study unlike the current practice where that is not the norm if a generator cancels a project that had been allocated costs for upgrades associated with its facilities who pays for the necessary upgrades if the generator drops out and does not complete the project Milestones Generators requested that milestones be tied into the progression of a construction project These milestones will include time lines and schedules The milestones will begin when a generator applies for interconnection Note TOs asked if generators could develop the milestones since they viewed them as a generatortogenerator issue As a result a group of generators joined a group of transmission owners to help develop the milestone language Drafting Team A drafting team was formed that contains representatives from each participatory group at the Interconnection meetings This group will draft consensus language for the final Interconnection document submittal This group takes daybyday issues and attempts to fashion language that represents broad consensus on these issues The language proposals are then vetted back through the individual caucus groups and voted on for later approval by the entire industry group FERC distributed a voting guide that helps categorize what is consensus and what is not Next Meetings Thanksgiving week Nov NO MEETINGS There will be no FERC Interconnection meetings for this week However the generators will have a caucus conference call on Monday Nov at AM to prepare for the following weeks meetings If you would like that call in number please email Chuck Linderman at Tonja Wicksvcf

PostMeeting Memo for October Highlights At Wednesdays Commission meeting generators scored a major victory with the Commissions order setting a new interim generator interconnection pol icy whereby transmission owners must pay interest to generators for interc onnection costs for system upgrades needed to interconnect Commissioner M assey although supporting the order only on an interim basis said that if the generator is going to used as a bank it should be paid interest Chairman Wood continues to be uncomfortable with generators being the ban k The remainder of the meeting focused on establishing processes for continu ed development of RTOs Within that framework the Commissioners discussed the status of the Southeast Northeast and Midwest RTOs Chairman Wood a lthough joking of the less than pleasant comments made by the Chairman of the Maryland Public Service Commission Catherine Riley and many other st ate commissioners at last weeks RTO Conference acknowledged that the FER C took heed to the state commissions concerns and will involve state comm issions in the decisionmaking process and formation of the RTOs going for ward To back that up Commissioner Brownell proposed the creation of a r egional panel consisting of state commissions and FERC staff This new pa nel will offer a forum for all regulatory bodies to provide input in the R TO process Commissioner Brownells proposal was supported by all three co mmissioners although Commissioner Massey expressed a little reservation It seems that the Commissioner is taking steps in that direction by conven ing the Western Infrastructure Adequacy Conference to be held during the W estern Governors Association Meeting in Seattle WA on November This c onference too was aimed at strengthening relationships with the states a nd involving them in the decisionmaking process In addition the Commission extends bid caps for the ISO NE and NY ISO mar kets addresses the issue of costs responsibility for interconnections and allows virtual bidding in the NY ISO realtime market These and other proceedings are reported below If you would like copies o f any orders please contact us Commission Discussion FERC Orders Transmission Providers to Pay Interest to Generators for Syste m Upgrades It is clear that the Commission is taking a serious look at the current in terconnection policies and is not afraid to revisit earlier FERC policy to make sure that they get it right In a dramatic move FERC changed policy course and ordered on rehearing that Indiana Michigan Power Company pay D PL Energy Inc interest on the transmission credits it will receive from Indiana to repay it for interconnection costs associated with system upgra des of facilities Chairman Wood believes that the transmission owner should both construct and take responsibility for getting transmission built Wood went on to s ay that generators should do what they do best and not be the bank Commissioner Massey tried to stress that his support of this order is only on an interim basis My longterm view has not yet been formulated I have an open mind about how to price interconnection costs However Mas sey supported this order because he believed that if a generator is goin g to be used as a bank it should be paid interest Commissioner Breathitt on the other hand was the lone dissenter on this order Commissioner Breathitt called this item for discussion in conjuncti on with six other interconnectionrelated proceedings being considered on this agenda EEEE and E This policy shift is to be app lied prospectively In support of her dissent Breathitt said that she wa s not convinced that this order adequately counters the July order which d enied rehearing on this very issue Commissioner Breathitt also stated that she believed it premature to address interconnection issues and cost resp onsibility in light of the Commissions earlier announcement that it will issue an ANOPR on generator interconnection procedures and costs allocatio n issues American Electric Power ER FERC To Establish Regional Panels to Facilitate RTO Formation At the request of Commissioner Brownell FERC will establish regional pane ls to help facilitate information exchange and collaboration between FERC and the state commissions This decision is a direct result of the Commiss ion responding to comments voiced by many state commissions at last weeks RTO Boot Camp It was clear that the state commissions have felt like t hey have been left out of the RTO debate and process So to remedy that go ing forward FERC has recommended the creation of this regional panel stru cture The goal of this regional panel is to strengthen relationships with the states help FERC with problemsolving and bring more efficiency to t his RTO process The Commissioners have recommended that this newly create d structure within FERC have a dedicated staff and serve as sort of a one stop shop for states to retrieve and exchange information with FERC Chairman Wood expressed his support for this initiative and thanked Commis sioner Brownell for her vision Wood also spelled out what he sees as the duties of this regional panel setting up RTOs addressing transmis sion cost and infrastructure issues devise demandside response mecha nisms help develop market monitoring and market mitigation programs and consider best use of distributed generation Chairman Wood said that he would like this panel to look at the use of distributed generatio n on his behalf Although conceding that distributed generation looks mo re like a retail issue Chairman Wood went on to say that he and the Comm issioners would do everything it could to help assist the states in that p rocess Even though Commissioner Massey supported the order he did however voic e his frustration over the continuous use of conferences and other forums aimed at developing regional transmission organizations that have yet to y ield the desired result It is my belief that we have had a lot of proces s if we need more we ought to structure it so to get to the end game ALJs Discuss RTO Mediation Reports and Recommendations Southeast RTO Mediation The Commission heard presentations by staff and both the Administrative La w Judge presiding over the Southeast and Northeast RTO meditations FERC s taff signaled the audience that governance is where this discussion will focus Identifying the unique nature of this mediation process Judge Bob bi Mc Cartney viewed this as a new approach to mediation in which she no w terms as a marketbased mediation approach In Judge McCartneys summar y of her Southeast mediation report she recommended that out of the two governance models that rose from the Southeast RTO Meditations the Collab orative Governance Model represented the most fullydeveloped model Jud ge McCartney went so far as to highlight several components of the GridFlo rida RTO model It GridFlorida has a nicely prepared forprofit Transco model Interestingly FERC staff in its presentation stated that both models sa tisfied compliance with Order However upon questioning by Commissio ner Massey staff conceded that the alternate Independent System Administ rator ISA model may NOT fully comply with Order and may need addit ional work to bring it in compliance Apparently wearing two hats Judge M cCartneys mediation advisor Chairman Herb Tate expressed his preference for the ISA model He stated that public power entities and states may be more comfortable with this model because of its similarity to the Indepe ndent System Operator ISO model currently in place in the Northeast Both Judge McCartney and Chairman Tate called on the Commission to take th is report and build from it Judge McCartney made it very clear that the f indings were limited to the narrow scope she was asked to address Judge M cCartney only looked at the filings made in the Southeast RTO dockets and made no comparisons to other regions RTO proposals Because of that limit ation Judge McCartney and Chairman Tate asked the Commission to do what t hey did not have an opportunity to Ultimately the Commissioners were very impressed by the results of the So utheast RTO meditations but recognized that much more needs to be explore d and resolved who does transmission planning how do you preserve the lowcost energy while restructuring the wholesale market and sh ould subregional RTOs still be allowed to continue developing knowing that they will be superseded by the creation of a supra regional RTO EX RT GridSouth RT Southwest Power Pool RT Entergy Servic es RT Southern Company Services Northeast RTO Mediation Discussions on the Northeast RTO Meditations went very much like the South east Judge Peter Young summarized his findings from the Northeast mediati on with assistance by his mediation advisor via telephone Joe Garcia The Northeast mediation did not concentrate on substantive issues and structu res instead it concentrated on process and timelines The meditations yie lded three options stakeholders offered for consideration Option IM Opti on M and Option M Judge Young expressed his favor with Option IM H owever again the advisors and Judges were split on the appropriate model to use going forward Joe Garcia recommended to the FERC the use of the M Option since it garnered the most broad based support from industry mediation participants Without committing to one model or the other Chairman Wood did however state that Option has some attractiveness because of the of the shorte ned time frame for implementation EX RT PJM RT PJMW est New York ISO RT Midwest RTO Developments The Midwest RTO discussions took a different approach beginning with a sta ff presentation that highlighted the status of both the Alliance RTO and t he Midwest RTOs From the FERC staff presentation it seemed as if the sta ff portrayed the Midwest ISO as the more progressive of the two RTOs before them Of particular note Commissioner Breathitt pointed out that Southwe st Power Pool had announced its plan to merge with the Midwest ISO which could address Commissions concern that its scope was too small Looking t o gain more intelligence on the announced proposed merger of MISO and SPP the Commissioners asked Jim Torgenson of MISO to join the panel and answe r staff questions The Commissioners were very concerned with the possibil ity of seams between the two areas ie Midwest ISO and SPP Mr Torgen son quieted those concerns by telling the Commission that there will be n o seams they will function as one Under the new proposed structure Jim Torgeson will become CEO of the newly created and named structure and Nick Brown will assume the position of COO for the new structure In addi tion the Midwest ISOSPP RTO will seat an entirely new independent per son board Representatives from the Alliance RTO were not given the same opportunity to update the Commissioners on their RTO progress The Commissioners only had the staff presentation summarizing what the Alliance had filed in its most recent status report afforded to them In the presentation staff not ed that the Alliance RTO would not be operational by the December RTO s tartup date but that the Midwest ISO intended to be Much of the Midwest discussion centered around the viability of standalo ne transcos and forprofit transcos within the RTO structure Commissione r Breathitt stated that she hopes to see a standalone transmission com pany she went on to say that with regards to Transcos maybe it is a ti me that has not yet come With so much uncertainty surrounding the Midwes t and other regions Commissioner Brownell instructed the Commission no to allow these models to be exposed in the market while we FERC tincker Commissioner Massey made a statement along the same lines asking for the Commission to consider what functions do investors need to invest in RTOs that could make the investments more appealing It is conceivable that th is uncertainty in the market surrounding the creation of RTOs both forpr ofit and notforprofit could deter much needed investment in these models EX RT Midwest ISOAlliance EL National Grid USA The message the Commissioners got across at Wednesdays meeting is that it will attempt to give people certainty by proceeding in a manner that will involve the necessary parties to bring RTOs into fruition perform an updated costbenefit analysis of creating RTOs issue a NOPR on RTOs that spell out what the Commission is looking for compliance issue an interconnection ANOPR to resolve a huge outstanding issue that could impac t functionality of RTOs create regional councils to facilitate collab oration between states and FERC and issue a NOPR on Open Access Tarif fs to guide the industry in fashioning tariffs Discussion of Western Infrastructure Adequacy Conference AD The staff started off the presentation by stating that it views this confe rence as a factfinding mission Staff proceeded to lay out three questi ons the FERC will attempt to answer through this conference Is curren t infrastructure adequate What are the infrastructure needs in the W est and What factors are inhibiting adequate investment in infrastru cture In addition to those questions staff is looking to address offsets of those larger contextual questions a what is the outlook for populat ion and growth of demand in the West b Why isnt needed infrastructure being built what are the barriers c What can FERC and the states do to increase investment in the West Chairman Wood ended the discussion by st ating that what is good for the West is good for the rest of the country So we can probably expect FERC to move forward with a series of regiona l discussions similar to this conference in the West Individual Contested Proceedings Bid Caps Market Mitigation New York ISO ER The Commission granted the NY ISO an extensio n of its bid cap until which time a Northeast RTO becomes operation al The Commission also directed the NY ISO to file semiannual reports on the progress of its efforts to implement programs that could minimize occu rrence of extreme prices eg demandside management programs In additio n as condition for approval of an extension for the use of the NY ISOs T emporary Extraordinary Procedures TEP the NY ISO must file within da ys a more defined set of procedures for triggering TEP in the market ISO New England ER The Commission granted the ISONE an exten sion of its bid cap until such time as a Northeast RTO becomes oper ational Morgan Stanley Capital Group v NY ISO EL ERER The Commission accepted the proposal to allow virtual bidding ie bidding of nonphysical generation and load in the NY ISOs realtime mar ket The Commission also accepted the NYISOs revised Market Mitigation Me asures aimed at addressing potential gaming or market power that may resul t from the introduction of virtual bidding Generator Interconnection New York Independent System Operator Inc ER The Commission addressed the issue of cost responsibility for interconnection by ruling that generators may only be assigned costs of System Upgrade Facilities to the extent that these costs are not already in the Baseline Assessment In addition siding with generator arguments the Commission also ordered the NY ISO to delete from its tariff its Material Impact Standards with out prejudice Market Complaints E San Diego Gas Electric Co v Sellers of Energy EL EL Order on the CA ISOs compliance filing proposing a new generat or outage and
