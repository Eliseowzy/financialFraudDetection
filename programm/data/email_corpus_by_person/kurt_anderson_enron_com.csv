be very interested seeing the data as well as the methodology utilized by Zilkha to arrive at these numbers and that we would work diligently to resolve the discrepancy between our numbers and theirs Rick replied that the information would be sent soon Michael Miller Michael Payne and Tom Nemila were participants on the call Kurt Anderson sent an email to Gary V requesting the information regarding the availability and reiterating our desire to resolve this issue Gary V replied with the data and a copy of a letter he sent to Rick W that outlined the methodology utilized in Zilkhas calculations Gary Vs email stated that he wanted to review the data with Joe Thorpe to explain the basis and reasoning applied to the calculations with the intent that Joe would then share this

give you something specific on certain GEWE issues We are drafting a formal letter to GEWE to express our concerns with their overstating of availability and general unresponsiveness to issues In our view their performance is unacceptable Along those lines attached is an analysis of availability for the January March period for both Mill Run machines and Somerset machines The attachment shows in the second last column the GEWE reported availability and in the third last column an availability number we determined after significant data analysis We believe that GEWE overstates their

Kurt I have a few questions relating to the Monthly Reports prepared for the Mill Run and Somerset Wind Farms They are as follows On April th the Main Circuit Breaker located within the pad mounted transformer on WTG at Mill Run was torn apart and replaced by Marvin Blanco GE Turbine Tech In addition on or about this same date IGBTs were replaced within the same turbine Nowhere in the Monthly report are these issues mentioned please explain WTG at Mill Run experienced downtime between at AM and at PM this equates to days hrs or days Assuming WTG operated fault free the entire month its availability at except for the above mentioned period of days the best possible availability that could be realized would be x Please explain how the availability of this turbine can be as listed in the Monthly Report On WTG experienced several hours of repair time due to worn HV cable which had been rubbing against the ladder rungs at the yaw deck level Apparently the bundle of cables sways or moves during normal operation and over an extended period it caused significant wear to the protective coatinginsulation Why was this not mentioned Are other turbines experiencing this problem Is there a retrofit being considered On a storm event with heavy winds rolled through the area Turbines and at Mill Run all experienced faults requiring component replacements The Summary on individual turbine activity in the monthly report does not reflect this neither does the Consumption Log also contained within the Monthly Report please explain In fact WTG required a new rack of IGBTs as a result of this storm event and no mention is made in the report to an IGBT replacement for this turbine Furthermore on a new rack of IGBTs was installed in WTG and they were blown upon start up IGBTs are major components As a minimum I would expect the monthly reports to include major component failuresreplacements I need clarification on what exactly Section EXHIBITS is attempting to demonstrate Surely this is not an attempt to list all faults that a turbine experienced for the current month How are you selecting the faults you choose to include on the list For example WTG lists one fault for the month and clearly that was not the case As one example check the operational activity for WTG on where it experienced multiple faults among them Gearbox Oil Pressure Too Low We have to have a better account of the operational history of these wind farms through GE Wind Monthly Reports I understand that the company as a whole has been consumed with many other tasks relating to the recent acquisition and that your attention has been elsewhere Nevertheless we need to work together in order to improve the accuracy and attention to important details that is lacking within these reports I

Kurt I have a few questions relating to the Monthly Reports prepared for the Mill Run and Somerset Wind Farms They are as follows On April th the Main Circuit Breaker located within the pad mounted transformer on WTG at Mill Run was torn apart and replaced by Marvin Blanco GE Turbine Tech In addition on or about this same date IGBTs were replaced within the same turbine Nowhere in the Monthly report are these issues mentioned please explain WTG at Mill Run experienced downtime between at AM and at PM this equates to days hrs or days Assuming WTG operated fault free the entire month its availability at except for the above mentioned period of days the best possible availability that could be realized would be x Please explain how the availability of this turbine can be as listed in the Monthly Report On WTG experienced several hours of repair time due to worn HV cable which had been rubbing against the ladder rungs at the yaw deck level Apparently the bundle of cables sways or moves during normal operation and over an extended period it caused significant wear to the protective coatinginsulation Why was this not mentioned Are other turbines experiencing this problem Is there a retrofit being considered On a storm event with heavy winds rolled through the area Turbines and at Mill Run all experienced faults requiring component replacements The Summary on individual turbine activity in the monthly report does not reflect this neither does the Consumption Log also contained within the Monthly Report please explain In fact WTG required a new rack of IGBTs as a result of this storm event and no mention is made in the report to an IGBT replacement for this turbine Furthermore on a new rack of IGBTs was installed in WTG and they were blown upon start up IGBTs are major components As a minimum I would expect the monthly reports to include major component failuresreplacements I need clarification on what exactly Section EXHIBITS is attempting to demonstrate Surely this is not an attempt to list all faults that a turbine experienced for the current month How are you selecting the faults you choose to include on the list For example WTG lists one fault for the month and clearly that was not the case As one example check the operational activity for WTG on where it experienced multiple faults among them Gearbox Oil Pressure Too Low We have to have a better account of the operational history of these wind farms through GE Wind Monthly Reports I understand that the company as a whole has been consumed with many other tasks relating to the recent acquisition and that your attention has been elsewhere Nevertheless we need to work together in order to improve the accuracy and attention to important details that is lacking within these reports I

Kurt I have a few questions relating to the Monthly Reports prepared for the Mill Run and Somerset Wind Farms They are as follows On April th the Main Circuit Breaker located within the pad mounted transformer on WTG at Mill Run was torn apart and replaced by Marvin Blanco GE Turbine Tech In addition on or about this same date IGBTs were replaced within the same turbine Nowhere in the Monthly report are these issues mentioned please explain WTG at Mill Run experienced downtime between at AM and at PM this equates to days hrs or days Assuming WTG operated fault free the entire month its availability at except for the above mentioned period of days the best possible availability that could be realized would be x Please explain how the availability of this turbine can be as listed in the Monthly Report On WTG experienced several hours of repair time due to worn HV cable which had been rubbing against the ladder rungs at the yaw deck level Apparently the bundle of cables sways or moves during normal operation and over an extended period it caused significant wear to the protective coatinginsulation Why was this not mentioned Are other turbines experiencing this problem Is there a retrofit being considered On a storm event with heavy winds rolled through the area Turbines and at Mill Run all experienced faults requiring component replacements The Summary on individual turbine activity in the monthly report does not reflect this neither does the Consumption Log also contained within the Monthly Report please explain In fact WTG required a new rack of IGBTs as a result of this storm event and no mention is made in the report to an IGBT replacement for this turbine Furthermore on a new rack of IGBTs was installed in WTG and they were blown upon start up IGBTs are major components As a minimum I would expect the monthly reports to include major component failuresreplacements I need clarification on what exactly Section EXHIBITS is attempting to demonstrate Surely this is not an attempt to list all faults that a turbine experienced for the current month How are you selecting the faults you choose to include on the list For example WTG lists one fault for the month and clearly that was not the case As one example check the operational activity for WTG on where it experienced multiple faults among them Gearbox Oil Pressure Too Low We have to have a better account of the operational history of these wind farms through GE Wind Monthly Reports I understand that the company as a whole has been consumed with many other tasks relating to the recent
