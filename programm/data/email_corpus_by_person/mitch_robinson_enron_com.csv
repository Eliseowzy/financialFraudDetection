cautiously optimistic Lets have an SIT legal kickoff discussion early next week Tuesday I would also like to include Marchris in the discussion Ill have my assistant set up the meeting and include a callin number for Marchris Mitch From Carlos Sole on PM To Mathew CT cc Bruce nronXGate Mitch nron Marchris nron David nronXGate Subject Re Seminole Indian Tribe Project Mathew Per our conversation yesterday I would reiterate the importance of a team meeting on our potential project with the Seminoles given that there will be a lot of complex legal structuring required for the project in addition to all of the commercial structuring that you are still evaluating As a general rule you should know that under federal law Indian tribes are legally treated as sovereign nations and so they are immune from regulation by a state government and immune from federal and state court jurisdiction unless they consent to it They are entitled to establish their own governing laws and regulations and are subject to very unique federal law requirements To illustrate with respect to our potential project with them it means we will need to address such issues as getting BIA approval for our site acquisition on Indian land nonIndians can only lease tribal land and for our type of transaction our lease will require approval from the BIA tribal taxes may impact the facility tribal permits licenses etc will apply including tribal environmental laws the tribe may have its own tribal EPA for instance preserving the right to challenge any tribal taxes or regulations in courts other than the tribal courts specifically getting waivers of sovereign immunity from the Tribe so that we can subject them to federal court jurisdiction specifically ensuring that the Tribe has complied with its own constitution and tribal rules in executing agreements so that such agreements are enforceable and specifically getting a waiver from the Tribe acknowledging and agreeing that Enron is not subject

cautiously optimistic Lets have an SIT legal kickoff discussion early next week Tuesday I would also like to include Marchris in the discussion Ill have my assistant set up the meeting and include a callin number for Marchris Mitch From Carlos Sole on PM To Mathew CT cc Bruce nronXGate Mitch nron Marchris nron David nronXGate Subject Re Seminole Indian Tribe Project Mathew Per our conversation yesterday I would reiterate the importance of a team meeting on our potential project with the Seminoles given that there will be a lot of complex legal structuring required for the project in addition to all of the commercial structuring that you are still evaluating As a general rule you should know that under federal law Indian tribes are legally treated as sovereign nations and so they are immune from regulation by a state government and immune from federal and state court jurisdiction unless they consent to it They are entitled to establish their own governing laws and regulations and are subject to very unique federal law requirements To illustrate with respect to our potential project with them it means we will need to address such issues as getting BIA approval for our site acquisition on Indian land nonIndians can only lease tribal land and for our type of transaction our lease will require approval from the BIA tribal taxes may impact the facility tribal permits licenses etc will apply including tribal environmental laws the tribe may have its own tribal EPA for instance preserving the right to challenge any tribal taxes or regulations in courts other than the tribal courts specifically getting waivers of sovereign immunity from the Tribe so that we can subject them to federal court jurisdiction specifically ensuring that the Tribe has complied with its own constitution and tribal rules in executing agreements so that such agreements are enforceable and specifically getting a waiver from the Tribe acknowledging and agreeing that Enron is not subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts Evaluating all of the above as well as the numerous other issues that will likely arise will require consultation with and the cooperation of the Tribe As you know I am still in the process of identifying outside counsel who is an expert in Indian law matters As an update on that our other Florida law firm currently represents the Seminoles on other matters so they are conflicted out of representing us Presently I am waiting to hear back from an Indian lawyer who was involved in the recent hotelgaming development transaction between the Seminoles and the Hard Rock Cafe group Although he is based in Wisconsin he is with a very large firm which has offices in Florida and Washington DC and which currently represents Enron on other matters After speaking with him I will further debrief you and if we elect to engage him I will then seek my internal approvals for doing so In the interim I have been receiving advice from a retired Vinson Elkins lawyer who has worked with Enron on its other dealings when Indian tribes were involved ie right of way agreements involving our pipeline companies He has prepared a brief memo on his views on our letter of intent and general issues that arise when dealing with tribes I would be happy to share that document with you note that I have tried to summarize most of it above As a result of that memo I do have some changes to incorporate into our letter of intent and I am still waiting to hear from you on how to modify the letter of intent based on your prior email I also have a more comprehensive legal paper entitled Energy Business in Indian Country Opportunities and Obstacles if you are having trouble sleeping at night Lastly as for Bill Bryants current activity below based on what youve told me and the email traffic he seems as if he is looking at the right regulatory issues but with an area of law as so complex as this is I would caution that you and Marchris should narrowly define and monitor his activities as it could otherwise quickly result in a very expensive research project Thanks and please let me know when we discuss this project further At a minimum I would suggest that we

Please work with Merle on the details Can you or Mike confirm my understanding of the following Though the units ran within limits on NOx and CO throughout the summer GE believes that the performance will be enhanced with the attached modifications ie NOx will be reduced even further to the ppm range Response The GE target will be to have NOx at range In addition the expectation is that CO will also be around ppm at Base load conditions The liners will have their dilution holes resized Will the secondary nozzles also be modified or is this not required Response The secondary nozzles will be modified to meet the new group number change which will increase the effective area This is an engineering requirement In addition the primary nozzle effective are will change with the new part numbers The liner dilution hole change will be standard across all the units You can postpone the retest until the next expected run season DecemberJanuary Response The retest could be delayed until the winter peak season but in the event that a unit was run after modification without a test the risk of compliance would be to Enron GE feels very strongly that a reliable operation of the unit would include retest as soon as practical after modifications In the event the units will not run until Q the abiity of GE to respond to the site need may be in jeopardy due to the high number of new unit start ups This change will not limit the ability to run prior to the scheduled test in the event of an unexpected run call Response The units would be available to run but the operator may not know where the unit would be in a regards to compliance We are also trying to bring the unit back to a nominal firing temperature The other point to consider is whether or not you need to alert the EPA of the modification and what your requirements are with that entity Enron or Des Plaines Green Land Development Lincoln Center will not incur any financial obligations as a result of the changeout Response GE will be paying for all labor tools and shop work necessary to perform the modifications but Enron or Des Plaines Green Land Development would be responsible for all fuel costs electrical

Lincoln Center Improvements Original Message From mailto Sent Monday September PM To Cc Subject Lincoln Center Improvements Michelle Please forward to Mike Murphy In general the schedule is acceptable Please work with Merle on the details Can you or Mike confirm my understanding of the following Though the units ran within limits on NOx and CO throughout the summer GE believes that the performance will be enhanced with the attached modifications ie NOx will be reduced even further to the ppm range Response The GE target will be to have NOx at range In addition the expectation is that CO will also be around ppm at Base load conditions The liners will have their dilution holes resized Will the secondary nozzles also be modified or is this not required Response The secondary nozzles will be modified to meet the new group number change which will increase the effective area This is an engineering requirement In addition the primary nozzle effective are will change with the new part numbers The liner dilution hole change will be standard across all the units You can postpone the retest until the next expected run season DecemberJanuary Response The retest could be delayed until the winter peak season but in the event that a unit was run after modification without a test the risk of compliance would be to Enron GE feels very strongly that a reliable operation of the unit would include retest as soon as practical after modifications In the event the units will not run until Q the abiity of GE to respond to the site need may be in jeopardy due to the high number of new unit start ups This change will not limit the ability to run prior to the scheduled test in the event of an unexpected run call Response The units would be available to run but the operator may not know where the unit would be in a regards to compliance We are also trying to bring the unit back to a nominal firing temperature The other point to consider is whether or not you need to alert the EPA of the modification and what your requirements are with that entity Enron or Des Plaines Green Land Development Lincoln Center will not incur any financial obligations as a result of the changeout Response GE will be paying for all labor tools and shop work necessary to perform the modifications but Enron or Des Plaines Green Land Development would be responsible for all fuel costs electrical costs and operator costs Thanks for your diligence and please let the GE team know that I appreciate the effort given to the Lincoln plant Regarding both the generator changeout and the emissions

Lincoln Center Improvements Original Message From mailto Sent Monday September PM To Cc Subject Lincoln Center Improvements Michelle Please forward to Mike Murphy In general the schedule is acceptable Please work with Merle on the details Can you or Mike confirm my understanding of the following Though the units ran within limits on NOx and CO throughout the summer GE believes that the performance will be enhanced with the attached modifications ie NOx will be reduced even further to the ppm range Response The GE target will be to have NOx at range In addition the expectation is that CO will also be around ppm at Base load conditions The liners will have their dilution holes resized Will the secondary nozzles also be modified or is this not required Response The secondary nozzles will be modified to meet the new group number change which will increase the effective area This is an engineering requirement In addition the primary nozzle effective are will change with the new part numbers The liner dilution hole change will be standard across all the units You can postpone the retest until the next expected run season DecemberJanuary Response The retest could be delayed until the winter peak season but in the event that a unit was run after modification without a test the risk of compliance would be to Enron GE feels very strongly that a reliable operation of the unit would include retest as soon as practical after modifications In the event the units will not run until Q the abiity of GE to respond to the site need may be in jeopardy due to the high number of new unit start ups This change will not limit the ability to run prior to the scheduled test in the event of an unexpected run call Response The units would be available to run but the operator may not know where the unit would be in a regards to compliance We are also trying to bring the unit back to a nominal firing temperature The other point to consider is whether or not you need to alert the EPA of the modification and what your requirements are with that entity Enron or Des Plaines Green Land Development Lincoln Center will not incur any financial obligations as a result of the changeout Response GE will be paying for all labor tools and shop work necessary to perform the modifications but Enron or Des Plaines Green Land Development would be responsible for all fuel costs electrical

others Richard As a followup to your request for information in support of any possible legal action at Gleason Im forwarding the attached news report I have copied only the three principle people Eric Ben Mark involved in analyzing the complaints gathering information in support of your legal research and responding accordingly A few comments A third party analysis Southwest Research Institute SWRI showed no abnormal noise within the hearing range SWRI showed that at Hz there is a louder than expected vibration This is well below the hearing range There are no vendor regulatory or otherwise specifications for vibrations in this range The fleet of FDs is too small to get any historical data on this range SWRI indicated that one possible source could be the water injection system in the combustor We have informed the turbine vendor Siemens Westinghouse SWPC of this and asked that they work with us to resolve the following a Is there a problem b If there is a problem what can be done to completely correct the cause of it c Barring b what can be done to mitigate the effect of the possible problem damping material in the stack etc Since we instrumented and tested by SWRI we have not had significant run time Mark Dobler and I are meeting with SWPC in Orlando on Monday of next week to hammer out the detailed plan The run season is coming to an end and I expect fewer than total run hours before next January We are working to resolve whether there is a problem and if so to correct it however since this is a new generation machine any efforts have to be coordinated with the OEM SWPC therefore an expeditious My instinct is to explain to the press and the neighbors fully what we are doing but I want to make sure that we dont put ourselves in any legal jeopardy Advice I suggest

others Richard As a followup to your request for information in support of any possible legal action at Gleason Im forwarding the attached news report I have copied only the three principle people Eric Ben Mark involved in analyzing the complaints gathering information in support of your legal research and responding accordingly A few comments A third party analysis Southwest Research Institute SWRI showed no abnormal noise within the hearing range SWRI showed that at Hz there is a louder than expected vibration This is well below the hearing range There are no vendor regulatory or otherwise specifications for vibrations in this range The fleet of FDs is too small to get any historical data on this range SWRI indicated that one possible source could be the water injection system in the combustor We have informed the turbine vendor Siemens Westinghouse SWPC of this and asked that they work with us to resolve the following a Is there a problem b If there is a problem what can be done to completely correct the cause of it c Barring b what can be done to mitigate the effect of the possible problem damping material in the stack etc Since we instrumented and tested by SWRI we have not had significant run time Mark Dobler and I are meeting with SWPC in Orlando on Monday of next week to hammer out the detailed plan The run season is coming to an end and I expect fewer than total run hours before next January We are working to resolve whether there is a problem and if so to correct it however since this is a new generation machine any efforts have to be coordinated with the OEM SWPC therefore an expeditious My instinct is to explain to the press and the neighbors fully what we are doing but I want to make sure that we dont put ourselves in any legal jeopardy Advice I suggest a meeting with all concerned if you have significant commentsadvice Mitch Forwarded by Mitch RobinsonCorpEnron on AM Ben F CT PM Sent by Ben CT To Mitch nron Eric NRON cc Subject FW Eyewitness News pm
