inference McDonalds Acquires Failed Web Firms Sends Employees to Burger U Oak Brook IL Fast food giant McDonalds has entered the dotcom world with a big splash acquiring failed web firms at a breakneck pace Not an ordinary technology investor McDonalds is taking a corporate raiding approach to these acquisitions Instead of utilizing acquired firms to increase the corporations Internet presence McDonalds is taking a new spin on the increasingly popular Vulture Capital role selling off patents and equipment while retraining the acquired staff Getting employees that can make correct change and process orders properly is much more difficult than one might imagine McDonalds spokesman Harrison Dent explained Theres also the issue of convincing qualified teenagers that McDonalds is a cool place to work It all makes staffing very difficult for us Weve found that most web programmers have sufficient mathematical skill to make correct change as well as handle the digital readouts on microwaves and French Fry machines With the economic problems many web firms have been having compared with the cost of constantly recruiting new teenagers and replacing them as they go off to college it has become economical to simply acquire a struggling web firm selloff whatever assets they have and send their staff to Burger U for retraining in the business of family dining Dent went on to say that the various positions at web firms mapped out well with McDonalds staffing matrix Programmers being mathematically inclined would process the customer orders and make correct change Quality assurance workers are sent back to the kitchen making sure each burger they flip is up to corporate standards Technical support makes sure the grills and fryers stay in working order and that the floors are clean Managers continue to manage and accountants still do the books Initially there were concerns that due to the large number of foreign programmers that there might be some language problems with these workers taking orders However upon execution it was found that the problems with poor English skills were no greater than those currently existing in our Chicago operations McDonalds largest problems in converting employees seem to be dress code and unauthorized snacking Unfortunately the casual dress codes allowed at some of these firms have caused a culture clash Dent elucidated We have had some issues with employees showing up to work in dirty tshirts rather than in a McDonalds uniform Similarly many of the acquired firms provided free and unlimited snacks and drinks a policy which is not a staple of our organization Still Dent was upbeat about the prospects of transitioning the digital economy to the burger economy Advert Want to laugh at something besides business Indignant Online because ATTITUDE matters we have sports too Advert Brain Dead The Next PP By The Big Head In the battle of acronyms the first PP was pathtoprofitability Then we had PP as in peertopeer Though no one really knows if this is Napster type PP central server based or the SETI type PP distributed computing Regardless the next PP will be PrivatetoPublic as in privatetopublic exchanges The beginning of the BB revolution was led by public exchanges While the exchanges were nothing of the sort when one used to think of true exchanges Commodities Futures NASDAQ NYSE they did expose the public to the Internet space These exchanges as they were called were really nothing more than glorified auctions There was no exchanging going on because that is not what they were designed to do The idea of these early companies was to build a technology and then leverage the power of the Internet to create buying communities Whether it was buyers or sellers the premise was the same If the company chose to work on sell side mechanics then it was usually excess inventory of some sort put out into a platform where the highest bidder was the winner Conceptually this was a good idea However it was fraught with a few challenges First you needed lots of buyers to attract the sellers and vice versa thus liquidity was an issue Second none of these technologies took into account a payment mechanism or payment platform thus all settlement issues were handled offline While this may have been fine in modern times the premise of the Internet was to help eliminate such paper and timebased inefficiencies If the company chose to work on buy side mechanics then a buyer would list his request and suppliers could jump at the chance to bid for the opportunity This as well brought about its own set of challenges Namely the suppliers who were necessary for the validity of the auction stayed away The figured it out pretty quickly that they would only be bidding against themselves and their own margins Thus without enough suppliers you had no liquidity Where is the industry now On the Private Exchange model What the industry failed to take into account was the value of RELATIONSHIPS The relationship between buyers and sellers is a long term and trusted item Some relationships go back a hundred years Take Ford and Firestone for instance That relationship has been in existence since the dawn of the automobile You dont just build a technology and expect to steal those existing bonds away overnight Therefore the premise of the public exchange is to leverage the existing relationship between the buyers and sellers of companies industries and verticals The companies are saying give me a better way to deal with my own suppliers I trust these companies I know them I know their pricing and their deliverables heck I play golf with their CFO I want to keep them However I want to do it more efficiently What can technology and the web do to make my life easier in dealing with the known quantities that exist within my own company realm So now the push is to private exchanges A way to take big companies with hundreds or thousands of existing relationships and bring them to the web This creates immediate liquidity among groups of companies used to doing business with each other That makes sense and should be where the market focus was all along What will the evolution of this be That is where the new PP comes in What is PP you ask PrivatetoPublic exchanges While a private exchange focuses on existing customers a public exchange holds the promise of more buyers and sellers Thus more liquidity creates potentially more sales or more savings Ask yourself If I were a company would I be interested in new buyers and sellers for my goods Invariably the answer is yes A private exchange automates my existing relationships However find a way to provide me access to more buyers and sellers as well and know you really have my attention Where is the future of exchanges It should move toward a privatetopublic marketplace First make it easier to deal with my existing customer and supplier base Second give me more buyers and sellers for my goods Whether this means a melding of the different private exchanges in the future or several overlying technologies that provides access across many borders is yet to be seen Im willing to bet the future of BB commerce will lie somewhere in the neighborhood of the new PP Advert What You havent subscribed to The Chicago Brain Trust yet Get with the program click here subscriptionshtm Enough already

headquarters to Chicago I was shocked an surprised to see that Boeing moved but then I checked out their rationale and concluded they were right Gates said Pointing to a PowerPoint presentation that no one could decipher Mr Gates remarked After all when you take into account climate available human resources the transportation capabilities its a nobrainer Sources close to Gates indicated that when Bill found out that the Playboy Building was available he jumped at the chance to move Its rumored that Bill has visions of taking on the mantra of Hefner now that hes stepped down as CEO of the worlds largest software company Evanston May Northwestern Universitys Mohan Sawhney Makes Internet Prediction that Comes True Yes thats right Professor Sawhney has actually made a prognostication that was borne out Last week the Professor predicted that Microsoft would move to Chicago After all when you take into account climate available human resources the transportation capabilities its a nobrainer Sawhney cited at a meeting of Internet gurus Sources close to Sawhney said that when the Professor heard that the Playboy Building was available he easily made the prediction Business is all about collaboration work flow and relationships And who was better at relationships that Hugh Hefner If Mr Gates can pick up where Mr Hefner left off Microsoft should be a winner Sawhney said In a related story a spokesperson for Viagra was heard to remark upon hearing the news If Bill uses the Hefner model hed better stock up on our product After all if Windows were a man not only would there be performance problems but shutting down in the middle of a session is just not going to cut it Others in Chicago said that perhaps that was the real reason for the move Maybe moving to the Playboy Building will inspire them to create products that get issued to the public prematurely Premature issuance is a real problem especially when well you know a local government official was quoted as remarking Most Chicagoans felt that that least the Windows wallpaper would likely be a bit less dull in the next Windows product line should Gates be ensconced in town Chicago May Britannica and

been allowed a lesser dose of my medicine and while my frontal lobes are clear I took some time to visit the hospitals library You would be so surprised to see just how many things were collected ON PAPER before the Internet reared its ugly head The facility actually has a wonderful collection of old newspapers yes a paper document where content was placed on a daily basis and youll never believe this dear readers people actually paid to read it Really Im not kidding Anyway what I found enervating was that there were reallife stories in these newspaper things you know something called news that didnt entail a wonderfully endowed woman or a plastic faced man to interpret it for us Think of this crude idea a person called a reporter went to the site of some news event and now I know you wont believe this wrote down the FACTS Then and this is even more fantastic the editor a person who actually read all the written down stuff to see if it made reading sense let the reporter person put it in the paper exactly like it happened he didnt need to spin it or check with the advertisers first WOW No wonder newspapers have ceased to exist But I digress The article I snipped out of the paper seemed vaguely familiar to me but I couldnt place it No problem I called Mohan Sawhney my old buddy at Kellogg If hes at Kellogg and hes so famous why is it hes never been on the Corn Flakes box and asked him if he could make the connection for me After hour and minutes of phraseology like Strategic Insights into eBusiness Transformation I thanked him and rang off While he didnt provide further illumination he did tell me that Kansas was in the Midwest Rather than try to figure it out myself I decided to let you the reader provide me with clues to why this tickled my subconscious Please let me know as I have to go back into confinement and wont be allowed back into the library until July th All emails should be sent to Kansas SunTimes Hullabaloo Kansas Dec For Produce Farmer Automobile Failed Against Horse and Wagon For generations Samuel L Rosss family has adopted the latest technology to keep their farms production at the head of the class Everyone here abouts knows my father was the first to buy a Deere reaping machine back in he was quoted as saying during our recent interview But theres one thing you wont see on Rosss farm any of those new fangled inventions called the automobile That new fangled horseless carriage isnt going to cut it when it comes to getting my produce to market Ross said while standing along side his farm wagon and team of horses Why the dang thing needs gasoline every miles and it only hauls ton compared to ton I can fit on my wagon Even worse it scared the dickens out of Joe Roys filly Ross said he was approached by Ransom E Olds last year and talked into purchasing an REO Speed Wagon to use to move his produce to market in Salinas over miles away Eager for a competitive advantage Ross jumped at the change to try the auto But shortly after he purchased the horseless carriage problems came up They didnt tell me you needed gasoline to run the dang thing hell Ive got lots of oats but I got to go into Salinas once a week to get gallons of that stuff Then I learned its even more flammable than kerosene I cant keep it anywhere near the stove Sam went on to say that the REO needed things like a tune up and spark advance things he wasnt qualified to do so he needed to hire a mechanic Hell if Ida known that Ida never bought the thing Seems that the idea behind the auto was wrong Olds invented the speed wagon for smaller deliveries in towns like Salinas and when he tried to sell it outside of town it just didnt catch on In fact Olds has left the truck business and is concentrating on carriages for homeowners Hell hell fail even faster with that model Sam said No way families are going to use that But all is not lost Sams been approached by a gentleman named Francis E Stanley out of Maine who is trying to sell Ross a steam powered wagon Now Im really considering that he said Steam thats a proven technology just like my tractor and all them locomotives Next week Sam is taking delivery of the steam wagon

organization and will soon begin touring with his blues band in support of his new album MultiMillionaires Blues divine is in sound financial shape Filiposwki said in a press conference earlier today Im comfortable leaving divine to fend for itself as I move on to greater opportunities When I came to the realization that divine and to a lesser extent Chicagos Internet presence could exist without my constant presence and supervision I began searching for another field I could put my stamp on and elevate Filipowski decided his next venture would be in the field of music Specifically the music of the Blues Filipowski formed a backup band The Cronies consisting as is his custom of former Platinum Technologies employees I realized that divine was not sufficiently about promoting myself Filipowski continued As such I consulted the Reverend Jesse Jackson as Rev Jackson is the only person I could think of that might be qualified to advise me on selfpromotion Eventually we determined much as Rev Jackson had become muchbeloved for reading Doctor Seuss on television that were I to record an album perhaps the general public could come to hold the sound of my voice in the same high esteem that I do Filipowski says his decision to take up the Blues was because of the musical genres strong association with Chicago and underperforming record sales People say I dont know what the Blues are about Filipowski commented To me anything thats not performing up to its potential has the Blues be it a company somebody who bothered to get an MBA from Harvard or even entire musical style From where Im sitting the Blues has the Blues Filipowski is on record as intending to singlehandedly save the Chicago Blues industry Filipowskis signature tune I Sold a Company For Million and I Cant Get No Respect appears to have a hit a popular chord with Silicon Valley executives generating enough buzz for Filipowski to predict a platinum record for the single Other tunes on the album include

the Earth for the last years our economy has been guided by a similar myth The myth that technology was and would drive our economy In the last months however those of us in the technology field have felt like our entire world has collapsed around us With layoffs closing of dot coms the nosedive of the Nasdaq the disappearance of angel investors and the barricading of the doors to funding it seems like our entire world has fallen on dark times To our mind and the minds of all of the financial community the entire universe revolved around the failings of our technology sector and if so then the economy was surely doomed I being at the epicenter of technology for over years tended to agree with these sentiments But miraculously something strange has happened In a strange twist of revelation people are beginning to point out that the universe indeed does not revolve around the planet of technology it instead revolves around the economy as a whole Key planetary indicators like housing consumer spending large ticket items and automobiles are all holding strong Indeed it is increasingly clear that technology was merely one planet in the entire economic universe And as we now know all planets revolve around the Sun not around the Earth The universal economy as a whole is more like our solar system and is made up of many factors all microcosms in and of themselves much like moons and asteroids revolving around a single planet but yet all truly still revolving around Sol the core of our system So instead of a revolutionary idea driving our economy the economic philosophers of old are coming back into vogue As they have always said it was always about the Sun Technology is a part of our economic universe a planet perhaps maybe only a moon but certainly not the Sun Here are some interesting statistics gathered from a recent study The study from the Pew Internet American Life Project serves up a heaping dose of reality to those who were wearing neweconomy blinders Pew estimates only one in six Americans has been touched by dotcom death either knowing someone who was laid off missing a favorite site or losing money invested in the Net Some particulars Just percent say theyve lost money on a dotcomrelated investment Only percent lost one of their favorite sites because of the dotcom downturn And while TheStandardcoms Layoff Tracker has tallied nearly lost jobs among Internetrelated businesses just percent of those surveyed by Pew knew someone let go from an Internet Economy position More than twothirds of the respondents said they hadnt closely followed the dotcom devastation and one out of three said they didnt know anything about the cratering of the Internet Economy And this recently from Crains in Chicago Despite economic slowing the Chicago region added nearly jobs in the month period ended March hitting a record total and the highest total employment in a decade How can that be The tech world is collapsing Life will cease to exist The world will come to a stop This cant be Everything revolves around my planet of technology No more likely we will look back on this collapse years from now and consider it nothing more than a celestial eclipse Though we in the technology world feel like we are in a total eclipse of the sun the other planets economic indicators for those not following the astronomy analogy are in a partial eclipse if they are in one at all So think of the technology sector as being in a brief time when all in the world seems bathed in darkness But what was our light based upon Tech values were nonsensible and out of line consumer spending was higher than cost of living increases a false sense of wealth and prosperity had set in somethings were spending more cash in a year than they will ever see in their lifetime companies focused on hiring and expansion as opposed to prudent management of funds and the list goes on and on Yes as we approached the eclipse we thought the sun revolved around our planet and as we were the center of the economic universe we felt we could do no wrong However the Sun that great epicenter of the entire economy has cast a shadow on our lowly planet of technology Thus reminding us once again that all is in order in the universe Will the Sun shine again Of course it will Will we be the center of the economic universe no and we should never expect to be no planet is ever thus So right now the ones panicking from an absence of sunlight are the youngsters who have never seen or experienced an eclipse before If you are still not following I am referring to an economic downturn a slow down a correction or at worst a recession Yes if you talk to wise old sages those over who at least felt the pinch of the crash and those of the s s and s they will tell you it was always like this Sometimes the sun shines on you and sometimes you are left in the dark With my brief history in technology Sunshine and prosperity is all I have known But I should have known history doth have a way of repeating itself I often used to hear Son you werent around when the bio techs were going crazy The reference being that all explosively absurd events go through a correction an eclipse if you will History is fraught with such examples biotech oil gold automobiles railroads gold again tulips and once even spices like pepper and cumin the list goes on What will the next planet be that thinks the Sun doth revolve around it Yes history doth have a way of repeating itself however in the long run no matter what planet you are on you will be in the light more often than the dark Advert Buy palm and handheld software image Advert HEADLINES OF THE WEEK Eppraisalscom Appraises Self Finds Out Its Worthless Evanston IL Eppraisalscom who had received million in

this newsletter except by satirical inference National Association For Acquiring Wealthy Spouses Revises Internet Executive Ratings Chicago IL In an emergency summit preceding their annual convention the National Association For Acquiring Wealthy Spouses NAFAWS revised their ratings for eligible singles in the profession of Internet executive It was very trendy two years ago to marry an Internet executive Mindi Newman NAFAWS presidentelect told reports The salaries were huge the stock options plentiful and the little dears were always at the office so you had your time to yourself It seems the dotbomb phenomenon has tempered longterm expectations on the worth of Internet executives as marital partners The stock market plunge has sent networths plummeting overnight and liquid assets have been eaten up during periods of unemployment causing some NAFAWS members to set their sights on mates in more traditional lines of work like petroleum executive physician and trust fund recipient The problem with Internet executives isnt so much the salary as the volatility of assets Newman explained Given the high divorce rate amongst our members a rapidly fluctuating net worth commonly caused by assets like stock options suffering through bear and bull markets can make timing the market for a divorce problematic If you finalize your settlement when the stock is at a temporary peak and it bottoms out before you can cash out what was the point of the marriage Similarly the culture of vesting schedules amongst Internet executives has influenced their prenuptial agreements In some severe cases Internet executives are limiting the assets available in case of divorce on a sliding scale determined by the length of the marriage Ironically prior to the proliferation of stock options that made these Internet works so attractive as partners a vesting schedule was unheard of in matrimonial matters Now it limits their appeal NAFAWS has officially downgraded the rating of Internet executives to Hold from Accumulate Dates While the lack of meaningful stock options is a minus these executives are still drawing decent salaries in many cases Newman elaborated As there is always a chance the market will rebound and their earnings potential will rise As such we have lowered them to a Hold rating instead of a Dump rating We do have the caveat that male NAFAWS members should continue to Accumulate Dates with female Internet Executives as there are relatively few of them and their availability should dry up quickly in the case of a market upswing Advert Want to laugh at

some recent activities warranted such action Recently the state of Illinois announced they were voting to cut the funding for technology by about MM I found this incredulous until I started to think about the way things really work here in our lovely state What I have come to realize is that no one really accepts responsibility It is all about protecting personal and political turf While most of our leaders talk a good game in reality very little gets done Why is that I began to ponder Is it lack of vision Fortitude Support Funding Belief Testicals What exactly could it be Last time I checked technology was the fastest growing industry and sector It had the highest paying jobs and the potential for the most substantial increase in the tax revenue Why then would the state vote to cut the funding Additionally why did the coalition wait until a single week before the vote to attempt to rally the troops How much of a difference could we really make in just under a week While we dont yet know the outcome of the vote it begat a train of thought This led me to question all sorts of issues many of which remain unresolved and a few of which I am throwing in just for the hell of it While it is often quoted the story you are about to hear is real the names have been changed to protect the innocent none of that such shannangry that is a president Bush word if you were unsure will occur here No we are not protecting the names of the innocent because in our opinion most of them are not innocent If you are reading this outside of Chicago feel free to drop the names in of your own local leaders Im sure it will be as relevant Last the following has the most dramatic impact if you have ever heard the song by the quasi rapreggae artist Shaggy He has a great song titled it wasnt me The

longer than yours truly Women in Black is program that annually celebrates the achievement of women in the tech community Todd was upset that we dont do the same for those of the other gender but I had to take the politically correct posture as I was seated at the time and inform him that men dont need to be recognized for their contribution to tech as women do because we already get plenty of

the materials in this newsletter except by satirical inference Flip Resigns From divine Post Starts Band Buzzed MSP For Immediate Release divine Inc CEO Andrew Flip Filopowski has resigned from the organization and will soon begin touring with his blues band in support of his new album MultiMillionaires Blues divine is in sound financial shape Filiposwki said in a press conference earlier today Im comfortable leaving divine to fend for itself as I move on to greater opportunities When I came to the realization that divine and to a lesser extent Chicagos Internet presence could exist without my constant presence and supervision I began searching for another field I could put my stamp on and elevate Filipowski decided his next venture would be in the field of music Specifically the music of the Blues Filipowski formed a backup band The Cronies consisting as is his custom of former Platinum Technologies employees I realized that divine was not sufficiently about promoting myself Filipowski continued As such I consulted the Reverend Jesse Jackson as Rev Jackson is the only person I could think of that might be qualified to advise me on selfpromotion Eventually we determined much as Rev Jackson had become muchbeloved for reading Doctor Seuss on television that were I to record an album perhaps the general public could come to hold the sound of my voice in the same high esteem that I do Filipowski says his decision to take up the Blues was because of the musical genres strong association with Chicago and underperforming record sales People say I dont know what the Blues are about Filipowski commented To me anything thats not performing up to its potential has the Blues be it a company somebody who bothered to get an MBA from Harvard or even entire musical style From where Im sitting the Blues has the Blues Filipowski is on record as intending to singlehandedly save the Chicago Blues industry Filipowskis signature tune I Sold a Company For Million and I Cant Get No Respect appears to have a hit a popular chord with Silicon Valley executives generating enough buzz for Filipowski to predict a platinum record for the single Other tunes on the album include The IPO Blues I Cant Remember Which Residence I Left My Baby In and a remake of Careless Whispers dedicated to Chicago Internet watchdog Ron May When asked for comment Chicago Blues legend Buddy Guy

the Earth for the last years our economy has been guided by a similar myth The myth that technology was and would drive our economy In the last months however those of us in the technology field have felt like our entire world has collapsed around us With layoffs closing of dot coms the nosedive of the Nasdaq the disappearance of angel investors and the barricading of the doors to funding it seems like our entire world has fallen on dark times To our mind and the minds of all of the financial community the entire universe revolved around the failings of our technology sector and if so then the economy was surely doomed I being at the epicenter of technology for over years tended to agree with these sentiments But miraculously something strange has happened In a strange twist of revelation people are beginning to point out that the universe indeed does not revolve around the planet of technology it instead revolves around the economy as a whole Key planetary indicators like housing consumer spending large ticket items and automobiles are all holding strong Indeed it is increasingly clear that technology was merely one planet in the entire economic universe And as we now know all planets revolve around the Sun not around the Earth The universal economy as a whole is more like our solar system and is made up of many factors all microcosms in and of themselves much like moons and asteroids revolving around a single planet but yet all truly still revolving around Sol the core of our system So instead of a revolutionary idea driving our economy the economic philosophers of old are coming back into vogue As they have always said it was always about the Sun Technology is a part of our economic universe a planet perhaps maybe only a moon but certainly not the Sun Here are some interesting statistics gathered from a recent study The study from the Pew Internet American Life Project serves up a heaping dose of reality to those who were wearing neweconomy blinders Pew estimates only one in six Americans has been touched by dotcom death either knowing someone who was laid off missing a favorite site or losing money invested in the Net Some particulars Just percent say theyve lost money on a dotcomrelated investment Only percent lost one of their favorite sites because of the dotcom downturn And while TheStandardcoms Layoff Tracker has tallied nearly lost jobs among Internetrelated businesses just percent of those surveyed by Pew knew someone let go from an Internet Economy position More than twothirds of the respondents said they hadnt closely followed the dotcom devastation and one out of three said they didnt know anything about the cratering of the Internet Economy And this recently from Crains in Chicago Despite economic slowing the Chicago region added nearly jobs in the month period ended March hitting a record total and the highest total employment in a decade How can that be The tech world is collapsing Life will cease to exist The world will come to a stop This cant be Everything revolves around my planet of technology No more likely we will look back on this collapse years from now and consider it nothing more than a celestial eclipse Though we in the technology world feel like we are in a total eclipse of the sun the other planets economic indicators for those not following the astronomy analogy are in a partial eclipse if they are in one at all So think of the technology sector as being in a brief time when all in the world seems bathed in darkness But what was our light based upon Tech values were nonsensible and out of line consumer spending was higher than cost of living increases a false sense of wealth and prosperity had set in somethings were spending more cash in a year than they will ever see in their lifetime companies focused on hiring and expansion as opposed to prudent management of funds and the list goes on and on Yes as we approached the eclipse we thought the sun revolved around our planet and as we were the center of the economic universe we felt we could do no wrong However the Sun that great epicenter of the entire economy has cast a shadow on our lowly planet of technology Thus reminding us once again that all is in order in the universe Will the Sun shine again Of course it will Will we be the center of the economic universe no and we should never expect to be no planet is ever thus So right now the ones panicking from an absence of sunlight are the youngsters who have never seen or experienced an eclipse before If you are still not following I am referring to an economic downturn a slow down a correction or at worst a recession Yes if you talk to wise old sages those over who at least felt the pinch of the crash and those of the s s and s they will tell you it was always like this Sometimes the sun shines on you and sometimes you are left in the dark With my brief history in technology Sunshine and prosperity is all I have known But I should have known history doth have a way of repeating itself I often used to hear Son you werent around when the bio techs were going crazy The reference being that all explosively absurd events go through a correction an eclipse if you will History is fraught with such examples biotech oil gold automobiles railroads gold again tulips and once even spices like pepper and cumin the list goes on What will the next planet be that thinks the Sun doth revolve around it Yes history doth have a way of repeating itself however in the long run no matter what planet you are on you will be in the light more often than the dark Advert Buy palm and handheld software image Advert HEADLINES OF THE WEEK Eppraisalscom Appraises Self Finds Out Its Worthless Evanston IL Eppraisalscom who had received million in

inference McDonalds Acquires Failed Web Firms Sends Employees to Burger U Oak Brook IL Fast food giant McDonalds has entered the dotcom world with a big splash acquiring failed web firms at a breakneck pace Not an ordinary technology investor McDonalds is taking a corporate raiding approach to these acquisitions Instead of utilizing acquired firms to increase the corporations Internet presence McDonalds is taking a new spin on the increasingly popular Vulture Capital role selling off patents and equipment while retraining the acquired staff Getting employees that can make correct change and process orders properly is much more difficult than one might imagine McDonalds spokesman Harrison Dent explained Theres also the issue of convincing qualified teenagers that McDonalds is a cool place to work It all makes staffing very difficult for us Weve found that most web programmers have sufficient mathematical skill to make correct change as well as handle the digital readouts on microwaves and French Fry machines With the economic problems many web firms have been having compared with the cost of constantly recruiting new teenagers and replacing them as they go off to college it has become economical to simply acquire a struggling web firm selloff whatever assets they have and send their staff to Burger U for retraining in the business of family dining Dent went on to say that the various positions at web firms mapped out well with McDonalds staffing matrix Programmers being mathematically inclined would process the customer orders and make correct change Quality assurance workers are sent back to the kitchen making sure each burger they flip is up to corporate standards Technical support makes sure the grills and fryers stay in working order and that the floors are clean Managers continue to manage and accountants still do the books Initially there were concerns that due to the large number of foreign programmers that there might be some language problems with these workers taking orders However upon execution it was found that the problems with poor English skills were no greater than those currently existing in our Chicago operations McDonalds largest problems in converting employees seem to be dress code and unauthorized snacking Unfortunately the casual dress codes allowed at some of these firms have caused a culture clash Dent elucidated We have had some issues with employees showing up to work in dirty tshirts rather than in a McDonalds uniform Similarly many of the acquired firms provided free and unlimited snacks and drinks a policy which is not a staple of our organization Still Dent was upbeat about the prospects of transitioning the digital economy to the burger economy Advert Want to laugh at something besides business Indignant Online because ATTITUDE matters we have sports too Advert Brain Dead The Next PP By The Big Head In the battle of acronyms the first PP was pathtoprofitability Then we had PP as in peertopeer Though no one really knows if this is Napster type PP central server based or the SETI type PP distributed computing Regardless the next PP will be PrivatetoPublic as in privatetopublic exchanges The beginning of the BB revolution was led by public exchanges While the exchanges were nothing of the sort when one used to think of true exchanges Commodities Futures NASDAQ NYSE they did expose the public to the Internet space These exchanges as they were called were really nothing more than glorified auctions There was no exchanging going on because that is not what they were designed to do The idea of these early companies was to build a technology and then leverage the power of the Internet to create buying communities Whether it was buyers or sellers the premise was the same If the company chose to work on sell side mechanics then it was usually excess inventory of some sort put out into a platform where the highest bidder was the winner Conceptually this was a good idea However it was fraught with a few challenges First you needed lots of buyers to attract the sellers and vice versa thus liquidity was an issue Second none of these technologies took into account a payment mechanism or payment platform thus all settlement issues were handled offline While this may have been fine in modern times the premise of the Internet was to help eliminate such paper and timebased inefficiencies If the company chose to work on buy side mechanics then a buyer would list his request and suppliers could jump at the chance to bid for the opportunity This as well brought about its own set of challenges Namely the suppliers who were necessary for the validity of the auction stayed away The figured it out pretty quickly that they would only be bidding against themselves and their own margins Thus without enough suppliers you had no liquidity Where is the industry now On the Private Exchange model What the industry failed to take into account was the value of RELATIONSHIPS The relationship between buyers and sellers is a long term and trusted item Some relationships go back a hundred years Take Ford and Firestone for instance That relationship has been in existence since the dawn of the automobile You dont just build a technology and expect to steal those existing bonds away overnight Therefore the premise of the public exchange is to leverage the existing relationship between the buyers and sellers of companies industries and verticals The companies are saying give me a better way to deal with my own suppliers I trust these companies I know them I know their pricing and their deliverables heck I play golf with their CFO I want to keep them However I want to do it more efficiently What can technology and the web do to make my life easier in dealing with the known quantities that exist within my own company realm So now the push is to private exchanges A way to take big companies with hundreds or thousands of existing relationships and bring them to the web This creates immediate liquidity among groups of companies used to doing business with each other That makes sense and should be where the market focus was all along What will the evolution of this be That is where the new PP comes in What is PP you ask PrivatetoPublic exchanges While a private exchange focuses on existing customers a public exchange holds the promise of more buyers and sellers Thus more liquidity creates potentially more sales or more savings Ask yourself If I were a company would I be interested in new buyers and sellers for my goods Invariably the answer is yes A private exchange automates my existing relationships However find a way to provide me access to more buyers and sellers as well and know you really have my attention Where is the future of exchanges It should move toward a privatetopublic marketplace First make it easier to deal with my existing customer and supplier base Second give me more buyers and sellers for my goods Whether this means a melding of the different private exchanges in the future or several overlying technologies that provides access across many borders is yet to be seen Im willing to bet the future of BB commerce will lie somewhere in the neighborhood of the new PP Advert What You havent subscribed to The Chicago Brain Trust yet Get with the program click here subscriptionshtm Enough already

no one could decipher Mr Gates remarked After all when you take into account climate available human resources the transportation capabilities its a nobrainer Sources close to Gates indicated that

related story a spokesperson for Viagra was heard to remark upon hearing the news If Bill uses the Hefner model hed better stock up on our product After all if Windows were a man not only would there be performance problems but shutting down in the middle of a session is just not going to cut it Others in Chicago said that perhaps that was the real reason for the move Maybe moving to the Playboy Building will inspire them to create products that get issued to the public prematurely Premature issuance is a real problem especially when well you know a local government official was quoted as

been allowed a lesser dose of my medicine and while my frontal lobes are clear I took some time to visit the hospitals library You would be so surprised to see just how many things were collected ON PAPER before the Internet reared its ugly head The facility actually has a wonderful collection of old newspapers yes a paper document where content was placed on a daily basis and youll never believe this dear readers people actually paid to read it Really Im not kidding Anyway what I found enervating was that there were reallife stories in these newspaper things you know something called news that didnt entail a wonderfully endowed woman or a plastic faced man to interpret it for us Think of this crude idea a person called a reporter went to the site of some news event and now I know you wont believe this wrote down the FACTS Then and this is even more fantastic the editor a person who actually read all the written down stuff to see if it made reading sense let the reporter person put it in the paper exactly like it happened he didnt need to spin it or check with the advertisers first WOW No wonder newspapers have ceased to exist But I digress The article I snipped out of the paper seemed vaguely familiar to me but I couldnt place it No problem I called Mohan Sawhney my old buddy at Kellogg If hes at Kellogg and hes so famous why is it hes never been on the Corn Flakes box and asked him if he could make the connection for me After hour and minutes of phraseology like Strategic Insights into eBusiness Transformation I thanked him and rang off While he didnt provide further illumination he did tell me that Kansas was in the Midwest Rather than try to figure it out myself I decided to let you the reader provide me with clues to why this tickled my subconscious Please let

Failed Against Horse and Wagon For generations Samuel L Rosss family has adopted the latest technology to keep their farms production at the head of the class Everyone here abouts knows my father was the first to buy a Deere reaping machine back in he was quoted as saying during our recent interview But theres one thing you wont see on Rosss farm any of those new fangled inventions called the automobile That new fangled horseless carriage isnt going to cut it when it comes to getting my produce to market Ross said while standing along side his farm wagon and team of horses Why the dang thing needs gasoline every miles and it only hauls ton compared to ton I can fit on my wagon Even worse it scared the dickens out of Joe Roys filly Ross said he was approached by Ransom E Olds last year and talked into purchasing an REO Speed Wagon to use to move his produce to market in Salinas over miles away Eager for a competitive advantage Ross jumped at the change to try the auto But shortly after he purchased the horseless carriage problems came up They didnt tell me you needed gasoline to run the dang thing hell Ive got lots of oats but I got to go into Salinas once a week to get gallons of that stuff Then I learned its even more flammable than kerosene I cant keep it anywhere near the stove Sam went on to say that the REO needed things like a tune up and spark advance things he wasnt qualified to do so he needed to hire a mechanic Hell if Ida known that Ida never bought the thing Seems that the idea behind the auto was wrong Olds invented the speed wagon for smaller deliveries in towns like Salinas and when he tried to sell it outside of town it just didnt catch on In fact Olds has left the truck business and is concentrating on carriages for homeowners Hell hell fail even faster with that model Sam said No way families are going to use that But all is not lost Sams been approached by a gentleman named Francis E Stanley out of Maine who is trying to sell Ross a steam powered wagon Now Im really considering that he said Steam thats a proven technology just like my tractor and all them locomotives Next week Sam is taking delivery of the steam wagon

presence McDonalds is taking a new spin on the increasingly popular Vulture Capital role selling off patents and equipment while retraining the acquired staff Getting employees that can make correct change and process orders properly is much more difficult than one might imagine McDonalds spokesman Harrison Dent explained Theres also the issue of convincing qualified teenagers that McDonalds is a cool place to work It all makes staffing very difficult for us Weve found that most web programmers have sufficient mathematical skill to make correct change as well as handle the digital readouts on microwaves and French Fry machines With the economic problems many web firms have been having compared with the cost of constantly recruiting new teenagers and replacing them as they go off to college it has become economical to simply acquire a struggling web firm selloff whatever assets they have and send their staff to Burger U for retraining in the business of family dining Dent went on to say that the various positions at web firms mapped out well with McDonalds staffing matrix Programmers being mathematically inclined would process the customer orders and make correct change Quality

peertopeer Though no one really knows if this is Napster type PP central server based or the SETI type PP distributed computing Regardless the next PP will be PrivatetoPublic as in privatetopublic exchanges The beginning of the BB revolution was led by public exchanges While the exchanges were nothing of the sort when one used to think of true exchanges Commodities Futures NASDAQ NYSE they did expose the public to the Internet space These exchanges as they were called were really nothing more than glorified auctions There was no exchanging going on because that is not what they were designed to do The idea of these early companies was to build a technology and then leverage the power of the Internet to create buying communities Whether it was buyers or sellers the premise was the same If the company chose to work on sell side mechanics then it was usually excess inventory of some sort put out into a platform where the highest bidder was the winner Conceptually this was a good idea However it was fraught with a few challenges First you needed lots of buyers to attract the sellers and vice versa thus liquidity was an issue Second none of these technologies took into account a payment mechanism or payment platform thus all settlement issues were handled offline While this may have been fine in modern times the premise of the Internet was to help eliminate such paper and timebased inefficiencies If the company chose to work on buy side mechanics then a buyer would list his request and suppliers could jump at the chance to bid for the opportunity This as well brought about its own set of challenges Namely the suppliers who were necessary for the validity of the auction stayed away The figured it out pretty quickly that they would only be bidding against themselves and their own margins Thus without enough suppliers you had no liquidity Where is the industry now On the Private Exchange model What the industry failed to take into account was the value of RELATIONSHIPS The relationship between buyers and sellers is a long term and trusted item Some relationships go back a hundred years Take Ford and Firestone for instance That relationship has been in existence since the dawn of the automobile You dont just build a technology and expect to steal those existing bonds away overnight Therefore the premise of the public exchange is to leverage the existing relationship between the buyers and sellers of companies industries and verticals The companies are saying give me a better way to deal with my own suppliers I trust these companies I know them I know their pricing and their deliverables heck I play golf with their CFO I want to keep them However I want to do it more efficiently What can technology and the web do to make my life easier in dealing with the known quantities that exist within my own company realm So now the push is to private exchanges A way to take big companies with hundreds or thousands of existing relationships and bring them to the web This creates immediate liquidity among groups of companies used to doing business with each other That makes sense and should be where the market focus was all along What will the evolution of this be That is where the new PP comes in What is PP you ask PrivatetoPublic exchanges While a private exchange focuses on existing customers a public exchange holds the promise of more buyers and sellers Thus more liquidity creates potentially more sales or more savings Ask yourself If I were a company would I be interested in new buyers and sellers for my goods Invariably the answer is yes A private exchange automates my existing relationships However find a way to provide me access to more buyers and sellers as well and know you really have my attention Where is the future of exchanges It should move toward a privatetopublic marketplace First make it easier to deal with my existing customer and supplier base Second give me more buyers and sellers for my goods Whether this means a melding of the different private exchanges in the future or several overlying technologies that provides access across many borders is yet to be seen Im willing to bet the future of BB commerce will lie somewhere in the neighborhood of the new PP Advert What You havent subscribed to The Chicago Brain Trust yet Get with the program click here subscriptionshtm Enough already

headquarters to Chicago I was shocked an surprised to see that Boeing moved but then I checked out their rationale and concluded they were right Gates said Pointing to a PowerPoint presentation that no one could decipher Mr Gates remarked After all when you take into account climate available human resources the transportation capabilities its a nobrainer Sources close to Gates indicated that when Bill found out that the Playboy Building was available he jumped at the chance to move Its rumored that Bill has visions of taking on the mantra of Hefner now that hes stepped down as CEO of the worlds largest software company Evanston May Northwestern Universitys Mohan Sawhney Makes Internet Prediction that Comes True Yes thats right Professor Sawhney has actually made a prognostication that was borne out Last week the Professor predicted that Microsoft would move to Chicago After all when you take into account climate available human resources the transportation capabilities its a nobrainer Sawhney cited at a meeting of Internet gurus Sources close to Sawhney said that when the Professor heard that the Playboy Building was available he easily made the prediction Business is all about collaboration work flow and relationships And who was better at relationships that Hugh Hefner If Mr Gates can pick up where Mr Hefner left off Microsoft should be a winner Sawhney said In a related story a spokesperson for Viagra was heard to remark upon hearing the news If Bill uses the Hefner model hed better stock up on our product After all if Windows were a man not only would there be performance problems but shutting down in the middle of a session is just not going to cut it Others in Chicago said that perhaps that was the real reason for the move Maybe moving to the Playboy Building will inspire them to create products that get issued to the public prematurely Premature issuance is a real problem especially when well you know a local government official was quoted as remarking Most Chicagoans felt that that least the Windows wallpaper would likely be a bit less dull in the next Windows product line should Gates be ensconced in town Chicago May Britannica and

been allowed a lesser dose of my medicine and while my frontal lobes are clear I took some time to visit the hospitals library You would be so surprised to see just how many things were collected ON PAPER before the Internet reared its ugly head The facility actually has a wonderful collection of old newspapers yes a paper document where content was placed on a daily basis and youll never believe this dear readers people actually paid to read it Really Im not kidding Anyway what I found enervating was that there were reallife stories in these newspaper things you know something called news that didnt entail a wonderfully endowed woman or a plastic faced man to interpret it for us Think of this crude idea a person called a reporter went to the site of some news event and now I know you wont believe this wrote down the FACTS Then and this is even more fantastic the editor a person who actually read all the written down stuff to see if it made reading sense let the reporter person put it in the paper exactly like it happened he didnt need to spin it or check with the advertisers first WOW No wonder newspapers have ceased to exist But I digress The article I snipped out of the paper seemed vaguely familiar to me but I couldnt place it No problem I called Mohan Sawhney my old buddy at Kellogg If hes at Kellogg and hes so famous why is it hes never been on the Corn Flakes box and asked him if he could make the connection for me After hour and minutes of phraseology like Strategic Insights into eBusiness Transformation I thanked him and rang off While he didnt provide further illumination he did tell me that Kansas was in the Midwest Rather than try to figure it out myself I decided to let you the reader provide me with clues to why this tickled my subconscious Please let

Failed Against Horse and Wagon For generations Samuel L Rosss family has adopted the latest technology to keep their farms production at the head of the class Everyone here abouts knows my father was the first to buy a Deere reaping machine back in he was quoted as saying during our recent interview But theres one thing you wont see on Rosss farm any of those new fangled inventions called the automobile That new fangled horseless carriage isnt going to cut it when it comes to getting my produce to market Ross said while standing along side his farm wagon and team of horses Why the dang thing needs gasoline every miles and it only hauls ton compared to ton I can fit on my wagon Even worse it scared the dickens out of Joe Roys filly Ross said he was approached by Ransom E Olds last year and talked into purchasing an REO Speed Wagon to use to move his produce to market in Salinas over miles away Eager for a competitive advantage Ross jumped at the change to try the auto But shortly after he purchased the horseless carriage problems came up They didnt tell me you needed gasoline to run the dang thing hell Ive got lots of oats but I got to go into Salinas once a week to get gallons of that stuff Then I learned its even more flammable than kerosene I cant keep it anywhere near the stove Sam went on to say that the REO needed things like a tune up and spark advance things he wasnt qualified to do so he needed to hire a mechanic Hell if Ida known that Ida never bought the thing Seems that the idea behind the auto was wrong Olds invented the speed wagon for smaller deliveries in towns like Salinas and when he tried to sell it outside of town it just didnt catch on In fact Olds has left the truck business and is concentrating on carriages for homeowners Hell hell fail even faster with that model Sam said No way families are going to use that But all is not lost Sams been approached by a gentleman named Francis E Stanley out of Maine who is trying to sell Ross a steam powered wagon Now Im really considering that he said Steam thats a proven technology just like my tractor and all them locomotives Next week Sam is taking delivery of the steam wagon

organization and will soon begin touring with his blues band in support of his new album MultiMillionaires Blues divine is in sound financial shape Filiposwki said in a press conference earlier today Im comfortable leaving divine to fend for itself as I move on to greater opportunities When I came to the realization that divine and to a lesser extent Chicagos Internet presence could exist without my constant presence and supervision I began searching for another field I could put my stamp on and elevate Filipowski decided his next venture would be in the field of music Specifically the music of the Blues Filipowski formed a backup band The Cronies consisting as is his custom of former Platinum Technologies employees I realized that divine was not sufficiently about promoting myself Filipowski continued As such I consulted the Reverend Jesse Jackson as Rev Jackson is the only person I could think of that might be qualified to advise me on selfpromotion Eventually we determined much as Rev Jackson had become muchbeloved for reading Doctor Seuss on television that were I to record an album perhaps the general public could come to hold the sound of my voice in the same high esteem that I do Filipowski says his decision to take up the Blues was because of the musical genres strong association with Chicago and underperforming record sales People say I dont know what the Blues are about Filipowski commented To me anything thats not performing up to its potential has the Blues be it a company somebody who bothered to get an MBA from Harvard or even entire musical style From where Im sitting the Blues has the Blues Filipowski is on record as intending to singlehandedly save the Chicago Blues industry Filipowskis signature tune I Sold a Company For Million and I Cant Get No Respect appears to have a hit a popular chord with Silicon Valley executives generating enough buzz for Filipowski to predict a platinum record for the single Other tunes on the album include The IPO Blues I Cant Remember Which Residence I Left My Baby In and a remake of Careless Whispers dedicated to Chicago Internet watchdog Ron May When asked for comment Chicago Blues legend Buddy Guy

the Earth for the last years our economy has been guided by a similar myth The myth that technology was and would drive our economy In the last months however those of us in the technology field have felt like our entire world has collapsed around us With layoffs closing of dot coms the nosedive of the Nasdaq the disappearance of angel investors and the barricading of the doors to funding it seems like our entire world has fallen on dark times To our mind and the minds of all of the financial community the entire universe revolved around the failings of our technology sector and if so then the economy was surely doomed I being at the epicenter of technology for over years tended to agree with these sentiments But miraculously something strange has happened In a strange twist of revelation people are beginning to point out that the universe indeed does not revolve around the planet of technology it instead revolves around the economy as a whole Key planetary indicators like housing consumer spending large ticket items and automobiles are all holding strong Indeed it is increasingly clear that technology was merely one planet in the entire economic universe And as we now know all planets revolve around the Sun not around the Earth The universal economy as a whole is more like our solar system and is made up of many factors all microcosms in and of themselves much like moons and asteroids revolving around a single planet but yet all truly still revolving around Sol the core of our system So instead of a revolutionary idea driving our economy the economic philosophers of old are coming back into vogue As they have always said it was always about the Sun Technology is a part of our economic universe a planet perhaps maybe only a moon but certainly not the Sun Here are some interesting statistics gathered from a recent study The study from the Pew Internet American Life Project serves up a heaping dose of reality to those who were wearing neweconomy blinders Pew estimates only one in six Americans has been touched by dotcom death either knowing someone who was laid off missing a favorite site or losing money invested in the Net Some particulars Just percent say theyve lost money on a dotcomrelated investment Only percent lost one of their favorite sites because of the dotcom downturn And while TheStandardcoms Layoff Tracker has tallied nearly lost jobs among Internetrelated businesses just percent of those surveyed by Pew knew someone let go from an Internet Economy position More than twothirds of the respondents said they hadnt closely followed the dotcom devastation and one out of three said they didnt know anything about the cratering of the Internet Economy And this recently from Crains in Chicago Despite economic slowing the Chicago region added nearly jobs in the month period ended March hitting a record total and the highest total employment in a decade How can that be The tech world is collapsing Life will cease to exist The world will come to a stop This cant be Everything revolves around my planet of technology No more likely we will look back on this collapse years from now and consider it nothing more than a celestial eclipse Though we in the technology world feel like we are in a total eclipse of the sun the other planets economic indicators for those not following the astronomy analogy are in a partial eclipse if they are in one at all So think of the technology sector as being in a brief time when all in the world seems bathed in darkness But what was our light based upon Tech values were nonsensible and out of line consumer spending was higher than cost of living increases a false sense of wealth and prosperity had set in somethings were spending more cash in a year than they will ever see in their lifetime companies focused on hiring and expansion as opposed to prudent management of funds and the list goes on and on Yes as we approached the eclipse we thought the sun revolved around our planet and as we were the center of the economic universe we felt we could do no wrong However the Sun that great epicenter of the entire economy has cast a shadow on our lowly planet of technology Thus reminding us once again that all is in order in the universe Will the Sun shine again Of course it will Will we be the center of the economic universe no and we should never expect to be no planet is ever thus So right now the ones panicking from an absence of sunlight are the youngsters who have never seen or experienced an eclipse before If you are still not following I am referring to an economic downturn a slow down a correction or at worst a recession Yes if you talk to wise old sages those over who at least felt the pinch of the crash and those of the s s and s they will tell you it was always like this Sometimes the sun shines on you and sometimes you are left in the dark With my brief history in technology Sunshine and prosperity is all I have known But I should have known history doth have a way of repeating itself I often used to hear Son you werent around when the bio techs were going crazy The reference being that all explosively absurd events go through a correction an eclipse if you will History is fraught with such examples biotech oil gold automobiles railroads gold again tulips and once even spices like pepper and cumin the list goes on What will the next planet be that thinks the Sun doth revolve around it Yes history doth have a way of repeating itself however in the long run no matter what planet you are on you will be in the light more often than the dark Advert Buy palm and handheld software image Advert HEADLINES OF THE WEEK Eppraisalscom Appraises Self Finds Out Its Worthless Evanston IL Eppraisalscom who had received million in
