Enron XMDRcptTo XMDRemoteIP Sender XReturnPath XMDMailingList XMDSendNotificationsTo trash XMDaemonDeliverTo Bay Guardian article featuring ENRON Slick oil George W Bushs toxic money pipeline By Pratap Chatterjee EARLY LAST OCTOBER every member of a ninth grade girls track team and the freshman the football team at suburban Houstons Deer Park High Schools north campus returned from practice reporting severe breathing problems That day Deer Park registered parts of ozone per billion more than twice the federal standard and Houston surpassed Los Angeles as the smoggiest city in the United States One of the biggest sources of Deer Parks pollution is a plant owned by Enron Houstons wealthiest company d and the single largest contributor and counting to the political ambitions of Texas Governor and Republican presidential nominee George W Bush Kenneth Lay the chief executive of Enron has personally given over to Bushs political campaigns more than any other individual He is one of Bushs Pioneers d elite fundraisers who have collected at least in direct contributions of or less for Dubya Enron is best known as the largest buyer and seller of natural gas in the country Its revenues of billion make it the th largest company in the United States Enron is invested in energy projects around the world including the UK Argentina Bolivia Brazil the Philippines Indonesia China India and Mozambique The company has recently expanded from energy to bandwidth capacity for the Internet making it one of the worlds largest Internetbased trading companies buying and selling a dizzying array of products ranging from pulp and paper to petrochemicals and plastics as well as esoteric products like clean air credits that utilities purchase to meet emission limits Texas activists say that this tight connection between Bush and Lay bodes ill for the country if Bush is elected Andrew Wheat from Texans for Public Justice a campaign finance advocacy group in Austin compared the symbiotic relationship between Enron and the Governor to cogenerationa process used by utilities to harness waste heat vented by their generators to produce more power In a more sinister form of cogeneration corporations are converting economic into political power Wheat explained A Bush election fueled by Enron dollars could fill the White House with dangerous levels of Enron gas When that gas ignites in the publicpolicy arena consumers will get burned Indeed Bush campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan said that if elected president the governor is keen to promote the kind of policies that he has crafted with companies like Enron for the state of Texas The governor believes in competition free enterprise better service and technology improvements He has promoted sweeping and effective reforms in education and has been the first governor in Texas to seriously address limits on emissions He will carry his agenda to Washington to do what he believes is best for the country But is what Bush believes is good for Texas good for the United States Of America Texas has one of the worst environmental records in the country particularly in air pollution Unfortunately the Bush platform for the country is very similar to the kinds of programs that he has worked on with Enron d cutting corporate taxes deregulating industry and replacing social programs with private sector volunteerism In addition Enron is invested in energy projects around the globesome of which have been tainted by charges of human rights abuses In India construction of Enrons controversial Dhabol power plant has brought charges by international groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International of complicity with police brutality in rural communities And according to Californiabased Amazon watch Enron is charged with human rights violations in Bolivia where it is building a major gas pipeline threatening indigenous communities and the rainforest environment Special deals The Enron Methanol plant in Pasadena Texas lies in the Houston Ship Channel area the nations largest concentration of petrochemical plants just east of the city The Enron Methanol plant has won special concessions from Governor Bush allowing the company to pollute without a permit as well as giving the company immunity from prosecution for violating the law Indeed plants like this in Texas actually emit twice as many nitrogen oxides a key ingredient of smog as do all the nine million cars in Texas put together Only seven percent of the more than tons of nitrogen oxide emitted by the Enron Methanol plant in were permitted Enron got away with this under the grandfather clause of the Texas Clean Air Act which allows plants built before to continue their polluting practices Governor Bush extended this clause under the Clean Air Responsibility Enterprise CARE program that his office drew up in a series of secret meetings with representatives of the top polluters in the state CARE waives permit requirements for plants that volunteer to cut emissions The CARE program is backed up by an act that Bush signed in May giving sweeping protections to polluters who perform internal environmental or safety audits The law makes these audit documents confidential from the public and allows polluters to escape responsibility for environmental violations To date Enron has conducted five such audits and filed for immunity from prosecution for violations of the law according to the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission TNRCC the state equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency Tamara Maschini who lives about five miles from the Enron plant is one of the founders of a local environmental group called Clean Air Clear Lake Whole families in this neighborhood have asthma because of the pollution from plants like Enron she says Its gotten so bad that NASA has a problem recruiting people to work here at Mission Control which is just down the road Houston is in trouble and George Bush is the reason d he has allowed the situation to deteriorate over the past several years according to Maschini Mark Palmer head of public relations for Enron says that the companys contribution to local pollution is minimal If the grandfather clause was canceled right now we would benefit the most of any of the companies in Texas because our nitrogen oxide emissions add up to less than half a percent of the total he said Neil Carman a former employee of the Texas Air Control Board who now works for the Sierra Club agrees that Enrons grandfathered nitrogen emissions add up to less than one percent of the total for all of Texas However he points out that Enron Methanol plant alone contributes of the nitrogen oxide emissions from the nearly stationary sources of pollution for the city of Houston d the equivalent of cars Whats more he says that Enron is simply paying lip service to the Bush proposal to cut pollution at grand fathered plants Enron showed up at the governors press conference to volunteer for the CARE program but they have been missing in action ever since They havent even bothered to file their voluntary plan Giving and receiving If environmental regulators wanted to speak to Enrons senior officials about the missing voluntary program they would be well advised to follow the presidential candidate around as he is often chaperoned by Enron officials On April Ken Lay Enrons chief executive played host to Bush junior and his father former president George Bush at the Houston Astros first home game of the season at the baseball teams brand new stadium d Enron Field d which was built with the help of a million donation from Enron The company got free advertising a tax break and a million dollar contract to supply power to the stadium in return Less than three weeks later Lay joined Bush in Washington DC for a Republican fundraiser that topped all previous records by bringing in a staggering million easily the biggest onenight haul for any political party in history Thats not all Lay makes sure that the Bush presidential campaign has access to other Enron facilities Last year the Bush campaign borrowed Enrons corporate jets eight times to fly aides around the country more times than any of the other companies that made their company aircraft available to the presidential hopeful Under federal law campaigns must reimburse companies for transportation typically at the cost of a firstclass ticket so Enron received from the Bush campaign for this favor Lays ties to Bush junior begin with his father former President George Bush who was also a recipient of EnronLays financial largesse Like his son now Bush senior was also happy to return the favor appointing Lay to the Presidents Export Council from to When asked about the relationship between the two men Ray Sullivan a spokesman for the Bush campaign chose his words carefully Ken Lay is a noted business leader in Texas who has long been active in Republican politics He is chair of the Governors Business Council But the governor has his own agenda based on what he believes is best for Texas and for the country Lay toed a similar line when recently interviewed by the New York Times When I make contributions to a candidate it is not for some special favor its not even for access d although Ill be the first to admit it probably helps access It is because Im supporting candidates I strongly believe in personally Indeed both Lay and Enron are generous contributors to local and national politicians wherever they do business often following the long standing corporate practice of funding candidates on both sides of the election According to campaign records Enron and Lay have contributed to Democrats as diverse as Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro US Rep Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Texas House Speaker Gib Lewis In Lay was Harris County chairman of a aplate ReaganBush fundraiser while at the same time cochairing a fundraiser for US Sen Lloyd Bentsen the vice presidential candidate on the opposing ticket Bush delivers just the kind of results that Lay wants Candidate Bush says he will work with local jurisdictions using marketbased solutions and not try to sue our way or regulate our way to clean air and water He proposes allowing industries to voluntarily police themselves just like he did for Enron and the other polluters in Texas Texas has regularly ranked as the most environmentally polluted states in this country for years According to the Environmental Defense Fund Texas has the worst record of all states in air pollution water pollution overall toxic releases recognized carcinogens in the air suspected carcinogens in the air developmental toxins in the air affecting brain and nervoussystem development in children and cancer risk While it is true that Texas was the most polluted state in the country before George W Bush became governor the reason it has stayed that way is simple Bushs policies have effectively allowed these industries to continue to pollute through a system of voluntary compliance Read the fine print Ken Lay and Enrons political beliefs overlap with candidate Bush in other arenas such as education For example on August the Houston Astros will host a book drive at Enron Field to promote one of George W Bush and Enrons favorite charities d the Reach Out And Read ROAR literacy program Launched in by Laura Welch Bush the governors wife the program calls for physicians and nurse practitioners to give free culturally appropriate books to their preschool age patients at every checkup Enron also regularly volunteers its employees to read to children in area clinics and conducts book drives The cost to Enron for this five year publicity program was Susan Cooley the director of Texas ROAR was gushing in her support for the company the governor and his wife Ive been a nurse for years I dont know anything about sponsorship or advertising But at Enron they have whole departments to do this so finding a corporate sponsor has been a godsend she said However Enron is less than supportive of schools that do not provide similar public relations opportunities And its political reach goes beyond the governors mansion Some miles north of the companys headquarters in Houston Enron has effectively cut approximately from the annual budget of the Spring school district one of Houstons ethnically diverse poorer suburbs Spring Texas sits on top of Bammel Field a huge underground salt cave which Enron uses to store large quantities of natural gas As the largest business in Spring Enron was required to pay taxes based on the value of its property and mineral holdings on January st of each year But under a special provision Enron and other large business property owners were allowed to choose September st as their tax assessment date when the company has less gas stored in Bammel field Enron was able to reduce its property taxes by million in blowing a hole in the school districts budget according to Katherine Trumbull a tax accountant with the school district The Spring school district went to court to challenge the new tax provision as unconstitutional and won at the appeals court level Enron appealed this decision to the Texas Supreme Court While the case was pending Enrons Political Action Committee PAC and senior executives contributed heavily to the election campaigns of every Republican judges vying for seats all the members of the Texas Supreme Court are elected and may take money from contributors for the campaign expenses Enrons employees and PAC doled out between the seven of the winning justices in the campaign including more than from Ken Lay personally The Supreme Court justices ruled unanimously in Enrons favor on May a month after Lay gave Chief Justice Thomas Phillips for his campaign I have nothing against Enron after all they are our biggest taxpayer They can afford to pay for good lawyers and lobbyists and we cant says Trumbull simply Enrons Palmer had no comment about the tax lawsuit brought by the Spring Independent School District Enrons global muscle Enron has also courted Bushs help for its business abroad In March Lay wrote a letter to Bush that was subsequently released to the press under Texas open records laws asking him to contact every member of the Texas delegation to explain how export credit agencies of the United States are critical to US developers like Enron who are pursuing international projects in developing countries These agencies include the Overseas Private Investment Corporation OPIC a federal agency which provides political risk coverage and financial support to United States companies investing abroad d including hundreds of millions of dollars for Enron projects in countries from Brazil to India Unfortunately for communities in these countries Enrons investments have had devastating impact In India where Enron received million in political risk insurance for the Dabhol offshore oil and gas development project in the company has been blamed by both Human Rights Watch as well as Amnesty International for financing local police brutality Just before dawn on June police stormed the home of several women in Veldur a fishing village in western state of Maharashtra India The policemen forcibly opened the door and dragged me out of the house into the police van parked on the road While dragging me the police kept beating me on my back with batons says Sugandha Vasudev Bhalekar a year old housewife who was three months pregnant at the time of her arrest according to Amnesty International The humiliation meted out to the other members of my family was similar to the way I was humiliated my one and a half year old daughter held on to me but the police kicked her away The only crime committed by these women was to lead a peaceful protest against a massive new Enron natural gas plant An investigative team from Amnesty International found that a number of the women subsequently sustained injuries including bruising abrasions and lacerations on arms and legs Several hundred other peaceful protestors have been arrested and temporarily detained by Indian police since December according to the report Meanwhile a January investigation by Human Rights Watch revealed that the police were directly on the Enron payroll Likewise Enron has been severely criticized for the Cuiab Integrated Energy Project in Bolivia and Brazil for which it received US million in insurance from OPIC in On February an oil pipeline operated by Transredes a joint venture between Enron and Shell in the Cuiab Integrated Energy Project erupted in the Bolivian altiplano and dumped an estimated barrels of refined crude oil and gasoline into the Desaguadero River which supports indigenous communities like the Uru Moratos Facing starvation from the loss of their life sustaining waterfowl and fish the Uru Moratos left their ancestral lands at the southern shores of Lake Poopo in April and marched miles to the city of Oruro to ask for government help TK result Mutual selfinterest In January Enron pitched in to help pay for Bushs inaugural bash in Austin Texas when he won the reelection for governor If George W wins this November it is very likely Ken Lay will be on hand when Bush is inaugurated as the next president of the United States hoping that in return for Lays generous campaign Support Bush will be equally generous in his support for Enrons businesses at home and abroad in the future Craig McDonald director of Texans for Public Justice says that the relationship is bound to pay off Those two have a mutual selfinterest in being buddies Bush has always delivered on Ken Lays political pitches Enron depends upon government policies to enhance their bottom line in lots of ways The company relies upon this kind of access to government he recently told an Associated Press reporter It is people from the Uru Moratas of Bolivia to the school children of Deer Park and Spring Texas who will ultimately pay the price through the continued destruction of their communities and environment This story was made possible by the Corporate Watch Fund for Investigative Journalism Holly A Senn Senior Information Specialist MRW Associates Harrison St Ste Oakland CA p

yrmodayopedpalahtml August States Deregulate Energy at Their Peril By GREGORY PALAST ECONIC N Y While reporters ogled celebrities at Barbra Streisands bungalow during the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles there was a real display of populism miles to the south in San Diego There politicians have enrolled two million citizens in a scary economic experiment This year San Diego became the first city in California to experience the end of state regulation of electricity prices When Californias lawmakers voted to bring the miracle of market competition to electricity they wrote into the law that homeowners bills would fall by at least percent In fact bills jumped percent this August over last Rather than repudiate this mad market experiment the federal government and other states New York included have rushed to imitate Californias lead Actually Californians were lucky Every hour of every day San Diego Gas and Electric the local utility must now buy its electricity at a state auction known as a power pool On the first hot day this summer during the noonday heat the companies that produce the power newly deregulated cranked up their bids to per megawatt hour Thats about percent more than the oncecontrolled price of but it could have been worse According to those inside the secretive auction agency sellers assumed the pools computers could handle only fourdigit bids In fact the computers could have accepted bids for seven figures and bankrupted a chunk of the state in a day One can trace Californias electricity market plague largely to a single source Daniel Fessler In the early s Mr Fessler then president of the states Public Utilities Commission developed an infatuation with one of Margaret Thatchers freemarket ventures the troubled EnglandWales Power Pool How strange Britons pay about percent more for electricity than Americans Thats hardly a surprise as each day around tea time when Englands usage peaks a small clique of power plant owners take over the electricity auction bidding up prices by to percent In the United States utilities vowed they would play no such tricks if California removed the limits on profits that have been at the core of regulation policy for the past years The promise lasted several months during which time five giant international electricity sellers all new to California imported the techniques theyd learned in Britain stacking cramming phantom scheduling and other maneuvers designed to manipulate the bidding process and in a single month produce profits once permitted for an entire year The deregulation bug is now winging eastward New York City for example has succumbed to percent average increases in Con Edison bills But in San Diego something extraordinary happened This month thousands joined an unprecedented consumers boycott The power companies can send out their bloated bills but the tanned masses wont pay Refuseniks include the Council of Churches the school district and without a hint of shame Steve Peace a state senator who sponsored the deregulation law The electricity fiasco should be a godsend for Al Gores campaign After all it was Mr Fessler and his fellow Republicans who threw Californias consumers to the meager mercies of the marketplace And Gov George W Bush pushed through deregulation in Texas which is widely expected to produce hefty returns for a former business partner Sam Wyly owner of GreenMountaincom a power seller But while Mr Gore spoke out in Los Angeles against powerful forces on this subject hes in a difficult position Despite recent warnings from federal regulators about the California situation the ClintonGore administration has promoted Californiastyle deregulation as a model for the nation Someones ready to feel Californias pain and it may not be good news for Mr Gore During the Democrats big show Ralph Nader went to San Diego to remind boycotters that he was founding father of the Utility Consumer Action Network the member local group leading the anticorporate uprising Electricity is the first big United States industry formerly under the tight control of states to be opened up to international operators and their free market rules

Enron XMDRcptTo XMDRemoteIP Sender XReturnPath XMDMailingList XMDSendNotificationsTo trash XMDaemonDeliverTo Bay Guardian article featuring ENRON Slick oil George W Bushs toxic money pipeline By Pratap Chatterjee EARLY LAST OCTOBER every member of a ninth grade girls track team and the freshman the football team at suburban Houstons Deer Park High Schools north campus returned from practice reporting severe breathing problems That day Deer Park registered parts of ozone per billion more than twice the federal standard and Houston surpassed Los Angeles as the smoggiest city in the United States One of the biggest sources of Deer Parks pollution is a plant owned by Enron Houstons wealthiest company d and the single largest contributor and counting to the political ambitions of Texas Governor and Republican presidential nominee George W Bush Kenneth Lay the chief executive of Enron has personally given over to Bushs political campaigns more than any other individual He is one of Bushs Pioneers d elite fundraisers who have collected at least in direct contributions of or less for Dubya Enron is best known as the largest buyer and seller of natural gas in the country Its revenues of billion make it the th largest company in the United States Enron is invested in energy projects around the world including the UK Argentina Bolivia Brazil the Philippines Indonesia China India and Mozambique The company has recently expanded from energy to bandwidth capacity for the Internet making it one of the worlds largest Internetbased trading companies buying and selling a dizzying array of products ranging from pulp and paper to petrochemicals and plastics as well as esoteric products like clean air credits that utilities purchase to meet emission limits Texas activists say that this tight connection between Bush and Lay bodes ill for the country if Bush is elected Andrew Wheat from Texans for Public Justice a campaign finance advocacy group in Austin compared the symbiotic relationship between Enron and the Governor to cogenerationa process used by utilities to harness waste heat vented by their generators to produce more power In a more sinister form of cogeneration corporations are converting economic into political power Wheat explained A Bush election fueled by Enron dollars could fill the White House with dangerous levels of Enron gas When that gas ignites in the publicpolicy arena consumers will get burned Indeed Bush campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan said that if elected president the governor is keen to promote the kind of policies that he has crafted with companies like Enron for the state of Texas The governor believes in competition free enterprise better service and technology improvements He has promoted sweeping and effective reforms in education and has been the first governor in Texas to seriously address limits on emissions He will carry his agenda to Washington to do what he believes is best for the country But is what Bush believes is good for Texas good for the United States Of America Texas has one of the worst environmental records in the country particularly in air pollution Unfortunately the Bush platform for the country is very similar to the kinds of programs that he has worked on with Enron d cutting corporate taxes deregulating industry and replacing social programs with private sector volunteerism In addition Enron is invested in energy projects around the globesome of which have been tainted by charges of human rights abuses In India construction of Enrons controversial Dhabol power plant has brought charges by international groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International of complicity with police brutality in rural communities And according to Californiabased Amazon watch Enron is charged with human rights violations in Bolivia where it is building a major gas pipeline threatening indigenous communities and the rainforest environment Special deals The Enron Methanol plant in Pasadena Texas lies in the Houston Ship Channel area the nations largest concentration of petrochemical plants just east of the city The Enron Methanol plant has won special concessions from Governor Bush allowing the company to pollute without a permit as well as giving the company immunity from prosecution for violating the law Indeed plants like this in Texas actually emit twice as many nitrogen oxides a key ingredient of smog as do all the nine million cars in Texas put together Only seven percent of the more than tons of nitrogen oxide emitted by the Enron Methanol plant in were permitted Enron got away with this under the grandfather clause of the Texas Clean Air Act which allows plants built before to continue their polluting practices Governor Bush extended this clause under the Clean Air Responsibility Enterprise CARE program that his office drew up in a series of secret meetings with representatives of the top polluters in the state CARE waives permit requirements for plants that volunteer to cut emissions The CARE program is backed up by an act that Bush signed in May giving sweeping protections to polluters who perform internal environmental or safety audits The law makes these audit documents confidential from the public and allows polluters to escape responsibility for environmental violations To date Enron has conducted five such audits and filed for immunity from prosecution for violations of the law according to the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission TNRCC the state equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency Tamara Maschini who lives about five miles from the Enron plant is one of the founders of a local environmental group called Clean Air Clear Lake Whole families in this neighborhood have asthma because of the pollution from plants like Enron she says Its gotten so bad that NASA has a problem recruiting people to work here at Mission Control which is just down the road Houston is in trouble and George Bush is the reason d he has allowed the situation to deteriorate over the past several years according to Maschini Mark Palmer head of public relations for Enron says that the companys contribution to local pollution is minimal If the grandfather clause was canceled right now we would benefit the most of any of the companies in Texas because our nitrogen oxide emissions add up to less than half a percent of the total he said Neil Carman a former employee of the Texas Air Control Board who now works for the Sierra Club agrees that Enrons grandfathered nitrogen emissions add up to less than one percent of the total for all of Texas However he points out that Enron Methanol plant alone contributes of the nitrogen oxide emissions from the nearly stationary sources of pollution for the city of Houston d the equivalent of cars Whats more he says that Enron is simply paying lip service to the Bush proposal to cut pollution at grand fathered plants Enron showed up at the governors press conference to volunteer for the CARE program but they have been missing in action ever since They havent even bothered to file their voluntary plan Giving and receiving If environmental regulators wanted to speak to Enrons senior officials about the missing voluntary program they would be well advised to follow the presidential candidate around as he is often chaperoned by Enron officials On April Ken Lay Enrons chief executive played host to Bush junior and his father former president George Bush at the Houston Astros first home game of the season at the baseball teams brand new stadium d Enron Field d which was built with the help of a million donation from Enron The company got free advertising a tax break and a million dollar contract to supply power to the stadium in return Less than three weeks later Lay joined Bush in Washington DC for a Republican fundraiser that topped all previous records by bringing in a staggering million easily the biggest onenight haul for any political party in history Thats not all Lay makes sure that the Bush presidential campaign has access to other Enron facilities Last year the Bush campaign borrowed Enrons corporate jets eight times to fly aides around the country more times than any of the other companies that made their company aircraft available to the presidential hopeful Under federal law campaigns must reimburse companies for transportation typically at the cost of a firstclass ticket so Enron received from the Bush campaign for this favor Lays ties to Bush junior begin with his father former President George Bush who was also a recipient of EnronLays financial largesse Like his son now Bush senior was also happy to return the favor appointing Lay to the Presidents Export Council from to When asked about the relationship between the two men Ray Sullivan a spokesman for the Bush campaign chose his words carefully Ken Lay is a noted business leader in Texas who has long been active in Republican politics He is chair of the Governors Business Council But the governor has his own agenda based on what he believes is best for Texas and for the country Lay toed a similar line when recently interviewed by the New York Times When I make contributions to a candidate it is not for some special favor its not even for access d although Ill be the first to admit it probably helps access It is because Im supporting candidates I strongly believe in personally Indeed both Lay and Enron are generous contributors to local and national politicians wherever they do business often following the long standing corporate practice of funding candidates on both sides of the election According to campaign records Enron and Lay have contributed to Democrats as diverse as Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro US Rep Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Texas House Speaker Gib Lewis In Lay was Harris County chairman of a aplate ReaganBush fundraiser while at the same time cochairing a fundraiser for US Sen Lloyd Bentsen the vice presidential candidate on the opposing ticket Bush delivers just the kind of results that Lay wants Candidate Bush says he will work with local jurisdictions using marketbased solutions and not try to sue our way or regulate our way to clean air and water He proposes allowing industries to voluntarily police themselves just like he did for Enron and the other polluters in Texas Texas has regularly ranked as the most environmentally polluted states in this country for years According to the Environmental Defense Fund Texas has the worst record of all states in air pollution water pollution overall toxic releases recognized carcinogens in the air suspected carcinogens in the air developmental toxins in the air affecting brain and nervoussystem development in children and cancer risk While it is true that Texas was the most polluted state in the country before George W Bush became governor the reason it has stayed that way is simple Bushs policies have effectively allowed these industries to continue to pollute through a system of voluntary compliance Read the fine print Ken Lay and Enrons political beliefs overlap with candidate Bush in other arenas such as education For example on August the Houston Astros will host a book drive at Enron Field to promote one of George W Bush and Enrons favorite charities d the Reach Out And Read ROAR literacy program Launched in by Laura Welch Bush the governors wife the program calls for physicians and nurse practitioners to give free culturally appropriate books to their preschool age patients at every checkup Enron also regularly volunteers its employees to read to children in area clinics and conducts book drives The cost to Enron for this five year publicity program was Susan Cooley the director of Texas ROAR was gushing in her support for the company the governor and his wife Ive been a nurse for years I dont know anything about sponsorship or advertising But at Enron they have whole departments to do this so finding a corporate sponsor has been a godsend she said However Enron is less than supportive of schools that do not provide similar public relations opportunities And its political reach goes beyond the governors mansion Some miles north of the companys headquarters in Houston Enron has effectively cut approximately from the annual budget of the Spring school district one of Houstons ethnically diverse poorer suburbs Spring Texas sits on top of Bammel Field a huge underground salt cave which Enron uses to store large quantities of natural gas As the largest business in Spring Enron was required to pay taxes based on the value of its property and mineral holdings on January st of each year But under a special provision Enron and other large business property owners were allowed to choose September st as their tax assessment date when the company has less gas stored in Bammel field Enron was able to reduce its property taxes by million in blowing a hole in the school districts budget according to Katherine Trumbull a tax accountant with the school district The Spring school district went to court to challenge the new tax provision as unconstitutional and won at the appeals court level Enron appealed this decision to the Texas Supreme Court While the case was pending Enrons Political Action Committee PAC and senior executives contributed heavily to the election campaigns of every Republican judges vying for seats all the members of the Texas Supreme Court are elected and may take money from contributors for the campaign expenses Enrons employees and PAC doled out between the seven of the winning justices in the campaign including more than from Ken Lay personally The Supreme Court justices ruled unanimously in Enrons favor on May a month after Lay gave Chief Justice Thomas Phillips for his campaign I have nothing against Enron after all they are our biggest taxpayer They can afford to pay for good lawyers and lobbyists and we cant says Trumbull simply Enrons Palmer had no comment about the tax lawsuit brought by the Spring Independent School District Enrons global muscle Enron has also courted Bushs help for its business abroad In March Lay wrote a letter to Bush that was subsequently released to the press under Texas open records laws asking him to contact every member of the Texas delegation to explain how export credit agencies of the United States are critical to US developers like Enron who are pursuing international projects in developing countries These agencies include the Overseas Private Investment Corporation OPIC a federal agency which provides political risk coverage and financial support to United States companies investing abroad d including hundreds of millions of dollars for Enron projects in countries from Brazil to India Unfortunately for communities in these countries Enrons investments have had devastating impact In India where Enron received million in political risk insurance for the Dabhol offshore oil and gas development project in the company has been blamed by both Human Rights Watch as well as Amnesty International for financing local police brutality Just before dawn on June police stormed the home of several women in Veldur a fishing village in western state of Maharashtra India The policemen forcibly opened the door and dragged me out of the house into the police van parked on the road While dragging me the police kept beating me on my back with batons says Sugandha Vasudev Bhalekar a year old housewife who was three months pregnant at the time of her arrest according to Amnesty International The humiliation meted out to the other members of my family was similar to the way I was humiliated my one and a half year old daughter held on to me but the police kicked her away The only crime committed by these women was to lead a peaceful protest against a massive new Enron natural gas plant An investigative team from Amnesty International found that a number of the women subsequently sustained injuries including bruising abrasions and lacerations on arms and legs Several hundred other peaceful protestors have been arrested and temporarily detained by Indian police since December according to the report Meanwhile a January investigation by Human Rights Watch revealed that the police were directly on the Enron payroll Likewise Enron has been severely criticized for the Cuiab Integrated Energy Project in Bolivia and Brazil for which it received US million in insurance from OPIC in On February an oil pipeline operated by Transredes a joint venture between Enron and Shell in the Cuiab Integrated Energy Project erupted in the Bolivian altiplano and dumped an estimated barrels of refined crude oil and gasoline into the Desaguadero River which supports indigenous communities like the Uru Moratos Facing starvation from the loss of their life sustaining waterfowl and fish the Uru Moratos left their ancestral lands at the southern shores of Lake Poopo in April and marched miles to the city of Oruro to ask for government help TK result Mutual selfinterest In January Enron pitched in to help pay for Bushs inaugural bash in Austin Texas when he won the reelection for governor If George W wins this November it is very likely Ken Lay will be on hand when Bush is inaugurated as the next president of the United States hoping that in return for Lays generous campaign Support Bush will be equally generous in his support for Enrons businesses at home and abroad in the future Craig McDonald director of Texans for Public Justice says that the relationship is bound to pay off Those two have a mutual selfinterest in being buddies Bush has always delivered on Ken Lays political pitches Enron depends upon government policies to enhance their bottom line in lots of ways The company relies upon this kind of access to government he recently told an Associated Press reporter It is people from the Uru Moratas of Bolivia to the school children of Deer Park and Spring Texas who will ultimately pay the price through the continued destruction of their communities and environment This story was made possible by the Corporate Watch Fund for Investigative Journalism Holly A Senn Senior Information Specialist MRW Associates Harrison St Ste Oakland CA p

Angeles there was a real display of populism miles to the south in San Diego There politicians have enrolled two million citizens in a scary economic experiment This year San Diego became the first city in California to experience the end of state regulation of electricity prices When Californias lawmakers voted to bring the miracle of market competition to electricity they wrote into the law that homeowners bills would fall by at least percent In fact bills jumped percent this August over last Rather than repudiate this mad market experiment the federal government and other states New York included have rushed to imitate Californias lead Actually Californians were lucky Every hour of every day San Diego Gas and Electric the local utility must now buy its electricity at a state auction known as a power pool On the first hot day this summer during the noonday heat the companies that produce the power newly deregulated cranked up their bids to per megawatt hour Thats about percent more than the oncecontrolled price of but it could have been worse According to those inside the secretive auction agency sellers assumed the pools computers could handle only fourdigit bids In fact the computers could have accepted bids for seven figures and bankrupted a chunk of the state in a day One can trace Californias electricity market plague largely to a single source Daniel Fessler In the early s Mr Fessler then president of the states Public Utilities Commission developed an infatuation with one of Margaret Thatchers freemarket ventures the troubled EnglandWales Power Pool How strange Britons pay about percent more for electricity than Americans Thats hardly a surprise as each day around tea time when Englands usage peaks a small clique of power plant owners take over the electricity auction bidding up prices by to percent In the United States utilities vowed they would play no such tricks if California removed the limits on profits that have been at the core of regulation policy for the past years The promise lasted several months during which time five giant international electricity sellers all new to California imported the techniques theyd learned in Britain stacking cramming phantom scheduling and other maneuvers designed to manipulate the bidding process and in a single month produce profits once permitted for an entire year The deregulation bug is now winging eastward New York City for example has succumbed to percent average increases in Con Edison bills But in San Diego something extraordinary happened This month thousands joined an unprecedented consumers boycott The power companies can send out their bloated bills but the tanned masses wont pay Refuseniks include the Council of Churches the school district and without a hint of shame Steve Peace a state senator who sponsored the deregulation law The electricity fiasco should be a godsend for Al Gores campaign After all it was Mr Fessler and his fellow Republicans who threw Californias consumers to the meager mercies of the marketplace And Gov George W Bush pushed through deregulation in Texas which is widely expected to produce hefty returns for a former business partner Sam Wyly owner of GreenMountaincom a power seller But while Mr Gore spoke out in Los Angeles against powerful forces on this subject hes in a difficult position Despite recent warnings from federal regulators about the California situation the ClintonGore administration has promoted Californiastyle deregulation as a model for the nation Someones ready to feel Californias pain and it may not be good news for Mr Gore During the Democrats big show Ralph Nader went to San Diego to remind boycotters that he was founding father of the Utility Consumer Action Network the member local group leading the anticorporate uprising Electricity is the first big United States industry formerly under the tight control of states to be opened up to international operators and their free market rules
