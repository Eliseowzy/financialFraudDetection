by Alan ComnesPDXECT on PM Alan Comnes PM To Tim CT Christian CT Jeff CT Robert CT Steve C CT Bill Williams CT cc Susan J NRON Joe NRON Subject FERC Staff market mitigation comments for CaliforniaComments of EnronDUE WEDNESDAY To West Desk Traders in Cali On Thursday FERC will accept comments on its staffs plan to provide market mitigation to California ISO markets A summary of the report is copied below Enron GA plans to file a motion that will support the comments of EPSA and WPTF and supplement the comments as noted below EPSAs comments are generally supportive of the staff report but recommends that FERC clarify that staffs market mitigation measures are being put into place to address structural defects in the California market not the abuse of market power by any market participants avoid the use of costbased rates as a proxy for competitive prices during times of scarcity ensure that if costbased proxy rates are used those rates includes the full value of scarcity capacity opportunity costs and other factors develop proxy rates if necessary using the formula in the March th Refund Order RATHER THAN the unit specific marginal costs identified in the order and forego forced bidding into realtime markets WPTF will make similar comments generally with more color and vehemence and will also raise how lack of creditworthiness will affect price I also recommend we supplement the EPSAWPTF comments with some additional comments on energylimited resources see attached Please prove Sue Mara or I with your comments by COB Wednesday Thank you Alan Comnes Report Summary from EPSA Stressing that the proposal is designed to apply only to approximately five percent of the market that remains in realtime and not to the bilateral and forward markets the Report immediately notes that ultimately the real solution to Californias problems lies in increased investments in infrastructure The Report recommends that the California ISO conduct a realtime auction with associated measures to mitigate the impact of physical and economic withholding and significant exercises of market power during periods of scarcity Coordinating and Controlling Outages The ISO should coordinate and approve all planned outages by units that have a Participating Generator Agreement PGA with the ISO Coordination and outage control procedures should then be coupled with reporting requirements to FERC and dispute review should be expedited Similarly the ISO should closely monitor unplanned outages and report questionable outages to FERC for further investigation Selling Obligations All capacity that is available and not scheduled to run under sellers with PGAs should be offered in the realtime market this obligation would not be imposed on bilateral markets of the ISO dayahead markets PGA generators would have to submit to FERC a dependable capacity for each unit in addition to other operating parameters necessary to calculate marginal costs such as heat rate FERC Staff would then use this data in combination with published fuel costs and emission credit data to determine a price that the ISO would use predetermined to mitigate prices during times of reserve deficiency Load Serving Entities should also be required to name their curtailment price and to identify which loads will be curtailed Price Mitigation When called upon to provide the available and unscheduled capacity as mentioned above PGA unit prices would be mitigated in hours when there is a reserve deficiency or Stage emergencies the Report notes that it is these hours which are extremely conducive to the exercise of market power by suppliers and will be obligated to sell capacity in realtime at the marginal cost of the highestpriced PGA until called upon to run Realtime Price Mitigation for Each Generating Unit all generating units should have a standing confidential price based on its marginal costs This price will be used by the ISO to establish the realtime market clearing price when mitigation is appropriate Staff believes that a single market clearing price auction design is appropriate thus reversing the recommendation to use an as bid design in the December Order Market Clearing Price All realtime energy offers should be paid the applicable market clearing price Conditions for Invoking Mitigation Mitigation measures should only be applied to critical operating periods such as emergencies As noted in the Report Staff recognizes that there are potential difficulties in implementing the proposal and that there are no easy answers to the current problems in the California market Among the purported difficulties Staff notes implementation problems with bidding obligations on imported power incentive effects on load scheduling treatment of purchased power mitigating prices during emergencies and setting a price component for scarcity

Report Summary from EPSA Stressing that the proposal is designed to apply only to approximately five percent of the market that remains in realtime and not to the bilateral and forward markets the Report immediately notes that ultimately the real solution to Californias problems lies in increased investments in infrastructure The Report recommends that the California ISO conduct a realtime auction with associated measures to mitigate the impact of physical and economic withholding and significant exercises of market power during periods of scarcity Coordinating and Controlling Outages The ISO should coordinate and approve all planned outages by units that have a Participating Generator Agreement PGA with the ISO Coordination and outage control procedures should then be coupled with reporting requirements to FERC and dispute review should be expedited Similarly the ISO should closely monitor unplanned outages and report questionable outages to FERC for further investigation Selling Obligations All capacity that is available and not scheduled to run under sellers with PGAs should be offered in the realtime market this obligation would not be imposed on bilateral markets of the ISO dayahead markets PGA generators would have to submit to FERC a dependable capacity for each unit in addition to other operating parameters necessary to calculate marginal costs such as heat rate FERC Staff would then use this data in combination with published fuel costs and emission credit data to determine a price that the ISO would use predetermined to mitigate prices during times of reserve deficiency Load Serving Entities should also be required to name their curtailment price and to identify which loads will be curtailed Price Mitigation When called upon to provide the available and unscheduled capacity as mentioned above PGA unit prices would be mitigated in hours when there is a reserve deficiency or Stage emergencies the Report notes that it is these hours which are extremely conducive to the exercise of market power by suppliers and will be obligated to sell capacity in realtime at the marginal cost of the highestpriced PGA until called upon to run Realtime Price Mitigation for Each Generating Unit all generating units should have a standing confidential price based on its marginal costs This price will be used by the ISO to establish the realtime market clearing price when mitigation is appropriate Staff believes that a single market clearing price auction design is appropriate thus reversing the recommendation to use an as bid design in the December Order Market Clearing Price All realtime energy offers should be paid the applicable market clearing price Conditions for Invoking Mitigation Mitigation measures should only be applied to critical operating periods such as emergencies As noted in the Report Staff recognizes that there are potential difficulties in implementing the proposal and that there are no easy answers to the current

December Honorable James Hoecker Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC Dear Chairman Hoecker I told you on November in San Diego that by December I would respond to your plan with my suggestions to protect the interests of the people and businesses of California by providing reliable electricity supplies at the lowest reasonable cost Obviously a complete plan by the State of Californ ia must await your review of my suggested changes to your proposed order and final action on that order on December This letter outlines the first steps toward a plan that my administration is developing based on extensive ongoing discussions with legislative leaders consumers business utilitie s generators environmentalists labor agricultural interests and other California stakeholders This emerging plan will indicate to you that I am prepared to act with the concurrence of the Legislature in California to fulfill our obligations to assure reliable service at reasonable costs to the consumer The free market applied to electricity can work but only if market conditions allow for real competition and if all parties act responsibly The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has found that the wholesal e market in California is dysfunctional and that the wholesale prices charged by generators in your jurisdiction are unjust and unreasonable For that reason I renew my call for the FERC to undertake the actions that are critical and clearly within your jurisdiction to order retroactiv e refunds to the consumers who have been harmed this year and to establish hard price and bid caps that will protect consumers until the energy marketplace becomes truly competitive I do not believe that your proposed MW clearing price limit will provide any real protection I again ask you to impose real price and bid caps in the MW range on a transitiona l basis over the next months If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale markets the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited in scope I cannot in good conscience however forego any measure that wou ld serve to protect the people of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale markets will not victimize Californians again Since our meeting in San Diego several things have occurred which influenc e my current thinking On November the California Energy Commission CEC published the results of a detailed bottomup study of available electricity supply for It shows that taking into account expected load growth firm and dynamically scheduled imports and new supply already under construction or under contract California should be able to avoid emergencies if supplie s are properly managed and scheduled This presumes of course no gaming or withholding by sellers in wholesale markets and an absence of panic buying But the CEC study also shows that supplies are sufficiently tight that mark et power will exist and will need to be mitigated during periods of high deman d The same opportunity for wholesale price gouging through the exercise of market power and withholding that existed in summer will exist in You must take decisive action to preclude such behavior During the week of November while you and regulatory commissioners from around the country were in San Diego California was subjected to several Stage Alerts reflecting severe shortages of generation even though these are the lowest load months of the year Prices were astronomical More than megawatts of generation were offline at the same time including over megawatts for unscheduled outages I will recommend steps to assure that existing resources in California are availab le to meet Californias local energy needs and that information and the authority necessary to prevent a recurrence of such events are available to state and local officials On November the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and Electricity Oversight Board EOB filed comments with you that summarize th e current status of their ongoing investigations They confirm the conclusion s of the independent market monitors that California has been victimized by t he exercise of market power by merchant generators and marketers during summer and fall The state agencies have been hampered in their investigation s by the refusal of merchant generators to provide information that will both assist in the understanding of last summers prices and in the fashionin g of remedies to assure that we are not victimized again I urge you to compel t he necessary disclosure of information to complete these investigations On November the CPUC issued an Environmental Impact Report EIR on the proposal by PGE to move its hydroelectric facilities out of the regulated utility The EIR concludes that such a project would cause significant unmitigated harm to the environment and recommends retention as the preferr ed alternative This suggests that Californias course of generation divest iture by utilities may be slowed or stopped With these events as background I want to describe the steps I have taken and plan to take to begin to address the energy problems in California Increase Supply and Expand Infrastructure During the years preceding my administration virtually no power plants were built in California Since April six power plants representing MW of new generation have been approved by the CEC Five of these plants are under construction and the sixth will begin construction no later than April Twenty more applicants have completed prefiling and have active applications under review by the commission staff Eleven more applications are in the prefiling stage This represents a significant change in policy and performance and responds to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and environmental protection Much has been made about the difficulty of siting and permitting generation in California With enactment of AB and the creation of the Governor s Clean Energy Green Team this September California has aggressively committ ed itself to continue to accelerate the siting and permitting of generation an d to coordinate local state and federal government agency review and action Federal and state air quality requirements present unique challenges to the construction and operation of new power plants Through the Green Team we are developing new and creative approaches to meet these challenges workin g with local air quality districts the California Air Resources Board and th e United States Environmental Protection Agency These might for example expand upon the case of the proposed Otay Mesa power plant where mobile emissions credits are being used to offset stationary source emissions that will be generated by the new facility If necessary I will seek legislatio n to enable these new approaches I am also calling on the CPUC to aggressively reduce barriers and to otherwise encourage the locating of distributed generation and cogeneratio n where it is viable cost effective and environmentally sound The CPUC has already initiated action that will provide a forum for expediting certificates for transmission facilities including environmental review Finally I believe it is important to assure that all supplies of electrici ty are available when emergency conditions exist to avoid interruptions such as those experienced last summer and as recently as last week Suggestions we are considering for achieving this include new means of coordinating powerplant maintenance and operations activities Forward Contracting by Utilities Many parties including the FERC have recommended expanding the use of forward contracting by the utilities including multiyear bilateral contracts as a way of reducing exposure to volatile spot market prices The contracts as a part of a larger utility energy portfolio represent an important tool to moderate price volatility and ensure reliability I am asking the CPUC to expeditiously develop benchmarks to assure the reasonableness of these contracts without unfairly second guessing these decisions in later years This process should be in place early in to provide adequate opportuni ty for contracts to be negotiated and in place before Summer Coupled with the forward contracting issue is the question of the obligatio n of utilities to buy and sell all of their electricity through the Californi a Power Exchange PX This issue requires careful consideration since these transactions through the PX are currently subject to full disclosure and safeguards are in place to assure delivery These protections for consumers and business must not be lost Among the suggestions that have been made to ensure that utilities have a costeffective portfolio of energy is the proposal that utilities retain their existing generation as was recommended in the CPUCs environmental impact report regarding PGEs hydroelectric facilities There is growing consensus around this matter I would hope that the paramount objective in this series of regulatory decisions will be the protection of the interests of consumers Invigorating the Demand Side Conservation and efficiency are the cornerstones of Californias energy future Under my Executive Order the State of California has achieved more than MW of load reduction earlier this year during Stage alerts and is moving quickly to add another MW of demand reduction for summer The federal government is following suit for federal facilities The state and federal governments should set an example for similar voluntary load reduction initiatives in the private sector I was pleased to work with the California Grocers Association this summer t o develop a voluntary percent demand reduction program during peak hours f or more than groceries statewide This program must be duplicated in oth er areas where feasible and the business community in California has pledged t o work cooperatively toward that end I am calling on the CPUC to expedite its investigation of the states de mand reduction programs for commercial and industrial users including the interruptible programs Those that are successful should be expanded Those that require change should be modified And new opportunities should be developed to reduce and shift loads during peak hours and short supply The se programs must be in place no later than March to provide adequate opportunity for private sector planning and participation I am also calling on the CPUC and CEC to coordinate efforts to demonstrate and implement programs which provide realtime price signals and energyreduction systems to sophisticated commercial electricity users and to recommend a process for voluntary participation by consumers and small businesses In September I signed historic urgency legislation that provides milli on for demand reduction programs that can be implemented by Summer I als o signed legislation that provides approximately million annually for th e next years for energy efficiency research and development and renewable resource support The CPUC and CEC are aggressively pursuing innovative demand reduction programs using these funds Institutional Reform As I testified at the FERC hearing on November I agree that the stakeholder boards of the California Independent System Operator CAISO an d California Power Exchange present inherent conflicts of interest for their members and must be replaced The composition of these boards is specified by state law both as to size and as to qualifications for directors I will propose legislation to replace the stakeholder boards with independe nt boards that are accountable for their actions and that will consider both the need to assure reliability and the most economic method to do so I intend to move quickly on this aspect of the problem Your concurrence in this effort is extremely important It will little serve the consumers utilities merchant generators or other parties to become embroiled in litigation over exactly what powers Congress conferred on the FERC in or what traditional state powers if any Congress meant to circumscribe or override Recognizing that there may be a need for more extensive reconstitution of these entities as some have suggested I do not intend to let the status q uo continue while those debates are carried on California will alter the composition and membership of the boards so that the entities are in positi on to contribute to achieving the paramount objectives of both state and feder al law protection of the consumers interests In Governor Pete Wilson and his CPUC reposed a great deal of trust in the FERC in moving Californias electricity system into an unbundled federalized mode Now is the time for you to justify that trust I want to cooperate with you in transitioning to a marketbased approach to provide this essential service However first and foremost I want you to do your job and to let me do mine Together we can protect the electricity consumer s of California and work to restore their confidence Sincerely GRAY DAVIS

Word document and read only the changes that we made to the summary since receiving the final order which was issued this afternoon Alan Comnes The full order is available at electricbulkpowerh tm SUMMARY OF FERCS ORDER ESTABLISHING PROSPECTIVE MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN FOR THE CALIFORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKETS AND ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION OF PUBLIC UTILITY RATES IN WHOLESALE WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS Issued April Effective Date Price mitigation is effective May ISO needs t o have its dayahead proxy price ready on Physical Withholding To prevent physical withholding the plan will require sellers with PGAs to offer all their available power in real time to the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade All California generators ev en those not subject to FERC price regulation will be required to sell into t he ISOs real time market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted This requirement to provide power is for all hours for yr Price Mitigation The plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market During Stage and emergencies in t he ISOs real time market each generator other than hydro with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generators heat curve emission rates gas costs and emission costs plus MWh for OM The gas cost wil l be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California emissions are to be based on Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services The ISO will publish by am the gas and emission figures to be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared These figures for the next day will be based on the prior days Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgerald data A single market clearing price is determined in rea l time for all generators Highest bid sets the clearing price Each gasfired generator must file with FERC and the ISO within days on a confidential basis heat and emission rates for each generating unit The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator including maintenance and operating costs Generators that submit bids at or below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability Although the following qualification is made However all public util ity rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on marketbased rates discussed infra Presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavior In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price the generator must within days of the end of each month file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price FERC explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the all delivery point index it has adopted FERC has days to review act No opportunity costs in real time Marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based o n specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost Underscheduling Penalites FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it is still in place Thus although it may be advantageous to wait to buy power in RT at capped prices doing so may make the scheduling coordinator subject to the currently effective MWh penalty See p of the FERC order New Generation New generation is NOT exempted from the Commissions price mitigation measures Demand Response Beginning June only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids FERC is attempting to make the demand curve more price responsive This requirement is in effect for all hours Outages PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages The ISO is required to make a tariff filing within days of the order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages including periodic reports to the Commission Term Order expires one year from date of issuance RTO Filing California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June or Order lapses with no further effect The RTO filing is to be consistent with the characteristics and functions in Order No ISO Reporting On September ISO must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built Comments are du e in days Quarterly reports thereafter Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds The market based ra te authority of all public utilities is conditioned on no physical withhol d of capacity and no inappropriate bidding behavior Inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate In addition hockey stick bids are expressly prohibited ie bidding at marginal cost and at a much higher level Other prohibited bidding practices identified include pricing a single unit much higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs WestWide Section Investigation Opens a section investigation concerning the JR of wholesale power in the WSCC other than sales to the CAISO market FERC requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitigation However its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real time markets for power less than hours in advance of RT spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below within a control area FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California Comments are due in days on the investigations Althou gh it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the nonCalifornia PN W the FERC sets the refund effective date is days from publication of the Order NOx Limits in California Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law However it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement just include the fines as part of the price bid Also if NOx is limited may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price Surcharge to pay past amount due Comments are due in days on whether FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into a n escrow account to pay past costs and the effect this surcharge would ha ve on the PGE bankruptcy filing Treatment of the CAISOs Market Stabilization Plan MSP The FERC rejec ts the CAISOs MSP saying that FERCs plan for market mitigation is suff icient It expressly rejects CAISOs plan to create a dayahead and hourahead e nergy markets are expressly reject and tells CAISO to stop actions to implement software changes to effectuate such markets Unfortunately it does not expressly reject CAISOs plan to cut exports In general no mention wa s made as to issue of exports of power from California although the statement that CAISO must become a real RTO would support the notion that CAISO must honor firm schedules on its system Recap of Dates Identified in the Order Issue date Heat rate emission filing from generators due days Comments due on WSCCwide price mitigation days ISO Tariff filing due days Comments on ISO Tariff due days thereafter Comments on whether Commission should allow a premium to recover unpaid generator bills

Connole and Tom Doggett Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited WASHINGTON April Reuters A split US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved on Wednesday a plan to stabilize Californias volatile power market and stem market abuses Under the plan set to take effect in late May and last for one year price relief measures will be imposed on Californias wholesale power sales during severe energy shortages The threemember commission split sharply on the plan voting for an order that the majority believe will prevent power costs from soaring out of control in California this summer Wholesale power prices have jumped tenfold in California in the past year the result of growing demand from the states million residents following a decade that saw no major power plants added to its electric system FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert a Republican and Democrat Linda Breathitt supported the order Democrat William Massey dissented despite hours of talks aimed at reaching a consensus California consumers can rest assured that the commission has been attentive to their problems and has worked tirelessly to ensure that they receive necessary relief in a manner that does not compound current problems or undemine longerterm solutions Hebert said DISSENTING VOTE Massey said that by limiting price relief to declared power emergencies FERCs actions would fall short of solving the severe problems plaguing the California market The evidence is pervasive that the problem exists hours a day seven days a week Now is not the time for halfaloaf solutions Massey said Under the plan price mitigation would be triggered whenever the California Independent System Operator ISO declares a power emergency The ISO which manages most of the states power grid uses a threestage alert system with a Stage One called when power reserves drop to within seven percent of actual demand on the grid As demand eats further into the supply cushion Stage Two and Stage Three alerts are declared with Stage Three indicating rolling blackouts may be required to avoid overloading the grid and triggering far more widespread outages California has ordered rolling blackouts four days so far this year with state energy officials predicting more are likely this summer when air conditioning pushes demand to its annual peak FINDING A FAIR PRICE The mitigation and monitoring plans central element will require generators to offer available power in real time using a proxy price established a day ahead of actual delivery FERC said The proxy price reflects the marginal cost of the highestcost generator asked to supply power to the grid This price will vary daily according to demand the price of fuel used by generators such as natural gas and the cost of complying with environmental standards However generators could charge more than the proxy price if they can justify the higher cost when FERC reviews their sales records which they are required to submit at the end of each month If those costs cannot be justified FERC can order the generator to refund the buyer FERC said all generators in California even those not subject to the commissions price regulations are required to sell into the ISOs real time price market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities were exempted from the plan because of their generation limitations which fluctuate according to reservoir levels and the competing needs of others for those same water resources REGIONAL SOLUTION The commission emphasized that the only real solution to the power supply problems affecting the western markets was to forge a regional response Toward this goal FERC said California ISO would need to file a plan to form a regional transmission organization RTO by June or forfeit the socalled crutch of FERCs pricerelief plan Among the many measures contained in the order FERC told California utilities to coordinate any temporary shutdowns of generating plants with the ISO to ensure the state has adequate electric supplies at all times The order also formally opened an investigation by commission staff into possible abusive wholesale practices behind power sales throughout the Western region FERC said the plan would expire in as the California power crisis eases The states rush to build new power plants is expected to put an

By Rebecca Smith The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Hewing more to the ideological position of the Bush administration than to the urgings of Gov Gray Davis and other California politicians a divided Federal Energy Regulatory Commission yesterday ordered limited price controls for the states flawed electricity market The new controls arent likely to restrain runaway wholesale power prices this summer The order was approved in a meeting that began hours late as the three commissioners locked horns over how far the agency should go to restrain wholesale prices that have pushed one of Californias big utilities into bankruptcy and which now threatens the states fiscal health The commission built on a staff recommendation issued in March that suggested it act only at those times when electricity supplies are in shortest supply In its order the commission decided to intervene whenever state electricity reserves drop below authorized levels socalled Stage I II and III emergencies The pricemitigation plan appears to ignore evidence filed by the gridoperating California Independent System Operator that generators can substantially raise market prices even when supplies arent technically short The ISO had recommended imposing price caps when individual generating plants tried to charge far more than fair production costs Commissioner William

consequence he said the economic carnage is spreading throughout the West Mr Massey an Arkansas Democrat criticized the commission for acting only when electricity reserves fall below since this agency is obligated to ensure just and reasonable prices in all hours Under the order generators will be required to submit cost data to justify high prices during periods of electricity scarcity They will be allowed to collect the price they bid so long as it doesnt exceed the price charged by the oldest leastefficient plant operating at the time Such proxy price methodology enabled plant owners to collect as much as per megawatt hour in February or roughly times the prevailing price a year earlier Support for the order came from commission Chairman Curt Hebert a Mississippi Republican who said he didnt intend the commission to fall into a trap of limiting market forces to the extent that we hinder efforts to build new power plants and transmission lines that are badly needed to correct Californias supplyanddemand imbalance Linda Breathitt a Kentucky Democrat was the swing vote who eventually sided with Mr Hebert FERC staffers said she expressed doubts about whether the commission was doing as much as it should In the meeting she acknowledged the complexity and difficulty of the task but said she remained steadfast in my belief that market solutions are preferable to regulatory controls The commission attached an unexpected condition to its order saying the pricecap scheme will be revoked June unless the California grid operator has filed a plan to become part of a regionwide gridoperating organization Californias ISO had such a plan ready to file but it got yanked when a new board named by the states governor took control recently In recent months Mr Davis has urged increased isolationism even suggesting the state no longer export powerIt isnt clear whether FERC intends to permit California to continue to operate as a standalone gridrunning organization More likely it will be expected to show it intends to become part of a multistate organization to operate transmission lines in a nondiscriminatory manner The commission gave tentative approval yesterday to formation of a regional grid operator that would encompass eight other Western states and would include the transmission system of the federal Bonneville Power Administration the biggest

accross the west businessreportspowerlatwesthtm Back to story Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California Utilities Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations swelled and few new energy sources were developed Now also facing blackouts they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and toward themselves By PETER G GOSSELIN Times Staff Writer WINTERSBURG ArizFor more than a century California ran a simple account with the rest of the West It demanded and the West supplied most especially water and power But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decadein no small part because of an outbound trek of Californiansthis simple supplydemand relationship has broken down Fundamentally the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system just as California has its own And it has done so in very much the same wayby adding too many people without enough new power or conservation Indeed statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have been on the verge of trouble even without Californias help and may yet face the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden State The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that its planning reservesthe extra power that utilities build in to handle emergencieshave shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts consider dangerous Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade Despite the long economic boom of the s which smiled especially on the West several such as Arizona have failed to complete a single new power plant We dont know how bad its going to be yet said Utahs Republican governor Mike Leavitt We wont know that until May June July and August when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers In trying to dodge the blackout bullet many Western leaders are seeking to force a great change on the region to renegotiate their states basic deal with California They want to end an old relationshipthat between center and hinterland colonizer and colonizedand establish a new one that could curtail Californias long regional dominance In the strange chemistry of the momentwhen a onceRepublican state government has turned Democratic and a onceDemocratic national government has turned Republican when the battle is to a large extent over privately owned electricity rather than publicly controlled waterthey could actually meet with some success California spent the th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street and the East said Kevin Starr the state librarian and author of a multivolume history of California Now all of a sudden theres a dramatic possibility of it being recolonized at least in part by the rest of the West Captive Plants Feed Power to California Ground zero for these changes lies miles west of Phoenix in the dry scrublands of Wintersburg This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility now the nations single biggest power producer It will soon be home as well to between three and six new gasfired power plants that combined will produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old fraying world of regulated utilities and about the supplydemand relationships that California once maintained with the rest of the West More than onequarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles municipal utility the Department of Water and Power several other California cities and Southern California Edison A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California carrying a transmission line from plant to consumer California has big stakes in a halfdozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New Mexico From Californias point of view the beauty of these projects has been that they provided nearcertain power without the muss of meeting state pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home And at least until the mids California regulators virtually guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits even if plants power wasnt immediately needed The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to meet demand no matter what said Paul L Joskow a veteran utility economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology If you had too much power if it cost you a little too much that was less important than being sure you could meet demand And he added you had regulators watching to make sure you did The gasfired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also representative but of the new deregulated world of power production Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same California transmission line they are being built on an entirely different business premise selling power to the highest bidder In fact the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself but its huge transmission lines In addition to the California line four others fan out from the plant two back to Phoenix one east to New Mexico and one north to Utah and from there to the Northwest All were built to hardwire the nuclear project to its owners But they are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar by sending power wherever prices are highest It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the market to see if they could meet demand said Jack Davis president of Pinnacle West Capital Corp which owns Arizonas major utility and is putting up two of the Wintersburg plants Now he said approvingly its being built by people who look at the market to see if you can make a lot of money Plans Go Awry in Many States Money not the watchful eye of government was what was supposed to assure that electricity deregulation worked The opportunity to make it would cause investors to flock to the electricity business ensuring that plenty of new power plants got built If too many went up it would be investors not ratepayers who suffered If too few then high prices would attract still more investors more plants and ultimately more power But to date almost nothing about deregulation has gone as plannedand not just in California but in the West in general Take Arizona The state has a handsoff attitude toward business including its utilities It has almost none of the environmental restrictions blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs Its population grew by from to according to the Census Bureau And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate according to industry figures Arizona should have been a power producers heaven said A Michael Schaal a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc a prominent Washingtonarea consulting firm But Arizonas power production rose a mere during the s mostly as a result of improving existing plants Until months ago no one had applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late s I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort of year time horizon Arizonas Republican Gov Jane Dee Hull said in a recent interview I think what we all worry about is Are they planning Or Nevada Its utilities apparently did plan and increased electricitymaking capacity between and by a substantial But that wasnt enough to keep up with the states population which increased On Thursday Nevada Gov Kenny Guinn a Republican and former energy company executive indefinitely halted deregulation in his state Or traditionally energyrich Washington state One of its major utilities Seattle City Light recently learned that all of its previously planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed and then some by just three new customers computer server farms being built to handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the hightech capital But its unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional supplies are balanced on a razors edge according to Northwest Power Pool President Jerry Rust We have no cushion Indeed the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a razors edge with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this summer Schaal the Washingtonarea consultant for example said the region will come up short Westerners can expect to hours of rolling blackouts most of them in California he said One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that in contrast to what most people think supplies have not grown short just recently They have been perilously tight for the last several yearsbefore the start of Californias troubles of this summer and fall and before the nearrecord dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water for its hydroelectric dams The implication is that California did not cause other states to run short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger It did that according to key observers with one monumentally inept maneuver When California required its major utilities to buy power in the volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along higher costs to consumers it set off a furious price spiral That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security blanket the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively if local supplies proved inadequate The result has been a string of crises across the West In southern Arizona for example the San Carlos Irrigation Project a tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by dropping longterm contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the spot market has announced that its bills are going up Most of the projects poor customers say they cant pay In Phoenix utility executives who had confidently said the state was rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two yearold steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market In Idaho the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps back to the firm Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than purchasing power on the open marketand the potato farmers are likely to do pretty well themselves Deep Hostility in Rest of the West The subtle difference between Californias triggering recent events and actually causing the regions crisis is largely lost in the current atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval Although leaders of the rest of the West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big neighbor they are less guarded at home The normally mildmannered Leavitt for example was recently quoted as warning a Salt Lake City audience that California if given the chance would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly In an interview he denied having made the remark Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners that their states are in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto plundered provincesterrain that first Easterners and then Californians have regularly raided for minerals water and most recently power But this time some Western leaders think they can change all this A lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with California to their advantage said Stanford historian Richard White The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West In the Northwest Oregon Washington Idaho and Montana are redoubling their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration the huge federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that is one of Californias chief sources of summer electricity The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the region can be exported without the regions consent Oregon Gov John Kitzhaber said in an interview In Arizona state officials have gone from having no proposals for new power plants to being buried by them Regulators recently approved the construction of plants including several around Palo Verde and are considering another eight Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizonas needs first the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for whatever prices they can command an arrangement that could leave California just one among many bidders Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way Gov Hull is close to President Bush who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic California Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah where Leavitt is trying something that could become Californias worst nightmarerecalling power that Utah produces for the state Los Angeles DWP and several other California utilities own threequarters of the huge coalfired Intermountain Power Project in westcentral Utah and have been drawing on it without incident for years But Utah officials recently unearthed a longforgotten provision in their agreement with the plants owners that gives them the right with proper notice to recall power for local use The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another next summer and it may be able to take back still more according to plant general manager Reed Searle Although the amounts are trivialthe Los Angeles utility either owns or has firm contracts for more than megawatts of capacityLeavitt said Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants in the state including a to megawatt facility that Los Angeles is negotiating to build California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has depended on us to do that the Utah governor said Thats fine and were willing to do that But he added there comes a point at which if demand grows too large weve got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves and for our children and grandchildren If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point California could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which it now suffers Times researcher Lynn Marshall in Seattle contributed

consider a favorable ruling by regulators on Jan Moodys will continue to review for possible downgrade the ratings of Southern California Edison Company and its parent Edison International and the ratings of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and its parent PGE Corporation and may take additional rating action next week prior to the January th meeting Moodys said However it is not anticipated at this point that any rating action taken prior to the January th meeting would result in the ratings of the utilities or their respective parents falling below investment grade Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric have lost a combined billion since May buying wholesale power at prices that far exceed the fixed rates theyre allowed to charge their customers Between onethird and onehalf of that figure is offset by profits from power plants the utilities still own but the net losses are substantial and mounting Both utilities have said they soon will become unable to continue buying power for their customers if the situation persists Ratings agency Standard Poors warned Wednesday that both utilities face imminent default and a downgrading of their debt ratings to junkbond status unless California officials acted immediately to raise rates and restore the utilities to liquidity On Thursday the California Public Utilities Commission agreed rate hikes were needed We believe that retail rates in California must rise the commission said in a written statement It is our intent to maintain the utilities access to capital on reasonable terms But the commission deferred a final ruling on rates until Jan pending hearings on the matter scheduled for next week Standard Poors wasnt immediately available to comment on the decision Moodys said Friday that the PUCs decision was a necessary first step in restoring the utilities to financial viability Comments by the PUC and other officials indicated their desire to maintain the utilities investmentgrade status Moodys said But Moodys set strict terms for what must come out of the PUCs Jan meeting if the utilities are to avoid being downgraded to speculative status Specifically at that meeting the utilities need to obtain the right to immediately raise rates by a sizeable amount and must obtain the unquestioned and unambiguous ability to recover past and future wholesale procurement costs Moodys said The failure by the CPUC to act in a prompt and constructive way around these two issues could result in the utilities ratings being downgraded to below investment grade Such a downgrade would hurt the

Wont Fail Competition Will By Mark Golden Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow Jones Fans of the movie Erin Brockovich have been tempted to fantasize about executives from Californias two main investorowned utilities PGE Corp PCG and Edison International EIX heading to bankruptcy court Dream on True this week the utilities didnt get either of the two things they need to escape the astronomically expensive spot market for electricity in California a rate increase and longterm contracts with independent generators at prices they can afford under new rates With lending sources virtually dry both utilities have said they are about to run out of the cash needed to continue buying electricity in the spot market But hearings on a rate increase are scheduled to resume next week followed by the California Public Utilities Commission vote on Jan and longterm contract negotiations are to resume Jan Both negotiations are likely to succeed in keeping the companies afloat because almost all parties would lose with the utilities under Chapter protection and because the price to save the utilities isnt that high The rate increase decision was postponed Thursday because California Governor Gray Davis and his CPUC are trying to give the corporations only what they need to survive and not a penny more If Davis succeeds he is insisting on an independent audit of the holding companies and all subsidiaries shareholders can expect to see their dividends cut Sorting out the finances of the billion PGE which is the rd largest US company and billion Edison International must be daunting But here are the basics First the utilities have to get out of the spot market SCE charges residential and small commercial customers cents a kilowatthour of which cents or a megawatthour goes for electricity The rest covers transmission and distribution some other costs and the utilitys profit In the dayahead and spot market where SCE has been buying almost half the power it needs the utility has been paying about MWh Rates obviously wont be tripled so that SCE can continue to buy power in the spot market But the company can purchase fiveyear supply contracts at about MWh currently which it could do with a mere halfcent increase in rates Since the company is already making plenty of money on the coalfired and nuclear generators that it owns a halfcent increase on all the electricity it sells could be applied to all of its outside purchasing which comes to an extra a megawatthour Edison International is in a more dire immediate cash situation because the utility is twothirds of the parent company but Pacific Gas Electric faces a more difficult situation operationally PGE gets only centsKWh or MWh from customers for electricity while wholesale prices in northern California are more expensive than in southern California Finally PGE has to buy about twothirds of the power it needs in the wholesale market compared to SCEs because it sold off more of its power plants as dictated by deregulation legislation more quickly than SCE Still PGE could pick up fiveyear supply contracts at about MWh A twocent increase to its basic rate of cents would give PGE more per megawatthour or MWh to spend on power purchases But a increase may not be necessary The governors staff needs to find out the details on the substantial longterm deals PGE had the foresight to sign back in October Those deals were done at less than MWh and they kick in Jan The governors staff may also look at the unexpectedly high profits from SCEs and PGEs nuclear power plants The utilities have cut costs at the plants so instead of making just return on capital the utilities have been getting a net gain of on nuclear revenues according to Bob Finkelstein of The Utilities Reform Network If the utilities say deregulation decisions such as the rate freeze must be reexamined because they are bankrupting the utilities then TURN says the deregulation decisions that have resulted in unexpected gains for the utilities should be looked at too Nevertheless retail competition in California is dead for another five years The utilities get their modest rate increases with the insistence that they lock up their needed supplies under longterm contracts The contracts will be approved by the CPUC which means the utilities are guaranteed to be paid for the costs even if wholesale power prices fall below MWh in three to four years as expected The only way to ensure that the utilities get paid is to add a new nonbypassable transition cost to customer bills for five years which means that even if a customer chooses an alternate power supplier they will still be sending money back to PGE and Edison to pay for this years debacle The current nonbypassable charges which are scheduled to end in March are what has killed retail competition since Competitors cant offer much in the way of savings so almost nobody bothers to switch Electricity traders and regulators wonder why the utilities keep buying so much power at the last minute through the Independent System Operator which will pay almost anything to keep the lights on Right now the ISO is paying MWh for power that readily could have been bought Thursday for MWh This practice over the past six months has run up Edisons debt to a projected billion at the end of December and PGEs to billion Edison overstates its real losses by PGE by So for about billion dollars the utilities will get a rate increase and four more years of protection

West sold for a megawatthour Thursday about times its yearago level The utilities have lost a combined billion since May buying wholesale power at such prices which far exceed the fixed rates theyre allowed to charge their customers Between onethird and onehalf of that figure is offset by profits from power plants the utilities still own in the state but the net losses are substantial and mounting Both utilities have said they soon will become unable to continue buying power for their customers if the situation persists Southern California Edison which said this week it wont be able to pay a power bill that comes due Jan said in a statement Thursday that it will soon adopt a cash preservation plan that could involve layoffs and cuts in operations Company executives were in talks with bankruptcy attorneys Thursday to plan their next move a Southern California Edison executive said The utilities deteriorating creditworthiness has left some generators reluctant to supply power to California without guarantees theyll be paid The US Department of Energy has issued an emergency order requiring power suppliers in the West to sell uncommitted electricity to California on demand until Dec Consumer groups which say the utilities are overstating their financial woes decried the PUC decision The most disturbing part is this notion that rate increases are inevitable said Michael Shames spokesman for San Diegobased Utility Consumers Action Network The utilities were seeking rate increases of up to State officials were reluctant to accept anything beyond an amount analysts said is insufficient The commission said it deferred its decision on the matter to create time for evidentiary hearings and an independent audit to determine how much of an increase is needed Consumer groups however were skeptical It is clearly a sham procedural course that indicates the PUC has something in mind to do but they need to claim they had a public process before doing it said Bob Finkelstein spokesman for The Utility Reform Network The Cambridge Energy Research Associates said Thursday that California faces another three years of high electricity prices and possible blackouts

Company Inc Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES This story was originally published late Thursday LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Unlike the almost daily threats of rolling blackouts from the electricity industry in California the possibility of natural gas interruptions is unlikely even though reserves are historically low said a company executive of Southern California Gas Co SoCal Gas is the gas distribution unit of San Diegobased Sempra Energy SRE and serves million customers Reserves of natural gas stored in four underground rock formations scattered throughout Southern California are at lower levels than what SoCal Gas normally maintains said Anne Smith vice president of customer service and marketing at SoCal Gas in a phone interview with Dow Jones Newswires SoCal Gas entered its winter season on Nov with billion cubic feet of gas in storage about Bcf less than its previous heating seasons Smith said The lower reserve levels are due to power plants in California siphoning out the gas at unprecedented levels she said The plants burn strictly gas and are trying to meet the intense electrical demand this winter after the states certain source of power from hydro generators in the Pacific Northwest had evaporated Lack of rain in the region this year is to blame for the hydro cutbacks Smith said As well a cold snap in November coupled with SoCal Gass decision to buy less gas this past summer for reserves didnt help matters Smith isnt worried about the lower levels of gas in the companys storage areas which can hold up to Bcf The cold weather in November forced SoCal Gas to pull out of storage about Bcf in November leaving a total of Bcf Smith said The stored gas is purchased as a hedge to protect the company from fluctuations in natural gas prices which this month have soared to as high as per million British thermal units on the spot market For the most part SoCal Gas imports its gas from outofstate regions in Texas and New Mexico via pipelines owned by El Paso Natural Gas Co EPG and Enron Corps ENE Transwestern pipeline El Paso and Transwestern are keeping up with demand and report that their pipelines are filled to the near the brim Over the past few weeks Smith said it is pushing out through its system of pipes about Bcf to Bcf of gas daily to its customers The way we see demand breakdown the last couple of weeks is generators using about Bcf a day our core customers million about Bcf and our noncore about Bcf she said The noncore customers which number about in total are industrial manufacturers who consume more than therms of gas annually Smith said In comparison a home averages about therms Smiths eyebrows have been raised by the rapid consumption of natural gas by power plants which use the commodity to run turbines for electrical generation Historically electric power plants have consumed about million to million cubic feet a day of gas in SoCal Gas service territory she said This is why we are seeing pipelines fuller than usual There is continuing demand by the electric generators she said This is basically an increase in demand for gas that has contributed to the national picture of why prices for gas have gone up this year Demand has outpaced production capacity Smith explained A growing economy starved for electricity to run its Internet systems or manufacturing businesses have contributed to the reasons why gas prices have soared this month she said Power plant owners have passed along these higher gas costs to the utilities where they sell their electricity This is partially why PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison Internationals EIX Southern California Edison face financial insolvency today They are having to borrow billions of dollars to pay for this higherpriced electricity as part of the states complex deregulation plan The power plants are owned by outofstate companies like AES Corp AES Calpine Corp CPN and Duke Energy Corp DUK The threat of rolling blackouts has several causes Some power plants run around the clock gobbling up the natural gas at a rapid pace But others have temporarily been shut down because environmental laws prohibit them from emitting certain levels of pollutants annually SoCal Gas has managed to keep its gas costs relatively low by buying gas for its core customers on longterm contracts at fixed prices This helps to insulate the company from price spikes on gas delivered to its system at the California and Arizona and Nevada borders By buying gas this way SoCal Gas was able to set a fixed charge of per MMBTU for its million core customers in the month of December A new price is set to be established next week for January We hope it holds steady in January said Smith We are doing everything we can By Pat Maio Dow Jones Newswires Article

unsecured debt ratings for one of those generators Calpine Corp CPN and indicated that the positions of a number of other generators were similarly stable Standard Poors without commenting on ratings said those generators include Dynegy Inc DYN The Williams Cos WMB Reliant Energy Inc REI Southern Energy Inc SOE and NRG Energy Inc NRG Each company has a diverse asset portfolio that mitigates

Next Article Previous Article Return to Headlines Chapter Filing May Give Calif Utils Breathing Room Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Thursday By Jason Leopold LOS ANGELES Dow JonesIf two of Californias largest utilities file for Chapter bankruptcy protection a move they said this week was possible it may give the companies some breathing room to allow for a much needed internal reorganization according to one California bankruptcy attorney What Chapter ultimately does is it allows a company to reorganize said Larry Peitzman an attorney with the Southern Californiabased law firm of Peitzman Glassman and Whegg The whole purpose is to come up with a plan to allow the company to service and pay back creditors and shareholders as much as possible While in bankruptcy a judge can order the state to raise the utilities retail electricity rates if that would help the company generate revenue to pay its creditors Peitzman said Peitzman who has worked on many large company bankruptcy cases in California said if PGE Corp unit PCG Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison International unit EIX Southern California Edison file for bankruptcy the companies will be given an injunction by a court that will prevent creditors from seizing the utilities assets collecting money or filing a lawsuit against the companies Another reason to file for bankruptcy protection is the companies wouldnt be forced to pay prebankruptcy debts if they have run up enormous bills Peitzman said Executives at both PGE and SoCal Edison said they may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection because of a combined billion debt in excess wholesale power costs and the inability under state law to pass those costs on to rate payers However between onehalf and onethird of that money has been paid into accounts held by the utilities to collect profits from the generators they still own The utilities were hoping for an immediate rate hike Thursday by the states Public Utilities Commission but commissioners said it would first hold evidentiary hearings and conduct an internal audit of the companies A rate increase is still at least two weeks off the commission said at its meeting Utilities Can Conduct Business While In Bankruptcy Peitzman said that while in bankruptcy the companies could operate as a debtor in possession which means the companies have the authority to conduct business as usual without the consent of bankruptcy court But if the companies were to try and secure a loan the loan would have to be approved by a judge Although most Chapter bankruptcy cases cant survive Peitzman said the states two largest utilities with millions of customers may be an exception Inevitably they are going to continue to owe money because of the constant shortfall they pay in electricity costs and what they charge their customers the attorney said But the bigger the company the more likely the company will survive It will be devastating to lose such large corporations If the companies fail to survive a Chapter filing the utilities assets would be liquidated to pay off their creditors Peitzman said In a Chapter filing PGE and SoCal Edison would put their creditors in different classes and determine how much under the dollar each one would get paid Peitzman said It can be as much as possible or less than cents on the dollar he said In addition any contracts that either companies held before a potential bankruptcy filing would have to be honored regardless if the company can fulfill its financial obligations to its counterpart Peitzman said Thats one of the other benefits he said Its called executory contracts which generally means both parties have material operations that have yet to be performed It may be longterm contracts and the company would be able to enforce the other part to continue doing business The other party cant refuse to do business because of a stay Bankruptcy can last as long as a judge allows it Peitzman said pointing to the Eastern Airlines bankruptcy case in the early s which lasted for years Neither company has indicated whether it will actually file for bankruptcy but SoCal Edison said in a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Tuesday that it may not be able to pay its January power bill if its retail rates are not immediately raised

New York Times Page Page Column c New York Times Company LOS ANGELES Dec The California Public Utilities Commission said today that a rate increase for consumers was likely and that over the next weeks it would inspect the books of the two major utilities to decide how much was reasonable The move is an effort in part to show Wall Street that California is committed to ensuring the health of the states utilities On Wednesday the agency that rates the creditworthiness of both the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison said that if meaningful action was not taken by Friday the two utilities were headed for bankruptcy The agency is expected to comment on the commissions action soon Gov Gray Davis has been meeting this week with utility executives and consumer advocates to come to an agreement on the size of a rate increase Mr Davis a Democrat is also seeking the advice of financial experts including Alan Greenspan chairman of the Federal Reserve Board whom he is expected to meet with next week Some people close to those discussions suggested that percent would be a palatable rate increase but the utilities are asking for more The commission will hold hearings next week and just how much consumers will have to pay should be decided by Jan Four years ago California agreed to deregulate its utilities with the hope that competition would lower rates for households and businesses But this year prices for wholesale electricity and natural gas have skyrocketed forcing utilities to incur costs of more than billion that they cannot pass to consumers because rates are frozen until In recent weeks the utilities have tried to make a case that without rate increases service to consumers is threatened John Bryson chief executive of Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison has taken the unusual step of warning consumers in television and newspaper advertisements in Southern California and in Sacramento that blackouts are inevitable unless order is imposed In response to the announcement by the commission today Southern California Edison said it expected additional cost cutting and measures to preserve cash soon But not all the commissioners believed that todays announcement would be enough to placate financial analysts and investors many of whom buy utility stocks because they are perceived to be less risky than for example Internet stocks Analysts have recently downgraded the stocks of both Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison which are trading near week lows over fears about

the California Public Utilities Commissions CPUC interim decision to initiate proceedings to consider raising retail rates as just one of the steps necessary to salvage credit quality for the states two largest utilities Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas and Electric Company Pac Gas The CPUC is expected to reach a decision on rate increases and recovery mechanisms during the first week of January at which time Fitch will assess the appropriate ratings for these companies The outstanding issue is whether rate increases will sufficiently offset high wholesale power prices being paid by the companies The companies securities ratings are likely to weaken unless full recovery is provided for the large monies paid by the utilities above existing retail rates and price stability is ensured for the regional market The utilities are unable to tap new credit until the rate decision is executed They do have however sufficient cash and existing credit to support them through the decision period of the first week in January If a suitable rate structure is passed by the CPUC at that time the utilities banks would be more likely to consider additional funding Liquidity will remain strained however to the extent that regional power prices remain high While Energy Secretary Richardson has ordered certain power producers to sell into the California market wholesale prices remain high and are above retail rates No additional federal action has been taken The CPUCs decision in early January is not expected to completely resolve the utilities future Given the large costs incurred and numerous constituent groups affected Fitch envisions a longerterm scenario of consecutive rate increases associated with a fundamental overhaul of Californias power market In conjunction

December Honorable James Hoecker Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC Dear Chairman Hoecker I told you on November in San Diego that by December I would respond to your plan with my suggestions to protect the interests of the people and businesses of California by providing reliable electricity supplies at the lowest reasonable cost Obviously a complete plan by the State of Californ ia must await your review of my suggested changes to your proposed order and final action on that order on December This letter outlines the first steps toward a plan that my administration is developing based on extensive ongoing discussions with legislative leaders consumers business utilitie s generators environmentalists labor agricultural interests and other California stakeholders This emerging plan will indicate to you that I am prepared to act with the concurrence of the Legislature in California to fulfill our obligations to assure reliable service at reasonable costs to the consumer The free market applied to electricity can work but only if market conditions allow for real competition and if all parties act responsibly The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has found that the wholesal e market in California is dysfunctional and that the wholesale prices charged by generators in your jurisdiction are unjust and unreasonable For that reason I renew my call for the FERC to undertake the actions that are critical and clearly within your jurisdiction to order retroactiv e refunds to the consumers who have been harmed this year and to establish hard price and bid caps that will protect consumers until the energy marketplace becomes truly competitive I do not believe that your proposed MW clearing price limit will provide any real protection I again ask you to impose real price and bid caps in the MW range on a transitiona l basis over the next months If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale markets the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited in scope I cannot in good conscience however forego any measure that wou ld serve to protect the people of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale markets will not victimize Californians again Since our meeting in San Diego several things have occurred which influenc e my current thinking On November the California Energy Commission CEC published the results of a detailed bottomup study of available electricity supply for It shows that taking into account expected load growth firm and dynamically scheduled imports and new supply already under construction or under contract California should be able to avoid emergencies if supplie s are properly managed and scheduled This presumes of course no gaming or withholding by sellers in wholesale markets and an absence of panic buying But the CEC study also shows that supplies are sufficiently tight that mark et power will exist and will need to be mitigated during periods of high deman d The same opportunity for wholesale price gouging through the exercise of market power and withholding that existed in summer will exist in You must take decisive action to preclude such behavior During the week of November while you and regulatory commissioners from around the country were in San Diego California was subjected to several Stage Alerts reflecting severe shortages of generation even though these are the lowest load months of the year Prices were astronomical More than megawatts of generation were offline at the same time including over megawatts for unscheduled outages I will recommend steps to assure that existing resources in California are availab le to meet Californias local energy needs and that information and the authority necessary to prevent a recurrence of such events are available to state and local officials On November the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and Electricity Oversight Board EOB filed comments with you that summarize th e current status of their ongoing investigations They confirm the conclusion s of the independent market monitors that California has been victimized by t he exercise of market power by merchant generators and marketers during summer and fall The state agencies have been hampered in their investigation s by the refusal of merchant generators to provide information that will both assist in the understanding of last summers prices and in the fashionin g of remedies to assure that we are not victimized again I urge you to compel t he necessary disclosure of information to complete these investigations On November the CPUC issued an Environmental Impact Report EIR on the proposal by PGE to move its hydroelectric facilities out of the regulated utility The EIR concludes that such a project would cause significant unmitigated harm to the environment and recommends retention as the preferr ed alternative This suggests that Californias course of generation divest iture by utilities may be slowed or stopped With these events as background I want to describe the steps I have taken and plan to take to begin to address the energy problems in California Increase Supply and Expand Infrastructure During the years preceding my administration virtually no power plants were built in California Since April six power plants representing MW of new generation have been approved by the CEC Five of these plants are under construction and the sixth will begin construction no later than April Twenty more applicants have completed prefiling and have active applications under review by the commission staff Eleven more applications are in the prefiling stage This represents a significant change in policy and performance and responds to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and environmental protection Much has been made about the difficulty of siting and permitting generation in California With enactment of AB and the creation of the Governor s Clean Energy Green Team this September California has aggressively committ ed itself to continue to accelerate the siting and permitting of generation an d to coordinate local state and federal government agency review and action Federal and state air quality requirements present unique challenges to the construction and operation of new power plants Through the Green Team we are developing new and creative approaches to meet these challenges workin g with local air quality districts the California Air Resources Board and th e United States Environmental Protection Agency These might for example expand upon the case of the proposed Otay Mesa power plant where mobile emissions credits are being used to offset stationary source emissions that will be generated by the new facility If necessary I will seek legislatio n to enable these new approaches I am also calling on the CPUC to aggressively reduce barriers and to otherwise encourage the locating of distributed generation and cogeneratio n where it is viable cost effective and environmentally sound The CPUC has already initiated action that will provide a forum for expediting certificates for transmission facilities including environmental review Finally I believe it is important to assure that all supplies of electrici ty are available when emergency conditions exist to avoid interruptions such as those experienced last summer and as recently as last week Suggestions we are considering for achieving this include new means of coordinating powerplant maintenance and operations activities Forward Contracting by Utilities Many parties including the FERC have recommended expanding the use of forward contracting by the utilities including multiyear bilateral contracts as a way of reducing exposure to volatile spot market prices The contracts as a part of a larger utility energy portfolio represent an important tool to moderate price volatility and ensure reliability I am asking the CPUC to expeditiously develop benchmarks to assure the reasonableness of these contracts without unfairly second guessing these decisions in later years This process should be in place early in to provide adequate opportuni ty for contracts to be negotiated and in place before Summer Coupled with the forward contracting issue is the question of the obligatio n of utilities to buy and sell all of their electricity through the Californi a Power Exchange PX This issue requires careful consideration since these transactions through the PX are currently subject to full disclosure and safeguards are in place to assure delivery These protections for consumers and business must not be lost Among the suggestions that have been made to ensure that utilities have a costeffective portfolio of energy is the proposal that utilities retain their existing generation as was recommended in the CPUCs environmental impact report regarding PGEs hydroelectric facilities There is growing consensus around this matter I would hope that the paramount objective in this series of regulatory decisions will be the protection of the interests of consumers Invigorating the Demand Side Conservation and efficiency are the cornerstones of Californias energy future Under my Executive Order the State of California has achieved more than MW of load reduction earlier this year during Stage alerts and is moving quickly to add another MW of demand reduction for summer The federal government is following suit for federal facilities The state and federal governments should set an example for similar voluntary load reduction initiatives in the private sector I was pleased to work with the California Grocers Association this summer t o develop a voluntary percent demand reduction program during peak hours f or more than groceries statewide This program must be duplicated in oth er areas where feasible and the business community in California has pledged t o work cooperatively toward that end I am calling on the CPUC to expedite its investigation of the states de mand reduction programs for commercial and industrial users including the interruptible programs Those that are successful should be expanded Those that require change should be modified And new opportunities should be developed to reduce and shift loads during peak hours and short supply The se programs must be in place no later than March to provide adequate opportunity for private sector planning and participation I am also calling on the CPUC and CEC to coordinate efforts to demonstrate and implement programs which provide realtime price signals and energyreduction systems to sophisticated commercial electricity users and to recommend a process for voluntary participation by consumers and small businesses In September I signed historic urgency legislation that provides milli on for demand reduction programs that can be implemented by Summer I als o signed legislation that provides approximately million annually for th e next years for energy efficiency research and development and renewable resource support The CPUC and CEC are aggressively pursuing innovative demand reduction programs using these funds Institutional Reform As I testified at the FERC hearing on November I agree that the stakeholder boards of the California Independent System Operator CAISO an d California Power Exchange present inherent conflicts of interest for their members and must be replaced The composition of these boards is specified by state law both as to size and as to qualifications for directors I will propose legislation to replace the stakeholder boards with independe nt boards that are accountable for their actions and that will consider both the need to assure reliability and the most economic method to do so I intend to move quickly on this aspect of the problem Your concurrence in this effort is extremely important It will little serve the consumers utilities merchant generators or other parties to become embroiled in litigation over exactly what powers Congress conferred on the FERC in or what traditional state powers if any Congress meant to circumscribe or override Recognizing that there may be a need for more extensive reconstitution of these entities as some have suggested I do not intend to let the status q uo continue while those debates are carried on California will alter the composition and membership of the boards so that the entities are in positi on to contribute to achieving the paramount objectives of both state and feder al law protection of the consumers interests In Governor Pete Wilson and his CPUC reposed a great deal of trust in the FERC in moving Californias electricity system into an unbundled federalized mode Now is the time for you to justify that trust I want to cooperate with you in transitioning to a marketbased approach to provide this essential service However first and foremost I want you to do your job and to let me do mine Together we can protect the electricity consumer s of California and work to restore their confidence Sincerely GRAY DAVIS

Word document and read only the changes that we made to the summary since receiving the final order which was issued this afternoon Alan Comnes The full order is available at electricbulkpowerh tm SUMMARY OF FERCS ORDER ESTABLISHING PROSPECTIVE MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN FOR THE CALIFORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKETS AND ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION OF PUBLIC UTILITY RATES IN WHOLESALE WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS Issued April Effective Date Price mitigation is effective May ISO needs t o have its dayahead proxy price ready on Physical Withholding To prevent physical withholding the plan will require sellers with PGAs to offer all their available power in real time to the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade All California generators ev en those not subject to FERC price regulation will be required to sell into t he ISOs real time market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted This requirement to provide power is for all hours for yr Price Mitigation The plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market During Stage and emergencies in t he ISOs real time market each generator other than hydro with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generators heat curve emission rates gas costs and emission costs plus MWh for OM The gas cost wil l be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California emissions are to be based on Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services The ISO will publish by am the gas and emission figures to be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared These figures for the next day will be based on the prior days Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgerald data A single market clearing price is determined in rea l time for all generators Highest bid sets the clearing price Each gasfired generator must file with FERC and the ISO within days on a confidential basis heat and emission rates for each generating unit The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator including maintenance and operating costs Generators that submit bids at or below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability Although the following qualification is made However all public util ity rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on marketbased rates discussed infra Presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavior In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price the generator must within days of the end of each month file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price FERC explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the all delivery point index it has adopted FERC has days to review act No opportunity costs in real time Marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based o n specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost Underscheduling Penalites FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it is still in place Thus although it may be advantageous to wait to buy power in RT at capped prices doing so may make the scheduling coordinator subject to the currently effective MWh penalty See p of the FERC order New Generation New generation is NOT exempted from the Commissions price mitigation measures Demand Response Beginning June only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids FERC is attempting to make the demand curve more price responsive This requirement is in effect for all hours Outages PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages The ISO is required to make a tariff filing within days of the order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages including periodic reports to the Commission Term Order expires one year from date of issuance RTO Filing California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June or Order lapses with no further effect The RTO filing is to be consistent with the characteristics and functions in Order No ISO Reporting On September ISO must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built Comments are du e in days Quarterly reports thereafter Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds The market based ra te authority of all public utilities is conditioned on no physical withhol d of capacity and no inappropriate bidding behavior Inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate In addition hockey stick bids are expressly prohibited ie bidding at marginal cost and at a much higher level Other prohibited bidding practices identified include pricing a single unit much higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs WestWide Section Investigation Opens a section investigation concerning the JR of wholesale power in the WSCC other than sales to the CAISO market FERC requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitigation However its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real time markets for power less than hours in advance of RT spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below within a control area FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California Comments are due in days on the investigations Althou gh it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the nonCalifornia PN W the FERC sets the refund effective date is days from publication of the Order NOx Limits in California Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law However it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement just include the fines as part of the price bid Also if NOx is limited may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price Surcharge to pay past amount due Comments are due in days on whether FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into a n escrow account to pay past costs and the effect this surcharge would ha ve on the PGE bankruptcy filing Treatment of the CAISOs Market Stabilization Plan MSP The FERC rejec ts the CAISOs MSP saying that FERCs plan for market mitigation is suff icient It expressly rejects CAISOs plan to create a dayahead and hourahead e nergy markets are expressly reject and tells CAISO to stop actions to implement software changes to effectuate such markets Unfortunately it does not expressly reject CAISOs plan to cut exports In general no mention wa s made as to issue of exports of power from California although the statement that CAISO must become a real RTO would support the notion that CAISO must honor firm schedules on its system Recap of Dates Identified in the Order Issue date Heat rate emission filing from generators due days Comments due on WSCCwide price mitigation days ISO Tariff filing due days Comments on ISO Tariff due days thereafter Comments on whether Commission should allow a premium to recover unpaid generator bills

Connole and Tom Doggett Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited WASHINGTON April Reuters A split US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved on Wednesday a plan to stabilize Californias volatile power market and stem market abuses Under the plan set to take effect in late May and last for one year price relief measures will be imposed on Californias wholesale power sales during severe energy shortages The threemember commission split sharply on the plan voting for an order that the majority believe will prevent power costs from soaring out of control in California this summer Wholesale power prices have jumped tenfold in California in the past year the result of growing demand from the states million residents following a decade that saw no major power plants added to its electric system FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert a Republican and Democrat Linda Breathitt supported the order Democrat William Massey dissented despite hours of talks aimed at reaching a consensus California consumers can rest assured that the commission has been attentive to their problems and has worked tirelessly to ensure that they receive necessary relief in a manner that does not compound current problems or undemine longerterm solutions Hebert said DISSENTING VOTE Massey said that by limiting price relief to declared power emergencies FERCs actions would fall short of solving the severe problems plaguing the California market The evidence is pervasive that the problem exists hours a day seven days a week Now is not the time for halfaloaf solutions Massey said Under the plan price mitigation would be triggered whenever the California Independent System Operator ISO declares a power emergency The ISO which manages most of the states power grid uses a threestage alert system with a Stage One called when power reserves drop to within seven percent of actual demand on the grid As demand eats further into the supply cushion Stage Two and Stage Three alerts are declared with Stage Three indicating rolling blackouts may be required to avoid overloading the grid and triggering far more widespread outages California has ordered rolling blackouts four days so far this year with state energy officials predicting more are likely this summer when air conditioning pushes demand to its annual peak FINDING A FAIR PRICE The mitigation and monitoring plans central element will require generators to offer available power in real time using a proxy price established a day ahead of actual delivery FERC said The proxy price reflects the marginal cost of the highestcost generator asked to supply power to the grid This price will vary daily according to demand the price of fuel used by generators such as natural gas and the cost of complying with environmental standards However generators could charge more than the proxy price if they can justify the higher cost when FERC reviews their sales records which they are required to submit at the end of each month If those costs cannot be justified FERC can order the generator to refund the buyer FERC said all generators in California even those not subject to the commissions price regulations are required to sell into the ISOs real time price market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities were exempted from the plan because of their generation limitations which fluctuate according to reservoir levels and the competing needs of others for those same water resources REGIONAL SOLUTION The commission emphasized that the only real solution to the power supply problems affecting the western markets was to forge a regional response Toward this goal FERC said California ISO would need to file a plan to form a regional transmission organization RTO by June or forfeit the socalled crutch of FERCs pricerelief plan Among the many measures contained in the order FERC told California utilities to coordinate any temporary shutdowns of generating plants with the ISO to ensure the state has adequate electric supplies at all times The order also formally opened an investigation by commission staff into possible abusive wholesale practices behind power sales throughout the Western region FERC said the plan would expire in as the California power crisis eases The states rush to build new power plants is expected to put an

By Rebecca Smith The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Hewing more to the ideological position of the Bush administration than to the urgings of Gov Gray Davis and other California politicians a divided Federal Energy Regulatory Commission yesterday ordered limited price controls for the states flawed electricity market The new controls arent likely to restrain runaway wholesale power prices this summer The order was approved in a meeting that began hours late as the three commissioners locked horns over how far the agency should go to restrain wholesale prices that have pushed one of Californias big utilities into bankruptcy and which now threatens the states fiscal health The commission built on a staff recommendation issued in March that suggested it act only at those times when electricity supplies are in shortest supply In its order the commission decided to intervene whenever state electricity reserves drop below authorized levels socalled Stage I II and III emergencies The pricemitigation plan appears to ignore evidence filed by the gridoperating California Independent System Operator that generators can substantially raise market prices even when supplies arent technically short The ISO had recommended imposing price caps when individual generating plants tried to charge far more than fair production costs Commissioner William Massey dissented in part from the order in a sharply worded attack on the commission which he said hadnt done its duty to protect energy users by restraining generators that overcharge As a consequence he said the economic carnage is spreading throughout the West Mr Massey an Arkansas Democrat criticized the commission for acting only when electricity reserves fall below since this agency is obligated to ensure just and reasonable prices in all hours Under the order generators will be required to submit cost data to justify high prices during periods of electricity scarcity They will be allowed to collect the price they bid so long as it doesnt exceed the price charged by the oldest leastefficient plant operating at the time Such proxy price methodology enabled plant owners to collect as much as per megawatt hour in February or roughly times the prevailing price a year earlier Support for the order came from commission Chairman Curt Hebert a Mississippi Republican who said he didnt intend the commission to fall into a trap of limiting market forces to the extent that we hinder efforts to build new power plants and transmission lines that are badly needed to correct Californias supplyanddemand imbalance Linda Breathitt a Kentucky Democrat was the swing vote who eventually sided with Mr Hebert FERC staffers said she expressed doubts about whether the commission was doing as much as it should In the meeting she acknowledged the complexity and difficulty of the task but said she remained steadfast in my belief that market solutions are preferable to regulatory controls The commission attached an unexpected condition to its order saying the pricecap scheme will be revoked June unless the California grid operator has filed a plan to become part of a regionwide gridoperating organization Californias ISO had such a plan ready to file but it got yanked when a new board named by the states governor took control recently In recent months Mr Davis has urged increased isolationism even suggesting the state no longer export powerIt isnt clear whether FERC intends to permit California to continue to operate as a standalone gridrunning organization More likely it will be expected to show it intends to become part of a multistate organization to operate transmission lines in a nondiscriminatory manner The commission gave tentative approval yesterday to formation of a regional grid operator that would encompass eight other Western states and would include the transmission system of the federal Bonneville Power Administration the biggest

accross the west businessreportspowerlatwesthtm Back to story Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California Utilities Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations swelled and few new energy sources were developed Now also facing blackouts they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and toward themselves By PETER G GOSSELIN Times Staff Writer WINTERSBURG ArizFor more than a century California ran a simple account with the rest of the West It demanded and the West supplied most especially water and power But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decadein no small part because of an outbound trek of Californiansthis simple supplydemand relationship has broken down Fundamentally the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system just as California has its own And it has done so in very much the same wayby adding too many people without enough new power or conservation Indeed statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have been on the verge of trouble even without Californias help and may yet face the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden State The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that its planning reservesthe extra power that utilities build in to handle emergencieshave shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts consider dangerous Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade Despite the long economic boom of the s which smiled especially on the West several such as Arizona have failed to complete a single new power plant We dont know how bad its going to be yet said Utahs Republican governor Mike Leavitt We wont know that until May June July and August when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers In trying to dodge the blackout bullet many Western leaders are seeking to force a great change on the region to renegotiate their states basic deal with California They want to end an old relationshipthat between center and hinterland colonizer and colonizedand establish a new one that could curtail Californias long regional dominance In the strange chemistry of the momentwhen a onceRepublican state government has turned Democratic and a onceDemocratic national government has turned Republican when the battle is to a large extent over privately owned electricity rather than publicly controlled waterthey could actually meet with some success California spent the th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street and the East said Kevin Starr the state librarian and author of a multivolume history of California Now all of a sudden theres a dramatic possibility of it being recolonized at least in part by the rest of the West Captive Plants Feed Power to California Ground zero for these changes lies miles west of Phoenix in the dry scrublands of Wintersburg This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility now the nations single biggest power producer It will soon be home as well to between three and six new gasfired power plants that combined will produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old fraying world of regulated utilities and about the supplydemand relationships that California once maintained with the rest of the West More than onequarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles municipal utility the Department of Water and Power several other California cities and Southern California Edison A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California carrying a transmission line from plant to consumer California has big stakes in a halfdozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New Mexico From Californias point of view the beauty of these projects has been that they provided nearcertain power without the muss of meeting state pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home And at least until the mids California regulators virtually guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits even if plants power wasnt immediately needed The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to meet demand no matter what said Paul L Joskow a veteran utility economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology If you had too much power if it cost you a little too much that was less important than being sure you could meet demand And he added you had regulators watching to make sure you did The gasfired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also representative but of the new deregulated world of power production Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same California transmission line they are being built on an entirely different business premise selling power to the highest bidder In fact the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself but its huge transmission lines In addition to the California line four others fan out from the plant two back to Phoenix one east to New Mexico and one north to Utah and from there to the Northwest All were built to hardwire the nuclear project to its owners But they are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar by sending power wherever prices are highest It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the market to see if they could meet demand said Jack Davis president of Pinnacle West Capital Corp which owns Arizonas major utility and is putting up two of the Wintersburg plants Now he said approvingly its being built by people who look at the market to see if you can make a lot of money Plans Go Awry in Many States Money not the watchful eye of government was what was supposed to assure that electricity deregulation worked The opportunity to make it would cause investors to flock to the electricity business ensuring that plenty of new power plants got built If too many went up it would be investors not ratepayers who suffered If too few then high prices would attract still more investors more plants and ultimately more power But to date almost nothing about deregulation has gone as plannedand not just in California but in the West in general Take Arizona The state has a handsoff attitude toward business including its utilities It has almost none of the environmental restrictions blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it

producers heaven said A Michael Schaal a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc a prominent Washingtonarea consulting firm But Arizonas power production rose a mere during the s mostly as a result of improving existing plants Until months ago no one had applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late s I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort of year time horizon Arizonas Republican Gov Jane Dee Hull said in a recent interview I think what we all worry about is Are they planning Or Nevada Its utilities apparently did plan and increased electricitymaking capacity between and by a substantial But that wasnt enough to keep up with the states population which increased On Thursday Nevada Gov Kenny Guinn a Republican and former energy company executive indefinitely halted deregulation in his state Or traditionally energyrich Washington state One of its major utilities Seattle City Light recently learned that all of its previously planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed and then some by just three new customers computer server farms being built to handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the hightech capital But its unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional supplies are balanced on a razors edge according to Northwest Power Pool President Jerry Rust We have no cushion Indeed the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a razors edge with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this summer Schaal the Washingtonarea consultant for example said the region will come up short Westerners can expect to hours of rolling blackouts most of them in California he said One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that in contrast to what most people think supplies have not grown short just recently They have been perilously tight for the last several yearsbefore the start of Californias troubles of this summer and fall and before the nearrecord dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water for its hydroelectric dams The implication is that California did not cause other states to run short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger It did that according to key observers with one monumentally inept maneuver When California required its major utilities to buy power in the volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along higher costs to consumers it set off a furious price spiral That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security blanket the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively if local supplies proved inadequate The result has been a string of crises across the West In southern Arizona for example the San Carlos Irrigation Project a tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by dropping longterm contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the spot market has announced that its bills are going up Most of the projects poor customers say they cant pay In Phoenix utility executives who had confidently said the state was rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two yearold steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market In Idaho the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps back to the firm Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than purchasing power on the open marketand the potato farmers are likely to do pretty well themselves Deep Hostility in Rest of the West The subtle difference between Californias triggering recent events and actually causing the regions crisis is largely lost in the current atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval Although leaders of the rest of the West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big neighbor they are less guarded at home The normally mildmannered Leavitt for example was recently quoted as warning a Salt Lake City audience that California if given the chance would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly In an interview he denied having made the remark Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners that their states are in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto plundered provincesterrain that first Easterners and then Californians have regularly raided for minerals water and most recently power But this time some Western leaders think they can change all this A lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with California to their advantage said Stanford historian Richard White The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West In the Northwest Oregon Washington Idaho and Montana are redoubling their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration the huge federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that is one of Californias chief sources of summer electricity The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the region can be exported without the regions consent Oregon Gov John Kitzhaber said in an interview In Arizona state officials have gone from having no proposals for new power plants to being buried by them Regulators recently approved the construction of plants including several around Palo Verde and are considering another eight Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizonas needs first the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for whatever prices they can command an arrangement that could leave California just one among many bidders Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way Gov Hull is close to President Bush who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic California Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah where Leavitt is trying something that could become Californias worst nightmarerecalling power that Utah produces for the state Los Angeles DWP and several other California utilities own threequarters of the huge coalfired Intermountain Power Project in westcentral Utah and have been drawing on it without incident for years But Utah officials recently unearthed a longforgotten provision in their agreement with the plants owners that gives them the right with proper notice to recall power for local use The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another next summer and it may be able to take back still more according to plant general manager Reed Searle Although the amounts are trivialthe Los Angeles utility either owns or has firm contracts for more than megawatts of capacityLeavitt said Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants in the state including a to megawatt facility that Los Angeles is negotiating to build California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has depended on us to do that the Utah governor said Thats fine and were willing to do that But he added there comes a point at which if demand grows too large weve got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves and for our children and grandchildren If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point California could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which it now suffers Times researcher Lynn Marshall in Seattle contributed

consider a favorable ruling by regulators on Jan Moodys will continue to review for possible downgrade the ratings of Southern California Edison Company and its parent Edison International and the ratings of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and its parent PGE Corporation and may take additional rating action next week prior to the January th meeting Moodys said However it is not anticipated at this point that any rating action taken prior to the January th meeting would result in the ratings of the utilities or their respective parents falling below investment grade Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric have lost a combined billion since May buying wholesale power at prices that far exceed the fixed rates theyre allowed to charge their customers Between onethird and onehalf of that figure is offset by profits from power plants the utilities still own but the net losses are substantial and mounting Both utilities have said they soon will become unable to continue buying power for their customers if the situation persists Ratings agency Standard Poors warned Wednesday that both utilities face imminent default and a downgrading of their debt ratings to junkbond status unless California officials acted immediately to raise rates and restore the utilities to liquidity On Thursday the California Public Utilities Commission agreed rate hikes were needed We believe that retail rates in California must rise the commission said in a written statement It is our intent to maintain the utilities access to capital on reasonable terms But the commission deferred a final ruling on rates until Jan pending hearings on the matter scheduled for next week Standard Poors wasnt immediately available to comment on the decision Moodys said Friday that the PUCs decision was a necessary first step in restoring the utilities to financial viability Comments by the PUC and other officials indicated their desire to maintain the utilities investmentgrade status Moodys said But Moodys set strict terms for what must come out of the PUCs Jan meeting if the utilities are to avoid being downgraded to speculative status Specifically at that meeting the utilities need to obtain the right to immediately raise rates by a sizeable amount and must obtain the unquestioned and unambiguous ability to recover past and future wholesale procurement costs Moodys said The failure by the CPUC to act in a prompt and constructive way around these two issues could result in the utilities ratings being downgraded to below investment grade Such a downgrade would hurt the

Wont Fail Competition Will By Mark Golden Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow Jones Fans of the movie Erin Brockovich have been tempted to fantasize about executives from Californias two main investorowned utilities PGE Corp PCG and Edison International EIX heading to bankruptcy court Dream on True this week the utilities didnt get either of the two things they need to escape the astronomically expensive spot market for electricity in California a rate increase and longterm contracts with independent generators at prices they can afford under new rates With lending sources virtually dry both utilities have said they are about to run out of the cash needed to continue buying electricity in the spot market But hearings on a rate increase are scheduled to resume next week followed by the California Public Utilities Commission vote on Jan and longterm contract negotiations are to resume Jan Both negotiations are likely to succeed in keeping the companies afloat because almost all parties would lose with the utilities under Chapter protection and because the price to save the utilities isnt that high The rate increase decision was postponed Thursday because California Governor Gray Davis and his CPUC are trying to give the corporations only what they need to survive and not a penny more If Davis succeeds he is insisting on an independent audit of the holding companies and all subsidiaries shareholders can expect to see their dividends cut Sorting out the finances of the billion PGE which is the rd largest US company and billion Edison International must be daunting But here are the basics First the utilities have to get out of the spot market SCE charges residential and small commercial customers cents a kilowatthour of which cents or a megawatthour goes for electricity The rest covers transmission and distribution some other costs and the utilitys profit In the dayahead and spot market where SCE has been buying almost half the power it needs the utility has been paying about MWh Rates obviously wont be tripled so that SCE can continue to buy power in the spot market But the company can purchase fiveyear supply contracts at about MWh currently which it could do with a mere halfcent increase in rates Since the company is already making plenty of money on the coalfired and nuclear generators that it owns a halfcent increase on all the electricity it sells could be applied to all of its outside purchasing which comes to an extra a megawatthour Edison International is in a more dire immediate cash situation because the utility is twothirds of the parent company but Pacific Gas Electric faces a more difficult situation operationally PGE gets only centsKWh or MWh from customers for electricity while wholesale prices in northern California are more expensive than in southern California Finally PGE has to buy about twothirds of the power it needs in the wholesale market compared to SCEs because it sold off more of its power plants as dictated by deregulation legislation more quickly than SCE Still PGE could pick up fiveyear supply contracts at about MWh A twocent increase to its basic rate of cents would give PGE more per megawatthour or MWh to spend on power purchases But a increase may not be necessary The governors staff needs to find out the details on the substantial longterm deals PGE had the foresight to sign back in October Those deals were done at less than MWh and they kick in Jan The governors staff may also look at the unexpectedly high profits from SCEs and PGEs nuclear power plants The utilities have cut costs at the plants so instead of making just return on capital the utilities have been getting a net gain of on nuclear revenues according to Bob Finkelstein of The Utilities Reform Network If the utilities say deregulation decisions such as the rate freeze must be reexamined because they are bankrupting the utilities then TURN says the deregulation decisions that have resulted in unexpected gains for the utilities should be looked at too Nevertheless retail competition in California is dead for another five years The utilities get their modest rate increases with the insistence that they lock up their needed supplies under longterm contracts The contracts will be approved by the CPUC which means the utilities are guaranteed to be paid for the costs even if wholesale power prices fall below MWh in three to four years as expected The only way to ensure that the utilities get paid is to add a new nonbypassable transition cost to customer bills for five years which means that even if a customer chooses an alternate power supplier they will still be sending money back to PGE and Edison to pay for this years debacle The current nonbypassable charges which are scheduled to end in March are what has killed retail competition since Competitors cant offer much in the way of savings so almost nobody bothers to switch Electricity traders and regulators wonder why the utilities keep buying so much power at the last minute through the Independent System Operator which will pay almost anything to keep the lights on Right now the ISO is paying MWh for power that readily could have been bought Thursday for MWh This practice over the past six months has run up Edisons debt to a projected billion at the end of December and PGEs to billion Edison overstates its real losses by PGE by So for about billion dollars the utilities will get a rate increase and four more years of protection

Company Inc Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES This story was originally published late Thursday LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Unlike the almost daily threats of rolling blackouts from the electricity industry in California the possibility of natural gas interruptions is unlikely even though reserves are historically low said a company executive of Southern California Gas Co SoCal Gas is the gas distribution unit of San Diegobased Sempra Energy SRE and serves million customers Reserves of natural gas stored in four underground rock formations scattered throughout Southern California are at lower levels than what SoCal Gas normally maintains said Anne Smith vice president of customer service and marketing at SoCal Gas in a phone interview with Dow Jones Newswires SoCal Gas entered its winter season on Nov with billion cubic feet of gas in storage about Bcf less than its previous heating seasons Smith said The lower reserve levels are due to power plants in California siphoning out the gas at unprecedented levels she said The plants burn strictly gas and are trying to meet the intense electrical demand this winter after the states certain source of power from hydro generators in the Pacific Northwest had evaporated Lack of rain in the region this year is to blame for the hydro cutbacks Smith said As well a cold snap in November coupled with SoCal Gass decision to buy less gas this past summer for reserves didnt help matters Smith isnt worried about the lower levels of gas in the companys storage areas which can hold up to Bcf The cold weather in November forced SoCal Gas to pull out of storage about Bcf in November leaving a total of Bcf Smith said The stored gas is purchased as a hedge to protect the company from fluctuations in natural gas prices which this month have soared to as high as per million British thermal units on the spot market For the most part SoCal Gas imports its gas from outofstate regions in Texas and New Mexico via pipelines owned by El Paso Natural Gas Co EPG and Enron Corps ENE Transwestern pipeline El Paso and Transwestern are keeping up with demand and report that their pipelines are filled to the near the brim Over the past few weeks Smith said it is pushing out through its system of pipes about Bcf to Bcf of gas daily to its customers The way we see demand breakdown the last couple of weeks is generators using about Bcf a day our core customers million about Bcf and our noncore about Bcf she said The noncore customers which number about in total are industrial manufacturers who consume more than therms of gas annually Smith said In comparison a home averages about therms Smiths eyebrows have been raised by the rapid consumption of natural gas by power plants which use the commodity to run turbines for electrical generation Historically electric power plants have consumed about million to million cubic feet a day of gas in SoCal Gas service territory she said This is why we are seeing pipelines fuller than usual There is continuing demand by the electric generators she said This is basically an increase in demand for gas that has contributed to the national picture of why prices for gas have gone up this year Demand has outpaced production capacity Smith explained A growing economy starved for electricity to run its Internet systems or manufacturing businesses have contributed to the reasons why gas prices have soared this month she said Power plant owners have passed along these higher gas costs to the utilities where they sell their electricity This is partially why PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison Internationals EIX Southern California Edison face financial insolvency today They are having to borrow billions of dollars to pay for this higherpriced electricity as part of the states complex deregulation plan The power plants are owned by outofstate companies like AES Corp AES Calpine Corp CPN and Duke Energy Corp DUK The threat of rolling blackouts has several causes Some power plants run around the clock gobbling up the natural gas at a rapid pace But others have temporarily been shut down because environmental laws prohibit them from emitting certain levels of pollutants annually SoCal Gas has managed to keep its gas costs relatively low by buying gas for its core customers on longterm contracts at fixed prices This helps to insulate the company from price spikes on gas delivered to its system at the California and Arizona and Nevada borders By buying gas this way SoCal Gas was able to set a fixed charge of per MMBTU for its million core customers in

the companies some breathing room to allow for a much needed internal reorganization according to one California bankruptcy attorney What Chapter ultimately does is it allows a company to reorganize said Larry Peitzman an attorney with the Southern Californiabased law firm of Peitzman Glassman and Whegg The whole purpose is to come up with a plan to allow the company to service and pay back creditors and shareholders as much as possible While in bankruptcy a judge can order the state to raise the utilities retail electricity rates if that would help the company generate revenue to pay its creditors Peitzman said Peitzman who has worked on many large company bankruptcy cases in California said if PGE Corp unit PCG Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison International unit EIX Southern California Edison file for bankruptcy the companies will be given an injunction by a court that will prevent creditors from seizing the utilities assets collecting money or filing a lawsuit against the companies Another reason to file for bankruptcy protection is the companies wouldnt be forced to pay prebankruptcy debts if they have run up enormous bills Peitzman said Executives at both PGE and SoCal Edison said they may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection because of a combined billion debt in excess wholesale power costs and the inability under state law to pass those costs on to rate payers However between onehalf and onethird of that money has been paid into accounts held by the utilities to collect profits from the generators they still own The utilities were hoping for an immediate rate hike Thursday by the states Public Utilities Commission but commissioners said it would first hold evidentiary hearings and conduct an internal audit of the companies A rate increase is still at least two weeks off the commission said at its meeting Utilities Can Conduct Business While In Bankruptcy Peitzman said that while in bankruptcy the companies could operate as a debtor in

be approved by a judge Although most Chapter bankruptcy cases cant survive Peitzman said the states two largest utilities with millions of customers may be an exception Inevitably they are going to continue to owe money because of the constant shortfall they pay in electricity costs and what they charge their customers the attorney said But the bigger the company the more likely the company will survive It will be devastating to lose such large corporations If the companies fail to survive a Chapter filing the utilities assets would be liquidated to pay off their creditors Peitzman said In a Chapter filing PGE and SoCal Edison would put their creditors in different classes and determine how much under the dollar each one would get paid Peitzman said It can be as much as possible or less than cents on the dollar he said In addition any contracts that either companies held before a potential bankruptcy filing would have to be honored regardless if the company can fulfill its financial obligations to its counterpart Peitzman said Thats one of the other benefits he said Its called executory contracts which generally means both parties have material operations that have yet to be performed It may be longterm contracts and the company would be able to enforce the other part to continue doing business The other party cant refuse to do business because of a stay Bankruptcy can last as long as a judge allows it Peitzman said pointing to the Eastern Airlines bankruptcy case in the early s which lasted for years Neither company has indicated whether it will actually file for bankruptcy but SoCal Edison said in a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Tuesday that it may not be able to pay its January power bill if its retail rates are not immediately raised By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Article Next Article Previous Article Return to Headlines National Desk Section A Trying to Shore Up Utilities California Plans Rate Increase By LAURA M HOLSON The New York Times Page Page Column c New York Times Company LOS ANGELES Dec The California Public Utilities Commission said today that a rate increase for consumers was likely and that over the next weeks it would inspect the books of the two major utilities to decide how much was reasonable The move is an effort in part to show Wall Street that California is committed to ensuring the health of the states utilities On Wednesday the agency that rates the creditworthiness of both the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison said that if meaningful action was not taken by Friday the two utilities were headed for bankruptcy The agency is expected to comment on the commissions action soon Gov Gray Davis has been meeting this week with utility executives and consumer advocates to come to an agreement on the size of a rate increase Mr Davis a Democrat is also seeking the advice of financial experts including Alan Greenspan chairman of the Federal Reserve Board whom he is expected to meet with next week Some people close to those discussions suggested that percent would be a palatable rate increase but the utilities are asking for more The commission will hold hearings next week and just how much consumers will have to pay should be decided by Jan Four years ago California agreed to deregulate its utilities with the hope that competition would lower rates for households and businesses But this year prices for wholesale electricity and natural gas have skyrocketed forcing utilities to incur costs of more than billion that they cannot pass to consumers because rates are frozen until In recent weeks the utilities have tried to make a case that without rate increases service to consumers is threatened John Bryson chief executive of Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison has taken the unusual step of warning consumers in television and newspaper advertisements in Southern California and in Sacramento that blackouts are inevitable unless order is imposed In response to the announcement by the commission today Southern California Edison said it expected additional cost cutting and measures to preserve cash soon But not all the commissioners believed that todays announcement would be enough to placate financial analysts and investors many of whom buy utility stocks because they are perceived to be less risky than for example Internet stocks Analysts have recently downgraded the stocks of both Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison which are trading near week lows over fears about Californias energy woes When I look at the newspapers and peruse the Internet I get the decided impression that Wall Street has spoken said Richard Bilas a commissioner I dont know if this decision goes far enough Article Next Article Previous Article Return to Headlines Fitch Comments On California Electric Utilities Business Wire Copyright c Business Wire CHICAGOBUSINESS WIREDec Fitch views the California Public Utilities Commissions CPUC interim decision to initiate proceedings to consider raising retail rates as just one of the steps necessary to salvage credit quality for the states two largest utilities Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas and Electric Company Pac Gas The CPUC is expected to reach a decision on rate increases and recovery mechanisms during the first week of January at which time Fitch will assess the appropriate ratings for these companies The outstanding issue is whether rate increases will sufficiently offset high wholesale power prices being paid by the companies The companies securities ratings are likely to weaken unless full recovery is provided for the large monies paid by the utilities above existing retail rates and price stability is ensured for the regional market The utilities are unable to tap new credit until the rate decision is executed They do have however sufficient cash and existing credit to support them through the decision period of the first week in January If a suitable rate structure is passed by the CPUC at that time the utilities banks would be more likely to consider additional funding Liquidity will remain strained however to the extent that regional power prices remain high While Energy Secretary Richardson has ordered certain power producers to sell into the California market wholesale prices remain high and are above retail rates No additional federal action has been taken The CPUCs decision in early January is not expected to completely resolve the utilities future Given the large costs incurred and numerous constituent groups affected Fitch envisions a longerterm scenario of consecutive rate increases associated with a fundamental overhaul of Californias power market In conjunction with the governors active involvement the California legislature is evaluating potential actions to restructure the states power situation Legislative action remains possible over the next three months and could impact debt ratings The Rating Watch Negative designation remains in place for Pac Gas SCE and its parent Edison International The current ratings are Southern California Edison First

Commissions CPUC interim decision by stating that it wished the commission had acted more decisively but would work with the commission to take definitive action to address the current crisis by Jan The company said it was encouraged by the language in the CPUCs interim decision that committed the commission to take expedited actions to fulfill our statutory obligations to ensure that the utilities can provide service at just and reasonable rates In our view that mandate means that we must avoid continuing conditions that may jeopardize the utilities creditworthiness and their ability to continue to procure energy on behalf of customers Therefore we believe that retail rates in California must begin to rise It is our intent to maintain the utilities access to capital on reasonable terms We recognize that this will require that we act expeditiously to address the new FERCimposed reality of unlimited wholesale prices Nevertheless SCE underscored that any solution to the current crisis requires prompt meaningful and final action by the commission ending the rate freeze providing for the recovery of procurement costs and increasing rates to a level that will restore the creditworthiness of Californias investor owned utilities SCE added that it anticipated announcing additional costreduction and cashpreservation measures in the near term that would be necessary to

Word document and read only the changes that we made to the summary since receiving the final order which was issued this afternoon Alan Comnes The full order is available at electricbulkpowerh tm SUMMARY OF FERCS ORDER ESTABLISHING PROSPECTIVE MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN FOR THE CALIFORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKETS AND ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION OF PUBLIC UTILITY RATES IN WHOLESALE WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS Issued April Effective Date Price mitigation is effective May ISO needs t o have its dayahead proxy price ready on Physical Withholding To prevent physical withholding the plan will require sellers with PGAs to offer all their available power in real time to the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade All California generators ev en those not subject to FERC price regulation will be required to sell into t he ISOs real time market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted This requirement to provide power is for all hours for yr Price Mitigation The plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market During Stage and emergencies in t he ISOs real time market each generator other than hydro with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generators heat curve emission rates gas costs and emission costs plus MWh for OM The gas cost wil l be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California emissions are to be based on Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services The ISO will publish by am the gas and emission figures to be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared These figures for the next day will be based on the prior days Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgerald data A single market clearing price is determined in rea l time for all generators Highest bid sets the clearing price Each gasfired generator must file with FERC and the ISO within days on a confidential basis heat and emission rates for each generating unit The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator including maintenance and operating costs Generators that submit bids at or below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability Although the following qualification is made However all public util ity rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on marketbased rates discussed infra Presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavior In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price the generator must within days of the end of each month file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price FERC explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the all delivery point index it has adopted FERC has days to review act No opportunity costs in real time Marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based o n specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost Underscheduling Penalites FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it is still in place Thus although it may be advantageous to wait to buy power in RT at capped prices doing so may make the scheduling coordinator subject to the currently effective MWh penalty See p of the FERC order New Generation New generation is NOT exempted from the Commissions price mitigation measures Demand Response Beginning June only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids FERC is attempting to make the demand curve more price responsive This requirement is in effect for all hours Outages PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages The ISO is required to make a tariff filing within days of the order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages including periodic reports to the Commission Term Order expires one year from date of issuance RTO Filing California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June or Order lapses with no further effect The RTO filing is to be consistent with the characteristics and functions in Order No ISO Reporting On September ISO must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built Comments are du e in days Quarterly reports thereafter Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds The market based ra te authority of all public utilities is conditioned on no physical withhol d of capacity and no inappropriate bidding behavior Inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate In addition hockey stick bids are expressly prohibited ie bidding at marginal cost and at a much higher level Other prohibited bidding practices identified include pricing a single unit much higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs WestWide Section Investigation Opens a section investigation concerning the JR of wholesale power in the WSCC other than sales to the CAISO market FERC requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitigation However its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real time markets for power less than hours in advance of RT spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below within a control area FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California Comments are due in days on the investigations Althou gh it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the nonCalifornia PN W the FERC sets the refund effective date is days from publication of the Order NOx Limits in California Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law However it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement just include the fines as part of the price bid Also if NOx is limited may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price Surcharge to pay past amount due Comments are due in days on whether FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into a n escrow account to pay past costs and the effect this surcharge would ha ve on the PGE bankruptcy filing Treatment of the CAISOs Market Stabilization Plan MSP The FERC rejec ts the CAISOs MSP saying that FERCs plan for market mitigation is suff icient It expressly rejects CAISOs plan to create a dayahead and hourahead e nergy markets are expressly reject and tells CAISO to stop actions to implement software changes to effectuate such markets Unfortunately it does not expressly reject CAISOs plan to cut exports In general no mention wa s made as to issue of exports of power from California although the statement that CAISO must become a

Connole and Tom Doggett Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited WASHINGTON April Reuters A split US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved on Wednesday a plan to stabilize Californias volatile power market and stem market abuses Under the plan set to take effect in late May and last for one year price relief measures will be imposed on Californias wholesale power sales during severe energy shortages The threemember commission split sharply on the plan voting for an order that the majority believe will prevent power costs from soaring out of control in California this summer Wholesale power prices have jumped tenfold in California in the past year the result of growing demand from the states million residents following a decade that saw no major power plants added to its electric system FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert a Republican and Democrat Linda Breathitt supported the order Democrat William Massey dissented despite hours of talks aimed at reaching a consensus California consumers can rest assured that the commission has been attentive to their problems and has worked tirelessly to ensure that they receive necessary relief in a manner that does not compound current problems or undemine longerterm solutions Hebert said DISSENTING VOTE Massey said that by limiting price relief to declared power emergencies FERCs actions would fall short of solving the severe problems plaguing the California market The evidence is pervasive that the problem exists hours a day seven days a week Now is not the time for halfaloaf solutions Massey said Under the plan price mitigation would be triggered whenever the California Independent System Operator ISO declares a power emergency The ISO which manages most of the states power grid uses a threestage alert system with a Stage One called when power reserves drop to within seven percent of actual demand on the grid As demand eats further into the supply cushion Stage Two and Stage Three alerts are declared with Stage Three indicating rolling blackouts may be required to avoid overloading the grid and triggering far more widespread outages California has ordered rolling blackouts four days so far this year with state energy officials predicting more are likely this summer when air conditioning pushes demand to its annual peak FINDING A FAIR PRICE The mitigation and monitoring plans central element will require generators to offer available power in real time using a proxy price established a day ahead of actual delivery FERC said The proxy price reflects the marginal cost of the highestcost generator asked to supply power to the grid This price will vary daily according to demand the price of fuel used by generators such as natural gas and the cost of complying with environmental standards However generators could charge more than the proxy price if they can justify the higher cost when FERC reviews their sales records which they are required to submit at the end of each month If those costs cannot be justified FERC can order the generator to refund the buyer FERC said all generators in California even those not subject to the commissions price regulations are required to sell into the ISOs real time price market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities were exempted from the plan because of their generation limitations which fluctuate according to reservoir levels and the competing needs of others for those same water resources REGIONAL SOLUTION The commission emphasized that the only real solution to the power supply problems affecting the western markets was to forge a regional response Toward this goal FERC said California ISO would need to file a plan to form a regional transmission organization RTO by June or forfeit the socalled crutch of FERCs pricerelief plan Among the many measures contained in the order FERC told California utilities to coordinate any temporary shutdowns of generating plants with the ISO to ensure the state has adequate electric supplies at all times The order also formally opened an investigation by commission staff into possible abusive wholesale practices behind power sales throughout the Western region FERC said the plan would expire in as the California power crisis eases The states rush to build new power plants is expected to put an

Sierra Pacific Forwarded by Alan ComnesPDXECT on PM on PM Please respond to To cc Subject FERC in the News FERC Orders Limited California Price Controls FERC Orders Limited California Price Controls By Rebecca Smith The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Hewing more to the ideological position of the Bush administration than to the urgings of Gov Gray Davis and other California politicians a divided Federal Energy Regulatory Commission yesterday ordered limited price controls for the states flawed electricity market The new controls arent likely to restrain runaway wholesale power prices this summer The order was approved in a meeting that began hours late as the three commissioners locked horns over how far the agency should go to restrain wholesale prices that have pushed one of Californias big utilities into bankruptcy and which now threatens the states fiscal health The commission built on a staff recommendation issued in March that suggested it act only at those times when electricity supplies are in shortest supply In its order the commission decided to intervene whenever state electricity reserves drop below authorized levels socalled Stage I II and III emergencies The pricemitigation plan appears to ignore evidence filed by the gridoperating California Independent System Operator that generators can substantially raise market prices even when supplies arent technically short The ISO had recommended imposing price caps when individual generating plants tried to charge far more than fair production costs Commissioner William Massey dissented in part from the order in a sharply worded attack on the commission which he said hadnt done its duty to protect energy users by restraining generators that overcharge As a consequence he said the economic carnage is spreading throughout the West Mr Massey an Arkansas Democrat criticized the commission for acting only when electricity reserves fall below since this agency is obligated to ensure just and reasonable prices in all hours Under the order generators will be required to submit cost data to justify high prices during periods of electricity scarcity They will be allowed to collect the price they bid so long as it doesnt exceed the price charged by the oldest leastefficient plant operating at the time Such proxy price methodology enabled plant owners to collect as much as per megawatt hour in February or roughly times the prevailing price a year earlier Support for the order came from commission Chairman Curt Hebert a Mississippi Republican who said he didnt intend the commission to fall into a trap of limiting market forces to the extent that we hinder efforts to build new power plants and transmission lines that are badly needed to correct Californias supplyanddemand imbalance Linda Breathitt a Kentucky Democrat was the swing vote who eventually sided with Mr Hebert FERC staffers said she expressed doubts about whether the commission was doing as much as it should In the meeting she acknowledged the complexity and difficulty of the task but said she remained steadfast in my belief that market solutions are preferable to regulatory controls The commission attached an unexpected condition to its order saying the pricecap scheme will be revoked June unless the California grid operator has filed a plan to become part of a regionwide gridoperating organization Californias ISO had such a plan ready to file but it got yanked when a new board named by the states governor took control recently In recent months Mr Davis has urged increased isolationism even suggesting the state no longer export powerIt isnt clear whether FERC intends to permit California to continue to operate as a standalone gridrunning organization More likely it will be expected to show it intends to become part of a multistate organization to operate transmission lines in a nondiscriminatory manner The commission gave tentative approval yesterday to formation of a regional grid operator that would encompass eight other Western states and would include the transmission system of the federal Bonneville Power Administration the biggest power marketer and transmission owner in the Northwest Geographically it would be the biggest regional grid organization in the United States Folder Name FERC in the News Relevance Score on Scale of

<31970185.1075846328340.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,alan.comnes@enron.com,2000-12-01 04:17:00,Re Governors Response to FERC Cc that Jeff D will give us his reactions but in the mean time here s the proposal December Honorable James Hoecker Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC Dear Chairman Hoecker I told you on November in San Diego that by December I would respond to your plan with my suggestions to protect the interests of the people and businesses of California by providing reliable electricity supplies at the lowest reasonable cost Obviously a complete plan by the State of Californ ia must await your review of my suggested changes to your proposed order and final action on that order on December This letter outlines the first steps toward a plan that my administration is developing based on extensive ongoing discussions with legislative leaders consumers business utilitie s generators environmentalists labor agricultural interests and other California stakeholders This emerging plan will indicate to you that I am prepared to act with the concurrence of the Legislature in California to fulfill our obligations to assure reliable service at reasonable costs to the consumer The free market applied to electricity can work but only if market conditions allow for real competition and if all parties act responsibly The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has found that the wholesal e market in California is dysfunctional and that the wholesale prices charged by generators in your jurisdiction are unjust and unreasonable For that reason I renew my call for the FERC to undertake the actions that are critical and clearly within your jurisdiction to order retroactiv e refunds to the consumers who have been harmed this year and to establish hard price and bid caps that will protect consumers until the energy marketplace becomes truly competitive I do not believe that your proposed MW clearing price limit will provide any real protection I again ask you to impose real price and bid caps in the MW range on a transitiona l basis over the next months If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale markets the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited in scope I cannot in good conscience however forego any measure that wou ld serve to protect the people of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale markets will not victimize Californians again Since our meeting in San Diego several things have occurred which influenc e my current thinking On November the California Energy Commission CEC published the results of a detailed bottomup study of available electricity supply for It shows that taking into account expected load growth firm and dynamically scheduled imports and new supply already under construction or under contract California should be able to avoid emergencies if supplie s are properly managed and scheduled This presumes of course no gaming or withholding by sellers in wholesale markets and an absence of panic buying But the CEC study also shows that supplies are sufficiently tight that mark et power will exist and will need to be mitigated during periods of high deman d The same opportunity for wholesale price gouging through the exercise of market power and withholding that existed in summer will exist in You must take decisive action to preclude such behavior During the week of November while you and regulatory commissioners from around the country were in San Diego California was subjected to several Stage Alerts reflecting severe shortages of generation even though these are the lowest load months of the year Prices were astronomical More than megawatts of generation were offline at the same time including over megawatts for unscheduled outages I will recommend steps to assure that existing resources in California are availab le to meet Californias local energy needs and that information and the authority necessary to prevent a recurrence of such events are available to state and local officials On November the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and Electricity Oversight Board EOB filed comments with you that summarize th e current status of their ongoing investigations They confirm the conclusion s of the independent market monitors that California has been victimized by t he exercise of market power by merchant generators and marketers during summer and fall The state agencies have been hampered in their investigation s by the refusal of merchant generators to provide information that will both assist in the understanding of last summers prices and in the fashionin g of remedies to assure that we are not victimized again I urge you to compel t he necessary disclosure of information to complete these investigations On November the CPUC issued an Environmental Impact Report EIR on the proposal by PGE to move its hydroelectric facilities out of the regulated utility The EIR concludes that such a project would cause significant unmitigated harm to the environment and recommends retention as the preferr ed alternative This suggests that Californias course of generation divest iture by utilities may be slowed or stopped With these events as background I want to describe the steps I have taken and plan to take to begin to address the energy problems in California Increase Supply and Expand Infrastructure During the years preceding my administration virtually no power plants were built in California Since April six power plants representing MW of new generation have been approved by the CEC Five of these plants are under construction and the sixth will begin construction no later than April Twenty more applicants have completed prefiling and have active applications under review by the commission staff Eleven more applications are in the prefiling stage This represents a significant change in policy and performance and responds to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and environmental protection Much has been made about the difficulty of siting and permitting generation in California With enactment of AB and the creation of the Governor s Clean Energy Green Team this September California has aggressively committ ed itself to continue to accelerate the siting and permitting of generation an d to coordinate local state and federal government agency review and action Federal and state air quality requirements present unique challenges to the construction and operation of new power plants Through the Green Team we are developing new and creative approaches to meet these challenges workin g with local air quality districts the California Air Resources Board and th e United States Environmental Protection Agency These might for example expand upon the case of the proposed Otay Mesa power plant where mobile emissions credits are being used to offset stationary source emissions that will be generated by the new facility If necessary I will seek legislatio n to enable these new approaches I am also calling on the CPUC to aggressively reduce barriers and to otherwise encourage the locating of distributed generation and cogeneratio n where it is viable cost effective and environmentally sound The CPUC has already initiated action that will provide a forum for expediting certificates for transmission facilities including environmental review Finally I believe it is important to assure that all supplies of electrici ty are available when emergency conditions exist to avoid interruptions such as those experienced last summer and as recently as last week Suggestions we are considering for achieving this include new means of coordinating powerplant maintenance and operations activities Forward Contracting by Utilities Many parties including the FERC have recommended expanding the use of forward contracting by the utilities including multiyear bilateral contracts as a way of reducing exposure to volatile spot market prices The contracts as a part of a larger utility energy portfolio represent an important tool to moderate price volatility and ensure reliability I am asking the CPUC to expeditiously develop benchmarks to assure the reasonableness of these contracts without unfairly second guessing these decisions in later years This process should be in place early in to provide adequate opportuni ty for contracts to be negotiated and in place before Summer Coupled with the forward contracting issue is the question of the obligatio n of utilities to buy and sell all of their electricity through the Californi a Power Exchange PX This issue requires careful consideration since these transactions through the PX are currently subject to full disclosure and safeguards are in place to assure delivery These protections for consumers and business must not be lost Among the suggestions that have been made to ensure that utilities have a costeffective portfolio of energy is the proposal that utilities retain their existing generation as was recommended in the CPUCs environmental impact report regarding PGEs hydroelectric facilities There is growing consensus around this matter I would hope that the paramount objective in this series of regulatory decisions will be the protection of the interests of consumers Invigorating the Demand Side Conservation and efficiency are the cornerstones of Californias energy future Under my Executive Order the State of California has achieved more than MW of load reduction earlier this year during Stage alerts and is moving quickly to add another MW of demand reduction for summer The federal government is following suit for federal facilities The state and federal governments should set an example for similar voluntary load reduction initiatives in the private sector I was pleased to work with the California Grocers Association this summer t o develop a voluntary percent demand reduction program during peak hours f or more than groceries statewide This program must be duplicated in oth er areas where feasible and the business community in California has pledged t o work cooperatively toward that end I am calling on the CPUC to expedite its investigation of the states de mand reduction programs for commercial and industrial users including the interruptible programs Those that are successful should be expanded Those that require change should be modified And new opportunities should be developed to reduce and shift loads during peak hours and short supply The se programs must be in place no later than March to provide adequate opportunity for private sector planning and participation I am also calling on the CPUC and CEC to coordinate efforts to demonstrate and implement programs which provide realtime price signals and energyreduction systems to sophisticated commercial electricity users and to recommend a process for voluntary participation by consumers and small businesses In September I signed historic urgency legislation that provides milli on for demand reduction programs that can be implemented by Summer I als o signed legislation that provides approximately million annually for th e next years for energy efficiency research and development and renewable resource support The CPUC and CEC are aggressively pursuing innovative demand reduction programs using these funds Institutional Reform As I testified at the FERC hearing on November I agree that the stakeholder boards of the California Independent System Operator CAISO an d California Power Exchange present inherent conflicts of interest for their members and must be replaced The composition of these boards is specified by state law both as to size and as to qualifications for directors I will propose legislation to replace the stakeholder boards with independe nt boards that are accountable for their actions and that will consider both the need to assure reliability and the most economic method to do so I intend to move quickly on this aspect of the problem Your concurrence in this effort is extremely important It will little serve the consumers utilities merchant generators or other parties to become embroiled in litigation over exactly what powers Congress conferred on the FERC in or what traditional state powers if any Congress meant to circumscribe or override Recognizing that there may be a need for more extensive reconstitution of these entities as some have suggested I do not intend to let the status q uo continue while those debates are carried on California will alter the composition and membership of the boards so that the entities are in positi on to contribute to achieving the paramount objectives of both state and feder al law protection of the consumers interests In Governor Pete Wilson and his CPUC reposed a great deal of trust in the FERC in moving Californias electricity system into an unbundled federalized mode Now is the time for you to justify that trust I want to cooperate with you in transitioning to a marketbased approach to provide this essential service However first and foremost I want you to do your job and to let me do mine Together we can protect the electricity consumer s of California and work to restore their confidence Sincerely GRAY DAVIS

MoodysWont Downgrade Calif Utils To Junk Before Jan Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones Moodys Investors Service doesnt expect to reduce the debt ratings of Californias two largest utilities below investment grade status before state regulators meet on a rate hike on Jan But the ratings agency said in a press release Friday that it might still cut the ratings of PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric and Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison next week to a level short of speculative status and set strict terms for what it would consider a favorable ruling by regulators on Jan Moodys will continue to review for possible downgrade the ratings of Southern California Edison Company and its parent Edison International and the ratings of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and its parent PGE Corporation and may take additional rating action next week prior to the January th meeting Moodys said However it is not anticipated at this point that any rating action taken prior to the January th meeting would result in the ratings of the utilities or their respective parents falling below investment grade Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric have lost a combined billion since May buying wholesale power at prices that far exceed the fixed rates theyre allowed to charge their customers Between onethird and onehalf of that figure is offset by profits from power plants the utilities still own but the net losses are substantial and mounting Both utilities have said they soon will become unable to continue buying power for their customers if the situation persists Ratings agency Standard Poors warned Wednesday that both utilities face imminent default and a downgrading of their debt ratings to junkbond status unless California officials acted immediately to raise rates and restore the utilities to liquidity On Thursday the California Public Utilities Commission agreed rate hikes were needed We believe that retail rates in California must rise the commission said in a written statement It is our intent to maintain the utilities access to capital on reasonable terms But the commission deferred a final ruling on rates until Jan pending hearings on the matter scheduled for next week Standard Poors wasnt immediately available to comment on the decision Moodys said Friday that the PUCs decision was a necessary first step in restoring the utilities to financial viability Comments by the PUC and other officials indicated their desire to maintain the utilities investmentgrade status Moodys said But Moodys set strict terms for what must come out of the PUCs Jan meeting if the utilities are to avoid being downgraded to speculative status Specifically at that meeting the utilities need to obtain the right to immediately raise rates by a sizeable amount and must obtain the unquestioned and unambiguous ability to recover past and future wholesale procurement costs Moodys said The failure by the CPUC to act in a prompt and constructive way around these two issues could result in the utilities ratings being downgraded to below investment grade Such a downgrade would hurt the utilities ability to fund power purchases and daytoday operations Moodys said By Andrew Dowell Dow Jones Newswires Article Next Article Previous Article Return to Headlines POWER POINTS Calif Utils Wont Fail Competition Will By Mark Golden Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow Jones Fans of the movie Erin Brockovich have been tempted to fantasize about executives from Californias two main investorowned utilities PGE Corp PCG and Edison International EIX heading to bankruptcy court Dream on True this week the utilities didnt get either of the two things they need to escape the astronomically expensive spot market for electricity in California a rate increase and longterm contracts with independent generators at prices they can afford under new rates With lending sources virtually dry both utilities have said they are about to run out of the cash needed to continue buying electricity in the spot market But hearings on a rate increase are scheduled to resume next week followed by the California Public Utilities Commission vote on Jan and longterm contract negotiations are to resume Jan Both negotiations are likely to succeed in keeping the companies afloat because almost all parties would lose with the utilities under Chapter protection and because the price to save the utilities isnt that high The rate increase decision was postponed Thursday because California Governor Gray Davis and his CPUC are trying to give the corporations only what they need to survive and not a penny more If Davis succeeds he is insisting on an independent audit of the holding companies and all subsidiaries shareholders can expect to see their dividends cut Sorting out the finances of the billion PGE which is the rd largest US company and billion Edison International must be daunting But here are the basics First the utilities have to get out of the spot market SCE charges residential and small commercial customers cents a kilowatthour of which cents or a megawatthour goes for electricity The rest covers transmission and distribution some other costs and the utilitys profit In the dayahead and spot market where SCE has been buying almost half the power it needs the utility has been paying about MWh Rates obviously wont be tripled so that SCE can continue to buy power in the spot market But the company can purchase fiveyear supply contracts at about MWh currently which it could do with a mere halfcent increase in rates Since the company is already making plenty of money on the coalfired and nuclear generators that it owns a halfcent increase on all the electricity it sells could be applied to all of its outside purchasing which comes to an extra a megawatthour Edison International is in a more dire immediate cash situation because the utility is twothirds of the parent company but Pacific Gas Electric faces a more difficult situation operationally PGE gets only centsKWh or MWh from customers for electricity while wholesale prices in northern California are more expensive than in southern California Finally PGE has to buy about twothirds of the power it needs in the wholesale market compared to SCEs because it sold off more of its power plants as dictated by deregulation legislation more quickly than SCE Still PGE could pick up fiveyear supply contracts at about MWh A twocent increase to its basic rate of cents would give PGE more per megawatthour or MWh to spend on power purchases But a increase may not be necessary The governors staff needs to find out the details on the substantial longterm deals PGE had the foresight to sign back in October Those deals were done at less than MWh and they kick in Jan The governors staff may also look at the unexpectedly high profits from SCEs and PGEs nuclear power plants The utilities have cut costs at the plants so instead of making just return on capital the utilities have been getting a net gain of on nuclear revenues according to Bob Finkelstein of The Utilities Reform Network If the utilities say deregulation decisions such as the rate freeze must be reexamined because they are bankrupting the utilities then TURN says the deregulation decisions that have resulted in unexpected gains for the utilities should be looked at too Nevertheless retail competition in California is dead for another five years The utilities get their modest rate increases with the insistence that they lock up their needed supplies under longterm contracts The contracts will be approved by the CPUC which means the utilities are guaranteed to be paid for the costs even if wholesale power prices fall below MWh in three to four years as expected The only way to ensure that the utilities get paid is to add a new nonbypassable transition cost to customer bills for five years which means that even if a customer chooses an alternate power supplier they will still be sending money back to PGE and Edison to pay for this years debacle The current nonbypassable charges which are scheduled to end in March are what has killed retail competition since Competitors cant offer much in the way of savings so almost nobody bothers to switch Electricity traders and regulators wonder why the utilities keep buying so much power at the last minute through the Independent System Operator which will pay almost anything to keep the lights on Right now the ISO is paying MWh for power that readily could have been bought Thursday for MWh This practice over the past six months has run up Edisons debt to a projected billion at the end of December and PGEs to billion Edison overstates its real losses by PGE by So for about billion dollars the utilities will get a rate increase and four more years of protection

Company Inc Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES This story was originally published late Thursday LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Unlike the almost daily threats of rolling blackouts from the electricity industry in California the possibility of natural gas interruptions is unlikely even though reserves are historically low said a company executive of Southern California Gas Co SoCal Gas is the gas distribution unit of San Diegobased Sempra Energy SRE and serves million customers Reserves of natural gas stored in four underground rock formations scattered throughout Southern California are at lower levels than what SoCal Gas normally maintains said Anne Smith vice president of customer service and marketing at SoCal Gas in a phone interview with Dow Jones Newswires SoCal Gas entered its winter season on Nov with billion cubic feet of gas in storage about Bcf less than its previous heating seasons Smith said The lower reserve levels are due to power plants in California siphoning out the gas at unprecedented levels she said The plants burn strictly gas and are trying to meet the intense electrical demand this winter after the states certain source of power from hydro generators in the Pacific Northwest had evaporated Lack of rain in the region this year is to blame for the hydro cutbacks Smith said As well a cold snap in November coupled with SoCal Gass decision to buy less gas this past summer for reserves didnt help matters Smith isnt worried about the lower levels of gas in the companys storage areas which can hold up to Bcf The cold weather in November forced SoCal Gas to pull out of storage about Bcf in November leaving a total of Bcf Smith said The stored gas is purchased as a hedge to protect the company from fluctuations in natural gas prices which this month have soared to as high as per million British thermal units on the spot market For the most part SoCal Gas imports its gas from outofstate regions in Texas and New Mexico via pipelines owned by El Paso Natural Gas Co EPG and Enron Corps ENE Transwestern pipeline El Paso and Transwestern are keeping up with demand and report that their pipelines are filled to the near the brim Over the past few weeks Smith said it is pushing out through its system of pipes about Bcf to Bcf of gas daily to its customers The way we see demand breakdown the last couple of weeks is generators using about Bcf a day our core customers million about Bcf and our noncore about Bcf she said The noncore customers which number about in total are industrial manufacturers who consume more than therms of gas annually Smith said In comparison a home averages about therms Smiths eyebrows have been raised by the rapid consumption of natural gas by power plants which use the commodity to run turbines for electrical generation Historically electric power plants have consumed about million to million cubic feet a day of gas in SoCal Gas service territory she said This is why we are seeing pipelines fuller than usual There is continuing demand by the electric generators she said This is basically an increase in demand for gas that has contributed to the national picture of why prices for gas have gone up this year Demand has outpaced production capacity Smith explained A growing economy starved for electricity to run its Internet systems or manufacturing businesses have contributed to the reasons why gas prices have soared this month she said Power plant owners have passed along these higher gas costs to the utilities where they sell their electricity This is partially why PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison Internationals EIX Southern California Edison face financial insolvency today They are having to borrow billions of dollars to pay for this higherpriced electricity as part of the states complex deregulation plan The power plants are owned by outofstate companies like AES Corp AES Calpine Corp CPN and Duke Energy Corp DUK The threat of rolling blackouts has several causes Some power plants run around the clock gobbling up the natural gas at a rapid pace But others have temporarily been shut down because environmental laws prohibit them from emitting certain levels of pollutants annually SoCal Gas has managed to keep its gas costs relatively low by buying gas for its core customers on longterm contracts at fixed prices This helps to insulate the company from price spikes on gas delivered to its system at the California and Arizona and Nevada borders By buying gas this way SoCal Gas was able to set a fixed charge of per MMBTU for its million core customers in

originally published Thursday By Jason Leopold LOS ANGELES Dow JonesIf two of Californias largest utilities file for Chapter bankruptcy protection a move they said this week was possible it may give the companies some breathing room to allow for a much needed internal reorganization according to one California bankruptcy attorney What Chapter ultimately does is it allows a company to reorganize said Larry Peitzman an attorney with the Southern Californiabased law firm of Peitzman Glassman and Whegg The whole purpose is to come up with a plan to allow the company to service and pay back creditors and shareholders as much as possible While in bankruptcy a judge can order the state to raise the utilities retail electricity rates if that would help the company generate revenue to pay its creditors Peitzman said Peitzman who has worked on many large company bankruptcy cases in California said if PGE Corp unit PCG Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison International unit EIX Southern California Edison file for bankruptcy the companies will be given an injunction by a court that will prevent creditors from seizing the utilities assets collecting money or filing a lawsuit against the companies Another reason to file for bankruptcy protection is the companies wouldnt be forced to pay prebankruptcy debts if they have run up enormous bills Peitzman said Executives at both PGE and SoCal Edison said they may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection because of a combined billion debt in excess wholesale power costs and the inability under state law to pass those costs on to rate payers However between onehalf and onethird of that money has been paid into accounts held by the utilities to collect profits from the generators they still own The utilities were hoping for an immediate rate hike Thursday by the states Public Utilities Commission but commissioners said it would first hold evidentiary hearings and conduct an internal audit of the companies A rate increase is still at least two weeks off the commission said at its meeting Utilities Can Conduct Business While In Bankruptcy Peitzman said that while in bankruptcy the companies could operate as a debtor in possession which means the companies have the authority to conduct business as usual without the consent of bankruptcy court But if the companies were to try and secure a loan the loan would have to be approved by a judge Although most Chapter bankruptcy cases cant survive Peitzman said the states two largest utilities with millions of customers may be an exception Inevitably they are going to continue to owe money because of the constant shortfall they pay in electricity costs and what they charge their customers the attorney said But the bigger the company the more likely the company will survive It will be devastating to lose such large corporations If the companies fail to survive a Chapter filing the utilities assets would be liquidated to pay off their creditors Peitzman said In a Chapter filing PGE and SoCal Edison would put their creditors in different classes and determine how much under the dollar each one would get paid Peitzman said It can be as much as possible or less than cents on the dollar he said In addition any contracts that either companies held before a potential bankruptcy filing would have to be honored regardless if the company can fulfill its financial obligations to its counterpart Peitzman said Thats one of the other benefits he said Its called executory contracts which generally means both parties have material operations that have yet to be performed It may be longterm contracts and the company would be able to enforce the other part to continue doing business The other party cant refuse to do business because of a stay Bankruptcy can last as long as a judge allows it Peitzman said pointing to the Eastern Airlines bankruptcy case in the early s which lasted for years Neither company has indicated whether it will actually file for bankruptcy but SoCal Edison said in a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Tuesday that it may not be able to pay its January power bill if its retail rates are not immediately raised

the states utilities On Wednesday the agency that rates the creditworthiness of both the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison said that if meaningful action was not taken by Friday the two utilities were headed for bankruptcy The agency is expected to comment on the commissions action soon Gov Gray Davis has been meeting this week with utility executives and consumer advocates to come to an agreement on the size of a rate increase Mr Davis a Democrat is also seeking the advice of financial experts including Alan Greenspan chairman of the Federal Reserve Board whom he is expected to meet with next week Some people close to those discussions suggested that percent would be a palatable rate increase but the utilities are asking for more The commission will hold hearings next week and just how much consumers will have to pay should be decided by Jan Four years ago California agreed to deregulate its utilities with the hope that competition would lower rates

two largest utilities Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas and Electric Company Pac Gas The CPUC is expected to reach a decision on rate increases and recovery mechanisms during the first week of January at which time Fitch will assess the appropriate ratings for these companies The outstanding issue is whether rate increases will sufficiently offset high wholesale power prices being paid by the companies The companies securities ratings are likely to weaken unless full recovery is provided for the large monies paid by the utilities above existing retail rates and price stability is ensured for the regional market The utilities are unable to tap new credit until the rate decision is executed They do have however sufficient cash and existing credit to support them through the decision period of the first week in January If a suitable rate structure is passed by the CPUC at that time the utilities banks would be more likely to consider additional funding Liquidity will remain strained however to the extent that regional power prices remain high While Energy Secretary Richardson has ordered certain power producers to sell into the California market wholesale prices remain high and are above retail rates No additional federal action has been taken The CPUCs decision in early January is not expected to completely resolve the utilities future Given the large costs incurred and numerous constituent groups affected Fitch envisions a longerterm scenario of consecutive rate increases associated with a fundamental overhaul of Californias power market In conjunction

accross the west businessreportspowerlatwesthtm Back to story Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California Utilities Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations swelled and few new energy sources were developed Now also facing blackouts they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and toward themselves By PETER G GOSSELIN Times Staff Writer WINTERSBURG ArizFor more than a century California ran a simple account with the rest of the West It demanded and the West supplied most especially water and power But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decadein no small part because of an outbound trek of Californiansthis simple supplydemand relationship has broken down Fundamentally the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system just as California has its own And it has done so in very much the same wayby adding too many people without enough new power or conservation Indeed statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have been on the verge of trouble even without Californias help and may yet face the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden State The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that its planning reservesthe extra power that utilities build in to handle emergencieshave shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts consider dangerous Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade Despite the long economic boom of the s which smiled especially on the West several such as Arizona have failed to complete a single new power plant We dont know how bad its going to be yet said Utahs Republican governor Mike Leavitt We wont know that until May June July and August when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers In trying to dodge the blackout bullet many Western leaders are seeking to force a great change on the region to renegotiate their states basic deal with California They want to end an old relationshipthat between center and hinterland colonizer and colonizedand establish a new one that could curtail Californias long regional dominance In the strange chemistry of the momentwhen a onceRepublican state government has turned Democratic and a onceDemocratic national government has turned Republican when the battle is to a large extent over privately owned electricity rather than publicly controlled waterthey could actually meet with some success California spent the th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street and the East said Kevin Starr the state librarian and author of a multivolume history of California Now all of a sudden theres a dramatic possibility of it being recolonized at least in part by the rest of the West Captive Plants Feed Power to California Ground zero for these changes lies miles west of Phoenix in the dry scrublands of Wintersburg This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility now the nations single biggest power producer It will soon be home as well to between three and six new gasfired power plants that combined will produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old fraying world of regulated utilities and about the supplydemand relationships that California once maintained with the rest of the West More than onequarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles municipal utility the Department of Water and Power several other California cities and Southern California Edison A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California carrying a transmission line from plant to consumer California has big stakes in a halfdozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New Mexico From Californias point of view the beauty of these projects has been that they provided nearcertain power without the muss of meeting state pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home And at least until the mids California regulators virtually guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits even if plants power wasnt immediately needed The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to meet demand no matter what said Paul L Joskow a veteran utility economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology If you had too much power if it cost you a little too much that was less important than being sure you could meet demand And he added you had regulators watching to make sure you did The gasfired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also representative but of the new deregulated world of power production Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same California transmission line they are being built on an entirely different business premise selling power to the highest bidder In fact the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself but its huge transmission lines In addition to the California line four others fan out from the plant two back to Phoenix one east to New Mexico and one north to Utah and from there to the Northwest All were built to hardwire the nuclear project to its owners But they are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar by sending power wherever prices are highest It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the market to see if they could meet demand said Jack Davis president of Pinnacle West Capital Corp which owns Arizonas major utility and is putting up two of the Wintersburg plants Now he said approvingly its being built by people who look at the market to see if you can make a lot of money Plans Go Awry in Many States Money not the watchful eye of government was what was supposed to assure that electricity deregulation worked The opportunity to make it would cause investors to flock to the electricity business ensuring that plenty of new power plants got built If too many went up it would be investors not ratepayers who suffered If too few then high prices would attract still more investors more plants and ultimately more power But to date almost nothing about deregulation has gone as plannedand not just in California but in the West in general Take Arizona The state has a handsoff attitude toward business including its utilities It has almost none of the environmental restrictions blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs Its population grew by from to according to the Census Bureau And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate according to industry figures Arizona should have been a power producers heaven said A Michael Schaal a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc a prominent Washingtonarea consulting firm But Arizonas power production rose a mere during the s mostly as a result of improving existing plants Until months ago no one had applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late s I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort of year time horizon Arizonas Republican Gov Jane Dee Hull said in a recent interview I think what we all worry about is Are they planning Or Nevada Its utilities apparently did plan and increased electricitymaking capacity between and by a substantial But that wasnt enough to keep up with the states population which increased On Thursday Nevada Gov Kenny Guinn a Republican and former energy company executive indefinitely halted deregulation in his state Or traditionally energyrich Washington state One of its major utilities Seattle City Light recently learned that all of its previously planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed and then some by just three new customers computer server farms being built to handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the hightech capital But its unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional supplies are balanced on a razors edge according to Northwest Power Pool President Jerry Rust We have no cushion Indeed the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a razors edge with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this summer Schaal the Washingtonarea consultant for example said the region will come up short Westerners can expect to hours of rolling blackouts most of them in California he said One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that in contrast to what most people think supplies have not grown short just recently They have been perilously tight for the last several yearsbefore the start of Californias troubles of this summer and fall and before the nearrecord dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water for its hydroelectric dams The implication is that California did not cause other states to run short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger It did that according to key observers with one monumentally inept maneuver When California required its major utilities to buy power in the volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along higher costs to consumers it set off a furious price spiral That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security blanket the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively if local supplies proved inadequate The result has been a string of crises across the West In southern Arizona for example the San Carlos Irrigation Project a tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by dropping longterm contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the spot market has announced that its bills are going up Most of the projects poor customers say they cant pay In Phoenix utility executives who had confidently said the state was rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two yearold steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market In Idaho the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps back to the firm Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than purchasing power on the open marketand the potato farmers are likely to do pretty well themselves Deep Hostility in Rest of the West The subtle difference between Californias triggering recent events and actually causing the regions crisis is largely lost in the current atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval Although leaders of the rest of the West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big neighbor they are less guarded at home The normally mildmannered Leavitt for example was recently quoted as warning a Salt Lake City audience that California if given the chance would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly In an interview he denied having made the remark Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners that their states are in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto plundered provincesterrain that first Easterners and then Californians have regularly raided for minerals water and most recently power But this time some Western leaders think they can change all this A lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with California to their advantage said Stanford historian Richard White The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West In the Northwest Oregon Washington Idaho and Montana are redoubling their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration the huge federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that is one of Californias chief sources of summer electricity The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the region can be exported without the regions consent Oregon Gov John Kitzhaber said in an interview In Arizona state officials have gone from having no proposals for new power plants to being buried by them Regulators recently approved the construction of plants including several around Palo Verde and are considering another eight Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizonas needs first the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for whatever prices they can command an arrangement that could leave California just one among many bidders Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way Gov Hull is close to President Bush who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic California Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah where Leavitt is trying something that could become Californias worst nightmarerecalling power that Utah produces for the state Los Angeles DWP and several other California utilities own threequarters of the huge coalfired Intermountain Power Project in westcentral Utah and have been drawing on it without incident for years But Utah officials recently unearthed a longforgotten provision in their agreement with the plants owners that gives them the right with proper notice to recall power for local use The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another next summer and it may be able to take back still more according to plant general manager Reed Searle Although the amounts are trivialthe Los Angeles utility either owns or has firm contracts for more than megawatts of capacityLeavitt said Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants in the state including a to megawatt facility that Los Angeles is negotiating to build California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has depended on us to do that the Utah governor said Thats fine and were willing to do that But he added there comes a point at which if demand grows too large weve got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves and for our children and grandchildren If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point California could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which it now suffers Times researcher Lynn Marshall in Seattle contributed

Connole and Tom Doggett Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited WASHINGTON April Reuters A split US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved on Wednesday a plan to stabilize Californias volatile power market and stem market abuses Under the plan set to take effect in late May and last for one year price relief measures will be imposed on Californias wholesale power sales during severe energy shortages The threemember commission split sharply on the plan voting for an order that the majority believe will prevent power costs from soaring out of control in California this summer Wholesale power prices have jumped tenfold in California in the past year the result of growing demand from the states million residents following a decade that saw no major power plants added to its electric system FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert a Republican and Democrat Linda Breathitt supported the order Democrat William Massey dissented despite hours of talks aimed at reaching a consensus California consumers can rest assured that the commission has been attentive to their problems and has worked tirelessly to ensure that they receive necessary relief in a manner that does not compound current problems or undemine longerterm solutions Hebert said DISSENTING VOTE Massey said that by limiting price relief to declared power emergencies FERCs actions would fall short of solving the severe problems plaguing the California market The evidence is pervasive that the problem exists hours a day seven days a week Now is not the time for halfaloaf solutions Massey said Under the plan price mitigation would be triggered whenever the California Independent System Operator ISO declares a power emergency The ISO which manages most of the states power grid uses a threestage alert system with a Stage One called when power reserves drop to within seven percent of actual demand on the grid As demand eats further into the supply cushion Stage Two and Stage Three alerts are declared with Stage Three indicating rolling blackouts may be required to avoid overloading the grid and triggering far more widespread outages California has ordered rolling blackouts four days so far this year with state energy officials predicting more are likely this summer when air conditioning pushes demand to its annual peak FINDING A FAIR PRICE The mitigation and monitoring plans central element will require generators to offer available power in real time using a proxy price established a day ahead of actual delivery FERC said The proxy price reflects the marginal cost of the highestcost generator asked to supply power to the grid This price will vary daily according to demand the price of fuel used by generators such as natural gas and the cost of complying with environmental standards However generators could charge more than the proxy price if they can justify the higher cost when FERC reviews their sales records which they are required to submit at the end of each month If those costs cannot be justified FERC can order the generator to refund the buyer FERC said all generators in California even those not subject to the commissions price regulations are required to sell into the ISOs real time price market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities were exempted from the plan because of their generation limitations which fluctuate according to reservoir levels and the competing needs of others for those same water resources REGIONAL SOLUTION The commission emphasized that the only real solution to the power supply problems affecting the western markets was to forge a regional response Toward this goal FERC said California ISO would need to file a plan to form a regional transmission organization RTO by June or forfeit the socalled crutch of FERCs pricerelief plan Among the many measures contained in the order FERC told California utilities to coordinate any temporary shutdowns of generating plants with the ISO to ensure the state has adequate electric supplies at all times The order also formally opened an investigation by commission staff into possible abusive wholesale practices behind power sales throughout the Western region FERC said the plan would expire in as the California power crisis eases The states rush to build new power plants is expected to put an

By Rebecca Smith The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Hewing more to the ideological position of the Bush administration than to the urgings of Gov Gray Davis and other California politicians a divided Federal Energy Regulatory Commission yesterday ordered limited price controls for the states flawed electricity market The new controls arent likely to restrain runaway wholesale power prices this summer The order was approved in a meeting that began hours late as the three commissioners locked horns over how far the agency should go to restrain wholesale prices that have pushed one of Californias big utilities into bankruptcy and which now threatens the states fiscal health The commission built on a staff recommendation issued in March that suggested it act only at those times when electricity supplies are in shortest supply In its order the commission decided to intervene whenever state electricity reserves drop below authorized levels socalled Stage I II and III emergencies The pricemitigation plan appears to ignore evidence filed by the gridoperating California Independent System Operator that generators can substantially raise market prices even when supplies arent technically short The ISO had recommended imposing price caps when individual generating plants tried to charge far more than fair production costs Commissioner William Massey dissented in part from the order in a sharply worded attack on the commission which he said hadnt done its duty to protect energy users by restraining generators that overcharge As a consequence he said the economic carnage is spreading throughout the West Mr Massey an Arkansas Democrat criticized the commission for acting only when electricity reserves fall below since this agency is obligated to ensure just and reasonable prices in all hours Under the order generators will be required to submit cost data to justify high prices during periods of electricity scarcity They will be allowed to collect the price they bid so long as it doesnt exceed the price charged by the oldest leastefficient plant operating at the time Such proxy price methodology enabled plant owners to collect as much as per megawatt hour in February or roughly times the prevailing price a year earlier Support for the order came from commission Chairman Curt Hebert a Mississippi Republican who said he didnt intend the commission to fall into a trap of limiting market forces to the extent that we hinder efforts to build new power plants and transmission lines that are badly needed to correct Californias supplyanddemand imbalance Linda Breathitt a Kentucky Democrat was the swing vote who eventually sided with Mr Hebert FERC staffers said she expressed doubts about whether the commission was doing as much as it should In the meeting she acknowledged the complexity and difficulty of the task but said she remained steadfast in my belief that market solutions are preferable to regulatory controls The commission attached an unexpected condition to its order saying the pricecap scheme will be revoked June unless the California grid operator has filed a plan to become part of a regionwide gridoperating organization Californias ISO had such a plan ready to file but it got yanked when a new board named by the states governor took control recently In recent months Mr Davis has urged increased isolationism even suggesting the state no longer export powerIt isnt clear whether FERC intends to permit California to continue to operate as a standalone gridrunning organization More likely it will be expected to show it intends to become part of a multistate organization to operate transmission lines in a nondiscriminatory manner The commission gave tentative approval yesterday to formation of a regional grid operator that would encompass eight other Western states and would include the transmission system of the federal Bonneville Power Administration the biggest

SUMMARY OF FERCS ORDER ESTABLISHING PROSPECTIVE MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN FOR THE CALIFORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKETS AND ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION OF PUBLIC UTILITY RATES IN WHOLESALE WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS Issued April Effective Date Price mitigation is effective May ISO needs t o have its dayahead proxy price ready on Physical Withholding To prevent physical withholding the plan will require sellers with PGAs to offer all their available power in real time to the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade All California generators ev en those not subject to FERC price regulation will be required to sell into t he ISOs real time market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted This requirement to provide power is for all hours for yr Price Mitigation The plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market During Stage and emergencies in t he ISOs real time market each generator other than hydro with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generators heat curve emission rates gas costs and emission costs plus MWh for OM The gas cost wil l be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California emissions are to be based on Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services The ISO will publish by am the gas and emission figures to be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared These figures for the next day will be based on the prior days Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgerald data A single market clearing price is determined in rea l time for all generators Highest bid sets the clearing price Each gasfired generator must file with FERC and the ISO within days on a confidential basis heat and emission rates for each generating unit The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator including maintenance and operating costs Generators that submit bids at or below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability Although the following qualification is made However all public util ity rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on marketbased rates discussed infra Presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavior In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price the generator must within days of the end of each month file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price FERC explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the all delivery point index it has adopted FERC has days to review act No opportunity costs in real time Marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based o n specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost Underscheduling Penalites FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it is still in place Thus although it may be advantageous to wait to buy power in RT at capped prices doing so may make the scheduling coordinator subject to

authority of all public utilities is conditioned on no physical withhol d of capacity and no inappropriate bidding behavior Inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate In addition hockey stick bids are expressly prohibited ie bidding at marginal cost and at a much higher level Other prohibited bidding practices identified include pricing a single unit much higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs WestWide Section Investigation Opens a section investigation concerning the JR of wholesale power in the WSCC other than sales to the CAISO market FERC requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitigation However its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real

California Comments are due in days on the investigations Althou gh it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the nonCalifornia PN W the FERC sets the refund effective date is days from publication of the Order NOx Limits in California Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law However it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must

<27642848.1075846335857.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,alan.comnes@enron.com,2000-12-01 04:17:00,Re Governors Response to FERC Cc that Jeff D will give us his reactions but in the mean time here s the proposal December Honorable James Hoecker Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC Dear Chairman Hoecker I told you on November in San Diego that by December I would respond to your plan with my suggestions to protect the interests of the people and businesses of California by providing reliable electricity supplies at the lowest reasonable cost Obviously a complete plan by the State of Californ ia must await your review of my suggested changes to your proposed order and final action on that order on December This letter outlines the first steps toward a plan that my administration is developing based on extensive ongoing discussions with legislative leaders consumers business utilitie s generators environmentalists labor agricultural interests and other California stakeholders This emerging plan will indicate to you that I am prepared to act with the concurrence of the Legislature in California to fulfill our obligations to assure reliable service at reasonable costs to the consumer The free market applied to electricity can work but only if market conditions allow for real competition and if all parties act responsibly The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has found that the wholesal e market in California is dysfunctional and that the wholesale prices charged by generators in your jurisdiction are unjust and unreasonable For that reason I renew my call for the FERC to undertake the actions that are critical and clearly within your jurisdiction to order retroactiv e refunds to the consumers who have been harmed this year and to establish hard price and bid caps that will protect consumers until the energy marketplace becomes truly competitive I do not believe that your proposed MW clearing price limit will provide any real protection I again ask you to impose real price and bid caps in the MW range on a transitiona l basis over the next months If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale markets the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited in scope I cannot in good conscience however forego any measure that wou ld serve to protect the people of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale markets will not victimize Californians again Since our meeting in San Diego several things have occurred which influenc e my current thinking On November the California Energy Commission CEC published the results of a detailed bottomup study of available electricity supply for It shows that taking into account expected load growth firm and dynamically scheduled imports and new supply already under construction or under contract California should be able to avoid emergencies if supplie s are properly managed and scheduled This presumes of course no gaming or withholding by sellers in wholesale markets and an absence of panic buying But the CEC study also shows that supplies are sufficiently tight that mark et power will exist and will need to be mitigated during periods of high deman d The same opportunity for wholesale price gouging through the exercise of market power and withholding that existed in summer will exist in You must take decisive action to preclude such behavior During the week of November while you and regulatory commissioners from around the country were in San Diego California was subjected to several Stage Alerts reflecting severe shortages of generation even though these are the lowest load months of the year Prices were astronomical More than megawatts of generation were offline at the same time including over megawatts for unscheduled outages I will recommend steps to assure that existing resources in California are availab le to meet Californias local energy needs and that information and the authority necessary to prevent a recurrence of such events are available to state and local officials On November the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and Electricity Oversight Board EOB filed comments with you that summarize th e current status of their ongoing investigations They confirm the conclusion s of the independent market monitors that California has been victimized by t he exercise of market power by merchant generators and marketers during summer and fall The state agencies have been hampered in their investigation s by the refusal of merchant generators to provide information that will both assist in the understanding of last summers prices and in the fashionin g of remedies to assure that we are not victimized again I urge you to compel t he necessary disclosure of information to complete these investigations On November the CPUC issued an Environmental Impact Report EIR on the proposal by PGE to move its hydroelectric facilities out of the regulated utility The EIR concludes that such a project would cause significant unmitigated harm to the environment and recommends retention as the preferr ed alternative This suggests that Californias course of generation divest iture by utilities may be slowed or stopped With these events as background I want to describe the steps I have taken and plan to take to begin to address the energy problems in California Increase Supply and Expand Infrastructure During the years preceding my administration virtually no power plants were built in California Since April six power plants representing MW of new generation have been approved by the CEC Five of these plants are under construction and the sixth will begin construction no later than April Twenty more applicants have completed prefiling and have active applications under review by the commission staff Eleven more applications are in the prefiling stage This represents a significant change in policy and performance and responds to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and environmental protection Much has been made about the difficulty of siting and permitting generation in California With enactment of AB and the creation of the Governor s Clean Energy Green Team this September California has aggressively committ ed itself to continue to accelerate the siting and permitting of generation an d to coordinate local state and federal government agency review and action Federal and state air quality requirements present unique challenges to the construction and operation of new power plants Through the Green Team we are developing new and creative approaches to meet these challenges workin g with local air quality districts the California Air Resources Board and th e United States Environmental Protection Agency These might for example expand upon the case of the proposed Otay Mesa power plant where mobile emissions credits are being used to offset stationary source emissions that will be generated by the new facility If necessary I will seek legislatio n to enable these new approaches I am also calling on the CPUC to aggressively reduce barriers and to otherwise encourage the locating of distributed generation and cogeneratio n where it is viable cost effective and environmentally sound The CPUC has already initiated action that will provide a forum for expediting certificates for transmission facilities including environmental review Finally I believe it is important to assure that all supplies of electrici ty are available when emergency conditions exist to avoid interruptions such as those experienced last summer and as recently as last week Suggestions we are considering for achieving this include new means of coordinating powerplant maintenance and operations activities Forward Contracting by Utilities Many parties including the FERC have recommended expanding the use of forward contracting by the utilities including multiyear bilateral contracts as a way of reducing exposure to volatile spot market prices The contracts as a part of a larger utility energy portfolio represent an important tool to moderate price volatility and ensure reliability I am asking the CPUC to expeditiously develop benchmarks to assure the reasonableness of these contracts without unfairly second guessing these decisions in later years This process should be in place early in to provide adequate opportuni ty for contracts to be negotiated and in place before Summer Coupled with the forward contracting issue is the question of the obligatio n of utilities to buy and sell all of their electricity through the Californi a Power Exchange PX This issue requires careful consideration since these transactions through the PX are currently subject to full disclosure and safeguards are in place to assure delivery These protections for consumers and business must not be lost Among the suggestions that have been made to ensure that utilities have a costeffective portfolio of energy is the proposal that utilities retain their existing generation as was recommended in the CPUCs environmental impact report regarding PGEs hydroelectric facilities There is growing consensus around this matter I would hope that the paramount objective in this series of regulatory decisions will be the protection of the interests of consumers Invigorating the Demand Side Conservation and efficiency are the cornerstones of Californias energy future Under my Executive Order the State of California has achieved more than MW of load reduction earlier this year during Stage alerts and is moving quickly to add another MW of demand reduction for summer The federal government is following suit for federal facilities The state and federal governments should set an example for similar voluntary load reduction initiatives in the private sector I was pleased to work with the California Grocers Association this summer t o develop a voluntary percent demand reduction program during peak hours f or more than groceries statewide This program must be duplicated in oth er areas where feasible and the business community in California has pledged t o work cooperatively toward that end I am calling on the CPUC to expedite its investigation of the states de mand reduction programs for commercial and industrial users including the interruptible programs Those that are successful should be expanded Those that require change should be modified And new opportunities should be developed to reduce and shift loads during peak hours and short supply The se programs must be in place no later than March to provide adequate opportunity for private sector planning and participation I am also calling on the CPUC and CEC to coordinate efforts to demonstrate and implement programs which provide realtime price signals and energyreduction systems to sophisticated commercial electricity users and to recommend a process for voluntary participation by consumers and small businesses In September I signed historic urgency legislation that provides milli on for demand reduction programs that can be implemented by Summer I als o signed legislation that provides approximately million annually for th e next years for energy efficiency research and development and renewable resource support The CPUC and CEC are aggressively pursuing innovative demand reduction programs using these funds Institutional Reform As I testified at the FERC hearing on November I agree that the stakeholder boards of the California Independent System Operator CAISO an d California Power Exchange present inherent conflicts of interest for their members and must be replaced The composition of these boards is specified by state law both as to size and as to qualifications for directors I will propose legislation to replace the stakeholder boards with independe nt boards that are accountable for their actions and that will consider both the need to assure reliability and the most economic method to do so I intend to move quickly on this aspect of the problem Your concurrence in this effort is extremely important It will little serve the consumers utilities merchant generators or other parties to become embroiled in litigation over exactly what powers Congress conferred on the FERC in or what traditional state powers if any Congress meant to circumscribe or override Recognizing that there may be a need for more extensive reconstitution of these entities as some have suggested I do not intend to let the status q uo continue while those debates are carried on California will alter the composition and membership of the boards so that the entities are in positi on to contribute to achieving the paramount objectives of both state and feder al law protection of the consumers interests In Governor Pete Wilson and his CPUC reposed a great deal of trust in the FERC in moving Californias electricity system into an unbundled federalized mode Now is the time for you to justify that trust I want to cooperate with you in transitioning to a marketbased approach to provide this essential service However first and foremost I want you to do your job and to let me do mine Together we can protect the electricity consumer s of California and work to restore their confidence Sincerely GRAY DAVIS

accross the west businessreportspowerlatwesthtm Back to story Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California Utilities Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations swelled and few new energy sources were developed Now also facing blackouts they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and toward themselves By PETER G GOSSELIN Times Staff Writer WINTERSBURG ArizFor more than a century California ran a simple account with the rest of the West It demanded and the West supplied most especially water and power But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decadein no small part because of an outbound trek of Californiansthis simple supplydemand relationship has broken down Fundamentally the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system just as California has its own And it has done so in very much the same wayby adding too many people without enough new power or conservation Indeed statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have been on the verge of trouble even without Californias help and may yet face the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden State The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that its planning reservesthe extra power that utilities build in to handle emergencieshave shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts consider dangerous Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade Despite the long economic boom of the s which smiled especially on the West several such as Arizona have failed to complete a single new power plant We dont know how bad its going to be yet said Utahs Republican governor Mike Leavitt We wont know that until May June July and August when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers In trying to dodge the blackout bullet many Western leaders are seeking to force a great change on the region to renegotiate their states basic deal with California They want to end an old relationshipthat between center and hinterland colonizer and colonizedand establish a new one that could curtail Californias long regional dominance In the strange chemistry of the momentwhen a onceRepublican state government has turned Democratic and a onceDemocratic national government has turned Republican when the battle is to a large extent over privately owned electricity rather than publicly controlled waterthey could actually meet with some success California spent the th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street and the East said Kevin Starr the state librarian and author of a multivolume history of California Now all of a sudden theres a dramatic possibility of it being recolonized at least in part by the rest of the West Captive Plants Feed Power to California Ground zero for these changes lies miles west of Phoenix in the dry scrublands of Wintersburg This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility now the nations single biggest power producer It will soon be home as well to between three and six new gasfired power plants that combined will produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old fraying world of regulated utilities and about the supplydemand relationships that California once maintained with the rest of the West More than onequarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles municipal utility the Department of Water and Power several other California cities and Southern California Edison A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California carrying a transmission line from plant to consumer California has big stakes in a halfdozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New Mexico From Californias point of view the beauty of these projects has been that they provided nearcertain power without the muss of meeting state pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home And at least until the mids California regulators virtually guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits even if plants power wasnt immediately needed The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to meet demand no matter what said Paul L Joskow a veteran utility economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology If you had too much power if it cost you a little too much that was less important than being sure you could meet demand And he added you had regulators watching to make sure you did The gasfired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also representative but of the new deregulated world of power production Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same California transmission line they are being built on an entirely different business premise selling power to the highest bidder In fact the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself but its huge transmission lines In addition to the California line four others fan out from the plant two back to Phoenix one east to New Mexico and one north to Utah and from there to the Northwest All were built to hardwire the nuclear project to its owners But they are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar by sending power wherever prices are highest It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the market to see if they could meet demand said Jack Davis president of Pinnacle West Capital Corp which owns Arizonas major utility and is putting up two of the Wintersburg plants Now he said approvingly its being built by people who look at the market to see if you can make a lot of money Plans Go Awry in Many States Money not the watchful eye of government was what was supposed to assure that electricity deregulation worked The opportunity to make it would cause investors to flock to the electricity business ensuring that plenty of new power plants got built If too many went up it would be investors not ratepayers who suffered If too few then high prices would attract still more investors more plants and ultimately more power But to date almost nothing about deregulation has gone as plannedand not just in California but in the West in general Take Arizona The state has a handsoff attitude toward business including its utilities It has almost none of the environmental restrictions blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs Its population grew by from to according to the Census Bureau And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate according to industry figures Arizona should have been a power producers heaven said A Michael Schaal a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc a prominent Washingtonarea consulting firm But Arizonas power production rose a mere during the s mostly as a result of improving existing plants Until months ago no one had applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late s I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort of year time horizon Arizonas Republican Gov Jane Dee Hull said in a recent interview I think what we all worry about is Are they planning Or Nevada Its utilities apparently did plan and increased electricitymaking capacity between and by a substantial But that wasnt enough to keep up with the states population which increased On Thursday Nevada Gov Kenny Guinn a Republican and former energy company executive indefinitely halted deregulation in his state Or traditionally energyrich Washington state One of its major utilities Seattle City Light recently learned that all of its previously planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed and then some by just three new customers computer server farms being built to handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the hightech capital But its unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional supplies are balanced on a razors edge according to Northwest Power Pool President Jerry Rust We have no cushion Indeed the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a razors edge with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this summer Schaal the Washingtonarea consultant for example said the region will come up short Westerners can expect to hours of rolling blackouts most of them in California he said One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that in contrast to what most people think supplies have not grown short just recently They have been perilously tight for the last several yearsbefore the start of Californias troubles of this summer and fall and before the nearrecord dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water for its hydroelectric dams The implication is that California did not cause other states to run short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger It did that according to key observers with one monumentally inept maneuver When California required its major utilities to buy power in the volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along higher costs to consumers it set off a furious price spiral That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security blanket the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively if local supplies proved inadequate The result has been a string of crises across the West In southern Arizona for example the San Carlos Irrigation Project a tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by dropping longterm contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the spot market has announced that its bills are going up Most of the projects poor customers say they cant pay In Phoenix utility executives who had confidently said the state was rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two yearold steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market In Idaho the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps back to the firm Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than purchasing power on the open marketand the potato farmers are likely to do pretty well themselves Deep Hostility in Rest of the West The subtle difference between Californias triggering recent events and actually causing the regions crisis is largely lost in the current atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval Although leaders of the rest of the West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big neighbor they are less guarded at home The normally mildmannered Leavitt for example was recently quoted as warning a Salt Lake City audience that California if given the chance would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly In an interview he denied having made the remark Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners that their states are in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto plundered provincesterrain that first Easterners and then Californians have regularly raided for minerals water and most recently power But this time some Western leaders think they can change all this A lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with California to their advantage said Stanford historian Richard White The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West In the Northwest Oregon Washington Idaho and Montana are redoubling their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration the huge federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that is one of Californias chief sources of summer electricity The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the region can be exported without the regions consent Oregon Gov John Kitzhaber said in an interview In Arizona state officials have gone from having no proposals for new power plants to being buried by them Regulators recently approved the construction of plants including several around Palo Verde and are considering another eight Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizonas needs first the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for whatever prices they can command an arrangement that could leave California just one among many bidders Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way Gov Hull is close to President Bush who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic California Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah where Leavitt is trying something that could become Californias worst nightmarerecalling power that Utah produces for the state Los Angeles DWP and several other California utilities own threequarters of the huge coalfired Intermountain Power Project in westcentral Utah and have been drawing on it without incident for years But Utah officials recently unearthed a longforgotten provision in their agreement with the plants owners that gives them the right with proper notice to recall power for local use The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another next summer and it may be able to take back still more according to plant general manager Reed Searle Although the amounts are trivialthe Los Angeles utility either owns or has firm contracts for more than megawatts of capacityLeavitt said Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants in the state including a to megawatt facility that Los Angeles is negotiating to build California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has depended on us to do that the Utah governor said Thats fine and were willing to do that But he added there comes a point at which if demand grows too large weve got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves and for our children and grandchildren If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point California could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which it now suffers Times researcher Lynn Marshall in Seattle contributed

Word document and read only the changes that we made to the summary since receiving the final order which was issued this afternoon Alan Comnes The full order is available at electricbulkpowerh tm SUMMARY OF FERCS ORDER ESTABLISHING PROSPECTIVE MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN FOR THE CALIFORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKETS AND ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION OF PUBLIC UTILITY RATES IN WHOLESALE WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS Issued April Effective Date Price mitigation is effective May ISO needs t o have its dayahead proxy price ready on Physical Withholding To prevent physical withholding the plan will require sellers with PGAs to offer all their available power in real time to the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade All California generators ev en those not subject to FERC price regulation will be required to sell into t he ISOs real time market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted This requirement to provide power is for all hours for yr Price Mitigation The plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market During Stage and emergencies in t he ISOs real time market each generator other than hydro with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generators heat curve emission rates gas costs and emission costs plus MWh for OM The gas cost wil l be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California emissions are to be based on Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services The ISO will publish by am the gas and emission figures to be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared These figures for the next day will be based on the prior days Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgerald data A single market clearing price is determined in rea l time for all generators Highest bid sets the clearing price Each gasfired generator must file with FERC and the ISO within days on a confidential basis heat and emission rates for each generating unit The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator including maintenance and operating costs Generators that submit bids at or below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability Although the following qualification is made However all public util ity rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on marketbased rates discussed infra Presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavior In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price the generator must within days of the end of each month file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price FERC explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the all delivery point index it has adopted FERC has days to review act No opportunity costs in real time Marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based o n specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost Underscheduling Penalites FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it is still in place Thus although it may be advantageous to wait to buy power in RT at capped prices doing so may make the scheduling coordinator subject to the currently effective MWh penalty See p of the FERC order New Generation New generation is NOT exempted from the Commissions price mitigation measures Demand Response Beginning June only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids FERC is attempting to make the demand curve more price responsive This requirement is in effect for all hours Outages PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages The ISO is required to make a tariff filing within days of the order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages including periodic reports to the Commission Term Order expires one year from date of issuance RTO Filing California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June or Order lapses with no further effect The RTO filing is to be consistent with the characteristics and functions in Order No ISO Reporting On September ISO must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built Comments are du e in days Quarterly reports thereafter Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds The market based ra te authority of all public utilities is conditioned on no physical withhol d of capacity and no inappropriate bidding behavior Inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate In addition hockey stick bids are expressly prohibited ie bidding at marginal cost and at a much higher level Other prohibited bidding practices identified include pricing a single unit much higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs WestWide Section Investigation Opens a section investigation concerning the JR of wholesale power in the WSCC other than sales to the CAISO market FERC requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitigation However its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real time markets for power less than hours in advance of RT spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below within a control area FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California Comments are due in days on the investigations Althou gh it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the nonCalifornia PN W the FERC sets the refund effective date is days from publication of the Order NOx Limits in California Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law However it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement just include the fines as part of the price bid Also if NOx is limited may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price Surcharge to pay past amount due Comments are due in days on whether FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into a n escrow account to pay past costs and the effect this surcharge would ha ve on the PGE bankruptcy filing Treatment of the CAISOs Market Stabilization Plan MSP The FERC rejec ts the CAISOs MSP saying that FERCs plan for market mitigation is suff icient It expressly rejects CAISOs plan to create a dayahead and hourahead e nergy markets are expressly reject and tells CAISO to stop actions to implement software changes to effectuate such markets Unfortunately it does not expressly reject CAISOs plan to cut exports In general no mention wa s made as to issue of exports of power from California although the statement that CAISO must become a real RTO would support the notion that CAISO must honor firm schedules on its system Recap of Dates Identified in the Order Issue date Heat rate emission filing from generators due days Comments due on WSCCwide price mitigation days ISO Tariff filing due days Comments on ISO Tariff due days thereafter Comments on whether Commission should allow a premium to recover unpaid generator bills

MoodysWont Downgrade Calif Utils To Junk Before Jan Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones Moodys Investors Service doesnt expect to reduce the debt ratings of Californias two largest utilities below investment grade status before state regulators meet on a rate hike on Jan But the ratings agency said in a press release Friday that it might still cut the ratings of PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric and Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison next week to a level short of speculative status and set strict terms for what it would consider a favorable ruling by regulators on Jan Moodys will continue to review for possible downgrade the ratings of Southern California Edison Company and its parent Edison International and the ratings of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and its parent PGE Corporation and may take additional rating action next week prior to the January th meeting Moodys said However it is not anticipated at this point that any rating action taken prior to the January th meeting would result in the ratings of the utilities or their respective parents falling below investment grade Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric have lost a combined billion since May buying wholesale power at prices that far exceed the fixed rates theyre allowed to charge their customers Between onethird and onehalf of that figure is offset by profits from power plants the utilities still own but the net losses are substantial and mounting Both utilities have said they soon will become unable to continue buying power for their customers if the situation persists Ratings agency Standard Poors warned Wednesday that both utilities face imminent default and a downgrading of their debt ratings to junkbond status unless California officials acted immediately to raise rates and restore the utilities to liquidity On Thursday the California Public Utilities Commission agreed rate hikes were needed We believe that retail rates in California must rise the commission said in a written statement It is our intent to maintain the utilities access to capital on reasonable terms But the commission deferred a final ruling on rates until Jan pending hearings on the matter scheduled for next week Standard Poors wasnt immediately available to comment on the decision Moodys said Friday that the PUCs decision was a necessary first step in restoring the utilities to financial viability Comments by the PUC and other officials indicated their desire to maintain the utilities investmentgrade status Moodys said But Moodys set strict terms for what must come out of the PUCs Jan meeting if the utilities are to avoid being downgraded to speculative status Specifically at that meeting the utilities need to obtain the right to immediately raise rates by a sizeable amount and must obtain the unquestioned and unambiguous ability to recover past and future wholesale procurement costs Moodys said The failure by the CPUC to act in a prompt and constructive way around these two issues could result in the utilities ratings being downgraded to below investment grade Such a downgrade would hurt the utilities ability to fund power purchases and daytoday operations Moodys said By Andrew Dowell Dow Jones Newswires Article Next Article Previous Article Return to Headlines POWER POINTS Calif Utils Wont Fail Competition Will By Mark Golden Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow Jones Fans of the movie Erin Brockovich have been tempted to fantasize about executives from Californias two main investorowned utilities PGE Corp PCG and Edison International EIX heading to bankruptcy court Dream on True this week the utilities didnt get either of the two things they need to escape the astronomically expensive spot market for electricity in California a rate increase and longterm contracts with independent generators at prices they can afford under new rates With lending sources virtually dry both utilities have said they are about to run out of the cash needed to continue buying electricity in the spot market But hearings on a rate increase are scheduled to resume next week followed by the California Public Utilities Commission vote on Jan and longterm contract negotiations are to resume Jan Both negotiations are likely to succeed in keeping the companies afloat because almost all parties would lose with the utilities under Chapter protection and because the price to save the utilities isnt that high The rate increase decision was postponed Thursday because California Governor Gray Davis and his CPUC are trying to give the corporations only what they need to survive and not a penny more If Davis succeeds he is insisting on an independent audit of the holding companies and all subsidiaries shareholders can expect to see their dividends cut Sorting out the finances of the billion PGE which is the rd largest US company and billion Edison International must be daunting But here are the basics First the utilities have to get out of the spot market SCE charges residential and small commercial customers cents a kilowatthour of which cents or a megawatthour goes for electricity The rest covers transmission and distribution some other costs and the utilitys profit In the dayahead and spot market where SCE has been buying almost half the power it needs the utility has been paying about MWh Rates obviously wont be tripled so that SCE can continue to buy power in the spot market But the company can purchase fiveyear supply contracts at about MWh currently which it could do with a mere halfcent increase in rates Since the company is already making plenty of money on the coalfired and nuclear generators that it owns a halfcent increase on all the electricity it sells could be applied to all of its outside purchasing which comes to an extra a megawatthour Edison International is in a more dire immediate cash situation because the utility is twothirds of the parent company but Pacific Gas Electric faces a more difficult situation operationally PGE gets only centsKWh or MWh from customers for electricity while wholesale prices in northern California are more expensive than in southern California Finally PGE has to buy about twothirds of the power it needs in the wholesale market compared to SCEs because it sold off more of its power plants as dictated by deregulation legislation more quickly than SCE Still PGE could pick up fiveyear supply contracts at about MWh A twocent increase to its basic rate of cents would give PGE more per megawatthour or MWh to spend on power purchases But a increase may not be necessary The governors staff needs to find out the details on the substantial longterm deals PGE had the foresight to sign back in October Those deals were done at less than MWh and they kick in Jan The governors staff may also look at the unexpectedly high profits from SCEs and PGEs nuclear power plants The utilities have cut costs at the plants so instead of making just return on capital the utilities have been getting a net gain of on nuclear revenues according to Bob Finkelstein of The Utilities Reform Network If the utilities say deregulation decisions such as the rate freeze must be reexamined because they are bankrupting the utilities then TURN says the deregulation decisions that have resulted in unexpected gains for the utilities should be looked at too Nevertheless retail competition in California is dead for another five years The utilities get their modest rate increases with the insistence that they lock up their needed supplies under longterm contracts The contracts will be approved by the CPUC which means the utilities are guaranteed to be paid for the costs even if wholesale power prices fall below MWh in three to four years as expected The only way to ensure that the utilities get paid is to add a new nonbypassable transition cost to customer bills for five years which means that even if a customer chooses an alternate power supplier they will still be sending money back to PGE and Edison to pay for this years debacle The current nonbypassable charges which are scheduled to end in March are what has killed retail competition since Competitors cant offer much in the way of savings so almost nobody bothers to switch Electricity traders and regulators wonder why the utilities keep buying so much power at the last minute through the Independent System Operator which will pay almost anything to keep the lights on Right now the ISO is paying MWh for power that readily could have been bought Thursday for MWh This practice over the past six months has run up Edisons debt to a projected billion at the end of December and PGEs to billion Edison overstates its real losses by PGE by So for about billion dollars the utilities will get a rate increase and four more years of protection

have soared to as high as per million British thermal units on the spot market For the most part SoCal Gas imports its gas from outofstate regions in Texas and New Mexico via pipelines owned by El Paso Natural Gas Co EPG and Enron Corps ENE Transwestern pipeline El Paso and Transwestern are keeping up with demand and report that their pipelines are filled to the near the brim Over the past few weeks Smith said it is pushing out through its system of pipes about Bcf to Bcf of gas daily to its customers The way we see demand breakdown the last couple of weeks is generators using about Bcf a day our core customers million about Bcf and our noncore about Bcf she said The noncore customers which number about in total are industrial manufacturers who consume more than therms of gas annually Smith said In comparison a home averages about therms Smiths eyebrows have been raised by the rapid consumption of natural gas by power plants which use the commodity to run turbines for electrical generation Historically electric power plants have consumed about million to million cubic feet a day of gas in SoCal Gas service territory she said This is why we are seeing pipelines fuller than usual There is continuing demand by the electric generators she said This is basically an increase in demand for gas that has contributed to the national picture of why prices for gas have gone up this year Demand has outpaced production capacity Smith explained A growing economy starved for electricity to run its Internet systems or manufacturing businesses have contributed to the reasons why gas prices have soared this month she said Power plant owners have passed along these higher gas costs to the utilities where they sell their electricity This is partially why PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison Internationals EIX Southern California Edison face financial insolvency today They are having to borrow billions of dollars to pay for this higherpriced electricity as part of the states complex deregulation plan The power plants are owned by outofstate companies like AES Corp AES Calpine Corp CPN and Duke Energy Corp DUK The threat of rolling blackouts has several causes Some power plants run around the clock gobbling up the natural gas at a rapid pace But others have temporarily been shut down because environmental laws prohibit them from emitting certain levels of pollutants annually SoCal Gas has managed to keep its gas costs relatively low by buying gas for its core customers on longterm contracts at fixed prices This helps to insulate the company from price spikes on gas delivered to its system at the California and Arizona and Nevada borders By buying gas this way SoCal Gas was able to set a fixed charge of per MMBTU for its million core customers in the month of December A new price is set to be established next week for January We hope it holds steady in January said Smith We are doing everything we can By Pat Maio Dow Jones Newswires Article

default by one of the states utilities is mitigated by their positions in other power markets Standard Poors said Thursday The ratings agency affirmed its doubleBplus corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings for one of those generators Calpine Corp CPN and indicated that the positions of a number of other generators were similarly stable Standard Poors without commenting on ratings said those generators include Dynegy Inc DYN The Williams Cos WMB Reliant Energy Inc REI Southern Energy Inc SOE and NRG Energy Inc NRG Each company has a diverse asset portfolio that mitigates exposure to any single market such as California SP said Standard Poors has concluded that the developers with merchant exposure to the California market have sufficient financial liquidity to sustain

counterparties in California PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric and Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison have lost a combined billion buying wholesale power at prices far higher than they are allowed to charge their customers Between onethird and onehalf of those losses are offset by the utilities own profits from generating power in the state but they are still substantial and mounting Both utilities have said they face a serious liquidity crisis SP said Thursday that both companies face imminent default unless California officials immediately come up with a way to correct the imbalance between their buying and selling price for power and said it would likely downgrade the utilities debt ratings to junkbond status even if they avoid bankruptcy The

Next Article Previous Article Return to Headlines Chapter Filing May Give Calif Utils Breathing Room Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Thursday By Jason Leopold LOS ANGELES Dow JonesIf two of Californias largest utilities file for Chapter bankruptcy protection a move they said this week was possible it may give the companies some breathing room to allow for a much needed internal reorganization according to one California bankruptcy attorney What Chapter ultimately does is it allows a company to reorganize said Larry Peitzman an attorney with the Southern Californiabased law firm of Peitzman Glassman and Whegg The whole purpose is to come up with a plan to allow the company to service and pay back creditors and shareholders as much as possible While in bankruptcy a judge can order the state to raise the utilities retail electricity rates if that would help the company generate revenue to pay its creditors Peitzman said Peitzman who has worked on many large company bankruptcy cases in California said if PGE Corp unit PCG Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison International unit EIX Southern California Edison file for bankruptcy the companies will be given an injunction by a court that will prevent creditors from seizing the utilities assets collecting money or filing a lawsuit against the companies Another reason to file for bankruptcy protection is the companies wouldnt be forced to pay prebankruptcy debts if they have run up enormous bills Peitzman said Executives at both PGE and SoCal Edison said they may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection because of a combined billion debt in excess wholesale power costs and the inability under state law to pass those costs on to rate payers However between onehalf and onethird of that money has been paid into accounts held by the utilities to collect profits from the generators they still own The utilities were hoping for an immediate rate hike Thursday by the states Public Utilities Commission but commissioners said it would first hold evidentiary hearings and conduct an internal audit of the companies A rate increase is still at least two weeks off the commission said at its meeting Utilities Can Conduct Business While In Bankruptcy Peitzman said that while in bankruptcy the companies could operate as a debtor in possession which means the companies have the authority to conduct business as usual without the consent of bankruptcy court But if the companies were to try and secure a loan the loan would have to be approved by a judge Although most Chapter bankruptcy cases cant survive Peitzman said the states two largest utilities with millions of customers may be an exception Inevitably they are going to continue to owe money because of the constant shortfall they pay in electricity costs and what they charge their customers the attorney said But the bigger the company the more likely the company will survive It will be devastating to lose such large corporations If the companies fail to survive a Chapter filing the utilities assets would be liquidated to pay off their creditors Peitzman said In a Chapter filing PGE and SoCal Edison would put their creditors in different classes and determine how much under the dollar each one would get paid Peitzman said It can be as much as possible or less than cents on the dollar he said In addition any contracts that either companies held before a potential bankruptcy filing would have to be honored regardless if the company can fulfill its financial obligations to its counterpart Peitzman said Thats one of the other benefits he said Its called executory contracts which generally means both parties have material operations that have yet to be performed It may be longterm contracts and the company would be able to enforce the other part to continue doing business The other party cant refuse to do business because of a stay Bankruptcy can last as long as a judge allows it Peitzman said pointing to the Eastern Airlines bankruptcy case in the early s which lasted for years Neither company has indicated whether it will actually file for bankruptcy but SoCal Edison said in a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Tuesday that it may not be able to pay its January power bill if its retail rates are not immediately raised

New York Times Page Page Column c New York Times Company LOS ANGELES Dec The California Public Utilities Commission said today that a rate increase for consumers was likely and that over the next weeks it would inspect the books of the two major utilities to decide how much was reasonable The move is an effort in part to show Wall Street that California is committed to ensuring the health of the states utilities On Wednesday the agency that rates the creditworthiness of both the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison said that if meaningful action was not taken by Friday the two utilities were headed for bankruptcy The agency is expected to comment on the commissions action soon Gov Gray Davis has been meeting this week with utility executives and consumer advocates to come to an agreement on the size of a rate increase Mr Davis a Democrat is also seeking the advice of financial experts including Alan Greenspan chairman of the Federal Reserve Board whom he is expected to meet with next week Some people close to those discussions suggested that percent would be a palatable rate increase but the utilities are asking for more The commission will hold hearings next week and just how much consumers will have to pay should be decided by Jan Four years ago California agreed to deregulate its utilities with the hope that competition would lower rates for households and businesses But this year prices for wholesale electricity and natural gas have skyrocketed forcing utilities to incur costs of more than billion that they cannot pass to consumers because rates are frozen until In recent weeks the utilities have tried to make a case that without rate increases service to consumers is threatened John Bryson chief executive of Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison has taken the unusual step of warning consumers in television and newspaper advertisements in Southern California and in Sacramento that blackouts are inevitable unless order is imposed In response to the announcement by the commission today Southern California Edison said it expected additional cost cutting and measures to preserve cash soon But not all the commissioners believed that todays announcement would be enough to placate financial analysts and investors many of whom buy utility stocks because they are perceived to be less risky than for example Internet stocks Analysts have recently downgraded the stocks of both Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison which are trading near week lows over fears about

the California Public Utilities Commissions CPUC interim decision to initiate proceedings to consider raising retail rates as just one of the steps necessary to salvage credit quality for the states two largest utilities Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas and Electric Company Pac Gas The CPUC is expected to reach a decision on rate increases and recovery mechanisms during the first week of January at which time Fitch will assess the appropriate ratings for these companies The outstanding issue is whether rate increases will sufficiently offset high wholesale power prices being paid by the companies The companies securities ratings are likely to weaken unless full recovery is provided for the large monies paid by the utilities above existing retail rates and price stability is ensured for the regional market The utilities are unable to tap new credit until the rate decision is executed They do have however sufficient cash and existing credit to support them through the decision period of the first week in January If a suitable rate structure is passed by the CPUC at that time the utilities banks would be more likely to consider additional funding Liquidity will remain strained however to the extent that regional power prices remain high While Energy Secretary Richardson has ordered certain power producers to sell into the California market wholesale prices remain high and are above retail rates No additional federal action has been taken The CPUCs decision in early January is not expected to completely resolve the utilities future Given the large costs incurred and numerous constituent groups affected Fitch envisions a longerterm scenario of consecutive rate increases associated with a fundamental overhaul of Californias power market In conjunction

Connole and Tom Doggett Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited WASHINGTON April Reuters A split US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved on Wednesday a plan to stabilize Californias volatile power market and stem market abuses Under the plan set to take effect in late May and last for one year price relief measures will be imposed on Californias wholesale power sales during severe energy shortages The threemember commission split sharply on the plan voting for an order that the majority believe will prevent power costs from soaring out of control in California this summer Wholesale power prices have jumped tenfold in California in the past year the result of growing demand from the states million residents following a decade that saw no major power plants added to its electric system FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert a Republican and Democrat Linda Breathitt supported the order Democrat William Massey dissented despite hours of talks aimed at reaching a consensus California consumers can rest assured that the commission has been attentive to their problems and has worked tirelessly to ensure that they receive necessary relief in a manner that does not compound current problems or undemine longerterm solutions Hebert said DISSENTING VOTE Massey said that by limiting price relief to declared power emergencies FERCs actions would fall short of solving the severe problems plaguing the California market The evidence is pervasive that the problem exists hours a day seven days a week Now is not the time for halfaloaf solutions Massey said Under the plan price mitigation would be triggered whenever the California Independent System Operator ISO declares a power emergency The ISO which manages most of the states power grid uses a threestage alert system with a Stage One called when power reserves drop to within seven percent of actual demand on the grid As demand eats further into the supply cushion Stage Two and Stage Three alerts are declared with Stage Three indicating rolling blackouts may be required to avoid overloading the grid and triggering far more widespread outages California has ordered rolling blackouts four days so far this year with state energy officials predicting more are likely this summer when air conditioning pushes demand to its annual peak FINDING A FAIR PRICE The mitigation and monitoring plans central element will require generators to offer available power in real time using a proxy price established a day ahead of actual delivery FERC said The proxy price reflects the marginal cost of the highestcost generator asked to supply power to the grid This price will vary daily according to demand the price of fuel used by generators such as natural gas and the cost of complying with environmental standards However generators could charge more than the proxy price if they can justify the higher cost when FERC reviews their sales records which they are required to submit at the end of each month If those costs cannot be justified FERC can order the generator to refund the buyer FERC said all generators in California even those not subject to the commissions price regulations are required to sell into the ISOs real time price market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities were exempted from the plan because of their generation limitations which fluctuate according to reservoir levels and the competing needs of others for those same water resources REGIONAL SOLUTION The commission emphasized that the only real solution to the power supply problems affecting the western markets was to forge a regional response Toward this goal FERC said California ISO would need to file a plan to form a regional transmission organization RTO by June or forfeit the socalled crutch of FERCs pricerelief plan Among the many measures contained in the order FERC told California utilities to coordinate any temporary shutdowns of generating plants with the ISO to ensure the state has adequate electric supplies at all times The order also formally opened an investigation by commission staff into possible abusive wholesale practices behind power sales throughout the Western region FERC said the plan would expire in as the California power crisis eases The states rush to build new power plants is expected to put an

By Rebecca Smith The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Hewing more to the ideological position of the Bush administration than to the urgings of Gov Gray Davis and other California politicians a divided Federal Energy Regulatory Commission yesterday ordered limited price controls for the states flawed electricity market The new controls arent likely to restrain runaway wholesale power prices this summer The order was approved in a meeting that began hours late as the three commissioners locked horns over how far the agency should go to restrain wholesale prices that have pushed one of Californias big utilities into bankruptcy and which now threatens the states fiscal health The commission built on a staff recommendation issued in March that suggested it act only at those times when electricity supplies are in shortest supply In its order the commission decided to intervene whenever state electricity reserves drop below authorized levels socalled Stage I II and III emergencies The pricemitigation plan appears to ignore evidence filed by the gridoperating California Independent System Operator that generators can substantially raise market prices even when supplies arent technically short The ISO had recommended imposing price caps when individual generating plants tried to charge far more than fair production costs Commissioner William Massey dissented in part from the order in a sharply worded attack on the commission which he said hadnt done its duty to protect energy users by restraining generators that overcharge As a consequence he said the economic carnage is spreading throughout the West Mr Massey an Arkansas Democrat criticized the commission for acting only when electricity reserves fall below since this agency is obligated to ensure just and reasonable prices in all hours Under the order generators will be required to submit cost data to justify high prices during periods of electricity scarcity They will be allowed to collect the price they bid so long as it doesnt exceed the price charged by the oldest leastefficient plant operating at the time Such proxy price methodology enabled plant owners to collect as much as per megawatt hour in February or roughly times the prevailing price a year earlier Support for the order came from commission Chairman Curt Hebert a Mississippi Republican who said he didnt intend the commission to fall into a trap of limiting market forces to the extent that we hinder efforts to build new power plants and transmission lines that are badly needed to correct Californias supplyanddemand imbalance Linda Breathitt a Kentucky Democrat was the swing vote who eventually sided with Mr Hebert FERC staffers said she expressed doubts about whether the commission was doing as much as it should In the meeting she acknowledged the complexity and difficulty of the task but said she remained steadfast in my belief that market solutions are preferable to regulatory controls The commission attached an unexpected condition to its order saying the pricecap scheme will be revoked June unless the California grid operator has filed a plan to become part of a regionwide gridoperating organization Californias ISO had such a plan ready to file but it got yanked when a new board named by the states governor took control recently In recent months Mr Davis has urged increased isolationism even suggesting the state no longer export powerIt isnt clear whether FERC intends to permit California to continue to operate as a standalone gridrunning organization More likely it will be expected to show it intends to become part of a multistate organization to operate transmission lines in a nondiscriminatory manner The commission gave tentative approval yesterday to formation of a regional grid operator that would encompass eight other Western states and would include the transmission system of the federal Bonneville Power Administration the biggest

Word document and read only the changes that we made to the summary since receiving the final order which was issued this afternoon Alan Comnes The full order is available at electricbulkpowerh tm SUMMARY OF FERCS ORDER ESTABLISHING PROSPECTIVE MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN FOR THE CALIFORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKETS AND ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION OF PUBLIC UTILITY RATES IN WHOLESALE WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS Issued April Effective Date Price mitigation is effective May ISO needs t o have its dayahead proxy price ready on Physical Withholding To prevent physical withholding the plan will require sellers with PGAs to offer all their available power in real time to the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade All California generators ev en those not subject to FERC price regulation will be required to sell into t he ISOs real time market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted This requirement to provide power is for all hours for yr Price Mitigation The plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market During Stage and emergencies in t he ISOs real time market each generator other than hydro with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generators heat curve emission rates gas costs and emission costs plus MWh for OM The gas cost wil l be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California emissions are to be based on Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services The ISO will publish by am the gas and emission figures to be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared These figures for the next day will be based on the prior days Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgerald data A single market clearing price is determined in rea l time for all generators Highest bid sets the clearing price Each gasfired generator must file with FERC and the ISO within days on a confidential basis heat and emission rates for each generating unit The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator including maintenance and operating costs Generators that submit bids at or below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability Although the following qualification is made However all public util ity rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on marketbased rates discussed infra Presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavior In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price the generator must within days of the end of each month file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price FERC explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the all delivery point index it has adopted FERC has days to review act No opportunity costs in real time Marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based o n specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost Underscheduling Penalites FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it is still in place Thus although it may be advantageous to wait to buy power in RT at capped prices doing so may make the scheduling coordinator subject to the currently effective MWh penalty See p of the FERC order New Generation New generation is NOT exempted from the Commissions price mitigation measures Demand Response Beginning June only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids FERC is attempting to make the demand curve more price responsive This requirement is in effect for all hours Outages PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages The ISO is required to make a tariff filing within days of the order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages including periodic reports to the Commission Term Order expires one year from date of issuance RTO Filing California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June or Order lapses with no further effect The RTO filing is to be consistent with the characteristics and functions in Order No ISO Reporting On September ISO must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built Comments are du e in days Quarterly reports thereafter Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds The market based ra te authority of all public utilities is conditioned on no physical withhol d of capacity and no inappropriate bidding behavior Inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate In addition hockey stick bids are expressly prohibited ie bidding at marginal cost and at a much higher level Other prohibited bidding practices identified include pricing a single unit much higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs WestWide Section Investigation Opens a section investigation concerning the JR of wholesale power in the WSCC other than sales to the CAISO market FERC requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitigation However its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real time markets for power less than hours in advance of RT spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below within a control area FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California Comments are due in days on the investigations Althou gh it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the nonCalifornia PN W the FERC sets the refund effective date is days from publication of the Order NOx Limits in California Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law However it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement just include the fines as part of the price bid Also if NOx is limited may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price Surcharge to pay past amount due Comments are due in days on whether FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into a n escrow account to pay past costs and the effect this surcharge would ha ve on the PGE bankruptcy filing Treatment of the CAISOs Market Stabilization Plan MSP The FERC rejec ts the CAISOs MSP saying that FERCs plan for market mitigation is suff icient It expressly rejects CAISOs plan to create a dayahead and hourahead e nergy markets are expressly reject and tells CAISO to stop actions to implement software changes to effectuate such markets Unfortunately it does not expressly reject CAISOs plan to cut exports In general no mention wa s made as to issue of exports of power from California although the statement that CAISO must become a real RTO would support the notion that CAISO must honor firm schedules on its system Recap of Dates Identified in the Order Issue date Heat rate emission filing from generators due days Comments due on WSCCwide price mitigation days ISO Tariff filing due days Comments on ISO Tariff due days thereafter Comments on whether Commission should allow a premium to recover unpaid generator bills

<21592629.1075850458620.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,alan.comnes@enron.com,2000-12-01 04:17:00,Re Governors Response to FERC Cc that Jeff D will give us his reactions but in the mean time here s the proposal December Honorable James Hoecker Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC Dear Chairman Hoecker I told you on November in San Diego that by December I would respond to your plan with my suggestions to protect the interests of the people and businesses of California by providing reliable electricity supplies at the lowest reasonable cost Obviously a complete plan by the State of Californ ia must await your review of my suggested changes to your proposed order and final action on that order on December This letter outlines the first steps toward a plan that my administration is developing based on extensive ongoing discussions with legislative leaders consumers business utilitie s generators environmentalists labor agricultural interests and other California stakeholders This emerging plan will indicate to you that I am prepared to act with the concurrence of the Legislature in California to fulfill our obligations to assure reliable service at reasonable costs to the consumer The free market applied to electricity can work but only if market conditions allow for real competition and if all parties act responsibly The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has found that the wholesal e market in California is dysfunctional and that the wholesale prices charged by generators in your jurisdiction are unjust and unreasonable For that reason I renew my call for the FERC to undertake the actions that are critical and clearly within your jurisdiction to order retroactiv e refunds to the consumers who have been harmed this year and to establish hard price and bid caps that will protect consumers until the energy marketplace becomes truly competitive I do not believe that your proposed MW clearing price limit will provide any real protection I again ask you to impose real price and bid caps in the MW range on a transitiona l basis over the next months If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale markets the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited in scope I cannot in good conscience however forego any measure that wou ld serve to protect the people of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale markets will not victimize Californians again Since our meeting in San Diego several things have occurred which influenc e my current thinking On November the California Energy Commission CEC published the results of a detailed bottomup study of available electricity supply for It shows that taking into account expected load growth firm and dynamically scheduled imports and new supply already under construction or under contract California should be able to avoid emergencies if supplie s are properly managed and scheduled This presumes of course no gaming or withholding by sellers in wholesale markets and an absence of panic buying But the CEC study also shows that supplies are sufficiently tight that mark et power will exist and will need to be mitigated during periods of high deman d The same opportunity for wholesale price gouging through the exercise of market power and withholding that existed in summer will exist in You must take decisive action to preclude such behavior During the week of November while you and regulatory commissioners from around the country were in San Diego California was subjected to several Stage Alerts reflecting severe shortages of generation even though these are the lowest load months of the year Prices were astronomical More than megawatts of generation were offline at the same time including over megawatts for unscheduled outages I will recommend steps to assure that existing resources in California are availab le to meet Californias local energy needs and that information and the authority necessary to prevent a recurrence of such events are available to state and local officials On November the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and Electricity Oversight Board EOB filed comments with you that summarize th e current status of their ongoing investigations They confirm the conclusion s of the independent market monitors that California has been victimized by t he exercise of market power by merchant generators and marketers during summer and fall The state agencies have been hampered in their investigation s by the refusal of merchant generators to provide information that will both assist in the understanding of last summers prices and in the fashionin g of remedies to assure that we are not victimized again I urge you to compel t he necessary disclosure of information to complete these investigations On November the CPUC issued an Environmental Impact Report EIR on the proposal by PGE to move its hydroelectric facilities out of the regulated utility The EIR concludes that such a project would cause significant unmitigated harm to the environment and recommends retention as the preferr ed alternative This suggests that Californias course of generation divest iture by utilities may be slowed or stopped With these events as background I want to describe the steps I have taken and plan to take to begin to address the energy problems in California Increase Supply and Expand Infrastructure During the years preceding my administration virtually no power plants were built in California Since April six power plants representing MW of new generation have been approved by the CEC Five of these plants are under construction and the sixth will begin construction no later than April Twenty more applicants have completed prefiling and have active applications under review by the commission staff Eleven more applications are in the prefiling stage This represents a significant change in policy and performance and responds to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and environmental protection Much has been made about the difficulty of siting and permitting generation in California With enactment of AB and the creation of the Governor s Clean Energy Green Team this September California has aggressively committ ed itself to continue to accelerate the siting and permitting of generation an d to coordinate local state and federal government agency review and action Federal and state air quality requirements present unique challenges to the construction and operation of new power plants Through the Green Team we are developing new and creative approaches to meet these challenges workin g with local air quality districts the California Air Resources Board and th e United States Environmental Protection Agency These might for example expand upon the case of the proposed Otay Mesa power plant where mobile emissions credits are being used to offset stationary source emissions that will be generated by the new facility If necessary I will seek legislatio n to enable these new approaches I am also calling on the CPUC to aggressively reduce barriers and to otherwise encourage the locating of distributed generation and cogeneratio n where it is viable cost effective and environmentally sound The CPUC has already initiated action that will provide a forum for expediting certificates for transmission facilities including environmental review Finally I believe it is important to assure that all supplies of electrici ty are available when emergency conditions exist to avoid interruptions such as those experienced last summer and as recently as last week Suggestions we are considering for achieving this include new means of coordinating powerplant maintenance and operations activities Forward Contracting by Utilities Many parties including the FERC have recommended expanding the use of forward contracting by the utilities including multiyear bilateral contracts as a way of reducing exposure to volatile spot market prices The contracts as a part of a larger utility energy portfolio represent an important tool to moderate price volatility and ensure reliability I am asking the CPUC to expeditiously develop benchmarks to assure the reasonableness of these contracts without unfairly second guessing these decisions in later years This process should be in place early in to provide adequate opportuni ty for contracts to be negotiated and in place before Summer Coupled with the forward contracting issue is the question of the obligatio n of utilities to buy and sell all of their electricity through the Californi a Power Exchange PX This issue requires careful consideration since these transactions through the PX are currently subject to full disclosure and safeguards are in place to assure delivery These protections for consumers and business must not be lost Among the suggestions that have been made to ensure that utilities have a costeffective portfolio of energy is the proposal that utilities retain their existing generation as was recommended in the CPUCs environmental impact report regarding PGEs hydroelectric facilities There is growing consensus around this matter I would hope that the paramount objective in this series of regulatory decisions will be the protection of the interests of consumers Invigorating the Demand Side Conservation and efficiency are the cornerstones of Californias energy future Under my Executive Order the State of California has achieved more than MW of load reduction earlier this year during Stage alerts and is moving quickly to add another MW of demand reduction for summer The federal government is following suit for federal facilities The state and federal governments should set an example for similar voluntary load reduction initiatives in the private sector I was pleased to work with the California Grocers Association this summer t o develop a voluntary percent demand reduction program during peak hours f or more than groceries statewide This program must be duplicated in oth er areas where feasible and the business community in California has pledged t o work cooperatively toward that end I am calling on the CPUC to expedite its investigation of the states de mand reduction programs for commercial and industrial users including the interruptible programs Those that are successful should be expanded Those that require change should be modified And new opportunities should be developed to reduce and shift loads during peak hours and short supply The se programs must be in place no later than March to provide adequate opportunity for private sector planning and participation I am also calling on the CPUC and CEC to coordinate efforts to demonstrate and implement programs which provide realtime price signals and energyreduction systems to sophisticated commercial electricity users and to recommend a process for voluntary participation by consumers and small businesses In September I signed historic urgency legislation that provides milli on for demand reduction programs that can be implemented by Summer I als o signed legislation that provides approximately million annually for th e next years for energy efficiency research and development and renewable resource support The CPUC and CEC are aggressively pursuing innovative demand reduction programs using these funds Institutional Reform As I testified at the FERC hearing on November I agree that the stakeholder boards of the California Independent System Operator CAISO an d California Power Exchange present inherent conflicts of interest for their members and must be replaced The composition of these boards is specified by state law both as to size and as to qualifications for directors I will propose legislation to replace the stakeholder boards with independe nt boards that are accountable for their actions and that will consider both the need to assure reliability and the most economic method to do so I intend to move quickly on this aspect of the problem Your concurrence in this effort is extremely important It will little serve the consumers utilities merchant generators or other parties to become embroiled in litigation over exactly what powers Congress conferred on the FERC in or what traditional state powers if any Congress meant to circumscribe or override Recognizing that there may be a need for more extensive reconstitution of these entities as some have suggested I do not intend to let the status q uo continue while those debates are carried on California will alter the composition and membership of the boards so that the entities are in positi on to contribute to achieving the paramount objectives of both state and feder al law protection of the consumers interests In Governor Pete Wilson and his CPUC reposed a great deal of trust in the FERC in moving Californias electricity system into an unbundled federalized mode Now is the time for you to justify that trust I want to cooperate with you in transitioning to a marketbased approach to provide this essential service However first and foremost I want you to do your job and to let me do mine Together we can protect the electricity consumer s of California and work to restore their confidence Sincerely GRAY DAVIS

accross the west businessreportspowerlatwesthtm Back to story Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California Utilities Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations swelled and few new energy sources were developed Now also facing blackouts they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and toward themselves By PETER G GOSSELIN Times Staff Writer WINTERSBURG ArizFor more than a century California ran a simple account with the rest of the West It demanded and the West supplied most especially water and power But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decadein no small part because of an outbound trek of Californiansthis simple supplydemand relationship has broken down Fundamentally the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system just as California has its own And it has done so in very much the same wayby adding too many people without enough new power or conservation Indeed statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have been on the verge of trouble even without Californias help and may yet face the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden State The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that its planning reservesthe extra power that utilities build in to handle emergencieshave shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts consider dangerous Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade Despite the long economic boom of the s which smiled especially on the West several such as Arizona have failed to complete a single new power plant We dont know how bad its going to be yet said Utahs Republican governor Mike Leavitt We wont know that until May June July and August when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers In trying to dodge the blackout bullet many Western leaders are seeking to force a great change on the region to renegotiate their states basic deal with California They want to end an old relationshipthat between center and hinterland colonizer and colonizedand establish a new one that could curtail Californias long regional dominance In the strange chemistry of the momentwhen a onceRepublican state government has turned Democratic and a onceDemocratic national government has turned Republican when the battle is to a large extent over privately owned electricity rather than publicly controlled waterthey could actually meet with some success California spent the th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street and the East said Kevin Starr the state librarian and author of a multivolume history of California Now all of a sudden theres a dramatic possibility of it being recolonized at least in part by the rest of the West Captive Plants Feed Power to California Ground zero for these changes lies miles west of Phoenix in the dry scrublands of Wintersburg This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility now the nations single biggest power producer It will soon be home as well to between three and six new gasfired power plants that combined will produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old fraying world of regulated utilities and about the supplydemand relationships that California once maintained with the rest of the West More than onequarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles municipal utility the Department of Water and Power several other California cities and Southern California Edison A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California carrying a transmission line from plant to consumer California has big stakes in a halfdozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New Mexico From Californias point of view the beauty of these projects has been that they provided nearcertain power without the muss of meeting state pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home And at least until the mids California regulators virtually guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits even if plants power wasnt immediately needed The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to meet demand no matter what said Paul L Joskow a veteran utility economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology If you had too much power if it cost you a little too much that was less important than being sure you could meet demand And he added you had regulators watching to make sure you did The gasfired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also representative but of the new deregulated world of power production Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same California transmission line they are being built on an entirely different business premise selling power to the highest bidder In fact the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself but its huge transmission lines In addition to the California line four others fan out from the plant two back to Phoenix one east to New Mexico and one north to Utah and from there to the Northwest All were built to hardwire the nuclear project to its owners But they are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar by sending power wherever prices are highest It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the market to see if they could meet demand said Jack Davis president of Pinnacle West Capital Corp which owns Arizonas major utility and is putting up two of the Wintersburg plants Now he said approvingly its being built by people who look at the market to see if you can make a lot of money Plans Go Awry in Many States Money not the watchful eye of government was what was supposed to assure that electricity deregulation worked The opportunity to make it would cause investors to flock to the electricity business ensuring that plenty of new power plants got built If too many went up it would be investors not ratepayers who suffered If too few then high prices would attract still more investors more plants and ultimately more power But to date almost nothing about deregulation has gone as plannedand not just in California but in the West in general Take Arizona The state has a handsoff attitude toward business including its utilities It has almost none of the environmental restrictions blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs Its population grew by from to according to the Census Bureau And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate according to industry figures Arizona should have been a power producers heaven said A Michael Schaal a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc a prominent Washingtonarea consulting firm But Arizonas power production rose a mere during the s mostly as a result of improving existing plants Until months ago no one had applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late s I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort of year time horizon Arizonas Republican Gov Jane Dee Hull said in a recent interview I think what we all worry about is Are they planning Or Nevada Its utilities apparently did plan and increased electricitymaking capacity between and by a substantial But that wasnt enough to keep up with the states population which increased On Thursday Nevada Gov Kenny Guinn a Republican and former energy company executive indefinitely halted deregulation in his state Or traditionally energyrich Washington state One of its major utilities Seattle City Light recently learned that all of its previously planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed and then some by just three new customers computer server farms being built to handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the hightech capital But its unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional supplies are balanced on a razors edge according to Northwest Power Pool President Jerry Rust We have no cushion Indeed the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a razors edge with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this summer Schaal the Washingtonarea consultant for example said the region will come up short Westerners can expect to hours of rolling blackouts most of them in California he said One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that in contrast to what most people think supplies have not grown short just recently They have been perilously tight for the last several yearsbefore the start of Californias troubles of this summer and fall and before the nearrecord dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water for its hydroelectric dams The implication is that California did not cause other states to run short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger It did that according to key observers with one monumentally inept maneuver When California required its major utilities to buy power in the volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along higher costs to consumers it set off a furious price spiral That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security blanket the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively if local supplies proved inadequate The result has been a string of crises across the West In southern Arizona for example the San Carlos Irrigation Project a tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by dropping longterm contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the spot market has announced that its bills are going up Most of the projects poor customers say they cant pay In Phoenix utility executives who had confidently said the state was rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two yearold steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market In Idaho the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps back to the firm Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than purchasing power on the open marketand the potato farmers are likely to do pretty well themselves Deep Hostility in Rest of the West The subtle difference between Californias triggering recent events and actually causing the regions crisis is largely lost in the current atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval Although leaders of the rest of the West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big neighbor they are less guarded at home The normally mildmannered Leavitt for example was recently quoted as warning a Salt Lake City audience that California if given the chance would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly In an interview he denied having made the remark Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners that their states are in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto plundered provincesterrain that first Easterners and then Californians have regularly raided for minerals water and most recently power But this time some Western leaders think they can change all this A lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with California to their advantage said Stanford historian Richard White The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West In the Northwest Oregon Washington Idaho and Montana are redoubling their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration the huge federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that is one of Californias chief sources of summer electricity The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the region can be exported without the regions consent Oregon Gov John Kitzhaber said in an interview In Arizona state officials have gone from having no proposals for new power plants to being buried by them Regulators recently approved the construction of plants including several around Palo Verde and are considering another eight Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizonas needs first the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for whatever prices they can command an arrangement that could leave California just one among many bidders Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way Gov Hull is close to President Bush who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic California Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah where Leavitt is trying something that could become Californias worst nightmarerecalling power that Utah produces for the state Los Angeles DWP and several other California utilities own threequarters of the huge coalfired Intermountain Power Project in westcentral Utah and have been drawing on it without incident for years But Utah officials recently unearthed a longforgotten provision in their agreement with the plants owners that gives them the right with proper notice to recall power for local use The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another next summer and it may be able to take back still more according to plant general manager Reed Searle Although the amounts are trivialthe Los Angeles utility either owns or has firm contracts for more than megawatts of capacityLeavitt said Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants in the state including a to megawatt facility that Los Angeles is negotiating to build California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has depended on us to do that the Utah governor said Thats fine and were willing to do that But he added there comes a point at which if demand grows too large weve got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves and for our children and grandchildren If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point California could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which it now suffers Times researcher Lynn Marshall in Seattle contributed

Connole and Tom Doggett Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited WASHINGTON April Reuters A split US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved on Wednesday a plan to stabilize Californias volatile power market and stem market abuses Under the plan set to take effect in late May and last for one year price relief measures will be imposed on Californias wholesale power sales during severe energy shortages The threemember commission split sharply on the plan voting for an order that the majority believe will prevent power costs from soaring out of control in California this summer Wholesale power prices have jumped tenfold in California in the past year the result of growing demand from the states million residents following a decade that saw no major power plants added to its electric system FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert a Republican and Democrat Linda Breathitt supported the order Democrat William Massey dissented despite hours of talks aimed at reaching a consensus California consumers can rest assured that the commission has been attentive to their problems and has worked tirelessly to ensure that they receive necessary relief in a manner that does not compound current problems or undemine longerterm solutions Hebert said DISSENTING VOTE Massey said that by limiting price relief to declared power emergencies FERCs actions would fall short of solving the severe problems plaguing the California market The evidence is pervasive that the problem exists hours a day seven days a week Now is not the time for halfaloaf solutions Massey said Under the plan price mitigation would be triggered whenever the California Independent System Operator ISO declares a power emergency The ISO which manages most of the states power grid uses a threestage alert system with a Stage One called when power reserves drop to within seven percent of actual demand on the grid As demand eats further into the supply cushion Stage Two and Stage Three alerts are declared with Stage Three indicating rolling blackouts may be required to avoid overloading the grid and triggering far more widespread outages California has ordered rolling blackouts four days so far this year with state energy officials predicting more are likely this summer when air conditioning pushes demand to its annual peak FINDING A FAIR PRICE The mitigation and monitoring plans central element will require generators to offer available power in real time using a proxy price established a day ahead of actual delivery FERC said The proxy price reflects the marginal cost of the highestcost generator asked to supply power to the grid This price will vary daily according to demand the price of fuel used by generators such as natural gas and the cost of complying with environmental standards However generators could charge more than the proxy price if they can justify the higher cost when FERC reviews their sales records which they are required to submit at the end of each month If those costs cannot be justified FERC can order the generator to refund the buyer FERC said all generators in California even those not subject to the commissions price regulations are required to sell into the ISOs real time price market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities were exempted from the plan because of their generation limitations which fluctuate according to reservoir levels and the competing needs of others for those same water resources REGIONAL SOLUTION The commission emphasized that the only real solution to the power supply problems affecting the western markets was to forge a regional response Toward this goal FERC said California ISO would need to file a plan to form a regional transmission organization RTO by June or forfeit the socalled crutch of FERCs pricerelief plan Among the many measures contained in the order FERC told California utilities to coordinate any temporary shutdowns of generating plants with the ISO to ensure the state has adequate electric supplies at all times The order also formally opened an investigation by commission staff into possible abusive wholesale practices behind power sales throughout the Western region FERC said the plan would expire in as the California power crisis eases The states rush to build new power plants is expected to put an

By Rebecca Smith The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Hewing more to the ideological position of the Bush administration than to the urgings of Gov Gray Davis and other California politicians a divided Federal Energy Regulatory Commission yesterday ordered limited price controls for the states flawed electricity market The new controls arent likely to restrain runaway wholesale power prices this summer The order was approved in a meeting that began hours late as the three commissioners locked horns over how far the agency should go to restrain wholesale prices that have pushed one of Californias big utilities into bankruptcy and which now threatens the states fiscal health The commission built on a staff recommendation issued in March that suggested it act only at those times when electricity supplies are in shortest supply In its order the commission decided to intervene whenever state electricity reserves drop below authorized levels socalled Stage I II and III emergencies The pricemitigation plan appears to ignore evidence filed by the gridoperating California Independent System Operator that generators can substantially raise market prices even when supplies arent technically short The ISO had recommended imposing price caps when individual generating plants tried to charge far more than fair production costs Commissioner William Massey dissented in part from the order in a sharply worded attack on the commission which he said hadnt done its duty to protect energy users by restraining generators that overcharge As a consequence he said the economic carnage is spreading throughout the West Mr Massey an Arkansas Democrat criticized the commission for acting only when electricity reserves fall below since this agency is obligated to ensure just and reasonable prices in all hours Under the order generators will be required to submit cost data to justify high prices during periods of electricity scarcity They will be allowed to collect the price they bid so long as it doesnt exceed the price charged by the oldest leastefficient plant operating at the time Such proxy price methodology enabled plant owners to collect as much as per megawatt hour in February or roughly times the prevailing price a year earlier Support for the order came from commission Chairman Curt Hebert a Mississippi Republican who said he didnt intend the commission to fall into a trap of limiting market forces to the extent that we hinder efforts to build new power plants and transmission lines that are badly needed to correct Californias supplyanddemand imbalance Linda Breathitt a Kentucky Democrat was the swing vote who eventually sided with Mr Hebert FERC staffers said she expressed doubts about whether the commission was doing as much as it should In the meeting she acknowledged the complexity and difficulty of the task but said she remained steadfast in my belief that market solutions are preferable to regulatory controls The commission attached an unexpected condition to its order saying the pricecap scheme will be revoked June unless the California grid operator has filed a plan to become part of a regionwide gridoperating organization Californias ISO had such a plan ready to file but it got yanked when a new board named by the states governor took control recently In recent months Mr Davis has urged increased isolationism even suggesting the state no longer export powerIt isnt clear whether FERC intends to permit California to continue to operate as a standalone gridrunning organization More likely it will be expected to show it intends to become part of a multistate organization to operate transmission lines in a nondiscriminatory manner The commission gave tentative approval yesterday to formation of a regional grid operator that would encompass eight other Western states and would include the transmission system of the federal Bonneville Power Administration the biggest

consider a favorable ruling by regulators on Jan Moodys will continue to review for possible downgrade the ratings of Southern California Edison Company and its parent Edison International and the

this point that any rating action taken prior to the January th meeting would result in the ratings of the utilities or their respective parents falling below investment grade Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric have lost a combined billion since May buying wholesale power at prices that far exceed the fixed rates theyre allowed to charge their customers Between onethird and onehalf of that figure is offset by profits from power plants the utilities still own but the net losses are substantial and mounting Both utilities have said they soon will become unable to continue buying power for their customers if the situation persists Ratings agency Standard Poors warned Wednesday that both utilities face imminent default and a downgrading of their debt ratings to junkbond

believe that retail rates in California must rise the commission said in a written statement It is our intent to maintain the utilities access to capital on reasonable terms But the commission deferred a final ruling on rates until Jan pending hearings on the matter scheduled for next week Standard Poors wasnt immediately available to comment on the decision Moodys said Friday that the PUCs decision was a necessary first step in restoring the utilities to financial viability Comments by the PUC and other officials indicated their desire to maintain the utilities investmentgrade status Moodys said But Moodys set strict terms for what must come out of the PUCs Jan meeting if the utilities are to avoid being downgraded to speculative status Specifically at that meeting the utilities need to obtain the right to immediately raise rates by a sizeable amount and must obtain the unquestioned and unambiguous ability to recover past and future wholesale procurement costs Moodys said The

Wont Fail Competition Will By Mark Golden Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow Jones Fans of the movie Erin Brockovich have been tempted to fantasize about executives from Californias two main investorowned utilities PGE Corp PCG and Edison International EIX heading to bankruptcy court Dream on True this week the utilities didnt get either of the two things they need to escape the astronomically expensive spot market for electricity in California a rate increase and longterm contracts with independent generators at prices they can afford under new rates With lending sources virtually dry both utilities have said they are about to run out of the cash needed to continue buying electricity in the spot market But hearings on a rate increase are scheduled to resume next week followed by the California Public Utilities Commission vote on Jan and longterm contract negotiations are to resume Jan Both negotiations are likely to succeed in keeping the companies afloat because almost all parties would lose with the utilities under Chapter protection and because the price to save the utilities isnt that high The rate increase decision was postponed Thursday because California Governor Gray Davis and his CPUC are trying to give the corporations only what they need to survive and not a penny more If Davis succeeds he is insisting on an independent audit of the holding companies and all subsidiaries shareholders can expect to see their dividends cut Sorting out the finances of the billion PGE which is the rd largest US company and billion Edison International must be daunting But here are the basics First the utilities have to get out of the spot market SCE charges residential and small commercial customers cents a kilowatthour of which cents or a megawatthour goes for electricity The rest covers transmission and distribution some other costs and the utilitys profit In the dayahead and spot market where SCE has been buying almost half the power it needs the utility has been paying about MWh Rates obviously wont be tripled so that SCE can continue to buy power in the spot market But the company can purchase fiveyear supply contracts at about MWh currently which it could do with a mere halfcent increase in rates Since the company is already making plenty of money on the coalfired and nuclear generators that it owns a halfcent increase on all the electricity it sells could be applied to all of its outside purchasing which comes to an extra a megawatthour Edison International is in a more dire immediate cash situation because the utility is twothirds of the parent company but Pacific Gas Electric faces a more difficult situation operationally PGE gets only centsKWh or MWh from customers for electricity while wholesale prices in northern California are more expensive than in southern California Finally PGE has to buy about twothirds of the power it needs in the wholesale market compared to SCEs because it sold off more of its power plants as dictated by deregulation legislation more quickly than SCE Still PGE could pick up fiveyear supply contracts at about MWh A twocent increase to its basic rate of cents would give PGE more per megawatthour or MWh to spend on power purchases But a increase may not be necessary The governors staff needs to find out the details on the substantial longterm deals PGE had the foresight to sign back in October Those deals were done at less than MWh and they kick in Jan The governors staff may also look at the unexpectedly high profits from SCEs and PGEs nuclear power plants The utilities have cut costs at the plants so instead of making just return on capital the utilities have been getting a net gain of on nuclear revenues according to Bob Finkelstein of The Utilities Reform Network If the utilities say deregulation decisions such as the rate freeze must be reexamined because they are bankrupting the utilities then TURN says the deregulation decisions that have resulted in unexpected gains for the utilities should be looked at too Nevertheless retail competition in California is dead for another five years The utilities get their modest rate increases with the insistence that they lock up their needed supplies under longterm contracts The contracts will be approved by the CPUC which means the utilities are guaranteed to be paid for the costs even if wholesale power prices fall below MWh in three to four years as expected The only way to ensure that the utilities get paid is to add a new nonbypassable transition cost to customer bills for five years which means that even if a customer chooses an alternate power supplier they will still be sending money back to PGE and Edison to pay for this years debacle The current nonbypassable charges which are scheduled to end in March are what has killed retail competition since Competitors cant offer much in the way of savings so almost nobody bothers to switch Electricity traders and regulators wonder why the utilities keep buying so much power at the last minute through the Independent System Operator which will pay almost anything to keep the lights on Right now the ISO is paying MWh for power that readily could have been bought Thursday for MWh This practice over the past six months has run up Edisons debt to a projected billion at the end of December and PGEs to billion Edison overstates its real losses by PGE by So for about billion dollars the utilities will get a rate increase and four more years of protection

on Nov with billion cubic feet of gas in storage about Bcf less than its previous heating seasons Smith said The lower reserve levels are due to power plants in California siphoning out the gas at unprecedented levels she said The plants burn strictly gas and are trying to meet the intense electrical demand this winter after the states certain source of power from hydro generators in the Pacific Northwest had evaporated Lack of rain in the region this year is to blame for the hydro cutbacks Smith said As well a cold snap in November coupled with SoCal Gass decision to buy less gas this past summer for reserves didnt help matters Smith isnt worried about the lower levels of gas in the companys storage areas which can hold up to Bcf The cold weather in November forced SoCal Gas to pull out of storage about Bcf in November leaving a total of Bcf Smith said The stored gas is purchased as a hedge to protect the company from fluctuations in natural gas prices which this month have soared to as high as per million British thermal units on the spot market For the most part SoCal Gas imports its gas from outofstate regions in Texas and New Mexico via pipelines owned by El Paso Natural Gas Co EPG and Enron Corps ENE Transwestern pipeline El Paso and Transwestern are keeping up with demand and report that their pipelines are filled to the near the brim Over the past few weeks Smith said it is pushing out through its system of pipes about Bcf to Bcf of gas daily to its customers The way we see demand breakdown the last couple of weeks is generators using about Bcf a day our core customers million about Bcf and our noncore about Bcf she said The noncore customers which number about in total are industrial manufacturers who consume more than therms of gas annually Smith said In comparison a home averages about therms Smiths eyebrows have been raised by the rapid consumption of natural gas by power plants which use the commodity to run turbines for electrical generation Historically electric power plants have consumed about million to million cubic feet a day of gas in SoCal Gas service territory she said This is why we are seeing pipelines fuller than usual There is continuing demand by the electric generators she said This is basically an increase in demand for gas that has contributed to the national picture of why prices for gas have gone up this year Demand has outpaced production capacity Smith explained A growing economy starved for electricity to run its Internet systems or manufacturing businesses have contributed to the reasons why gas prices have soared this month she said Power plant owners have passed along these higher gas costs to the utilities where they sell their electricity This is partially why PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison Internationals EIX Southern California Edison face financial insolvency today They are having to borrow billions of dollars to pay for this higherpriced electricity as part of the states complex deregulation plan The power plants are owned by outofstate companies like AES Corp AES Calpine Corp CPN and Duke Energy Corp DUK The threat of rolling blackouts has several causes Some power plants run around the clock gobbling up the natural gas at a rapid pace But others have temporarily been shut down because environmental laws prohibit them from emitting certain levels of pollutants annually SoCal Gas has managed to keep its gas costs relatively low by buying gas for its core customers on longterm contracts at fixed prices This helps to insulate the company from price spikes on gas delivered to its system at the California and Arizona and Nevada borders By buying gas this way SoCal Gas was able to set a fixed charge of per MMBTU for its million core customers in the month of December A new price is set to be established next week for January We hope it holds steady in January said Smith We are doing everything we can By Pat Maio Dow Jones Newswires Article

published Thursday NEW YORK Dow Jones Independent generators selling power into California face extremely serious counterparty credit concerns but the threat to their financial positions from a default by one of the states utilities is mitigated by their positions in other power markets Standard Poors said Thursday The ratings agency affirmed its doubleBplus corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings for one of those generators Calpine Corp CPN and indicated that the positions of a number of other generators were similarly stable Standard Poors without commenting on ratings said those generators include Dynegy Inc DYN The Williams Cos WMB Reliant Energy Inc REI Southern Energy Inc SOE and NRG Energy Inc NRG Each company has a diverse asset portfolio that mitigates exposure to any single market such as California SP said Standard Poors has concluded that the developers with merchant exposure to the California market have sufficient financial liquidity to sustain longterm disruptions to their markets SP also said the generators have generally incorporated conservative pricing assumptions well below Californias current market prices The generators main counterparties in California PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric and Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison have lost a combined billion buying wholesale power at prices far higher than they are allowed to charge their customers Between onethird and onehalf of those losses are offset by the utilities own profits from generating power in the state but they are still substantial and mounting Both utilities have said they face a serious liquidity crisis SP said Thursday that both companies face imminent default unless California officials immediately come up with a way to correct the imbalance between their buying and selling price for power and said it would likely downgrade the utilities debt ratings to junkbond status even if they avoid bankruptcy The

Next Article Previous Article Return to Headlines Chapter Filing May Give Calif Utils Breathing Room Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Thursday By Jason Leopold LOS ANGELES Dow JonesIf two of Californias largest utilities file for Chapter bankruptcy protection a move they said this week was possible it may give the companies some breathing room to allow for a much needed internal reorganization according to one California bankruptcy attorney What Chapter ultimately does is it allows a company to reorganize said Larry Peitzman an attorney with the Southern Californiabased law firm of Peitzman Glassman and Whegg The whole purpose is to come up with a plan to allow the company to service and pay back creditors and shareholders as much as possible While in bankruptcy a judge can order the state to raise the utilities retail electricity rates if that would help the company generate revenue to pay its creditors Peitzman said Peitzman who has worked on many large company bankruptcy cases in California said if PGE Corp unit PCG Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison International unit EIX Southern California Edison file for bankruptcy the companies will be given an injunction by a court that will prevent creditors from seizing the utilities assets collecting money or filing a lawsuit against the companies Another reason to file for bankruptcy protection is the companies wouldnt be forced to pay prebankruptcy debts if they have run up enormous bills Peitzman said Executives at both PGE and SoCal Edison said they may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection because of a combined billion debt in excess wholesale power costs and the inability under state law to pass those costs on to rate payers However between onehalf and onethird of that money has been paid into accounts held by the utilities to collect profits from the generators they still own The utilities were hoping for an immediate rate hike Thursday by the states Public Utilities Commission but commissioners said it would first hold evidentiary hearings and conduct an internal audit of the companies A rate increase is still at least two weeks off the commission said at its meeting Utilities Can Conduct Business While In Bankruptcy Peitzman said that while in bankruptcy the companies could operate as a debtor in possession which means the companies have the authority to conduct business as usual without the consent of bankruptcy court But if the companies were to try and secure a loan the loan would have to be approved by a judge Although most Chapter bankruptcy cases cant survive Peitzman said the states two largest utilities with millions of customers may be an exception Inevitably they are going to continue to owe money because of the constant shortfall they pay in electricity costs and what they charge their customers the attorney said But the bigger the company the more likely the company will survive It will be devastating to lose such large corporations If the companies fail to survive a Chapter filing the utilities assets would be liquidated to pay off their creditors Peitzman said In a Chapter filing PGE and SoCal Edison would put their creditors in different classes and determine how much under the dollar each one would get paid Peitzman said It can be as much as possible or less than cents on the dollar he said In addition any contracts that either companies held before a potential bankruptcy filing would have to be honored regardless if the company can fulfill its financial obligations to its counterpart Peitzman said Thats one of the other benefits he said Its called executory contracts which generally means both parties have material operations that have yet to be performed It may be longterm contracts and the company would be able to enforce the other part to continue doing business The other party cant refuse to do business because of a stay Bankruptcy can last as long as a judge allows it Peitzman said pointing to the Eastern Airlines bankruptcy case in the early s which lasted for years Neither company has indicated whether it will actually file for bankruptcy but SoCal Edison said in a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Tuesday that it may not be able to pay its January power bill if its retail rates are not immediately raised

New York Times Page Page Column c New York Times Company LOS ANGELES Dec The California Public Utilities Commission said today that a rate increase for consumers was likely and that over the next weeks it would inspect the books of the two major utilities to decide how much was reasonable The move is an effort in part to show Wall Street that California is committed to ensuring the health of the states utilities On Wednesday the agency that rates the creditworthiness of both the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison said that if meaningful action was not taken by Friday the two utilities were headed for bankruptcy The agency is expected to comment on the commissions action soon Gov Gray Davis has been meeting this week with utility executives and consumer advocates to come to an agreement on the size of a rate increase Mr Davis a Democrat is also seeking the advice of financial experts including Alan Greenspan chairman of the Federal Reserve Board whom he is expected to meet with next week Some people close to those discussions suggested that percent would be a palatable rate increase but the utilities are asking for more The commission will hold hearings next week and just how much consumers will have to pay should be decided by Jan Four years ago California agreed to deregulate its utilities with the hope that competition would lower rates for households and businesses But this year prices for wholesale electricity and natural gas have skyrocketed forcing utilities to incur costs of more than billion that they cannot pass to consumers because rates are frozen until In recent weeks the utilities have tried to make a case that without rate increases service to consumers is threatened John Bryson chief executive of Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison has taken the unusual step of warning consumers in television and newspaper advertisements in Southern California and in Sacramento that blackouts are inevitable unless order is imposed In response to the announcement by the commission today Southern California Edison said it expected additional cost cutting and measures to preserve cash soon But not all the commissioners believed that todays announcement would be enough to placate financial analysts and investors many of whom buy utility stocks because they are perceived to be less risky than for example Internet stocks Analysts have recently downgraded the stocks of both Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison which are trading near week lows over fears about Californias energy woes When I look at the newspapers and peruse the Internet I get the decided impression that Wall Street has spoken said Richard Bilas a commissioner I dont know if this decision goes far enough Article Next Article Previous Article Return to Headlines Fitch Comments On California Electric Utilities Business Wire Copyright c Business Wire CHICAGOBUSINESS WIREDec Fitch views the California Public Utilities Commissions CPUC interim decision to initiate proceedings to consider raising retail rates as just one of the steps necessary to salvage credit quality for the states two largest utilities Southern California Edison SCE and Pacific Gas and Electric Company Pac Gas The CPUC is expected to reach a decision on rate increases and recovery mechanisms during the first week of January at which time Fitch will assess the appropriate ratings for these companies The outstanding issue is whether rate increases will sufficiently offset high wholesale power prices being paid by the companies The companies securities ratings are likely to weaken unless full recovery is provided for the large monies paid by the utilities above existing retail rates and price stability is ensured for the regional market The utilities are unable to tap new credit until the rate decision is executed They do have however sufficient cash and existing credit to support them through the decision period of the first week in January If a suitable rate structure is passed by the CPUC at that time the utilities banks would be more likely to consider additional funding Liquidity will remain strained however to the extent that regional power prices remain high While Energy Secretary Richardson has ordered certain power producers to sell into the California market wholesale prices remain high and are above retail rates No additional federal action has been taken The CPUCs decision in early January is not expected to completely resolve the utilities future Given the large costs incurred and numerous constituent groups affected Fitch envisions a longerterm scenario of consecutive rate increases associated with a fundamental overhaul of Californias power market In conjunction with the governors active involvement the California legislature is evaluating potential actions to restructure the states power situation Legislative action remains possible over the next three

The company said it was encouraged by the language in the CPUCs interim decision that committed the commission to take expedited actions to fulfill our statutory obligations to ensure that the utilities can provide service at just and reasonable rates In our view that mandate means that we must avoid continuing conditions that may jeopardize the utilities creditworthiness and their ability

terms We recognize that this will require that we act expeditiously to address the new FERCimposed reality of unlimited wholesale prices Nevertheless SCE underscored that any solution to the current crisis requires prompt meaningful and final action by the commission ending the rate freeze providing for the recovery of procurement costs and increasing rates to a level that will restore the

mentioned in this December Victims and Champions of a Darwinian Enron By DAVID BARBOZA OUSTON Dec After an accounting scandal a bankruptcy filing and mass layoffs Enron newsquote has gone from model of management vision to case study for management obfuscation Only one group of true believers remains the people who worked there and just got burned there They may be in a minority After all people have been thrown out of work in the midst of a recession Most employees lost a huge part of their retirement savings as the value of their Enron stock evaporated Many are furious at what they view as bungling or worse by top management Even so a surprising number of former employees lament the end of an entrepreneurial culture that more closely resembled a startup than a Fortune behemoth That culture encouraged creativity and rewarded new ideas that worked they say even though its dark side an almost manic drive to experiment with new methods and conquer new markets resulted in its downfall Where they wonder can they go from here Innovative is a clich but thats what Enron was Brandon Rigney who operated the companys Web site said on Thursday This is four days gone from the place and Im already in withdrawal Enron which began as a gas pipeline company and transformed itself into the worlds largest energy trader in the s created an associate analysts program modeled after Wall Street investment banks Each year it tapped college graduates half of them MBAs to spend three years in rotating jobs at all parts of its empire It also gave workers opportunities to start new business units The companys energy trading platform Enron Online was created a few years ago by a yearold gas trader It quickly became one of the most profitable divisions In recent years the company came to be dominated by young people like Jeff Shankman a Wharton School graduate who joined the company at By age he had become president and chief operating officer of Enron Global Markets Mr Shankman who has just left the company said Enron was special because it didnt have a corporate hierarchy to encumber creativity Management experts like Gary Hamel praised Enron for breaking with convention and turning regular employees like the yearold gas trader into corporate entrepreneurs And Fortune magazine named it Americas most innovative company for six consecutive years The corporate makeover was largely the work of Jeffrey K Skilling who resigned as chief executive in August only six months after being promoted to the job Under Mr Skilling a former McKinsey Company consultant the company tested new strategies like structuring its corporate culture to mimic the marketplace You could come up with an idea and get people excited said Janel Guerrero who worked in Enrons government affairs department noting that a friend in the broadband unit went to top executives with an idea and Enron started moving on it quickly You didnt ponder it was about acting very quickly and it was about being a first mover she added Enron rapidly created ventures to trade everything from energy paper pulp and lumber to broadband and advertising But quickness sometimes exacts a price Some ventures went broke like Azurix newsquote its spinoff water company The broadband unit lost about billion When top management got into broadband metal steel pulp we thought it was innovative Mr Rigney said When people said Well trade water and waste water thats the future we said Thats cool I didnt hear dissent in the ranks But I drank the KoolAid with everyone else even though it made my head throb Indeed the expansion into new areas drained the profits of the successful energy trading operations critics say Undone by shaky accounting and too much borrowed money the company collapsed last month But even near the end it was buzzing with new ventures I just got here five months ago said Fred Radvansky who was attending a Houston job fair I was part of a group of about people We were rolling out a new Enron model We were going to start trading freight If inventiveness flourished at Enron the freewheeling environment there also encouraged other and less agreeable impulses cutthroat competition and management arrogance It was kind of like a dotcom phenomenon said Harvey J Padewer president of energy services at Duke Energy newsquote a big utility They created a killandeat culture Mr Rigney the former Web site operator remembers it well People tried to take work away from you he said There was a Darwinism for ideas for projects That undermined the companys health critics say For example it is widely believed that compensation for the people who negotiated deals with other companies was based on the size of the transactions rather than their longterm effect on the bottom line Annual reviews aimed at weeding out the least productive to percent of the work force damaged morale and some longtime employees felt unwanted There were all these MBAs coming in and they were evaluating things differently said Becky Cantrell who worked on regulatory matters I was one of the oldest people at When I saw someone my age it was a relief For all the doubts some employees harbored others reveled in the derringdo atmosphere even after Enrons financial fall and cringed at the prospect of being acquired by Dynegy Inc newsquote a stodgy Houston electric utility They bragged about being a meatandpotatoes company with people who went to the University of Nebraska one former Enron employee said We had all these hyperactive Harvard and Stanford types It would have never worked After the merger fell apart Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec and laid off about employees in Houston Over the next few days television crews filmed weeping employees streaming out of the headquarters and carrying boxes of personal belongings even as construction workers put finishing touches on Enrons shimmering new story headquarters office tower Some got word of their dismissal via voice mail Others are still packing up and wondering I dont think Enron will ever be recreated Mr Shankman said on Thursday sitting on a nearly empty trading floor that was built for people at Enron Maybe we got into some businesses too quickly and too early Enron officials and management experts insist it was not the corporate culture that brought Enron down it was accounting mistakes or the ballooning debt of hard assets like projects in Brazil and India Those facts may now be plumbed by business school case studies In the meantime some former employees have created Enron alumni Web sites Others are writing letters to The Houston Chronicle about how for a brief time they thought they were part of something special Enron was what I thought epitomized a global American Dream of sorts wrote Kathy Walthall a former Enron contractor By far the best days of my career were as a consultant for Enron The environment was an extreme rush Very busy very progressive and innovative But Ms Walthall said she was also outraged at the board for allowing the company to fall so swiftly I really hope the company turns around she wrote But I know it will never be the same

Dynegy Bid to Buy Out Enron Energy Both companies are prominent players in the states power market The move to combine their strength is raising some concerns By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS TIMES STAFF WRITER November Dynegy Inc of Houston has been hailed as a hero on Wall Street as it rides to deliver crosstown rival Enron Corp from its selfinflicted ills and save energy markets from serious distress through its proposed billion buyout of the worlds largest energy trader But in California Dynegy has a different image Dynegy coowner of several Southern California power plants has been the quietest member of the Big Five group of energy producers commonly portrayed as villains by California politicians and regulators Gov Gray Davis and others have called Dynegy and its fellow energy suppliers gougers and pirates who manipulated the market and charged too much for electricity precipitating Californias blackoutstudded energy crisis Partly because of the heightened political sensitivities to all things surrounding Californias energy problems the state is expected to play a central role in the proposed merger between Dynegy and Enron antitrust experts and others say The states Attorney Generals office already has begun scrutinizing the proposed combination If it merges with Enron another favorite Davis target Dynegy would be a powerhouse in energy trading electricity generation and natural gas transmission And the combined firm would have a strong presence in California which some find troubling I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust implications would consider this one carefully said state Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon one of the architects of Californias failed foray into electricity deregulation who became a fierce critic of power producers and resellers If anything Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to manipulate markets than it was before Dynegy agreed on Nov to buy Enron through a stock swap valued at about billion and to inject billion into crumbling Enron provided by cashrich ChevronTexaco Corp the San Franciscobased oil company that owns nearly of Dynegy But a continuing trickle of disturbing financial disclosures keep slamming Enrons stock price indicating that investors have their doubts that the deal will be completed as negotiated The Enron purchase would hurl Dynegy which is about a quarter of Enrons size into the top ranks of energy merchants In Californias energy world Dynegy already is a key company At every significant twist in the state energy crisis Dynegy was there although not as visibly as some of the other powerplant owners and electricity resellers Enron and Reliant Energy Inc also of Houston and Duke Energy Corp of Charlotte NC drew particular fire from politicians and consumer advocates during the last months as energy leaped higher But Dynegy also was accused by the states grid operator of reaping excessive profit through its electricity bidding practices and to a lesser extent by holding back some electricity from its Southern California power plants In addition Dynegy signed longterm electricity contracts with the state that have been singled out by critics for containing potentially lucrative clauses requiring that the state pay emissions costs and other costs The California Independent System Operator which runs the longdistance power transmission grid serving much of the state has asked federal regulators to ban Dynegy from selling power at market prices CalISO has made the same request concerning the other major power plant owners Duke Reliant Atlantabased Mirant Inc and AES Corp of Arlington Va which markets its power through an agreement with Williams Cos of Tulsa Okla Dynegy has sort of slid by under the radar said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer Consumer Rights a consumer activist group Not only did Dynegy do very well but particularly its trading and marketing division did very well over the course of the last two years It profited wildly For its part Dynegy rejects accusations of market manipulation saying it has played a constructive role in the California marketplace stepping forward to be one of the first companies to sign longterm contracts with the state when its need was greatest despite an electricity debt of million owed the company by the state and its utilities Dynegy has acted ethically and responsibly in California said Dynegy spokesman John Sousa The fundamental problem in California is that supply did not keep up with demand Dynamic Energy Accused of Overcharging Dynegy was created in as a natural gas trading operation known as Natural Gas Clearinghouse to take advantage of the deregulation of natural gas prices Under Chief Executive Chuck Watson the company has expanded into natural gas processing and distribution and electricity generation changing its name along the way to Dynegy a word created by combining dynamic and energy In California Dynegy owns power plants capable of generating megawatts of electricity through a partnership with NRG Energy Inc of Minneapolis A megawatt can supply about average homes with electricity The states big investorowned utilities were required to sell some of their power plants by the landmark deregulation legislation By the end of the DynegyNRG partnership had purchased three large power plants in Long Beach El Segundo and San Diego and a collection of small peaker plants from Southern California Edison Co and San Diego Gas Electric Co Under the arrangement between the partnership NRG operates the power plants and Dynegy markets the electricity from them It is Dynegys bidding practices in selling that power into state markets that put it along with other energy producers on the wrong side of the state grid operator and federal energy regulators Among the allegations In a report released in March CalISO accused energy producers and resellers including Dynegy of overcharging Californians by billion between May and March Power suppliers have denied the allegations The report also found that Dynegy reaped about million in monopoly rents between May and November of last year or profits beyond what a competitive market would bear That was the fourthhighest total for any company noted in the report Enron was ranked sixth taking million in such profits CalISO said Dynegy maximized profits primarily through a practice known as economic withholding or bidding electricity at prices so high that they would be rejected thereby pushing up the price charged for the remaining generation sold into the market Dynegy also did some physical withholding CalISO said meaning that the company withheld electricity supplies to drive up the price Dynegy was accused last April in hearings before state legislators of hoarding space on a key natural gas pipeline into California in and causing natural gas prices to soar Dynegy executives testified that the charge was untrue When federal regulators ordered million in potential refunds for the first four months of the year Dynegys portion was the largest among the power sellers named representing slightly more than one third Dynegy said its prices were justified by high natural gas prices emissions costs and other factors Dynegy President Stephen Bergstrom said in April that the company was unfairly and inaccurately accused of withholding power from the California market As we have repeatedly communicated to California policymakers and regulators and to industry officials we remain ready and willing to generate and sell power to any and all buyers at fair and reasonable prices when they are able to provide appropriate assurances that they will fulfill their obligation to pay for those purchases A recent report by the state Department of Water Resources backs up Dynegys assertions that its prices have been in line with the rest of the market During the first three months of this year after skyhigh prices pushed Edison and PGE so close to insolvency that the state had to step in and buy power for their customers Dynegy sold power to the DWR at an average price of per megawatthour for electricity That was slightly below the average of per megawatthour charged by all sellers Dynegy portrays itself as a minor player in the California market representing about of the states generation But CalISO in asking federal regulators to revoke Dynegys authority to sell power at market rates said Dynegy has profited systematically from the exercise of market power to the significant harm of Californias electric consumers and economy A decision is pending Officials reviewing the DynegyEnron merger will closely review the companies operations in California Although Enron owns no power plants in California it is believed to have longterm contracts with some generators although spokesman Eric Thode refused to detail them In addition Enron has a hand in of the energy trades around the nation with a significant portion of that in California Thode would not detail California operations citing company policy Finally Enron controls an undetermined amount of natural gas which is used to generate about onethird of the states electricity through its transwestern pipeline which crosses into California and through natural gas marketing and trading arrangements It is those largely unregulated energy trading operations that have many energy watchdogs worried They say that middlemen such as Enron and Dynegy can drive up the price of power by reselling it at higher prices each time A lawsuit filed in May against the Big Five generators by Lt Gov Cruz Bustamante acting as a private citizen described it this way The Dynegy trading floor working with the trading floors operated by Williams Mirant Reliant and Duke Energy is one of the principal tools the defendants used to inflate the price of electricity within their respective markets as well as throughout the state of California These defendants engaged in trading of electricity futures forwards options and other risk products that had the effect of manipulating and inflating the price of electricity within their respective markets the suit charged These defendants engaged in megawatt laundering in which they made trades with the primary purpose of inflating the costs of electricity within their respective markets State Is Examining Proposed Merger California Atty Gen Bill Lockyer has begun examining what effects such a merger would have on California spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said The Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also will scrutinize the merger in a process that Dynegy and Enron expect will take no more than nine months Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey said she plans to urge FERC to look beyond traditional measurements of how much the companies own in the market to examine inputs into the market such as gas pipeline capacity controlled by the companies and gas trading by Dynegy and Enron It really raises many questions about how the market works Bowen said Opposition by California could be a severe hindrance to the merger said Garret Rasmussen a lawyer with Patton Boggs in Washington DC and formerly a Federal Trade Commission antitrust investigator The state if it chooses could play as pivotal a role as it has in negotiations over the antitrust settlement between the federal government and Microsoft Corp he said While this administration has been quite tolerant of mergers an action by the California attorney general could have a significant chance of success Rasmussen said Merger Might Reopen Contract Negotiation The proposed merger might give California leverage to renegotiate its power contract with Dynegy which contains the unusual provision that the state would pay for any emission costs that the company incurred said V John White director of the Center for Energy Efficiency Renewable Technologies in Sacramento Dynegys large San Diego plant lacks crucial pollution control equipment he said The California attorney general needs to carefully examine Dynegys environmental stewardship activities and renegotiate that provision in the longterm contract White said Dynegy has a Texas theleastwecando attitude as far as the environment is concerned David Freemen the former Los Angeles Department of Water Power general manager who helped negotiate Dynegys and other longterm contracts said that while opportunities to renegotiate may present themselves the agreements now maligned as too expensive were key to stabilizing the electricity market Freeman praised Dynegy for its part in that process Theres a difference between companies that bargained hard with us and reached agreementlike Dynegy Calpine and Williamsand those that were reaching for the moon and we didnt reach agreement Freeman said Dynegy knew that they wanted to do business in California and do it in a businesslike manner For information about reprinting

Steve Hall GAC FYI At todays FERC meeting two sets of items were voted out that pertain directly to the CA markets This summary is based upon the discussion at the meeting and the actual orders will contain additional details that may not be reflected here A subsequent email will circulate with links to th e FERC orders once they are posted FERC voted out an order granting in part and denying in part the Reli ant Mirant complaint against CAISO The order builds on the creditw orthiness order and finds that DWR is a Scheduling Coordinator that it sho uld not have access to confidential information not also available to other s and that DWR should be scheduling and operating pursuant to the CAISO ta riff During the discussion on this item Massey noted concern about CAISO allega tion that the BEEP stack is not reliable bc generators are not following d ispatch instructions Massey wants CAISO to promptly inform the Commission where they believe an entity is not complying with the tariff or failing t o follow the dispatch instruction The second set of orders involves three dockets a a new rulemakin g regarding marketbased rate authority b revision of the market power t est made in the context of a triennial review of market based rate authori ty and c a narrow exemption to the FERC market mitigation for entities w ith market power pursuant to the order in b FERC is putting out a new rulingmaking regarding marketbased rate authorit y to close what they find to be a flaw with existing tariffs in the wake of Californias problems The rulemaking initiated today calls for the impos ition of a refund provision in all marketbased rates The refund requirem ent attaches to bad behavior such as economic or physical withholding or other anticompetitive actions Apparently there is a portion of the rulema king that asks for comments within days During discussion Massey poin ted out that no bad behavior was found in California and that customers should not be forced to bear the burden where the market goes out of contro l FERC has revised the market power analysis used to support a request for ma rketbased rate authority FERC is now establishing a supply margin analy sis SMA to replace the hub spoke analysis used to determine the pres ence of market power The SMA looks for pivotal suppliers based on peak demand within a market The definition of the market would recognize the r ole of transmission constraints A generator is considered pivotal where its supply is required to meet system peak demand If such status is foun d the marketbased rate authority does not extend to those peak conditions and instead the applicable rates are a costbased rate that is applicable only to the uncommitted unit capacity Rates for any such capacity would be posted in INCs and DECs for that uncommitted capacity This policy revi sion occurs in the context of a triennial review of market based rate autho rity for AEP Southern and Entergy Additional details will be in the orde r and well send an email with links when it gets posted The last item would create a narrow exemption to the application of SMA and maket power mitigation in the case where the supplier is in a ISO or RTO w ith existing FERCapproved market mitigation mechanisms While this order was to be adopted along with the other two noted above it was held for so me revisions and is expected to come out either later today or tomorrow T he context for this order is the Huntington Beach application The languag e revisions are aimed at addressing concerns that at the end of the westwi de mitigation in the coming September there would not be an effective repl acement mitigation mechanism at CAISO We will have a short discussion on these items during the FERC call at a m today ABB Andrew Brown

ISSUES Will Enron or Dynegy employees be laid off as a result of the merger The merger will be a long and complex process Some elimination of positions is almost inevitable in this type of merger and one of the key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure and resourcing of the merged company How many lay offs will there be Prior to the merger we hope to address any need for employment

Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow Jones Any merger deal that may emerge between Dynegy Inc DYN and Enron Corp ENE will face a complicated and timeconsuming regulatoryreview process legal experts said Thursday Any equity deal would require approvals from numerous US federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators as well as survive Canadian and European antitrust reviews energy attorneys contacted by Dow Jones Newswires said A merger would require approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Securities and Exchange Commission Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission And the Illinois Commerce Commission likely would weigh into the mix since Dynegy owns Illinovas Illinois Power Co Any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by Enrons ownership of Portland General Electric Co While Enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co NWN a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications A key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential EnronDynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail the attorneys said Financially wounded Enron is the nations largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines Dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing The transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at FERC where the merger application would challenge the commissions mergerreview policy attorneys said Racing Against The Liquidity Clock Enron is a complicated beast and an acquisition by Dynegy likely would stretch FERCs limits of marketpower review one legal expert said The primary question the commission will consider is whether combining the companies will increase market concentration in wholesale power markets to an unacceptable level Also FERC is in the process of changing the basis upon which it authorizes electricity sales at marketbased rates which could pose complications for a combined EnronDynegy down the road According to Platts Power Markets Week Enrons market share in competitive power markets is nearly while Dynegys is pushing That makes the combined market share perilously close to the threshold of concern under antitrust review But FERC will undertake a more complicated analysis than that looking at both vertical and horizontal market power attorneys said On a horizontal basis there likely wont be much concern at FERC Enron owns few hard generating assets compared to Dynegy although FERC will scrutinize generation assets that Enron doesnt own but controls the output of on a contractual basis It is in the vertical market power analysis where FERCs merger review gets truly complicated The commission will assess to what degree the combination of Enrons pipelines including one that controls of natural gas imported from Canada and Dynegys portfolio of electric generation assets present competitive concerns While Dynegys pipeline holdings are far smaller than Enrons it does have some upstream natural gas processing and gathering assets that FERC could view as problematic Never before has FERC encountered a vertical market power analysis of such scale and scope before legal experts agreed Another aspect of the deal that will interest FERC according to one attorney is Enrons Internetbased trading platform EnronOnline through which of wholesale power sales are traded FERC has traditionally only looked at hard assets but in recent weeks has indicated it intends to take a harder look at financial assets when considering market power issues But even if FERC doesnt take on the issue the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission certainly will when considering the antitrust aspects of the combination These two companies are huge commodity traders Oftentimes theyre trading in commodities that have nothing to do with energy noted one attorney Antitrust agencies will scrutinize whether the combination could present market power concerns for nonenergyrelated commodities as well as electricity and natural gas As if the complicated marketpower reviews by FERC and antitrust agencies werent enough the deal also must pass muster at the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Public Utility Holding Company Act The Depressionera law restricts the geographic scope and nonenergy business holdings of multistate utility holding companies Dynegy is an exempt holding company under the act since its utility holding is confined to one state It would have to register under the law and potentially divest assets to garner SEC approval as long as Enron still holds Portland General Electric attorneys agreed The SEC review also is complicated by the stake in Dynegy held by ChevronTexaco CVX That investment was structured in a highly complex manner to avoid triggering regulation under the holding company act according to a lawyer familiar with the deal Dynegy could structure the deal in several different ways in order to sidestep holding company act restrictions according to a leading legal expert on the law Dynegy could take nonvoting or preferred stock with conversion rights contingent on Enrons selling the Oregon utility the attorney said There are ways to structure it short of a stockforstock deal which is what most people think about Given the race against the clock driven by Enrons increasingly perilous liquidity crunch such an investment sidestepping regulatory review may be the way the companies have to go in the near term Its a run on the bank the holding company act expert said A Wall Street analyst suggested that given Enrons predominance in energy markets concerned Washington regulators and politicians may choose to expedite the deal Enron going down on the verge of winter is not a good thing the analyst said They may be more lenient if they can put a frigging tourniquet on Enron By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

who are starting to wonder if you experimented on small children while at Enron GAC Could Enrons Business Model Actually Work January By DANIEL ALTMAN Is Enron newsquotes business model still a good one With fuzzy financing and arcane accounting stripped away the answer may be yes Despite Enrons collapse its goal of merging the best thinking in energy finance and information technology as an online commodity trader still garners respect Enron failed because they were scamming but the basic virtual market part was fine said Dale Kutnick chief executive and research director of the META Group newsquote an information technology consultancy There is still a real market for virtual trading companies no question about it Enron traded contracts for electricity and natural gas and later other products like rights to highspeed telecommunications networks and financial hedges against changes in the weather It used a sophisticated online platform backed by a financial apparatus meant to hedge the companys bets In the words of Kurt Launer an analyst who follows Enron for Credit Suisse First Boston the company had the pioneering online venture for realtime availability of information used in trading commodities Enrons basic business model in other words may yet serve as a model for other companies In the wake of Enrons bankruptcy filing some of the best support for that model model came from its competitors Reliant Energy newsquote is one of several companies that followed Enron in offering online exchanges for electricity and natural gas Our commodity markets worked just fine the day after Enron went away said Joe Bob Perkins president and chief operating officer of the wholesale group at Reliant Everybody got gas everybody got power and prices stayed basically the same Mr Perkins said The loss of one intermediary just proves that these competitive markets work Other companies offering similar services rushed to fill the gap after Enron suspended its trading Weve picked up market share said Stephen L Baum the chairman president and chief executive of Sempra He noted though that unlike Enron our trading although extremely important and a big income earner for us is not the centerpiece of our business Another company that sees continued value in the Enron approach is UBS Warburg the Swiss investment bank which bought Enrons electricity and gas trading business in bankruptcy proceedings and plans to restart them under its own brand Were confident we can reestablish the business David Walker a UBS Warburg spokesman said It is a firstrate trading platform Similarities between UBS Warburgs financial derivatives business and Enrons trading of energy contracts were one factor that made the deal appealing Mr Walker said The characteristics of trading these types of products and betting on interest rates which is a core ability of UBS are similar he said Theyre kind of neighbors Mr Kutnick the research chief added that Enron had outstanding information technology organization that was backed by tremendous amounts of money In that way as well he said the company was certainly comparable to the best financial companies out there Because of Enrons technological advantage Mr Kutnick predicted UBS would have little difficulty regaining Enrons market share They were far enough ahead that it shouldnt be an issue he said If you are a couple seconds faster in terms of spotting and executing a market inefficiency obviously youre going to make money According to experts who consulted for Enron in the field of finance the company did not necessarily come up with a lot of powerful new ideas Its strength was in synthesizing existing ideas which sometimes led to innovative methods They took a lot of finance theory and applied it in the context of their business said Ramesh K S Rao a professor of finance at the University of Texas who once consulted for Enron There was no magic to what they were doing Robert L McDonald a professor of finance at Northwestern advised Enron on the use of derivatives from to He said the company needed advanced financial tools to price its derivatives which specified energy products to be delivered at various times and sites while demand was uncertain Thats a hard problem so they were probably breaking some new ground trying to deal with that he said Its the kind of thing thats easy to describe and may be hard to do Peter Tufano a professor at the Harvard Business School who studied Enron said the company had been using what would be considered best practices for using derivatives by any serious financial firm in the early s Had Enron stuck to those practices Mr Kutnick said it might still survive today Enron could have done extremely well with betting on market inefficiencies and hedging bets he said People stop hedging because they get too enamored of their own theories As a parallel he cited Long Term Capital Management the hedge fund which failed in when it could no longer cover the everhigher risks it began taking Enron also betrayed its success Mr Launer said by throwing money at ventures that failed to generate cash flow For example Enron spent around billion on its network capacity or bandwidth exchange which never turned a profit The fact that Enron became a dotcom financed itself like a dotcom and then suffered a demise like a dotcom he said is one of the central parts of this story But Enrons failed attempts to expand its online trading system to products beyond electricity and natural gas might not rule out future similar endeavors In any commodity there are always people who have too much and others who have too little so theres always going to be a need for them to trade and exchange Professor Tufano said Mr Launer suggested that Enrons efforts were simply illtimed These things take a while to get going he said He noted that the deregulation of electricity and natural gas led to a long period during which the market for energy products and their derivatives evolved It does take a while before users of a commodity get comfortable with the idea that they should riskmanage and outsource their use of that commodity

press release Merger QA Nov THE DEAL What are the deal terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange The exchange ratio will be As an example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of the combined company upon closing Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion upon closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock Enron will have immediate access to the billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary What approvals are required This merger will require SEC and FERC approvals the approval of shareholders of both Enron and Dynegy and expiration or termination of the HartScottRodino waiting period In addition various approvals are required due to the ownership of Enrons and Dynegys wholly owned subsidiaries From a business standpoint are Enron and Dynegy now one company Not until closing which may not occur for a number of months Until that time we will continue to deal with one another on a commercial level as competitors just as we have done in the past In general this means that we cannot share commercial information coordinate commercial behavior agree on prices etc We will act towards Dynegy the same way that we would act toward any other competitor When do you expect the deal to close The transaction is expected to close by the end of Q Why do you believe this is the best deal for shareholders The Board considered numerous optionsstandalone execution private equity infusions strategic partner infusion and a merger with a strategic partner The Enron Board felt that the merger with Dynegy coupled with the billion equity investment was the best opportunity for continued growth and shareholder value What is the ownership structure of the new company On a converted basis Enron shareholders will own approximately of the new company and Dynegy shareholders will own Post closing the combined company is expected to have approximately million shares outstanding What percentage of shareholder votes is required to approve the transaction A majority of Enron shareholders must approve the transaction and of Dynegy shareholders must approve Has a new management team been identified Chuck Watson Chairman and CEO Steve Bergstrom President and COO Greg Whalley Executive Vice President Robert Doty CFO Watson Bergstrom and Whalley will make up the combined companys Office of the Chairman Has Dynegy completed due diligence Are they satisfied that the potential exposure is manageable Dynegy has completed significant due diligence and there is no due diligence out as such Dynegy was fully aware of the matters reported recently with respect to certain financial statement restatements and related party transactions How will the Board seats be allocated When the merger is complete the Board of Directors of the combined company will be comprised of no more than members Dynegys designees will include three from ChevronTexaco Enron will have the right to designate a minimum of three board members How will the merger impact customers We expect customers to benefit significantly from this combination This combination provides a wider and more diverse platform to meet the energy needs of our customers with reliable delivery and predictable pricing Customers will also benefit from broader supplysources of the two companies Does this mean Northern Natural Gas is no longer a part of Enron No Northern Natural Gas will remain an important member of the Enron family If the merger is terminated Dynegy has a right to acquire Northern Natural Gas subject to a repurchase right of Enron Is Dynegy buying Northern Natural Gas No Dynegy is buying a billion preferred stock interest in Northern Natural Gas and acquiring an option to acquire of Northern Natural Gas in certain circumstances if the merger is terminated What percent of Northern Natural Gas will Dynegy own They will own preferred stock unless and until the merger is terminated and Dynegy exercises its right under certain circumstances to purchase of Northern Natural Gas FINANCIAL ISSUES Why is Enron merging at this price Enrons Board of Directors and management considered numerous options to best serve the interest of our shareholders including Standalone execution Private equity infusion Strategic partner infusion A merger with a strategic partner The Board and management feel strongly that a merger with Dynegy which included an immediate infusion of billion in cash offered the best opportunity for continued growth and enhanced shareholder value Have you discussed the combination with the rating agencies Yes The preliminary assessment by the rating agencies has been positive ENRON QUESTIONS What are the immediate business benefits of the transaction This deal confirms the value of Enrons core business and strengthens the companys liquidity This transaction enables the shareholders of both companies to participate in the upside of the combined enterprise What will happen to Enron Online It will continue as EnronOnline until the transaction closes How will you treat proprietary trading information prior to the deal close What impact will this have on counterparty trading Until the deal closes they remain separate companies and will keep confidential trading information confidential What will happen to Enrons pending asset sales The asset sales we have previously announced are scheduled to move forward What happens to the SEC investigation As we have from the beginning Enron will continue to fully cooperate with the SEC investigation What happens to the lines of credit Enron took out last week Enron drew down on billion from existing credit lines and has obtained commitment letters on an additional billion secured financing Will any Enron executives have a role in the combined companys senior management team Yes Greg Whalley will serve as Executive Vice President and will join Dynegys Office of the Chairman when the transaction closes What happens to Ken Lay Ken Lay will remain as Chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes He will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Will Enron complete its new building Yes Is Enrons vision still to be the worlds leading company Enrons vision will be revisited once the companies are merged Will this affect Enrons innovation A key strength of Enron and Dynegy has been their employees innovation and we expect this to continue What will this do to our deregulation efforts Both Enron and Dynegy share the belief in open markets and competition We believe our deregulation efforts will continue DYNEGY ISSUES Dynegy profile Dynegy Inc is a leading energy merchant and power generator in North America the United Kingdom and Continental Europe A Fortune company Dynegy in established its communications business Dynegy Global Communications which is engaged in providing network solutions and connectivity to wholesale customers worldwide What is ChevronTexacos relationship to this deal ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys

Enron Field be renamed The combined company will determine this Is Enrons contribution program continuing during this time The contributions program will still be a focus for Enron but we have curtailed new giving for now What does this merger mean for Houston We believe that it is positive for Houston because two premier energy companies will join forces and remain in the city EMPLOYMENT ISSUES Will Enron or Dynegy employees be laid off as a result of the merger The merger will be a long and complex process Some elimination of positions is almost inevitable in this type of merger and one of the key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure and resourcing of the merged company How many lay offs will there be Prior to the merger we hope to address any need for employment reductions through attrition and reduced hirings We cannot rule out involuntary separations but we have not targeted a specific number at this time If I am laid off either prior to the merger completion or as a result of it what will my severance package be Will the severance plan change If an Enron employee is let go prior to the merger and is eligible for benefits under the Enron Corp Severance Plan then the terms of that plan will govern Post merger employees will be eligible for benefits under whatever severance plan the merged company adopts No changes to the severance plan have been made at this time What happens to our bonuses this year The bonus process will continue as usual and will be consistent with previous practice based on company and individual performance What will happen to my stock options Your vested unexercised and unvested options will be converted as follows The number of options will be converted on the same ratio as outstanding shares are converted Your number of Enron options will be multiplied by to calculate the number of Dynegy options at close At the closing of the merger the strike price on your Enron options will be divided by the merger ratio to determine the strike price of the new Dynegy options Will there be salary adjustments as a result of the merger Both companies will continue our marketbased approach to compensating employees In addition both companies have a strong pay for performance philosophy in regard to total cash compensation Prior to the merger there will be no changes in Enrons salary structure Post merger we will jointly determine our salary strategy and structure What will happen with benefits and retirement programs There are no anticipated changes to Enron benefit plans before the merger is completed Upon completion of the merger we anticipate that there will likely be changes to ensure that one benefits strategy exists for the merged company Will the analyst and associate program at Enron continue As we bring both companies together we will look into the possibility of combining both Dynegys PACE program with Enrons AssociateAnalyst program Where do I go if I have a question A detailed general Q A on the merger is being prepared at present and will be posted on the Enron Update intranet page Additionally Enron and Dynegy HR teams are jointly preparing a detailed employee Q A to address HRrelated questions This will be posted on the same website as the general Q A In the interim if you have a specific question or concern you may email INTERNAL ISSUES What will happen to nonHouston locations Decisions will be made about all locations in the coming weeks Will moves to the new building continue as planned Yes at this time When will we begin seeing changes in our workplace Until the merger is completed it is unlikely you will see many changes in the workplace As things change we will share this information with you Will there be a yearend PRC We are still reviewing the yearend process Does Dynegy have a performance review process like Enron Dynegy has a similar performance review to Enrons Will there still be a Chairmans Award Yes Will any early retirement packages be offered There are no plans to offer such packages at this time Is there a hiring freeze Will all open positions at Enron just remain open or be cancelled We are carefully evaluating every open

form Will the Enron Body Shop remain open The Body Shop will remain open and continue with normal hours Once the merger is nearing completion the program will be evaluated What does this mean for the United Way Both Enron and Dynegy are supporters of the United Way The merged entity will also continue to support the UW The company will match all employee contributions to the United Way as promised

Sue o r I know if you believe we should interveneprotest Alan Comnes Summary of ISO Amendment Filed December Effective Date expedited treatment requested Protests Due January need to confirm this Filing in a Nutshell The ISO states that the purpose of the amendment is t o clarify certain issues associated with implementation of the new transmissi on Access Charge methodology it orginally proposed in Amendment No According to the ISO Amendment has been accepted for filing suspended and set for hearing Settlement negotiations are ongoing Is Enron a par ty to these settlements In addition the ISO provides new transmission Acce ss Charge TAC rates that will be in effect if the Commission approves the Ci ty of Vernon joining the ISO effective January and the amount of Firm Transmission Rights that will be given to Vernon in accordance with the ISO Tariff Specific Proposed Changes Clarification of Wheeling Access Charge Quantity The ISO proposes that these provisions be clarified to specify that in the determination of the Wheeling Access Charge the proper calculation is to u se transmission facility ownership and Entitlements less all Encumbrances Encumbrances include transmission used to meet demands of existing contracts This is how the ISO is currently calculating this charge and th e ISO appears to be using this filing to codify this method New HV TAC Rates Using Year of the ISOs Proposed Transmission Methodo logy The current Access Charge methodology consists of three separate zone rates based on the Transmission Revenue Requirement of the Original Participating TO Because each zone corresponds to the service territory of the TO they are known as license plate rates Under Amendment No this met hodology continues in effect until a New Participating TO joins the ISO Once that occurs the Access Charge for High Voltage Transmission Facilities will be assessed based on the combined High Voltage Transmission Revenue Requiremen ts of all the Participating TOs in each TAC Area The filing claims to implement an alreadyapproved transition formula where in new members of the ISO will pay a rate that is a mix license place and syst em average embedded costs The goal is that after years there will be only high voltage access charge The following table shows that under the curren t method which would be a split of licenseplatesystemaverage charge s PGE and SCE TO access charges would rise approximately million and Vernon would be subsidized approximately million Calculation of the net benefitsburdens from Access Charge and GMC Impact PGE and SCE have a Million cap annually and SDGE has a Million cap annually Vernon is held harmless I OUs pay muni cost increases in proportion to their cap relative to the tota l capAdjusted Net Benefit Burden PGE SCE SDGE Vernon Total Note a positive number means the TAC is going up A negative number me ans the TAC is going down or will be lower than would be the case under license plate ratemaking Vernons Existing Transmission Rights Converted to FTRs Veron by joining the ISO effective agrees to convert existing transmission rights to FTRs of presumably an equivalent amount The propos ed FTRs to allocate to Vernon are in the filing These FTRs will expire when the underlying contract right expires or years whichever is sooner Susan J NRON PM To Richard

EL alleging discriminatory use of OOM by the ISO against instate generators Seeks pricing above shortrun marginal costs plus on a temporary basis and to prohibit the ISO from using OOM for

Sue o r I know if you believe we should interveneprotest Alan Comnes Summary of ISO Amendment Filed December Effective Date expedited treatment requested Protests Due January need to confirm this Filing in a Nutshell The ISO states that the purpose of the amendment is t o clarify certain issues associated with implementation of the new transmissi on Access Charge methodology it orginally proposed in Amendment No According to the ISO Amendment has been accepted for filing suspended and set for hearing Settlement negotiations are ongoing Is Enron a par ty to these settlements In addition the ISO provides new transmission Acce ss Charge TAC rates that will be in effect if the Commission approves the Ci ty of Vernon joining the ISO effective January and the amount of Firm Transmission Rights that will be given to Vernon in accordance with the ISO Tariff Specific Proposed Changes Clarification of Wheeling Access Charge Quantity The ISO proposes that these provisions be clarified to specify that in the determination of the Wheeling Access Charge the proper calculation is to u se transmission facility ownership and Entitlements less all Encumbrances Encumbrances include transmission used to meet demands of existing contracts This is how the ISO is currently calculating this charge and th e ISO appears to be using this filing to codify this method New HV TAC Rates Using Year of the ISOs Proposed Transmission Methodo logy The current Access Charge methodology consists of three separate zone rates based on the Transmission Revenue Requirement of the Original Participating TO Because each zone corresponds to the service territory of the TO they are known as license plate rates Under Amendment No this met hodology continues in effect until a New Participating TO joins the ISO Once that occurs the Access Charge for High Voltage Transmission Facilities will be assessed based on the combined High Voltage Transmission Revenue Requiremen ts of all the Participating TOs in each TAC Area The filing claims to implement an alreadyapproved transition formula where in new members of the ISO will pay a rate that is a mix license place and syst em average embedded costs The goal is that after years there will be only high voltage access charge The following table shows that under the curren t method which would be a split of licenseplatesystemaverage charge s PGE and SCE TO access charges would rise approximately million and Vernon would be subsidized approximately million Calculation of the net benefitsburdens from Access Charge and GMC Impact PGE and SCE have a Million cap annually and SDGE has a Million cap annually Vernon is held harmless I OUs pay muni cost increases in proportion to their cap relative to the tota l capAdjusted Net Benefit Burden PGE SCE SDGE Vernon Total Note a positive number means the TAC is going up A negative number me ans the TAC is going down or will be lower than would be the case under license plate ratemaking Vernons Existing Transmission Rights Converted to FTRs Veron by joining the ISO effective agrees to convert existing transmission rights to FTRs of presumably an equivalent amount The propos ed FTRs to allocate to Vernon are in the filing These FTRs will expire when the underlying contract right expires or years whichever is sooner Susan J NRON PM To Richard

California from a generator whose stock they owned setting up a clash of official duties personal intereststhe people fired disclosed below State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics The consultants were involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock they owned setting up a clash of official duties personal interests JEFFREY L RABIN DARYL KELLEY RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company The Davis administration stung by charges of excessive secrecy disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit according to state records All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned In addition the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled Top advisors to Gov Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements A review of those documents which included stock holdings showed that some of the consultants may have crossed the line said the governors senior advisor Nancy McFadden State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence the governor has not required some of his most influential privatesector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governors energy rescue plan which includes the largest state bond sale in US history The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid a month to among other things help pitch the billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers The companies stand to make an additional million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines Davis contends that Fichera Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor beyond the reach of the states political reform laws Critics question the distinction The governors approach may be convenient for him said Jim Knox executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause but it ignores the law Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest Knox said Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year More than million is being spent by the state on consultants according to state records In the process seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances including investments The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within days of starting work for state agencies Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted Most of the consultants for example failed to state when they bought the energy stocks One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year Jones has accused the governor of a conscious policy of secrecy in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp a San Josebased power generator that has landed the largest share of the billion in longterm state power contracts Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than records show While working for the state Department of Water Resources officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the states behalf More than million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year according to the most recent records available We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks the governors legal affairs secretary Barry Goode said in an interview The highestranking consultant removed Richard Ferreira was hired on a contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for longterm power and negotiating contracts records show A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Ferreira was paid an hour by the state After he disclosed owning as much as in Calpine stock officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the companys contracts Ferreira could not be reached for comment The governors office identified the other four as traders William F Mead Herman Leung Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange a nowdefunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of Californias electricity deregulation Hired by the state in February and March the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between and a month including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California Mead a former Edison engineer said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago He said he bought nearly all of his shares years ago for and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times doubling in value each time Mead said he was called by the head of the states energy buying team Thursday and fired I asked very directly Is this because of the stock and they wouldnt give me an answer Mead said He just said your services are terminated I came up here away from home living in a hotel room trying to keep the lights on trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if Im some sort of criminal I guess its just politics and were the pawns Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state That trader Elaine Griffin who also came from the Power Exchange left the state power buying operation July three days after disclosing her energy industry investment Griffin who the governors office said had obtained another job could not be reached for comment Griffin reported purchasing to of Calpine stock on Feb in her final days working at the electricity exchange A few days later Calpine signed and announced a billion year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources On Feb Griffin joined the state power buying agency just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional billion in power contracts One of those a year deal signed Feb was the longest The state has awarded Calpine about billion in contracts to supply power for up to years In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock two others reported owning stock in Texasbased power marketing giant Enron Corp And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation Bernard Barretto an energy trader who buys energy on the daily spot market said in an interview that he bought about in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb Purchase of Enron Stock Defended I dont see a conflict he said At the time we werent really dealing with Enron I still havent bought from Enron Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job That notice came from Goode the governors lawyer We expect and have always expected the states consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards he wrote That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today If he or she refuses the state will sever its contract with that person However the governors office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors Fichera and Hoffman Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors not consultants and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects Fichera is Davis point man on the governors energy rescue planincluding the unprecedented bond sale He has pitched the plan to lawmakers reporters and the Wall Street financial community Fichera refused to comment on the record Fichera and Hoffmans companies Saber Partners and Blackstone Group prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure intended to pay for past and future power buying Pact Specifies Financial Advice The states contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide financial advisory services to the state The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates That consulting firm was hired on a million contract Like the other two firms it too was hired to provide financial advisory services to the state That firms top advisor Douglas S Montague was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement He reported no power company interests The governors legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract PHOTO Barry Goode above governors legal affairs secretary Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights

ir orginal offset NOx quantities Alan Comnes Original Message From Schoen Mary SentMonday June PM ToComnes Alan CcGuerrero Janel SubjectRe FW Davis Eases Power Plant Pollution Rules The following is more explanation about the recent Executive Order EO sig ned by the Governor of California on June In order to avoid futu re blackouts Governor Gray Davis is waiving limits on hours of operation a nd the associated emissions for natural gasfired peaker units if they adhe re to certain conditions He is requesting local air districts to allow na tural gasfired peaker power plants to operate in excess of their hourly d aily quarterly andor annual emission limitations if they do the following Agree to sell power to the California Department of Water Resources or to a utility located in California To serve an operating utilitys own load Agree to sell to another Californiabased utility The gasfired peaker units must also pay a mitigation fee to the local air districts of per pound of oxides of nitrogen NOx and per poun d of carbon monoxide CO emitted The Governor set this number it is however the same amount the South Coast AQMD is charging for NOx offsets i n the modifications it made to the RECLAIM program These mitigation fees will be used to clean up or retire other sources of pollution in the same a ir basin The Governor is ordering the California Air Resources Board to w ork with the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that power plants wi lling to operate under this order obtain the necessary approvals As you know there are many peaking plants that are close to exhausting the ir allowable operating hours Once these facilities exhaust the amount of allowable hours they would have to either shut down the units or negotiate an agreement with the local air agency to continue to operate With the ex ception of Mirant Potrero in San Francisco and Reliant Energy Mandalay in V entura County no facilities have negotiated such agreements The EO issue d by the Governor gives the peaker facilities a blanket approval to operate beyond the restrictions The Governor believes that waiving of the requir ements will also minimize reliance on backup dieselfired generators which have even higher emissions than the natural gas peakers In my previous d iscussions with the US EPA Region they did say they were willing to work with the state to provide variances to power plants operating limits Ho wever in the two instances mentioned above the EPA required the plants t o agree to install pollution control equipment at a specific future date This aspect of the agreement was critical to EPA because the increased emi ssions from the peakers with increased hours are now significant enough ma jor source status to trigger New Source Review which requires installation of Best Available Control Technology BACT The EO by the Governor makes no mention of future controls According to municipal utilities and other generators the Governors actio n could provide up to Megawatts of additional power this summer by ex panding the number of hours of operation at natural gasfired plants The EO will expire on October unless revoked modified or extended b y further executive order The air director of the Ventura air board has a lready sent comments opposing this order due to its negative air impacts Environmentalists will also no doubt object The EPA has not yet responded Despite the potential negative environmental effects the political pres sure will be strong to let these plants operate I will keep my ears open for additional developments on this

the state State officials said the plants must be pressed into use to avoid blac kouts Davis executive order lets the generators build the cost of air pollu tion fines into the price the state pays for electricity produced by natura l gasfired power plants said Catherine Witherspoon of the California Air Resources Board Municipal utility districtsincluding the Los Angeles Department of W ater and Powerand independent power companies could supply as much as megawatts from socalled peaker plants facilities that generally are pe rmitted to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollute so heavily That is enough power for more than million homes Other gasfired power plants that have been shut down because of air p ollution restrictions also could be started up as a

of course Some action in CA seems more than likely and the best bet seem to be extending the current proxy mitigation to all hours The article below raises the possibility of reissuing the refund orders recall that they began in March for the month of January to cover all hours and not just during Stage Such reissued refund order could extend back to Oct Alan Comnes Wednesday June Federal Panel May Extend Price Limits Utilities Regulatory commission weighs expanding the plan beyond emergencies and throughout the West By RICARDO ALONSOZALDIVAR Times Staff Writer WASHINGTONThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission responding to pressure from lawmakers state officials and consumers is considering a significant expansion of its plan to limit California electricity prices this summer senior agency officials said Tuesday Commissioners and staff members are engaged in intense negotiations in advance of a key meeting Monday to finalize an emergency plan for California and the West According to several commission officials the options being discussed include Extending FERCs current price limitsnow in effect only during power emergencies in Californiato hours a day seven days a week The limits intended to prevent price spikes were invoked during two emergencies last month and resulted in immediate cuts in the price of wholesale electricity FERC is also considering applying such limits throughout the West Requiring power generators in the entire Western region to sell available electricity to California or into their local power grids during emergencies reducing the threat of blackouts Establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell electricity back into the grid during peak usage times Some companies that have longterm power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by scaling back their operations and selling electricity Tightening rules on what energy marketersfirms that buy and resell power contracts much like stockbrokers trade sharescan charge for their electricity Expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies That refund order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies The measures under consideration stop short of the price caps being sought by Gov Gray Davis and California Democrats But they may go far enough to provide an acceptable compromise The whole thing is in flux but it is moving toward a much more effective price mitigation plan not only for California but for the West said an agency official Strong political pressure from Senate Democrats and House Republicans appears to have galvanized FERC into taking a more decisive role Were sort of the last to get it the official said FERC has been bitterly criticized by Davis for abandoning California FERC Chairman Curtis L Hebert Jr has responded by citing dozens of modest FERC actions to assist the state But Hebert has resisted Davis central demand that FERC use its legal authority to order a temporary return to fixed electricity rates Such fixed rates based on the cost of producing power plus an allowance for profit were standard before deregulation The politics of the situation have changed significantly and commissioners are not immune to politics said another senior agency official The message from Capitol Hill has gotten stronger with a Democratic Senate Even the Bush administration is saying we should make sure there is no price gouging FERC members have been summoned to testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen Joseph I Lieberman DConn a week from today Meanwhile Sen Jeff Bingaman DNM the new Senate Energy Committee chairman has told FERC he will move legislation to cap electricity rates in the West unless it acts soon Agency officials said commissioners do not want to face Lieberman next week emptyhanded House Republicans have also been prodding the agency On Tuesday Energy Committee Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin RLa wrote Hebert to urge Westernwide roundtheclock price limits We strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council wrote Tauzin referring to the Western power grid FERC officials said a strong effort is underway to achieve a consensus on the fivemember commission lately riven by ideology but now bolstered by two new pragmatic commissioners who favor active oversight of industry Commissioner William Massey who for months has been a lonely dissenter is continuing to press for the traditional price caps sought by Davis officials said Once marginalized Massey apparently is now being actively wooed by the other members S David Freeman an energy advisor to Gov Davis said Tuesday that expanding FERCs current price limits would be a positive step But he added that the governor continues to advocate a return to traditional fixed rates Any strengthening of the FERC plan is in the public interest Freeman told reporters at a Washington news conference FERCs price limits are not keyed to a particular dollar amount but are flexible When a power emergency is called by the state FERCs plan limits the price that generators can charge to what it costs to produce power at the least efficient plant running at that time The costs of all the plants are determined beforehand by Californias grid operator based on data filed by the generators Another requirement of the FERC plan forces generators using the California grid to sell any power they have available during emergency conditions When the price limits were tested in two emergencies late last month prices came down quickly But power sellers complained that the limits were too strict And by the second emergency there was evidence that some sellers had started finding ways around the limits Copyright Los Angeles Times

Walton Steve Sent Friday September AM To Yeung Charles Shelk John Novosel Sarah Cc Robertson Linda Nersesian Carin Perrino Dave Rodriquez Andy Sha piro Richard Kaufman Paul Landwehr Susan M Comnes Alan Subject RE WECC In order to explain who WECC is I must lay a little historical background If you will recall when EPAct was passed the usual view was that FER C could order wheeling but only on a case by case basis There had been a n effort to include an RTG provision in the bill but it died when the conf erence committee was finalizing the bill There was a view by many in the West at the time that it would still be better to move ahead with selfimp lementation of open access rather than waiting for litigation In the summ er of first WRTA Western Regional Transmission Assocation then SWRT A Southwestern Regional Transmission Association and NRTA Northwest Regi onal Transmission Association were filed They were developed in an open process that included perhaps for the first time the transmission owners the transmission dependent utilities new market entrants and state regula tors The IPPs and Marketers were participants including Enron Electric Clearing House now Dynegy DesTec CalPine Tenaska etc FERC responded in November telling WRTA that it would have to accept comparable transmiss ion access Instead of collapsing as predicted by the just say no crowd the members accepted the conditions and accepted those conditions WRTA f ormed in June of While the RTGs appear rather tame today at the time they challenged the tr aditional view offering to provide open access tariffs When the FERC iss ued the NOPR that gave us Orders just prior to WRTAs formation the participants in the three Western RTGs members responded during the summer of by working together to develop the key concepts of what became OAS IS With the filing of the current OATTs much of the ground breaking work of the RTGs was done but they remained a forum for discussion of the inte rface between commercial and reliablity A common planning data base was d eveloped in which included nontraditional participants and their ideas to be included The Western Market Interface Committee WMIC was organized b y the RTGs and has had a continuing role in bringing the the three soon to be two RTOs proposals together When the Western RTGs were organized in they were formed outside of WS CC WSCC had a very restrictive policy allowing only utilities to be memb ers When they grudgingly allowed IPPs to join it was still by halfmeasu res For instance WSCC would allow only employees of the member to attend so new small members could not employ a consultant for joint representat ion When the RTG discussions were underway the good old boys wanted it i nside WSCC with the same kinds of restrictions We broke that mold formed separately and then through the FERC order approving WRTA force WSCC to op en its membership fully or to face the creating of a separate planning orga nization The change passed by one vote but the change occured Once all the organizations were up and running WSCC WRTA NRTA SWRTA it was obvious that there was substantial duplication of meetings and functio ns Serions talks of a merger began in about They went very slowly but finally produced a common organization to be called the Western Elect ric Coordinating Council WECC which would merge WSCC WRTA and SWRTA tog ether initially NRTA will likely vote to merge as well WECC is a RRG as far as NERC is concerned While the new bylaws do not go as far as I would have liked they do furthe r open up the WSCC process and provide for some consideration of the commer cial impact of reliablity rules Is this a transitional phase Perhaps D oes it go as far as the EISB proposal No but I see no reason to play sm ashem bashem will every effort that hasnt followed the latest turn in our thinking As I hope this memo shows we have been evolving the industr y never as fast as Enron or others myself included have wanted it to cha nge The WECC will reconsititue the WSCC board under new membership rules and opens the possiblity of changing the entrenched senior staff as WSCC to breath some life into the organization At a minimum the change from WSC CWRTASWRTANRTA to WECC will provide interim improvement while the debate over EISB works its way to a conclusion and further change takes place Steve Original Message From Yeung Charles Sent Fri AM To Shelk John Novosel Sarah Cc Robertson Linda Nersesian Carin Walton Steve Perrino Dave Rodri quez Andy Subject RE WECC This is the first I have heard of WECC I assume it is a Western NERC t ype organization I understand that the traders in the West are not too concerned about form ing single standards applicable to both the East and West They would howe ver like to see more consistency in practices between TPs within the West itself Sounds like WECC may be able to do this One of the big problems w ith the WSCC has been that it was not as stringent in dictating operating r equirements on its members as the East has tried to be At NERC WSCC mem bers have always argued deference to the West due to system differences U nfortunately deference to the West has meant little to no standardization i n the West over many transmission access practices leaving it up to the su bregions or individual TPs to decide I am not saying they are not techni cally justified but there has been no incentive to bring about more consis tent practices Is WECC consistent with EISB It depends if WECC is sovereign over any ot her organization for standards approval then I would say no I think WECC should be subject to the EISB process and have to get standards approved t hrough EISB as well The problem is that EISB is voluntary and if WECC can go directly to FERC then it becomes effectively the same as deference to the West type language we have been fighting against So my verdict on WECC depends As I noted in an earlier note I believe there are those pushing for NERC t o continue doing reliabilityonly and establish a contractual relationshi p to coordinate with EISB The WECC could take the same approach If this scenario plays out I believe customers will leave NERC and put their mone y into EISB We must then work towards making NERC merely a transmission o perators advocacy group ie EEI is transmission owners advocacy group They can exist to focus on reliability but have no direct standards set ting authority They must be a member of EISB and participate as a member in one of the market sectors If anyone has any more info on WECC please share it Charles Yeung Original Message From Shelk John Sent Friday September AM To Novosel Sarah Yeung Charles Cc Robertson Linda Nersesian Carin Subject WECC What do we think of FERCs approval of the new WECC this week As I unders tand it from the trade press this new group is a merger of the WSCC and tw o other groups The new entity will handle reliability for RTOs etc and others in the West Is this consistent with our views on reliablity EISB etc Thanks

The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can heal its wounds Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by or possibly not sure of date Otherwise the utility will lose marketbased rates will be unable to get a merger approved and will have its transmission rev req scrutinized The commission favors market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure The goal is to essentially reissue the Order tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation Although California will be allowed to heal it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates Further summary prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt Affairs DC office is provided below Alan Comnes The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues The following is a summary of the meeting The meeting is still going on and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon regarding market power RTOs Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks organizational what will the RTO organizations look like and substantive once you set up the organizations what will they do Organizational Effort Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to marry up meaning I suppose that the two should consolidate Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems Structural Effort The Commission will initiate a section proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the functions established in Order No into RTO structures To achieve this goal the Commission is establishing an RTO week of advanced workshops from October in advance of issuing a NOPR to address structural issues such as congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability transmission rights Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No transmission tariff The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs Wood also recognized that some sticks are needed to entice RTO participation Therefore Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December with a declaration to join an RTO If they do not make this declaration these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis Furthermore Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs they should not be authorized to merge their facilities and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs Wood states that these sticks provide incentive but do not mandate RTO participation With regard to the pending requests for rehearing Wood asked legal staff to figure out how FERC can get there In other words I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals because she was not required to vote on anything today she only expressed her concern Upcoming Dates October RTO Workshops End of October further orders on Northeast Southeast Midwest RTOs December all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct Within the next few days FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on standards of conduct for transmission providers As explained at the meeting we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates not just marketers The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmissionowners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers As you know the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers As the interim general counsel noted these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR Breathitt may not support but if the industry does not support the proposal FERC will pull it We of course will strongly support the proposal Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity ICAP Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August and he is not that familiar with the issues Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days In sum Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability After the presentation Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply without politically unacceptable prolonged price spikes Commissioner Brownell from the Pennsylvania PUC has a better understanding of ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers Realizing that there are many positions on this topic Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process Sorry this is so long but a lot happened today We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over Let us know if you have any questions Sarah

are starting to wonder if you experimented on small children while at Enron GAC Could Enrons Business Model Actually Work January By DANIEL ALTMAN Is Enron newsquotes business model still a good one With fuzzy financing and arcane accounting stripped away the answer may be yes Despite Enrons collapse its goal of merging the best thinking in energy finance and information technology as an online commodity trader still garners respect Enron failed because they were scamming but the basic virtual market part was fine said Dale Kutnick chief executive and research director of the META Group newsquote an information technology consultancy There is still a real market for virtual trading companies no question about it Enron traded contracts for electricity and natural gas and later other products like rights to highspeed telecommunications networks and financial hedges against changes in the weather It used a sophisticated online platform backed by a financial apparatus meant to hedge the companys bets In the words of Kurt Launer an analyst who follows Enron for Credit Suisse First Boston the company had the pioneering online venture for realtime availability of information used in trading commodities Enrons basic business model in other words may yet serve as a model for other companies In the wake of Enrons bankruptcy filing some of the best support for that model model came from its competitors Reliant Energy newsquote is one of several companies that followed Enron in offering online exchanges for electricity and natural gas Our commodity markets worked just fine the day after Enron went away said Joe Bob Perkins president and chief operating officer of the wholesale group at Reliant Everybody got gas everybody got power and prices stayed basically the same Mr Perkins said The loss of one intermediary just proves that these competitive markets work Other companies offering similar services rushed to fill the gap after Enron suspended its trading Weve picked up market share said Stephen L Baum the chairman president and chief executive of Sempra He noted though that unlike Enron our trading although extremely important and a big income earner for us is not the centerpiece of our business Another company that sees continued value in the Enron approach is UBS Warburg the Swiss investment bank which bought Enrons electricity and gas trading business in bankruptcy proceedings and plans to restart them under its own brand Were confident we can reestablish the business David Walker a UBS Warburg spokesman said It is a firstrate trading platform Similarities between UBS Warburgs financial derivatives business and Enrons trading of energy contracts were one factor that made the deal appealing Mr Walker said The characteristics of trading these types of products and betting on interest rates which is a core ability of UBS are similar he said Theyre kind of neighbors Mr Kutnick the research chief added that Enron had outstanding information technology organization that was backed by tremendous amounts of money In that way as well he said the company was certainly comparable to the best financial companies out there Because of Enrons technological advantage Mr Kutnick predicted UBS would have little difficulty regaining Enrons market share They were far enough ahead that it shouldnt be an issue he said If you are a couple seconds faster in terms of spotting and executing a market inefficiency obviously youre going to make money According to experts who consulted for Enron in the field of finance the company did not necessarily come up with a lot of powerful new ideas Its strength was in synthesizing existing ideas which sometimes led to innovative methods They took a lot of finance theory and applied it in the context of their business said Ramesh K S Rao a professor of finance at the University of Texas who once consulted for Enron There was no magic to what they were doing Robert L McDonald a professor of finance at Northwestern advised Enron on the use of derivatives from to He said the company needed advanced financial tools to price its derivatives which specified energy products to be delivered at various times and sites while demand was uncertain Thats a hard problem so they were probably breaking some new ground trying to deal with that he said Its the kind of thing thats easy to describe and may be hard to do Peter Tufano a professor at the Harvard Business School who studied Enron said the company had been using what would be considered best practices for using derivatives by any serious financial firm in the early s Had Enron stuck to those practices Mr Kutnick said it might still survive today Enron could have done extremely well with betting on market inefficiencies and hedging bets he said People stop hedging because they get too enamored of their own theories As a parallel he cited Long Term Capital Management the hedge fund which failed in when it could no longer cover the everhigher risks it began taking Enron also betrayed its success Mr Launer said by throwing money at ventures that failed to generate cash flow For example Enron spent around billion on its network capacity or bandwidth exchange which never turned a profit The fact that Enron became a dotcom financed itself like a dotcom and then suffered a demise like a dotcom he said is one of the central parts of this story But Enrons failed attempts to expand its online trading system to products beyond electricity and natural gas might not rule out future similar endeavors In any commodity there are always people who have too much and others who have too little so theres always going to be a need for them to trade and exchange Professor Tufano said Mr Launer suggested that Enrons efforts were simply illtimed These things take a while to get going he said He noted that the deregulation of electricity and natural gas led to a long period during which the market for energy products and their derivatives evolved It does take a while before users of a commodity get comfortable with the idea that they should riskmanage and outsource their use of that commodity

that investigators would prove collusion because traders will cover their tracks Theyre expunging harddrive data as we speak he said The documents are long gone Lawsuits Two classaction lawsuits filed on behalf of taxpayers by San Francisco and by Lt Gov Cruz Bustamante accuse the energy companies of colluding to drive up prices Neither lawsuit clearly documents how the energy companies engaged in secretive datasharing The Bustamante suit however targets a new Internet site for wholesale energy trading launched last fall by heavyhitter energy companies such as Duke and Reliant The Atlantabased Web site IntercontinentalExchange is one of at least a dozen such electronic trading floors that have popped up on the Internet in the last four years None of these trading exchanges which analysts say are the wave of the future are regulated IntercontinentalExchange declined to comment since it is not a party to the suit The lawsuit charges the site has several features that support collusive behavior amongst market participants One is that only approved traders have access to IntercontinentalExchange and those traders can pick who they want to trade with and shut other traders out And more importantly Aguirre said the energy companies who own many of these Web exchanges get the tremendous benefit of having a record of all the trades It gives them an enormous amount of market data

Original Message From Onukogu Ernest ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESOnukoguCErnestCErnestEOnukogudowjones EcomE NRONcom Sent Friday July PM To undisclosedrecipientsENRON Subject POWER POINTSNevada Suffers FERC Unintended Consequences POWER POINTSNevada Suffers FERC Unintended Consequences By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesThose who have opposed wholesale electricity price controls have been labeled as extreme freemarket ideologues who are insensitive to the practical impacts on peoples lives of high electricity prices But the most common argument against price caps has been logical not ideological Price controls have never worked Market participants always find a way around the rules This week the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decided that it will have to consider at its meeting next week revisions to its June price control ruling The initial price cap rule set by the California Independent System Operator last spring was only a few paragraphs long Each successive price cap order has gotten longer though effectiveness still appears out of reach The FERCs April order was pages long the June order was pages And now additional rules are on call to plug the new loopholes The revisions will also try to repair damage done to the market by the June order During a spell of very hot weather Monday Sierra Pacific Resources SRP subsidiary Nevada Power had to initiate limited rolling blackouts to a small number of customers for minutes The company attributed the blackouts in part to the new price controls Sierra Pacifics chief spokesman Paul Heagen provided a birds eye view of the practical realities of the FERCs new price cap regime Power Points After having a few days to look into it can you say that price caps definitely contributed to blackouts in Nevada on Monday Paul Heagen Yes but first let me say that all of it was unintentional FERC was trying to do the right thing Price caps were a noble effort to solve a real problem in California But on Monday the market needed speed and clarity to function It had neither and that can be attributed to the price caps Normally in one or two phone calls we could have got what we needed On Monday we were five to six calls into it and still on the phone Price caps are having the unintended consequence of dragging other states into the California morass We have this artificial environment which we are all trying to sort through PP How specifically are the caps having this effect PH There are a couple of elements The premium for power sold to California is supposed to reflect concerns about credit That in an open market is no big deal but in a constrained situation the seller will grab it because now its his only chance to make money Also the way this is set up they look backwards They determine the price after the fact I cant think of any business in the world where you sell a product and find out later what price you sold at This had a very chilling effect on peoples willingness to sell Normally a cloud cover comes in and a utility has a little extra power to sell in the realtime market Normally those little megawatt packets move pretty easily and thats really important for maintaining reliability With the price cap utilities hunkered down Selling at wasnt worth the risk They figured they might as well hang on in case they needed it Also we have a voluntary curtailment program that allows us to share savings with customers who agree to curtail use If the market is say we might pay them MWh to curtail demand But in a mkt we can offer them such a small amount of money that they stay on PP Have you talked to FERC about these problems with the price controls PH Weve had a senior team in Washington DC at the FERC since last week Right away we saw another effect of the FERC order It penalizes companies like ours that signed longterm supply contracts before the order because many of those deals were done at prices above the price cap The biggest issue for us is did FERC really mean to penalize companies like us that planned ahead Its longterm contracts that provide price stability Its unfair to our customers to expect them to pay for longterm contracts that have been undercut by price caps If we get into a situation where we have a little extra to sell now we cant recover our costs PP With such high prices the past year a lot of small oilfired turbines have been dusted off and put into service on time for this summer Traders for other southwest utilities have said that all these little turbines have been very helpful when supplies got tight earlier in the year but they werent available this week because they cost more to run than the price cap Did you see the same thing PH We have some small turbines that we put in Reno and the Lake Tahoe area in the last few months They were supposed to provide peak power but they get uneconomic in a hurry under the price cap scheme You know weve tried to isolate ourselves as best we could from the California situation and behave very independent of how California behaves So Nevada is a great test case to see if price caps have an unintended effect outside of California We were able to minimize the impact on our customers Monday but the situation has maximized the attention of the country on the impact of price caps By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END DOW JONES NEWS PM PM EDT

another effect of the FERC order It penalizes companies like ours that signed longterm supply contracts before the order because many of those deals were done at prices above the price cap The biggest

scrutiny Posted at pm PDT Sunday June BY JENNIFER BJORHUS Mercury News State officials investigating Californias extraordinary energy prices are zeroing in on how energy traders use the technology tools of their profession from email and specialized software to Internet energy data sites and online trading floors This technology may be key they say to helping traders acquire the intimate knowledge needed to manipulate Californias troubled energy market With minutetominute knowledge of market conditions some traders went even further two lawsuits charge illegally coordinating bids and sending electricity prices to recordbreaking levels The state Attorney Generals Office has subpoenaed from power generators software used to formulate bidding strategies names of employees providing computer support communications with a prominent industry Web site and the name of firms that handle computer networks And a state Senate committee has hired an information technology consultant to help them look into how traders tracked patterns on the states Internetbased spot market among other things Once you were knowledgeable about its operations the opportunity to game it became pretty obvious said Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove who chairs the committee Antitrust laws Working together or colluding to fix prices is illegal and violates state and federal antitrust laws Sharing sensitive industry data if it involved financial markets would be considered insider trading and would be treated far differently said Anjali Sheffrin head of market analysis for the Independent System Operator which manages the states power grid The Securities and Exchange Commission polices the nations stock markets but wholesale energy trading goes largely unwatched by federal regulators San Diego attorney Mike Aguirre agreed with Sheffrin Aguirre is part of a team of lawyers who have filed two lawsuits against leading power generators such as Dynegy Duke Energy and Williams Energy Services Its basically an embryonic kind of trading market that involves the sharing of inside information and the only reason theyre getting away with it is theres no SEC cop he said Energy companies dismiss these charges as speculation All of these What ifs said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel The fact of the matter is weve played by the rules weve acted ethically we havent done anything wrong Energy companies say the way they use technology is all above board Thats something that were proud of that we have all of the tools to do the best possible job in the trading said Paula HallCollins spokeswoman for Tulsabased Williams Co Not everyone is persuaded that energy companies actually conspired to hike prices Some public officials and energy industry players call the technology focus a red herring Californias energy problems are far more fundamental they say than clickhappy energy traders with spreadsheets The nowdefunct California Power Exchange for example was something of a sitting duck unable to freely shop around for the best electricity prices Wealth of data Other experts believe the sheer wealth of data floating around from river flows to day forecasts of power line outages gives traders an unfair advantage Thats exactly the issue said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute The issue is whether all this information is actually doing more harm to competition than benefit to the efficiency of procuring and selling power The best illustration of this is a somewhat legendary Web site blunder In that incident an energy industry association called the Western Systems Coordinating Council posted highly sensitive realtime data about transmission of extrahigh voltage electricity in California Alarmed that such information could be used to game the market the states grid operator last October demanded that the trade group take the information off the site which it did A former energy trader who spoke to the Mercury News on the condition that he not be identified said When you can calculate exactly what a market needs and where its surplus is going to come from then you have the ability to essentially fix prices Its like a linear equation You know exactly what the end equation is going to be At issue are how traders employ the tools that like the telephone and fax machine are standard in trading electricity software data Web sites and Internet energy exchanges Dunn and other public officials acknowledge that it isnt clear how technology was used in suspected abuses And no one has turned up slamdunk evidence of collusion The ISO has done extensive studies that conclude traders drove up prices through gaming The high prices have cost the state at least billion since May Energy traders trade information among themselves the ISOs Sheffrin charged comparing it to insidertrading These traders are calling each other up all the time The former energy trader who talked to the Mercury News agreed energy traders as a very incestuous group They talk and email every day Sometimes many many many times a day he said Some of them have instant messaging He said he believes it could amount to de facto collusion But proving collusion in court is extremely difficult The sticking point said UCs Borenstein is showing exactly what energy traders did with the information These guys arent

commentary research analysis talks and the market walks The fastgrowing power producer received a ton of flak Monday for taking no questions on a conference call designed at rebutting a critical article by The New York Times Calpine held another call Tuesday with the stated aim of discussing talks to renegotiate power sale contracts with the state of California and spent more than three hours responding to a range of issues raised by concerned holders and snarky critics But soon after this marathon gabfest got under way Calpine stock already down for the day plummeted after a series of remarks by executives that the market didnt like It ended the day down at a week low If Detox had to make a list of why the market biffed Calpine during the call these would be the reasons Dilution Calpine executives said they would be willing to issue stock at a low price if cash were needed and if debt couldnt be issued because it would push the leverage ratio above acceptable levels Leverage is here defined as debt to total capital while capital is debt plus equity and equitylike securities The executives didnt say an equity issue was imminent or probable However the fact that an offering could be done at a low stock price would make it dilutive for existing shareholders A big negative To raise billion at Tuesdays stock price Calpine would have to issue about million shares equivalent to of its shares outstanding at the end of the third quarter Notably Calpine executives said that they probably wouldnt use an equity issue to pay back a billion convertible bond that may need refinancing in April Natural gas assets Calpine said it could if it had to raise billion from monetizing its natural gas reserves That would provide the company with cash but it would put an uptodate price on the assets that could be well below what Calpine recently paid for them That might force the company to do a big writedown to equity which would in turn damage leverage ratios On the call Calpine executives played down the notion that they may have to do a writedown saying future gas prices suggest one isnt necessary Related Stories Calpine Holders Cringe as Cash Questions Swirl Calpine Offers Cold Comfort Calpine Offers Its Side of the Story How Enron Came Undone Dynegy Dives as Enron Wont Go Quietly Earnings outlook Not only did the company say it may have to revise earnings guidance but it also showed uncertainty about fourthquarter earnings This looks bad for three reasons First it suggests that Calpine has more of its business unhedged than investors have believed leaving the company vulnerable to the slump in power prices Second it will add weight to the argument that a glut of power generation capacity is building Third and critically for investors looking for a bottom in Calpine stock a large cut in the earnings outlook could make the stock look a lot pricier than it is at multiples based on current Street estimates Analysts currently expect Calpine to make a share in putting the stock on a bargainbasement priceearnings ratio of to But if earnings were to be half that the PE would obviously double to which would actually be quite expensive for a company that faces liquidity constraints that could force it to jettison its growth strategy If Calpine continues to struggle to clear its name a floor for its stock price may be book value currently a share Renegotiating California contracts Although this was the ostensible subject of the call too little was said on this issue The company gave no indication of how much business might be at stake and was reluctant to surmise on how much of a hit it might take from recasting the forward gas purchases made to fuel the power production Accounting issues remain Calpine revealed on the call that it uses it own inhouse method to calculate its leverage This unorthodox method which adds million paid for a Canadian gas company to equity makes the companys leverage ratio look lower than it actually is At one point on the call a Calpine executive couldnt detail what was added to net income to get to the companys earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization EBITDA number This is pertinent because SEC Insight a research firm that reviews internal Securities and Exchange Commission documents said in a report Tuesday that the SEC had talked with Calpine about the way it presents its EBITDA number in its SECfiled financials Bank loans and liquidity Much time was spent addressing whether Calpine can increase the size of a corporate revolving loan to billion from million The company said it thought it could do this in early January But banks that have gotten burned by lending to Enron ENENYSE news commentary research analysis may now be scaling back their energy exposure Whats more Calpine is trying to raise the size of a corporate loan implying that the funds arent needed primarily for construction purposes Could the need for new cash have arisen within the companys trading operations Calpine said Tuesday that its counterparties werent asking for more collateral But if the trading desk is consuming more then its even more unlikely that the banks will increase their credit line considering the Enron meltdown xflowed

Dietrich Janet Mara Susan Robertson Linda Kingerski Harry Denne Karen Palmer Mark A PR Shapiro Richard Curry Wanda Mellencamp Lisa Higgason Kelly Whalley Greg Mellencamp Lisa Comnes Alan Subject PUC Press Release Announcing Deal with Edison Importance High PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates The California Public Utilities Commission PUC and Southern California Edison Edison today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers limit ratepayers costs of paying off the debt and maintain the states role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable certain period of time The terms of the Settlement Agreement include Edison will apply cash on hand plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs to paying off its back debt The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August less the cash on hand on that date less an additional million adjustment The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be billion as of the end of this month The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through or on the full payment of its debt if sooner If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in Edison is free to resume paying dividends in Since Edisons annual dividend has typically been about million Edisons shareholders will have forgone at least billion in dividends and possibly more in addition to the million adjustment Edison will apply of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers The PUC can direct Edison to use million each year for other utility purposes including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt The PUC agrees not to lower Edisons retail rates below their current level through the end of unless the back debts are recovered However rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over and if Edisons back debt has not been recovered by the end of There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities Edison may make up to million in capital expenditures annually This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California said Loretta Lynch President of the PUC The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers This agreement settles a November federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC in which Edison claimed that the Commissions actions in not providing sufficient retail rates violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property Under this agreement Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commissions decisions implementing AB X AB X and the TURN accounting proposal Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Tuesday October PM To Dasovich Jeff Kean Steven J Belden Tim Sharp Vicki Blachman

Mellencamp Lisa Comnes Alan Subject California UpdatePart PUC Approves Edison Bailout In another surprise move the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a vote This item was not on the Commissions agenda other than as a placeholder regarding litigation We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edisons SVP of Regulatory Affairs and heres a summary The Commission will keep current rates in place through Any overcollection resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off B in Edisons past due accounts the socalled undercollection If Edison collects the B prior to then rates can change If Edison has not collected the B by the end of the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder Half the remainder will be collected in and the other half in Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the B undercollection Edison can keep of any refunds received after the B is paid off Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the B Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs ie if DWRs costs go up the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edisons rates The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edisons capital structure varies from the PUCapproved capital structure Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding the filed rate doctrine and the socalled TURN accounting method which effectively kept the rate freeze in place Edison agrees to cooperate with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the special session that the Governor recently announced We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them Best Jeff Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Tuesday October PM To Kean Steven J Belden Tim Sharp Vicki Blachman

Mellencamp Lisa Subject California Update PUC Turns Down Davis Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event the California PUC today voted down Davis proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC The vote was with the two Republicans voting with Davis handpicked appointees Lynch and Wood Davis proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointeeGeoff Brownwho made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis proposed rate agreement What is Davis proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs no questions asked What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis proposal With the vote it remains unclear how CaliforniaDWR will pay for the DWR power contracts The political pressure to renegotiateor breakthe DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably It remains unclear how CaliforniaDWR will pay for the B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months Under the structure devised by Davis the revenues flowing from the CPUCDWR rate agreement would be used to both pay for the DWR power contracts and service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay Californias General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January In short there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds Safe to say that todays PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis and left his approach to solving California electricity crisis in shambles What Next A broad leftright coalition of energy interests supported a bill XX that passed the Legislature with broad bipartisan support The bill would create a dedicated rate component on every customers bill to service the B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue Proponents of the billand just about everyone elseargue that the dedicated rate component is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget The bill is silent however on how California would pay for the DWR contracts and the bills opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill The leftright coalition from Nader types to oil companies is also working hard to get Davis to sign it Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel Given todays vote however Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid Update on Edison Bailout Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another special session next Tuesday If you have any questions just let us know Best Jeff

RTO West are to be married The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can heal its wounds Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by or possibly not sure of date Otherwise the utility will lose marketbased rates will be unable to get a merger approved and will have its transmission rev req scrutinized The commission favors market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure The goal is to essentially reissue the Order tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation Although California will be allowed to heal it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates Further summary prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt Affairs DC office is provided below Alan Comnes The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues The following is a summary of the meeting The meeting is still going on and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon regarding market power RTOs Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks organizational what will the RTO organizations look like and substantive once you set up the organizations what will they do Organizational Effort Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to marry up meaning I suppose that the two should consolidate Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems Structural Effort The Commission will initiate a section proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the functions established in Order No into RTO structures To achieve this goal the Commission is establishing an RTO week of advanced workshops from October in advance of issuing a NOPR to address structural issues such as congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability transmission rights Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No transmission tariff The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs Wood also recognized that some sticks are needed to entice RTO participation Therefore Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December with a declaration to join an RTO If they do not make this declaration these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis Furthermore Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs they should not be authorized to merge their facilities and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs Wood states that these sticks provide incentive but do not mandate RTO participation With regard to the pending requests for rehearing Wood asked legal staff to figure out how FERC can get there In other words I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals because she was not required to vote on anything today she only expressed her concern Upcoming Dates October RTO Workshops End of October further orders on Northeast Southeast Midwest RTOs December all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct Within the next few days FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on standards of conduct for transmission providers As explained at the meeting we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates not just marketers The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmissionowners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers As you know the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers As the interim general counsel noted these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR Breathitt may not support but if the industry does not support the proposal FERC will pull it We of course will strongly support the proposal Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity ICAP Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August and he is not that familiar with the issues Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days In sum Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability After the presentation Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply without politically unacceptable prolonged price spikes Commissioner Brownell from the Pennsylvania PUC has a better understanding of ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers Realizing that there are many positions on this topic Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process Sorry this is so long but a lot happened today We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over Let us know if you have any questions Sarah

big battle in uncharted bankruptcy waters PGE restructuring bid draws state ire By Dale Kasler and Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writers Published Sept In a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy Pacific Gas and Electric Co proposed a radical restructuring Thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utilitys valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants To make the plan work PGE asked a US bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing powerplant ownership a request that triggered immediate opposition from California officials PGE said the plan a complicated blend of asset transfers debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs would restore the utilitys financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state bailout Divorcing the utility from its parent company the plan would pay off the entire billion of debt PGE accumulated during Californias poorly executed era of deregulation The plan filed in US Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco had the support of a key block of creditors including independent energy generators whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan But it ran into immediate opposition from Gov Gray Davis and other state officials setting up a potentially fierce battle Despite PGEs claims to the contrary they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because PGE could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants The proposal would have the state Public Utilities Commission relinquish control over those plants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has proven over the last months to be no friend of the ratepayer Davis told reporters Thursday The PUC while far from perfect has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Im very wary of PGEs proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a nonregulated environment Proposed PGE reorganization PGE wants to Split the parent company PGE Corp and a scaleddown utility into two unrelated companies Override state law in order to transfer stateregulated power plants to the unregulated PGE Corp Sell power from those plants to the regulated utility for years for well over currently permitted rates After years have the ability to charge market rates Give shareholders of PGE Corp stock in the utility company PGE pledges it would Repay all its debts about billion Retain all employees Get out of bankruptcy by December Avoid rate increases The PUC vowed to fight the plan in court I dont think the judge is going to do it said PUC President Loretta Lynch Consumer advocates noted that PGE has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants Its complete piracy said Nettie Hoge head of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco Its the most audacious thing Ive ever seen Filed six months after the utility sought bankruptcy protection the plan calls for PGE to be spun off from PGE Corp but the utility would transfer its hydro and nuclear plants and some other assets to the parent That would violate a state law passed as a response to the energy crisis prohibiting utilities from selling any of their generating plants before The law was intended to keep electricity in California hands at a time when outofstate generators were charging ultrahigh prices to PGE and Southern California Edison PGE acknowledged the conflict with state law but said it will ask the bankruptcy court a federal entity to override the state law Legal experts said its not clear whether a bankruptcy judge would ignore state law and in prior rulings US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali has sided with state officials Any federal court would be very reluctant to go in and override state laws said influential state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey chair of the Senate Energy Committee Robert D Glynn Jr PGEs chairman called the transfer a good deal for customers He said the electricity from those plants would be sold back to the utility at about a megawatt hour the lower end of current rates under a year contract But thats almost double the existing rates for those plants critics said And Gary Cohen the PUCs general counsel said the company would be free to charge market rates when the contract runs out putting utility customers at the mercy of an independent unregulated generator This is more of what got us into this mess to begin with Cohen said Despite the friction between PGE and the state the plan requires assurance from the PUC that the utility will be allowed to collect its wholesale power costs in the future from ratepayers regardless of how high they go Such assurance will make the utility creditworthy again and able to borrow money to fund the reorganization PGE said The plan also requires approval from federal officials and a yes vote from a majority of PGEs creditors along with Montali Glynn said the plan could be completed by December enabling the utility to resume buying electricity The state has been buying power for PGE since January when it became insolvent While the PUC raised rates an average of percent this year the reorganization plan doesnt require another rate hike Glynn insisted From the customers view this transaction will be seamless he said The same should be true for most employees he said The PGE chairman whose company has feuded with Davis for months also boasted that PGE isnt asking the state for a bailout or a rescue a jab at Davis asyetunsuccessful effort to sell the Legislature on a multibilliondollar rescue for Edison Its unclear what impact PGEs proposal would have on Edisons attempt to avoid bankruptcy Edisons creditors already angered that the Legislature adjourned without passing the Davisbacked plan might conclude that Edison is better off in bankruptcy and could push the Southern California utility into court analysts said The PGE proposal involves a complicated series of property transfers and bond offerings that would leave the current PGE Corp split into two separate publiclytraded companies The utility company Pacific Gas and Electric would become strictly a retailer and would sell other assets including its hydro and nuclear plants transmission wires and gas pipelines to PGE Corp for billion in cash and IOUs PGE Corp shareholders would receive stock in the slimmeddown utility although the details of the stock transaction havent been worked out The bankruptcy proposal represents the fourth time in three years that PGE has tried to remove its hydro plants from state control The PUC and Legislature have resisted because of potential impacts on costs and the environment Despite the criticism PGE said removing those assets from regulators oversight is essential to making the plan work Why Because PUC rules limit how much money the utility can borrow against those assets said utility spokesman Ron Low If the assets became property of PGE Corp the corporation could borrow a lot more money and use the proceeds to pay its debts Glynn said hes had indepth discussions with investment bankers about issuing new bonds Also by removing the generating plants from PUC oversight the plan can produce more cash for debt repayment said credit analyst David Bodek of Standard Poors Corp in New York If state officials fight the plan the question arises How do you discharge these debts Bodek said Heres a plan that does that The plan would pay creditors billion in cash and billion in bonds Creditors with debts of more than would get percent in cash and percent in bonds which will be paid in or more years said Paul Aronzon attorney for a committee of unsecured creditors Theres some credibility here and it works Aronzon said of the plan Gary Ackerman a spokesman for independent generators said his group would probably accept the plan even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money Shareholders also endorsed the plan PGE Corps stock jumped to on a day when the markets took another bad fall

Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow Jones Any merger deal that may emerge between Dynegy Inc DYN and Enron Corp ENE will face a complicated and timeconsuming regulatoryreview process legal experts said Thursday Any equity deal would require approvals from numerous US federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators as well as survive Canadian and European antitrust reviews energy attorneys contacted by Dow Jones Newswires said A merger would require approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Securities and Exchange Commission Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission And the Illinois Commerce Commission likely would weigh into the mix since Dynegy owns Illinovas Illinois Power Co Any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by Enrons ownership of Portland General Electric Co While Enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co NWN a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications A key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential EnronDynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail the attorneys said Financially wounded Enron is the nations largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines Dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing The transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at FERC where the merger application would challenge the commissions mergerreview policy attorneys said Racing Against The Liquidity Clock Enron is a complicated beast and an acquisition by Dynegy likely would stretch FERCs limits of marketpower review one legal expert said The primary question the commission will consider is whether combining the companies will increase market concentration in wholesale power markets to an unacceptable level Also FERC is in the process of changing the basis upon which it authorizes electricity sales at marketbased rates which could pose complications for a combined EnronDynegy down the road According to Platts Power Markets Week Enrons market share in competitive power markets is nearly while Dynegys is pushing That makes the combined market share perilously close to the threshold of concern under antitrust review But FERC will undertake a more complicated analysis than that looking at both vertical and horizontal market power attorneys said On a horizontal basis there likely wont be much concern at FERC Enron owns few hard generating assets compared to Dynegy although FERC will scrutinize generation assets that Enron doesnt own but controls the output of on a contractual basis It is in the vertical market power analysis where FERCs merger review gets truly complicated The commission will assess to what degree the combination of Enrons pipelines including one that controls of natural gas imported from Canada and Dynegys portfolio of electric generation assets present competitive concerns While Dynegys pipeline holdings are far smaller than Enrons it does have some upstream natural gas processing and gathering assets that FERC could view as problematic Never before has FERC encountered a vertical market power analysis of such scale and scope before legal experts agreed Another aspect of the deal that will interest FERC according to one attorney is Enrons Internetbased trading platform EnronOnline through which of wholesale power sales are traded FERC has traditionally only looked at hard assets but in recent weeks has indicated it intends to take a harder look at financial assets when considering market power issues But even if FERC doesnt take on the issue the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission certainly will when considering the antitrust aspects of the combination These two companies are huge commodity traders Oftentimes theyre trading in commodities that have nothing to do with energy noted one attorney Antitrust agencies will scrutinize whether the combination could present market power concerns for nonenergyrelated commodities as well as electricity and natural gas As if the complicated marketpower reviews by FERC and antitrust agencies werent enough the deal also must pass muster at the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Public Utility Holding Company Act The Depressionera law restricts the geographic scope and nonenergy business holdings of multistate utility holding companies Dynegy is an exempt holding company under the act since its utility holding is confined to one state It would have to register under the law and potentially divest assets to garner SEC approval as long as Enron still holds Portland General Electric attorneys agreed The SEC review also is complicated by the stake in Dynegy held by ChevronTexaco CVX That investment was structured in a highly complex manner to avoid triggering regulation under the holding company act according to a lawyer familiar with the deal Dynegy could structure the deal in several different ways in order to sidestep holding company act restrictions according to a leading legal expert on the law Dynegy could take nonvoting or preferred stock with conversion rights contingent on Enrons selling the Oregon utility the attorney said There are ways to structure it short of a stockforstock deal which is what most people think about Given the race against the clock driven by Enrons increasingly perilous liquidity crunch such an investment sidestepping regulatory review may be the way the companies have to go in the near term Its a run on the bank the holding company act expert said A Wall Street analyst suggested that given Enrons predominance in energy markets concerned Washington regulators and politicians may choose to expedite the deal Enron going down on the verge of winter is not a good thing the analyst said They may be more lenient if they can put a frigging tourniquet on Enron By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

example of how price controls degrade reliability Bill If you have any further insights on what happened that day let Dave Perrino or Sue Mara know Thanks Alan Officials study grids close call Published Friday Aug in the San Jose Mercury News BY STEVE JOHNSON JOHN WOOLFOLK AND GLENNDA CHUI Mercury News Two energy agencies announced Thursday that they are investigating charges some California generators have disregarded orders to provide electricity and Atlantabased Mirant admitted it had a role in last weeks incident that briefly imperiled the Western power grid California officials said two companies failed to deliver expected power on Aug and pushed the grid dangerously close to collapse threatening outages on the electrical lifeline to million people But it could take state and federal officials some time to sort through conflicting accounts of what led to the power shortfall and how to prevent it from happening again Some generators and a federal official questioned the California Independent System Operators handling of the emergency and said the rules governing how power plants must respond to state orders for supplying electricity need to be clarified But Stephanie McCorkle with the California agency said the incident was just the latest in a series in which generators didnt follow orders And she said state officials are particularly troubled at the reasons some of the firms involved have offered for falling short on delivering promised electricity We asked them over and over why theyre not following our dispatch instructions she said adding that some have provided explanations that dont add up It makes us suspicious McCorkle said the Aug incident occurred when two power companies balked at state orders to provide power That left the Western grid a vast network of highvoltage lines transformers and other electrical gear that spans states and parts of Canada and Mexico with a sudden and severe electrical shortage If uncorrected she and others said it could have led to widespread power outages Although officials need to keep the grids electrical frequency at hertz the Aug shortage lowered it to hertz State officials said blackouts could occur at hertz McCorkle declined to name the companies involved But Patrick Dorinson a spokesman for Mirant which has three plants in the Bay Area said it was partly responsible While offering few details about what happened he blamed the incident on an inadvertent error by a company employee not making a timely call and some software problems with our computers It happens Dorinson said People make mistakes An official with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission one of the agencies investigating the matter said it views the Aug incident with alarm and wants to ensure the problem doesnt happen again The agency also intends to look into whether penalties are in order But at this point the official said its unclear whether the problem stemmed from confusion incompetence or attempts to manipulate market prices The official said the agency also wants to know why the California Independent System Operator didnt declare a statewide emergency on Aug when the promised electricity wasnt delivered Had it done so he said the agency would have had more leverage over the generators Some power company representatives complained that the ISO doesnt always give generators enough time to get their plants warmed up sufficiently to provide the power it needs For many plants it takes a lot longer than minutes to ramp up said Richard Wheatley a spokesman with Reliant Energy of Houston You physically cant do it But ISO officials defended their procedures and spokesman Gregg Fishman said issuing an emergency declaration on Aug wouldnt have been feasible This was so quick he said It was less than half an hour total from start to finish and we were able to deal with it appropriately without suffering blackouts The incident also is being looked into by the Western Systems Coordinating Council a voluntary confederation of energy suppliers and utility officials which sets rules for managing grids in the regions nearly million square miles Robert Dintelman the agencys assistant executive director said brief electricity fluctuations such as the one that hit California or worse occur once or twice a month across the West On Aug for example the frequency dipped to in Montana when an electrical disturbance forced a large power plant offline there Dintelman said But he said Californias claim that generators arent following orders is unusual That is alarming he added The council can issue fines for some rule violations But Dintelman said hes not sure if they can be levied for defying orders to deliver power Nationally such violators typically get away with little more than a slap on the wrist because penalties are so weak said Ellen Vancko of the North American Electric Reliability Council Her group has been pushing Congress to make the system tougher but the legislation has stalled Meanwhile she said grid rule violations appear to be on the rise nationwide Although the motivation for these incidents varies she said sometimes those

California from a generator whose stock they owned setting up a clash of official duties personal interestsBill NonPrivilegedpst Names of the people fired disclosed below State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics The consultants were involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock they owned setting up a clash of official duties personal interests JEFFREY L RABIN DARYL KELLEY RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company The Davis administration stung by charges of excessive secrecy disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit according to state records All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned In addition the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled Top advisors to Gov Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements A review of those documents which included stock holdings showed that some of the consultants may have crossed the line said the governors senior advisor Nancy McFadden State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence the governor has not required some of his most influential privatesector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governors energy rescue plan which includes the largest state bond sale in US history The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid a month to among other things help pitch the billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers The companies stand to make an additional million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines Davis contends that Fichera Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor beyond the reach of the states political reform laws Critics question the distinction The governors approach may be convenient for him said Jim Knox executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause but it ignores the law Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest Knox said Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year More than million is being spent by the state on consultants according to state records In the process seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances including investments The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within days of starting work for state agencies Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted Most of the consultants for example failed to state when they bought the energy stocks One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year Jones has accused the governor of a conscious policy of secrecy in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp a San Josebased power generator that has landed the largest share of the billion in longterm state power contracts Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than records show While working for the state Department of Water Resources officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the states behalf More than million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year according to the most recent records available We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks the governors legal affairs secretary Barry Goode said in an interview The highestranking consultant removed Richard Ferreira was hired on a contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for longterm power and negotiating contracts records show A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Ferreira was paid an hour by the state After he disclosed owning as much as in Calpine stock officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the companys contracts Ferreira could not be reached for comment The governors office identified the other four as traders William F Mead Herman Leung Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange a nowdefunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of Californias electricity deregulation Hired by the state in February and March the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between and a month including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California Mead a former Edison engineer said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago He said he bought nearly all of his shares years ago for and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times doubling in value each time Mead said he was called by the head of the states energy buying team Thursday and fired I asked very directly Is this because of the stock and they wouldnt give me an answer Mead said He just said your services are terminated I came up here away from home living in a hotel room trying to keep the lights on trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if Im some sort of criminal I guess its just politics and were the pawns Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state That trader Elaine Griffin who also came from the Power Exchange left the state power buying operation July three days after disclosing her energy industry investment Griffin who the governors office said had obtained another job could not be reached for comment Griffin reported purchasing to of Calpine stock on Feb in her final days working at the electricity exchange A few days later Calpine signed and announced a billion year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources On Feb Griffin joined the state power buying agency just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional billion in power contracts One of those a year deal signed Feb was the longest The state has awarded Calpine about billion in contracts to supply power for up to years In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock two others reported owning stock in Texasbased power marketing giant Enron Corp And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation Bernard Barretto an energy trader who buys energy on the daily spot market said in an interview that he bought about in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb Purchase of Enron Stock Defended I dont see a conflict he said At the time we werent really dealing with Enron I still havent bought from Enron Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job That notice came from Goode the governors lawyer We expect and have always expected the states consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards he wrote That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today If he or she refuses the state will sever its contract with that person However the governors office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors Fichera and Hoffman Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors not consultants and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects Fichera is Davis point man on the governors energy rescue planincluding the unprecedented bond sale He has pitched the plan to lawmakers reporters and the Wall Street financial community Fichera refused to comment on the record Fichera and Hoffmans companies Saber Partners and Blackstone Group prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure intended to pay for past and future power buying Pact Specifies Financial Advice The states contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide financial advisory services to the state The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates That consulting firm was hired on a million contract Like the other two firms it too was hired to provide financial advisory services to the state That firms top advisor Douglas S Montague was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement He reported no power company interests The governors legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract PHOTO Barry Goode above governors legal affairs secretary Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights

<31030541.1075840060460.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,alan.comnes@enron.com,2001-12-21 20:47:38,FERC Rehearing of Orders Pertaining to California refunds and CaliforniaWestwide mitigated prices for the period Oct through Sept Cc is huge and I will not attempt to comprehensively sum marize it However here are my top findings of interest to EPMIoldco newco and marketers in general Given that current prices are well below t he cap many of these FERC findings regarding prospective mitigation are ir relevant from a commercial standpoint But will become important if the ma rket turns up before There will be many more general summaries in the trade press For a starte r I recommend reading Gary Ackermans attached The underscheduling penalty has been completely eliminated retroactively The IOUs and EOB won here Thus EPMIs million noninvoiced cr edit is kaput unless we appeal the FERC decision FERC affirms mitigation applies only to spot transactions and not to for ward contracts This comes up in several places in the order eg see p and and is useful in or defense against SPPNPC complaints On the refund side marketers and hydro owners may show that refunds do not cause net negative revenues p see also p the Commission will provide an opportunity after the conclusion of the r efund hearing for marketers to submit cost evidence on the impact of the re fund methodology on their overall revenues over the refund period For the Commission to consider any adjustments marketers will have to demonstrate that the refund methodology results in a total revenue shortfall for all ju risdictional transactions during the refund period The Commission will con sider such submissions in light of the regulatory principle that sellers ar e guaranteed only an opportunity to make a profit To the extent we stated in the July Order that we would not allow such a showing regarding selle rs purchased power costs we grant rehearing We will also allow seller s of hydroelectric power to demonstrate the impact of the refund methodolog y CAISO is required to submit a comprehensive congestion management redesi gn and plans for a dayahead energy market by May This is a good requirement because it gives FERC cover to NOT extend mitigation past CAISO must have known this is coming since it is already circulating a proposal Government agency exemptions The FERC was firm that government entitie s and RUSfinanced cooperatives are NOT exempt from the mitigation and refu nd requirements if the power was sold to one of the FERCapproved markets namely the CAISOs RT market and the PX dayahead market However FERC granted rehearing of government entity requests to be exempt from the West wide cap Thus government entities are now exempt from the WSCC wide cap However marketers cannot resell government generated power above the ca p The key difference is that government agencies selling power outside th e CAISO are not necessarily using a FERC regulated market No special treatment for vertically integrated utilities acting as marke ters p We will not allow LSEs to justify sales above the mitigated Market Clearin g Prices based on their cost of purchased power Enron wins on certainty of price in mitigated ancillary service markets In one of the few places a rehearing was granted FERC approved Enrons r equest to make the cap binding at the time the deal is consummated not whe n power flows p The ISO Enron and Reliant seek some type of ex ante pricing The ISO prop oses that prices in the Ancillary Services capacity markets in all hours in cluding system emergency hours be limited to percent of the most recentl y established mitigated reserve deficiency MCP asserting that such an appr oach is more consistent with the Commissions intention to set prices befor e they are charged While Enron and Reliant also seek a price that is known before the price is charged and that will not change that price would not be capped This topic is addressed in the order on the ISOs compliance fi lings that is being issued concurrently with this order As we explain in t hat order changes in the mitigated reserve deficiency MCP for the Imbalanc e Energy market should have no effect on prices in the Ancillary Services m arkets Thus we agree with Enron and Reliant that the price for the hour a transaction is entered into and not the hour of delivery is relevant for establishing the marketclearing price for ancillary Services We will gra nt rehearing of our prior orders on this point to the extent needed to all ow this modification However EPMI asked for similar certainty in the mitigated market price in the RT energy market p FERC raised the question but I could not f ind a response Marketers still cannot sell above the cap Marketers were denied rehea ring in several places eg p Marketers cannot be treated like gen erators even if they own or control generation In one of the more ambiguo us passages The Commission denies clarification that marketers that own or control gen eration and engage in marketing through a portfolio of resources or that p erform scheduling or tolling functions on behalf of generators will be tre ated as generators they must be price takers By contrast entities that a re able to trace a transaction to a specific generating unit will be treate d as generators With respect to Calpines request for clarification the C ommission will require marketing affiliates of generators to be price taker s Furthermore marketertomarketer transactions in the bilateral spot mar ket are subject to price mitigation and marketers selling outside of the IS Os single price auction will receive the price up to the mitigated Market Clearing Price I am not sure how the second sentence jives with the first If market pric es rise we will need to research this issue Option contracts are forward sales yeah we won p Similarly with respect to Enrons request for clarification that option a greements exercised for spotmarket sales are not themselves spotmarket sa les we clarify that such sales are entered into for future periods and the refore are not subject to mitigation

to story Tuesday March Small Power Firms Cutbacks Contribute to Blackouts Outages Alternative generators of solar wind and biomass energy and smaller gasfired plants havent been paid since November By JULIE TAMAKI Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOThe rolling blackouts that swept California on Monday were sparked in part by a crucial group of small energy producers that have cut supplies to the states utilities because they are not being paid Californias power supply dropped Monday when alternative producers reduced output or went offline cutting their usual deliveries to utilities in half The lost electricitymore than seven times the cuts the companies were making just weeks agocould have served million homes I think were just getting at a breaking point for many of these businesses said Ed Tomeo president of UAE Energy Operations Corp a San Ramon company that operates a biomass plant and a small gasfired plant Tomeo said he expects to take his gasfired plant offline today because hes run out of money to buy natural gas Tomeos firm is among the nearly alternative energy producers that generate more than a fourth of the power consumed in California Collectively the group estimates it is owed billion by the states two largest utilities Big outofstate power producers are getting paid because the state stepped in to buy electricity for the foundering utilities But the California producers of solar wind and biomass energy and typically smaller gasfired generators have received no payments since November from Southern California Edison and only partial payments from Pacific Gas Electric Co for December and January deliveries Edisons debt to the producers is estimated at million as of March PGEs debt to the producers was million as of March Jim Detmers director of the California Independent System Operator the agency that operates the states power grid said Mondays shortfall from the alternative producers was mostly caused by reduced output by about a dozen companies that have been cutting back electricity deliveries for the past two months Detmers said he could not say whether the action was orchestrated but it appeared to be a business decision The cuts have grown from about megawatts a day in early February to megawatts over the last several days according to state officials Assemblyman Fred Keeley a Boulder Creek Democrat said he did not blame the small producers who are formally referred to as qualifying facilities for shutting down Although I feel it is unfortunate for consumers I dont blame them at all Keeley said Theyre the only ones generating electricity and not getting paid Keeley said he will revive efforts to pass legislation that would ensure that the alternative energy producers get paid while cutting their rates A previous effort to slash the rates paid to the group SB X by Keeley and Sen Jim Battin RLa Quinta appears doomed Gov Gray Davis huddled for more than two hours with Democratic legislative leaders Monday after keeping his distance for several weeks and an agreement emerged to give small generators a choice Take a higher price in exchange for shortterm commitments to buy their power or accept a lower price in exchange for a multiyear commitment to buy their power sources who attended the meeting said And the governor and Legislature would quickly devise a way to ensure that the producers start getting paid at least for power they continue to produce As long as the utilities are collecting money from their customers Davis later told a labor group theyre going to make the payments The alternative producers rates are pegged to the price of natural gas which has skyrocketed in recent months Driving down and stabilizing their prices is a critical factor in Davis overall plan of buying power without imposing additional consumer rate hikes As a growing number of unpaid producers have dropped offline state officials have been forced to purchase replacement supplies on the pricey spot market A worstcase scenario materialized Monday when a lack of electricity supplies forced state officials to order rolling blackouts A number of plants are out for maintenance but its very clear to me that there are a significant number that are off due to nonpayment said Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers My concern is that this is a prelude to what well see this summer PGE spokesman John Nelson described the alternative producers as victims of the states energy meltdown Many of these generators are relatively small enterprises that cannot afford to continue operating on a daily basis Nelson said his companys inability to fully pay the producers it has contracts with is caused by the rate freeze that bars PGE from passing the true cost of electricity on

HSbert Will Block Western Price Caps by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Energy Info Source Reuters is reporting that Curt HSbert FERC Chairman said he would block a move by fellow commissioners to impose a temporary price cap on wholesale electricity prices in the western United States HSbert reportedly said that even if a majority of the three member commission favored price caps he would prevent a vote from being taken because he does not believe price curbs would increase electricity supplies or reduce demand in the region Absent someone proving to me that price caps would bring more supply and less demand in California and the West my answer is yes HSbert said when asked by reporters if he would block a FERC vote on western price caps A FERC spokesman later downplayed HSberts remarks He did not say he would block any vote said FERC spokesman Hedley Burrell He said he would need to be shown that price caps would bring more supply or less demand to the West Analysis Just last week I discussed the growing dissension with the FERC over the price cap issue see IssueAlert The dissension appears to be coming to a head just as FERC grows from a threemember commission to its standard five members As the philosophical complexion of the new FERC is unknown it remains questionable whether or not HSberts adamant stand against price caps will be sufficient to keep the commission from moving in this direction HSberts hard line against price caps was espoused during the same week that the FERC chairman appeared at a Santa Fe NM conference and spoke about high wholesale prices in California and the fact that the states utilities could have saved about billion had they accepted proposals for longterm contracts six months ago First lets look at how the structure of FERC is presently changing and how this might impact the commissions divided position on price caps On March President Bush announced his intention to nominate state utility officials Nora Mead Brownell of Pennsylvania and Patrick Wood III of Texas to serve on FERC Word on the nomination of Wood was expected although rumors had indicated that Wood might be named to replace HSbert as chairman Brownell a commissioner with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission will be appointed to the remainder of a fiveyear term that expires June of this year and an additional term expiring in Wood who formerly served on FERC from to will be appointed to the remainder of a fiveyear term that expires in As I mentioned in the IssueAlert the FERC is presently divided on the issue of price caps Obviously HSbert has expressed strong opposition to any kind of restriction on pricing However Commissioner William Massey has said that he will continue to push for price caps to help calm the volatility of the California market Linda Key Breathitt the third commissioner presently at FERC has remained undecided on the issue What could change the balance of power at FERC with the two new appointments is the fact that both Brownell and Wood come from states in which some form of wholesale price caps are presently in place Consequently there is a real possibility that HSbert despite his role as chairman could soon find himself in the minority position with regard to the price cap issue HSbert seems unconcerned about this possibility and has made reference to likeminded friends in Washington who would side with him on the issue The rationale behind HSberts opposition to price caps has been well documented The FERC chairman has not been fully convinced that price caps would do anything to increase supply or reduce demand in the Western region or anywhere else for that matter Rather HSbert believes that price caps have the potential to cause serious damage and actually cause supply to decrease further as power generators will opt to build plants in other regions that do not place restrictions on prices The fact that HSbert opposes price caps but yet supports FERCs investigation into the unjust and unreasonable prices charged by power suppliers may seem like somewhat of a contradiction to some observers Earlier this month FERC put California power sellers on notice that they must either make refunds for certain power sales or provide further justification of their prices Total potential refunds or offsets in the ISO and PX markets are approximately million for January transactions Further FERC established a price screen of MWh that would be justified during periods of a Stage alert and that anything above this price would be considered excessive In addition the commission will determine a top wholesale power price for each month through April and then formulate a permanent plan for monitoring prices in California for transactions taking place after May FERC is utilizing a methodology to determine the price screen and scarcity pricing is a very important factor in the equation The commission uses a model that takes different factors into account for instance weighted gas weighted NOX etc to determine a price of electricity when the lights are about to go out Stage alert time That is the price that FERC uses to determine scarcity prices Therefore it can and will change month to month One may wonder how HSbert can reconcile the use of a market price screen and yet remain so opposed to price caps However it is important to realize that for the most part FERC is not prohibiting that power generators sell power above the price screen Rather FERC will simply demand that any company selling power above this price report to the commission and justify the higherthanaverage price That is an important but subtle difference between a price screen and a price cap which prohibits generators from exceeding a certain price As noted HSbert spoke earlier this week at a conference in Santa Fe entitled Current Issues Challenging the Utility Industry sponsored by the Center for Public Utilities HSbert spoke about a variety of topics including the current status of RTO applications and new technologies related to pipelines and generation However one thing that HSbert said related to the wholesale market in California struck me as particularly interesting HSbert said that last fall wholesale power suppliers offered California utilities longterm power contracts in the range of MWh The general consensus among the utilities and Gov Gray Davis was that the price was excessive and that they should wait to sign longterm deals until wholesale prices decreased or until the state could negotiate lower prices on behalf of the utilities HSberts point was that California utilities could have saved approximately billion had they signed on for longterm deals at that time Most of the contracts that the California Department of Water Resources is now signing with power suppliers are confidential and thus we do not know how the fixed prices of the contracts compare to the average MWh that was offered last fall However most reports indicate that the state of California already has spent billion to procure power and is expected to pay billion for power over the course of this year Meanwhile California and other western lawmakers continue to urge the Bush administration and FERC to enact temporary price caps in the West In fact bipartisan lawmakers from California Oregon and Washington met with Vice President Dick Cheney head of the Bush administrations energy task force to assert that soaring electricity prices in the West could lead the entire country into a recession Cheney responded that the White House opposes any price controls on energy as they would discourage new power plants from being built At the Santa Fe conference HSbert said that Washington doesnt do temporary very well What he meant by this statement was that although lawmakers are putting pressure on the federal government to put a temporary price cap into place if one were to be enacted it would most likely remain in place for some time Clearly HSbert will continue to oppose wholesale price caps in the West unless someone can make the case to him that price restrictions will lower demand or increase supply Yet at the same time just this week HSbert said that he was open to a request from New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to enact wholesale power prices in the Northeast Giuliani asked FERC to impose a temporary MWh cap on wholesale electricity prices to ensure that New York City gets through tight summer power supplies without large price spikes How FERC as a whole will rule on the larger issue of price caps across the country and particularly in California once the new commissioners come on board remains to be seen In any event FERC along with state regulators still faces the challenge of finding some longterm solution that will stabilize the market in California and the Pacific Northwest An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

Calif ISO Inflates Outage Figures By Mark Golden Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow Jones The California Independent System Operator on Monday published on its Web site its list of offline generators as it has done every day since Jan as a way of showing why it is having such a hard time keeping the lights on Mondays bottom line megawatts of generating capacity out of service was stunning since electricity usage within the ISOs area peaked that day at MW But on Monday as it has every day since Jan the ISO padded the list It included power that isnt in any way considered resources of the ISO qualifying facilities that the ISO counts twice and generators that returned to service hours before the list was published When those are eliminated Mondays listed outage total falls to MW from The ISO list for example added MW to the total of its California Generation Curtailments because the MW Palo Verde nuclear unit was taken off line over the weekend for scheduled refueling But only one of the three investorowned utilities that the ISO represents Edison Internationals EIX Southern California Edison owns any of the electricity from the Palo Verde plant which is in Arizona Edisons take from the generator is just MW The same could be said for Four Corners unit which contributes MW to the ISO when its running but MW to Mondays ISO outage list The ISO list also includes dozens of generators owned by California municipal utilities that arent part of the ISOs system The ISO is responsible for managing the combined electricity load of Southern California Edison and Californias other two investorowned utilities PGE Corps PCG Pacific Gas Electric Co and Sempra Energys SRE San Diego Gas Electric Co Power plants owned by the three utilities are considered to be ISO resources as are the big power plants that the utilities sold to merchant power companies like Dynegy DYN and Reliant REI and smaller alternative power plants or qualifying facilities that provide juice to utilities under longterm contracts On Monday the ISO included MW of offline generation that isnt considered by anybody to be ISO resources in the first place The ISO agrees it shouldnt be counting the entire output from generators that the utilities only partially own Its a flaw in the calculation by the software Were trying to get that fixed and it should be within a week or two said Tracy Bibb the ISOs managing director of engineering and maintenance As for counting generators owned by municipal utilities in Pasadena and Sacramento that the ISO doesnt serve Bibb said the ISO has no choice but to include them The governor issued an emergency order that the ISO shall publish a list of all unit outages in California We contacted all the utilities and said that even though youre not part of the ISO you are required to report outages to us and were required to post them Bibb said The inflated daily outage list hurts the reputation of the states merchant power companies One of the primary uses of the list is to imply that outofstate generators as they are often called are keeping massive amounts of power off line to maintain false scarcity and pump up the wholesale power market California once again was threatened with blackouts Friday which put Reliant Energy on the spot when it announced it had taken one of its units out of service at its secondlargest power plant in the state the Houston Chronicle reported last week California critics have called power producers pirates saying practices like taking plants out of service at key times push up prices The ISO includes every little difference between maximum output and actual output however small or temporary Of the large instate generating units owned by merchant power companies Reliant Dynegy AES Corp AES Duke Energy DUK and Mirant MIR units were on the ISOs list Many are off line for scheduled spring maintenance but most are on the list because at some point in the day they werent generating at full capacity Dukes MW Morro bay unit for example appeared on Mondays list because at some point in the day it was generating just MW We hardly ever bring that yearold unit to full load It will stay on longer that way The MW maximum is running it flat out under perfect weather conditions said Duke spokesman Tom Williams And many units are run at partial capacity due to annual limits on emissions of nitrogen oxide which became far more strict this year Williams and others said The ISO doesnt want to hear the excuses A lot of them have been certified to a certain maximum capacity Any derate at all off of that does get picked up The unit is supposed to be good for that maximum Bibb said As for NOx limits Bibb agreed the limits are being reached because the units are running more than ever before But he said there are ways around the limits such as obtaining variances AES had to shut down several plants when it exhausted its emissions last year and this spring and fall AES is installing NOx reduction equipment at eight of its big generators But that raises another problem the merchant power companies have with the way the ISO breaks down its outages Of the MW shortfall listed Monday is listed as unplanned The merchant companies said most of these unplanned outages were coordinated with and approved by the ISO months ago The ISO has coordinated the schedule for all units in the LA basin that are going to be off line for SCR selective catalytic reduction installations this year The schedule was finalized in early March said AES spokesman Aaron Thomas Nevertheless three AES units out for SCR installation contributed MW to Mondays unplanned outage total Its the unplanned total that is often used to imply that merchant power companies are creating a false scarcity in order to drive up prices Weirdly if a unit is generating less than its maximum by different amounts at different times of the day the two curtailments are added together for the ISO list though Bibb says this will also be fixed in the new software program Also on Monday the ISO listed MW off line at Southern California Edisons Mohave plant even though the generators involved had returned to full operation hours before the ISO put its list out at am PDT The return of any capacity before the list is published is ignored but if a unit trips off line just before the list is published that gets included the ISOs Bibb said The grid operator doubledips when it cites the states smaller qualifying facilities The ISOs chief operator and spokesman have said repeatedly in press conferences interviews and press releases that the qualifying facilities that have been turned off due to lack of payment from utilities are separate from the ISO outage list And daily newspaper reports give both the outage total and the qualifying facility total separately But the outage list includes QFs every day On Monday for example MW of QF generation contributed to the outage total In the meantime its the lists inflated total that grabs attention We dont get that many questions on it from the media People pretty much take what they need from it the bottom line said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

operated in California and to ensure just and reasonable wholesale power rates by public utility sellers in California San Diego Gas Electric Co et al FERC Several of the key elements of that order were intended to remove barriers to entering into longterm contracts The Commission now seeks information to determine how successful efforts have been to fashion longterm contracts and to reduce reliance on spot markets In addition we note that at a hearing held by the Committee on Government Reform of the United States House of Representatives on April in Sacramento California the Committee requested that the Commission provide information on bilateral contracts for sales to the California Department of Water Resources DWR which has been negotiating such contracts with suppliers on behalf of endusers in California The Commission directs each supplier listed on the Attachment to file by the close of business April copies of all shortterm and longterm bilateral contracts for electricity which such seller has entered into with DWR subsequent to the December Order The Commission will treat these contracts as confidential unless the supplier waives such confidential treatment However the Commission intends to provide copies of the contracts to the Committee on Government Reform under confidential seal To the extent any responsive contracts have already been filed with the Commission in unredacted form suppliers may substitute a reference to the Docket No assigned to the Docket Nos EL and EL pertinent document rather than submitting a copy of the document If a

Calif DWR Power Contracts Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Dow Jones The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued an order late Thursday requiring electricity providers to file information regarding contracts they have entered into with the California Department of Water Resources The information due by the close of business Monday is being compiled on behalf of the House Government Reform Committee which held hearings in California this week as part of its oversight investigation into the states electricitysupply crisis Rep Dan Burton RInd the committees chairman requested the information from FERC to determine whether the commissions order Dec designed to move the state away from reliance on volatile spot markets for power supplies and into lowercost longterm contracts has been effective The state water department has been purchasing power for months on behalf of the states two financially troubled utilities spending more than billion at a rate of million daily Edison International unit Southern California Edison EIX and PGE Corp unit Pacific Gas Electric Co have amassed more than billion in liabilities because stateregulated retail rates dont allow them to pass through highcost wholesale power purchases PGE filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection on behalf of its utility unit a week ago Monday Edison entered into an agreement to sell the state its transmission lines in a bid to restore financial solvency FERCs order Thursday requests information from power suppliers on both short and longterm contracts they may have entered into with the department since Dec FERC said it will treat the information as confidential unless the supplier states otherwise One Democratic official in Washington suggested the House panel is engaged in a partisan bashing effort targeting California Gov Gray Davis who has widely been touted as a presidential prospect for the election Davis spokesman Steven Maviglio supported the officials assessment What a shock Dan Burton is at it again Maviglio said facetiously of Burton who derived a reputation as a partisan foe of former US President Bill Clinton with his many investigations into Clinton and his administration The bottom line is theyre aiding and abetting the generators Maviglio said of Burtons committee The governors spokesman also questioned whether the information FERC amasses under seal of confidentiality will remain private once turned over to the committee The committees offices were closed Friday so no response was immediately available By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Congressional Committee Members Question California Utility Officials Michelle Guido KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News San Jose Mercury News California Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Officials from Californias two major utilities and two of its smaller power generators were in the hot seat in San Jose on Wednesday fielding questions from federal lawmakers about their role in the states power crisis On Day of a threeday swing through California three Republican members of a US House subcommittee on energy policy and three local Democratic representatives heard testimony from utility officials and from the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The energy crisis is expected to bring rolling blackouts to California through the summer months and energy officials warned on Wednesday that the high prices consumers face here undoubtedly will spill over into neighboring states if FERC doesnt cap prices now But FERC Chairman Curt L Hebert Jr reiterated what he said Tuesday at a western energy summit in Boise He does not support price caps on electricity in California or any of the western states The energy is going to go where the caps are not and nine out of western state governors have said they dont want price caps in their states Hebert said A cap sends us in the wrong direction Instead he said by May FERC will unveil a plan to monitor energy prices and in some cases might mitigate the price of energy sold on Californias more expensive spot markets He wouldnt elaborate but made it clear those adjustments would not include price caps Government Reform Committee Chairman Dan Burton of Indiana opened the hearing by saying the committees mission was not to point fingers We wanted to see if there were ways the federal government and the state government could work together to get past this crisis At one point early in the hearing demonstrators attempted to address the lawmakers They were ushered out of the room by security personnel Burton was joined by Republican representatives Doug Ose of Woodland and Steve Horn of Lakewood Also participating in the hearings were Democratic representatives Zoe Lofgren and Michael Honda of San Jose and Barbara Lee of Oakland The Democrats pushed strongly for FERC to consider price caps We need to gain control of this outofcontrol market and gain control of the price gouging Lofgren said Honda concurred We believe that FERC has a responsibility and theyve even said that rates are unjust and unreasonable We need shortterm caps It was clear that Burton doesnt believe that price caps are the answer In fact on several occasions he suggested that capping energy prices might result in even more blackouts as summer approaches Lee suggested that some people believe the only way out of the crisis is some form of reregulation But Dede Hapner vice president of regulatory relations for PGE said she wasnt sure that was the answer We still think a correctly structured market could work Its certainly working in other states Hapner said In retrospect the way the deregulation market was structured was designed to fail Today the hearings move to San Diego where members will hear from representatives of generators that have been accused of overcharging California including Reliant

Connole and Tom Doggett Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited WASHINGTON April Reuters A split US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved on Wednesday a plan to stabilize Californias volatile power market and stem market abuses Under the plan set to take effect in late May and last for one year price relief measures will be imposed on Californias wholesale power sales during severe energy shortages The threemember commission split sharply on the plan voting for an order that the majority believe will prevent power costs from soaring out of control in California this summer Wholesale power prices have jumped tenfold in California in the past year the result of growing demand from the states million residents following a decade that saw no major power plants added to its electric system FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert a Republican and Democrat Linda Breathitt supported the order Democrat William Massey dissented despite hours of talks aimed at reaching a consensus California consumers can rest assured that the commission has been attentive to their problems and has worked tirelessly to ensure that they receive necessary relief in a manner that does not compound current problems or undemine longerterm solutions Hebert said DISSENTING VOTE Massey said that by limiting price relief to declared power emergencies FERCs actions would fall short of solving the severe problems plaguing the California market The evidence is pervasive that the problem exists hours a day seven days a week Now is not the time for halfaloaf solutions Massey said Under the plan price mitigation would be triggered whenever the California Independent System Operator ISO declares a power emergency The ISO which manages most of the states power grid uses a threestage alert system with a Stage One called when power reserves drop to within seven percent of actual demand on the grid As demand eats further into the supply cushion Stage Two and Stage Three alerts are declared with Stage Three indicating rolling blackouts may be required to avoid overloading the grid and triggering far more widespread outages California has ordered rolling blackouts four days so far this year with state energy officials predicting more are likely this summer when air conditioning pushes demand to its annual peak FINDING A FAIR PRICE The mitigation and monitoring plans central element will require generators to offer available power in real time using a proxy price established a day ahead of actual delivery FERC said The proxy price reflects the marginal cost of the highestcost generator asked to supply power to the grid This price will vary daily according to demand the price of fuel used by generators such as natural gas and the cost of complying with environmental standards However generators could charge more than the proxy price if they can justify the higher cost when FERC reviews their sales records which they are required to submit at the end of each month If those costs cannot be justified FERC can order the generator to refund the buyer FERC said all generators in California even those not subject to the commissions price regulations are required to sell into the ISOs real time price market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities were exempted from the plan because of their generation limitations which fluctuate according to reservoir levels and the competing needs of others for those same water resources REGIONAL SOLUTION The commission emphasized that the only real solution to the power supply problems affecting the western markets was to forge a regional response Toward this goal FERC said California ISO would need to file a plan to form a regional transmission organization RTO by June or forfeit the socalled crutch of FERCs pricerelief plan Among the many measures contained in the order FERC told California utilities to coordinate any temporary shutdowns of generating plants with the ISO to ensure the state has adequate electric supplies at all times The order also formally opened an investigation by commission staff into possible abusive wholesale practices behind power sales throughout the Western region FERC said the plan would expire in as the California power crisis eases The states rush to build new power plants is expected to put an additional to megawatts on the grid by next summer enough to supply up to six million homes Folder Name FERC in the News Relevance Score on Scale of To review or revise your folder visit or contact

By Rebecca Smith The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Hewing more to the ideological position of the Bush administration than to the urgings of Gov Gray Davis and other California politicians a divided Federal Energy Regulatory Commission yesterday ordered limited price controls for the states flawed electricity market The new controls arent likely to restrain runaway wholesale power prices this summer The order was approved in a meeting that began hours late as the three commissioners locked horns over how far the agency should go to restrain wholesale prices that have pushed one of Californias big utilities into bankruptcy and which now threatens the states fiscal health The commission built on a staff recommendation issued in March that suggested it act only at those times when electricity supplies are in shortest supply In its order the commission decided to intervene whenever state electricity reserves drop below authorized levels socalled Stage I II and III emergencies The pricemitigation plan appears to ignore evidence filed by the gridoperating California Independent System Operator that generators can substantially raise market prices even when supplies arent technically short The ISO had recommended imposing price caps when individual generating plants tried to charge far more than fair production costs Commissioner William Massey dissented in part from the order in a sharply worded attack on the commission which he said hadnt done its duty to protect energy users by restraining generators that overcharge As a consequence he said the economic carnage is spreading throughout the West Mr Massey an Arkansas Democrat criticized the commission for acting only when electricity reserves fall below since this agency is obligated to ensure just and reasonable prices in all hours Under the order generators will be required to submit cost data to justify high prices during periods of electricity scarcity They will be allowed to collect the price they bid so long as it doesnt exceed the price charged by the oldest leastefficient plant operating at the time Such proxy price methodology enabled plant owners to collect as much as per megawatt hour in February or roughly times the prevailing price a year earlier Support for the order came from commission Chairman Curt Hebert a Mississippi Republican who said he didnt intend the commission to fall into a trap of limiting market forces to the extent that we hinder efforts to build new power plants and transmission lines that are badly needed to correct Californias supplyanddemand imbalance Linda Breathitt a Kentucky Democrat was the swing vote who eventually sided with Mr Hebert FERC staffers said she expressed doubts about whether the commission was doing as much as it should In the meeting she acknowledged the complexity and difficulty of the task but said she remained steadfast in my belief that market solutions are preferable to regulatory controls The commission attached an unexpected condition to its order saying the pricecap scheme will be revoked June unless the California grid operator has filed a plan to become part of a regionwide gridoperating organization Californias ISO had such a plan ready to file but it got yanked when a new board named by the states governor took control recently In recent months Mr Davis has urged increased isolationism even suggesting the state no longer export powerIt isnt clear whether FERC intends to permit California to continue to operate as a standalone gridrunning organization More likely it will be expected to show it intends to become part of a multistate organization to operate transmission lines in a nondiscriminatory manner The commission gave tentative approval yesterday to formation of a regional grid operator that would encompass eight other Western states and would include the transmission system of the federal Bonneville Power Administration the biggest

Word document and read only the changes that we made to the summary since receiving the final order which was issued this afternoon Alan Comnes The full order is available at electricbulkpowerh tm SUMMARY OF FERCS ORDER ESTABLISHING PROSPECTIVE MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN FOR THE CALIFORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKETS AND ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION OF PUBLIC UTILITY RATES IN WHOLESALE WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS Issued April Effective Date Price mitigation is effective May ISO needs t o have its dayahead proxy price ready on Physical Withholding To prevent physical withholding the plan will require sellers with PGAs to offer all their available power in real time to the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade All California generators ev en those not subject to FERC price regulation will be required to sell into t he ISOs real time market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted This requirement to provide power is for all hours for yr Price Mitigation The plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market During Stage and emergencies in t he ISOs real time market each generator other than hydro with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generators heat curve emission rates gas costs and emission costs plus MWh for OM The gas cost wil l be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California emissions are to be based on Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services The ISO will publish by am the gas and emission figures to be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared These figures for the next day will be based on the prior days Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgerald data A single market clearing price is determined in rea l time for all generators Highest bid sets the clearing price Each gasfired generator must file with FERC and the ISO within days on a confidential basis heat and emission rates for each generating unit The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator including maintenance and operating costs Generators that submit bids at or below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability Although the following qualification is made However all public util ity rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on marketbased rates discussed infra Presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavior In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price the generator must within days of the end of each month file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price FERC explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the all delivery point index it has adopted FERC has days to review act No opportunity costs in real time Marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based o n specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost Underscheduling Penalites FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it is still in place Thus although it may be advantageous to wait to buy power in RT at capped prices doing so may make the scheduling coordinator subject to the currently effective MWh penalty See p of the FERC order New Generation New generation is NOT exempted from the Commissions price mitigation measures Demand Response Beginning June only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids FERC is attempting to make the demand curve more price responsive This requirement is in effect for all hours Outages PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages The ISO is required to make a tariff filing within days of the order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages including periodic reports to the Commission Term Order expires one year from date of issuance RTO Filing California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June or Order lapses with no further effect The RTO filing is to be consistent with the characteristics and functions in Order No ISO Reporting On September ISO must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built Comments are du e in days Quarterly reports thereafter Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds The market based ra te authority of all public utilities is conditioned on no physical withhol d of capacity and no inappropriate bidding behavior Inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate In addition hockey stick bids are expressly prohibited ie bidding at marginal cost and at a much higher level Other prohibited bidding practices identified include pricing a single unit much higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs WestWide Section Investigation Opens a section investigation concerning the JR of wholesale power in the WSCC other than sales to the CAISO market FERC requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitigation However its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real time markets for power less than hours in advance of RT spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below within a control area FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California Comments are due in days on the investigations Althou gh it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the nonCalifornia PN W the FERC sets the refund effective date is days from publication of the Order NOx Limits in California Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law However it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement just include the fines as part of the price bid Also if NOx is limited may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price Surcharge to pay past amount due Comments are due in days on whether FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into a n escrow account to pay past costs and the effect this surcharge would ha ve on the PGE bankruptcy filing Treatment of the CAISOs Market Stabilization Plan MSP The FERC rejec ts the CAISOs MSP saying that FERCs plan for market mitigation is suff icient It expressly rejects CAISOs plan to create a dayahead and hourahead e nergy markets are expressly reject and tells CAISO to stop actions to implement software changes to effectuate such markets Unfortunately it does not expressly reject CAISOs plan to cut exports In general no mention wa s made as to issue of exports of power from California although the statement that CAISO must become a

Cost Study Critical of Public Agencies Too Power DWP is among three governmentrun producers cited as driving prices up Spokesmen deny any market manipulation By ROBERT J LOPEZ RICH CONNELL Times Staff Writers Governmentowned utilities including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power were influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to levels that helped ignite Californias exploding energy crisis during the summer and fall according to public and confidential records For months Gov Gray Davis legislators and consumer advocates have chiefly blamed a few private power companies for throwing the state into darkness and economic chaos But they are just part of the equation A confidential document obtained by The Times names power providers that have allegedly manipulated the electricity market While the document does identify outofstate merchants criticized for gouging it also discloses for the first time the extent to which public entities allegedly have maximized profits in the volatile spot market The documentwhich decodes the identities of unnamed suppliers in a recent state studysingles out three governmentrun agencies as consistently trying to inflate prices They are the DWP the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest and the trading arm of Canadas BC Hydro in British Columbia Like a number of privately owned generators these three producers offered power at a range of high prices and sometimes in large amounts when the state was most desperate They also helped saddle Californias three largest utilities with billions of dollars in debtleading one Pacific Gas Electric to seek bankruptcy protection last week The study by the California Independent System Operator or CalISO analyzed thousands of hours of bidding practices for large suppliers in the spot or realtime market from May to November The study accounted for factors such as rising production costs increased demand periods of scarcity and profits that would be earned in a healthy competitive market Money earned above that was called excess profits No entitypublic or privateearned as much in alleged excess profits as British Columbias Powerex the state records show They were the most aggressive bidders said Anjali Sheffrin author of the coded study They had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in said Sheffrin who did not discuss any companies by name The Canadian agency reaped million in alleged excessive profitsseveral times the amount collected by all but one of the private generators Second on the list was Atlantabased Southern Co Energy Marketing now called Mirant which collected nearly million in alleged inflated earnings BC Hydro and Mirantalong with the DWP and other producerssay they played by the rules established under Californias flawed deregulation plan and did not exploit the states troubles But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of severe power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise overnight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity which could be produced inexpensively but sold for a premium It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity would be at any given time said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins We helped keep the lights on in California And the rates low for their own customers During the past year BC Hydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a rainy day account to ensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America Los Angeles Department of Water and Power although eighth on the list of alleged profiteers was among those singled out for seeking high prices during periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire spot market where emergency purchases are made This according to state documents was accomplished by offering power at incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest increases in demand The strategy also helped prop up prices keeping them from falling The DWPs average hourly bid or asking price for electricity ultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston and Tulsabased Williams Cos two major players in the national energy market In addition the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that could pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand the report said referring by code to DWP and four other suppliers The data shows they clearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load conditions DWP General Manager S David Freeman called the reports findings outrageous insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes unpunished in this state Freeman said noting that DWP power helped avert more blackouts across the state He did acknowledge however that the agency has charged high prices for surplus power at the th hour but said that was only because it cost more to produce We have consistently charged CalISO our cost plus he said Its not as though were up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down their throats Freeman said that when his staff

Donna NRON cc Subject LADWP BC Hydro Bonneville Accused of Gouging California Energy Cost Study Critical of Public Agencies Too Power DWP is among three governmentrun producers cited as driving prices up Spokesmen deny any market manipulation By ROBERT J LOPEZ RICH CONNELL Times Staff Writers Governmentowned utilities including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power were influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to levels that helped ignite Californias exploding energy crisis during the summer and fall according to public and confidential records For months Gov Gray Davis legislators and consumer advocates have chiefly blamed a few private power companies for throwing the state into darkness and economic chaos But they are just part of the equation A confidential document obtained by The Times names power providers that have allegedly manipulated the electricity market While the document does identify outofstate merchants criticized for gouging it also discloses for the first time the extent to which public entities allegedly have maximized profits in the volatile spot market The documentwhich decodes the identities of unnamed suppliers in a recent state studysingles out three governmentrun agencies as consistently trying to inflate prices They are the DWP the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest and the trading arm of Canadas BC Hydro in British Columbia Like a number of privately owned generators these three producers offered power at a range of high prices and sometimes in large amounts when the state was most desperate They also helped saddle Californias three largest utilities with billions of dollars in debtleading one Pacific Gas Electric to seek bankruptcy protection last week The study by the California Independent System Operator or CalISO analyzed thousands of hours of bidding practices for large suppliers in the spot or realtime market from May to November The study accounted for factors such as rising production costs increased demand periods of scarcity and profits that would be earned in a healthy competitive market Money earned above that was called excess profits No entitypublic or privateearned as much in alleged excess profits as British Columbias Powerex the state records show They were the most aggressive bidders said Anjali Sheffrin author of the coded study They had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in said Sheffrin who did not discuss any companies by name The Canadian agency reaped million in alleged excessive profitsseveral times the amount collected by all but one of the private generators Second on the list was Atlantabased Southern Co Energy Marketing now called Mirant which collected nearly million in alleged inflated earnings BC Hydro and Mirantalong with the DWP and other producerssay they played by the rules established under Californias flawed deregulation plan and did not exploit the states troubles But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of severe power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise overnight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity which could be produced inexpensively but sold for a premium It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity would be at any given time said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins We helped keep the lights on in California And the rates low for their own customers During the past year BC Hydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a rainy day account to ensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America Los Angeles Department of Water and Power although eighth on the list of alleged profiteers was among those singled out for seeking high prices during periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire spot market where emergency purchases are made This according to state documents was accomplished by offering power at incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest increases in demand The strategy also helped prop up prices keeping them from falling The DWPs average hourly bid or asking price for electricity ultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston and Tulsabased Williams Cos two major players in the national energy market In addition the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that could pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand the report said referring by code to DWP and four other suppliers The data shows they clearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load conditions DWP General Manager S David Freeman called the reports findings outrageous insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes unpunished in this state Freeman said noting that DWP power helped avert more blackouts across the state He did acknowledge however that the agency has charged high prices for surplus power at the th hour but said that was only because it cost more to produce We have consistently charged CalISO our cost plus he said Its not as though were up

scrutiny Posted at pm PDT Sunday June BY JENNIFER BJORHUS Mercury News State officials investigating Californias extraordinary energy prices are zeroing in on how energy traders use the technology tools of their profession from email and specialized software to Internet energy data sites and online trading floors This technology may be key they say to helping traders acquire the intimate knowledge needed to manipulate Californias troubled energy market With minutetominute knowledge of market conditions some traders went even further two lawsuits charge illegally coordinating bids and sending electricity prices to recordbreaking levels The state Attorney Generals Office has subpoenaed from power generators software used to formulate bidding strategies names of employees providing computer support communications with a prominent industry Web site and the name of firms that handle computer networks And a state Senate committee has hired an information technology consultant to help them look into how traders tracked patterns on the states Internetbased spot market among other things Once you were knowledgeable about its operations the opportunity to game it became pretty obvious said Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove who chairs the committee Antitrust laws Working together or colluding to fix prices is illegal and violates state and federal antitrust laws Sharing sensitive industry data if it involved financial markets would be considered insider trading and would be treated far differently said Anjali Sheffrin head of market analysis for the Independent System Operator which manages the states power grid The Securities and Exchange Commission polices the nations stock markets but wholesale energy trading goes largely unwatched by federal regulators San Diego attorney Mike Aguirre agreed with Sheffrin Aguirre is part of a team of lawyers who have filed two lawsuits against leading power generators such as Dynegy Duke Energy and Williams Energy Services Its basically an embryonic kind of trading market that involves the sharing of inside information and the only reason theyre getting away with it is theres no SEC cop he said Energy companies dismiss these charges as speculation All of these What ifs said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel The fact of the matter is weve played by the rules weve acted ethically we havent done anything wrong Energy companies say the way they use technology is all above board Thats something that were proud of that we have all of the tools to do the best possible job in the trading said Paula HallCollins spokeswoman for Tulsabased Williams Co Not everyone is persuaded that energy companies actually conspired to hike prices Some public officials and energy industry players call the technology focus a red herring Californias energy problems are far more fundamental they say than clickhappy energy traders with spreadsheets The nowdefunct California Power Exchange for example was something of a sitting duck unable to freely shop around for the best electricity prices Wealth of data Other experts believe the sheer wealth of data floating around from river flows to day forecasts of power line outages gives traders an unfair advantage Thats exactly the issue said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute The issue is whether all this information is actually doing more harm to competition than benefit to the efficiency of procuring and selling power The best illustration of this is a somewhat legendary Web site blunder In that incident an energy industry association called the Western Systems Coordinating Council posted highly sensitive realtime data about transmission of extrahigh voltage electricity in California Alarmed that such information could be used to game the market the states grid operator last October demanded that the trade group take the information off the site which it did A former energy trader who spoke to the Mercury News on the condition that he not be identified said When you can calculate exactly what a market needs and where its surplus is going to come from then you have the ability to essentially fix prices Its like a linear equation You know exactly what the end equation is going to be At issue are how traders employ the tools that like the telephone and fax machine are standard in trading electricity software data Web sites and Internet energy exchanges Dunn and other public officials acknowledge that it isnt clear how technology was used in suspected abuses And no one has turned up slamdunk evidence of collusion The ISO has done extensive studies that conclude traders drove up prices through gaming The high prices have cost the state at least billion since May Energy traders trade information among themselves the ISOs Sheffrin charged comparing it to insidertrading These traders are calling each other up all the time The former energy trader who talked to the Mercury News agreed energy traders as a very incestuous group They talk and email every day Sometimes many many many times a day he said Some of them have instant messaging He said he believes it could amount to de facto collusion But proving collusion in court is extremely difficult The sticking point said UCs Borenstein is showing exactly what energy traders did with the information These guys arent actually sitting down in a room together Borenstein said They sort of watched each other and said Well other firms are keeping capacity out and we will too The former energy trader said he doubted that investigators would prove collusion because traders will cover their tracks Theyre expunging harddrive data as we speak he said The documents are long gone Lawsuits Two classaction lawsuits filed on behalf of taxpayers by San Francisco and by Lt Gov Cruz Bustamante accuse the energy companies of colluding to drive up prices Neither lawsuit clearly documents how the energy companies engaged in secretive datasharing The Bustamante suit however targets a new Internet site for wholesale energy trading launched last fall by heavyhitter energy companies such as Duke and Reliant The Atlantabased Web site IntercontinentalExchange is one of at least a dozen such electronic trading floors that have popped up on the Internet in the last four years None of these trading exchanges which analysts say are the wave of the future are regulated IntercontinentalExchange declined to comment since it is not a party to the suit The lawsuit charges the site has several features that support collusive behavior amongst market participants One is that only approved traders have access to IntercontinentalExchange and those traders can pick who they want to trade with and shut other traders out And more importantly Aguirre said the energy companies who own many of these Web exchanges get the tremendous benefit of having a record of all the trades It gives them an enormous amount of market data that no one else has access to he said Its a conduit for collusion Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at or

more production from heavily polluting peaker facilities By DAN MORAIN Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOGov Gray Davis agreed Monday to lift air emission limits on heavily polluting power plants and allow them to run at capacity this summer as long as the electricity they produce is sold in the state State officials said the plants must be pressed into use to avoid blackouts Davis executive order lets the generators build the cost of air pollution fines into the price the state pays for electricity produced by natural gasfired power plants said Catherine Witherspoon of the California Air Resources Board Municipal utility districtsincluding the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powerand independent power companies could supply as much as megawatts from socalled peaker plants facilities that generally are permitted to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollute so heavily That is enough power for more than million homes Other gasfired power plants that have been shut down because of air pollution restrictions also could be started up as a result of the order In a news conference Monday state officials said the order will have the effect of lowering air pollution by limiting the use of far dirtier diesel generators which industry could use if power supplies are threatened If we dont get every last megawatt we can from natural gasfired plants said Witherspoon of the air board we will see people turning to diesel more frequently Added Kellan Fluckiger a top energy advisor to Davis If you dont run these youre either going to have outages or youre going to run something dirtier Fluckiger said the order expands the number of hours these things can run and the amount of energy they can produce New natural gasfired power plants emit about half a pound per megawatthour of operation of ozoneproducing pollutants The plants affected by the order emit between two and five pounds of oxides of nitrogen per megawatthour If the plants are pressed into operation for megawatthours this summer there will be between and million additional pounds of oxides of nitrogen emitted into the air The state probably will end up paying the fees associated with the extra pollution through higher electricity prices The fees amount to per pound of oxides of nitrogenor million if the plants operate for hoursand per pound of carbon monoxide emissions The money would be used to reduce air pollution from other sources Under this order dirty power plants can run as long as they want and pollute as much as they want so long as they pay into a fund said Gail Ruderman Feuer senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council Our concern is that theres no guarantee that the fund will result in emission reductions any time soon A Ventura County air pollution control official said that running one peaking power plant operated by Reliant Energy for one hour is the equivalent of adding new cars to Ventura County highways for an hour Reliant Energy could not be reached for comment Monday night To the extent that they run when not needed for an emergency its going to put more air pollution into Ventura County skies and its going to make our air dirtier said Dick Baldwin air pollution control officer for Ventura County Los Angeles DWP Director David Wiggs hailed the order saying it was needed so the city can sell the state as much as megawatts of power this summer This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of our excess capacity to the state Wiggs said He added however that the city and state have not yet agreed on a price for the power Wiggs said the city is negotiating to get our cost as low as we can legally charge so that customers of the city utility district are not subsidizing consumers in the rest of the state Municipal utility districts elsewhere in the state also are expected to benefit from the order Though the order was aimed at spurring municipal utilities to sell power to the state it also

Monday We are hopeful and doing lobbying to push for for no action outside of California given the unworkability and meaninglessness of price controls outside of CA This is an effort and not a promise of course Some action in CA seems more than likely and the best bet seem to be extending the current proxy mitigation to all hours The article below raises the possibility of reissuing the refund orders recall that they began in March for the month of January to cover all hours and not just during Stage Such reissued refund order could extend back to Oct Alan Comnes Wednesday June Federal Panel May Extend Price Limits Utilities Regulatory commission weighs expanding the plan beyond emergencies and throughout the West By RICARDO ALONSOZALDIVAR Times Staff Writer WASHINGTONThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission responding to pressure from lawmakers state officials and consumers is considering a significant expansion of its plan to limit California electricity prices this summer senior agency officials said Tuesday Commissioners and staff members are engaged in intense negotiations in advance of a key meeting Monday to finalize an emergency plan for California and the West According to several commission officials the options being discussed include Extending FERCs current price limitsnow in effect only during power emergencies in Californiato hours a day seven days a week The limits intended to prevent price spikes were invoked during two emergencies last month and resulted in immediate cuts in the price of wholesale electricity FERC is also considering applying such limits throughout the West Requiring power generators in the entire Western region to sell available electricity to California or into their local power grids during emergencies reducing the threat of blackouts Establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell electricity back into the grid during peak usage times Some companies that have longterm power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by scaling back their operations and selling electricity Tightening rules on what energy marketersfirms that buy and resell power contracts much like stockbrokers trade sharescan charge for their electricity Expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies That refund order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies The measures under consideration stop short of the price caps being sought by Gov Gray Davis and California Democrats But they may go far enough to provide an acceptable compromise The whole thing is in flux but it is moving toward a much more effective price mitigation plan not only for California but for the West said an agency official Strong political pressure from Senate Democrats and House Republicans appears to have galvanized FERC into taking a more decisive role Were sort of the last to get it the official said FERC has been bitterly criticized by Davis for abandoning California FERC Chairman Curtis L Hebert Jr has responded by citing dozens of modest FERC actions to assist the state But Hebert has resisted Davis central demand that FERC use its legal authority to order a temporary return to fixed electricity rates Such fixed rates based on the cost of producing power plus an allowance for profit were standard before deregulation The politics of the situation have changed significantly and commissioners are not immune to politics said another senior agency official The message from Capitol Hill has gotten stronger with a Democratic Senate Even the Bush administration is saying we should make sure there is no price gouging FERC members have been summoned to testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen Joseph I Lieberman DConn a week from today Meanwhile Sen Jeff Bingaman DNM the new Senate Energy Committee chairman has told FERC he will move legislation to cap electricity rates in the West unless it acts soon Agency officials said commissioners do not want to face Lieberman next week emptyhanded House Republicans have also been prodding the agency On Tuesday Energy Committee Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin RLa wrote Hebert to urge Westernwide roundtheclock price limits We strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council wrote Tauzin referring to the Western power grid FERC officials said a strong effort is underway to achieve a consensus on the fivemember commission lately riven by ideology but now bolstered by two new pragmatic commissioners who favor active oversight of industry Commissioner William Massey who for months has been a lonely dissenter is continuing to press for the traditional price caps sought by Davis officials said Once marginalized Massey apparently is now being actively wooed by the other members S David Freeman an energy advisor to Gov Davis said Tuesday that expanding FERCs current price limits would be a positive step But he added that the governor continues to advocate a return to traditional fixed rates Any strengthening of the FERC plan is in the public interest Freeman told reporters at a Washington news conference FERCs price limits are not keyed to a particular dollar amount but are flexible When a power emergency is called by the state FERCs plan limits the price that generators can charge to what it costs to produce power at the least efficient plant running at that time The costs of all the plants are determined beforehand by Californias grid operator based on data filed by the generators Another requirement of the FERC plan forces generators using the California grid to sell any power they have available during emergency conditions When the price limits were tested in two emergencies late last month prices came down quickly But power sellers complained that the limits were too strict And by the second emergency there was evidence that some sellers had started finding ways around the limits Copyright Los Angeles Times

the ir orginal offset NOx quantities Alan Comnes Original Message From Schoen Mary Sent Monday June PM To Comnes Alan Cc Guerrero Janel Subject Re FW Davis Eases Power Plant Pollution Rules The following is more explanation about the recent Executive Order EO signed by the Governor of California on June In order to avoid future blackouts Governor Gray Davis is waiving limits on hours of operati on and the associated emissions for natural gasfired peaker units if they adhere to certain conditions He is requesting local air districts to allo w natural gasfired peaker power plants to operate in excess of their hourly daily quarterly andor annual emission limitations if they do the followin g Agree to sell power to the California Department of Water Resources or t o a utility located in California To serve an operating utilitys own load Agree to sell to another Californiabased utility The gasfired peaker units must also pay a mitigation fee to the local air districts of per pound of oxides of nitrogen NOx and per poun d of carbon monoxide CO emitted The Governor set this number it is however the same amount the South Coast AQMD is charging for NOx offsets i n the modifications it made to the RECLAIM program These mitigation fees wi ll be used to clean up or retire other sources of pollution in the same air basin The Governor is ordering the California Air Resources Board to work with the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that power plants willin g to operate under this order obtain the necessary approvals As you know there are many peaking plants that are close to exhausting the ir allowable operating hours Once these facilities exhaust the amount of allowable hours they would have to either shut down the units or negotiate an agreement with the local air agency to continue to operate With the exception of Mirant Potrero in San Francisco and Reliant Energy Mandalay in Ventura County no facilities have negotiated such agreements The EO issu ed by the Governor gives the peaker facilities a blanket approval to operate beyond the restrictions The Governor believes that waiving of the requirements will also minimize reliance on backup dieselfired generators which have even higher emissions than the natural gas peakers In my previous discussions with the US EPA Region they did say they were willi ng to work with the state to provide variances to power plants operating limits However in the two instances mentioned above the EPA required t he plants to agree to install pollution control equipment at a specific future date This aspect of the agreement was critical to EPA because the increased emissions from the peakers with increased hours are now significa nt enough major source status to trigger New Source Review which requires installation of Best Available Control Technology BACT The EO by the Governor makes no mention of future controls According to municipal utilities and other generators the Governors actio n could provide up to Megawatts of additional power this summer by expanding the number of hours of operation at natural gasfired plants T he EO will expire on October unless revoked modified or extended by further executive order The air director of the Ventura air board has already sent comments opposing this order due to its negative air impacts Environmentalists will also no doubt object The EPA has not yet responded Despite the potential negative environmental effects the political pressur e will be strong to let these plants operate I will keep my ears open for additional

Subject Davis Eases Power Plant Pollution Rules Tuesday June Davis Eases Power Plant Pollution Rules Electricity Order will allow more production from heavily polluting peaker facilities By DAN MORAIN Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOGov Gray Davis agreed Monday to lift air emission limits on heavily polluting power plants and allow them to run at capacity this summe r as long as the electricity they produce is sold in the state State officials said the plants must be pressed into use to avoid blackouts Davis executive order lets the generators build the cost of air pollution fines into the price the state pays for electricity produced by natural gasfired power plants said Catherine Witherspoon of the Californi a Air Resources Board Municipal utility districtsincluding the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powerand independent power companies could supply as much as megawatts from socalled peaker plants facilities that generally are permitted to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollu te so heavily That is enough power for more than million homes Other gasfired power plants that have been shut down because of air pollution restrictions also could be started up as a result of the order In a news conference Monday state officials said the order will have the effect of lowering air pollution by limiting the use of far dirtier diesel generators which industry could use if power supplies are threatene d If we dont get every last megawatt we can from natural gasfired plants said Witherspoon of the air board we will see people turning to diesel more frequently Added Kellan Fluckiger a top energy advisor to Davis If you dont r un these youre either going to have outages or youre going to run something dirtier Fluckiger said the order expands the number of hours these things can run and the amount of energy they can produce New natural gasfired power plants emit about half a pound per megawatthour of operation of ozoneproducing pollutants The plants affect ed by the order emit between two and five pounds of oxides of nitrogen per megawatthour If the plants are pressed into operation for megawatthours th is summer there will be between and million additional pounds of oxides of nitrogen emitted into the air The state probably will end up paying the fees associated with the ext ra pollution through higher electricity prices The fees amount to per pound of oxides of nitrogenor million if the plants operate for hoursand per pound of carbon monoxide emissions The money would be used to reduce air pollution from other sources Under this order dirty power plants can run as long as they want and pollute as much as they want so long as they pay into a fund said Gail Ruderman Feuer senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council Our concern is that theres no guarantee that the fund will result in emission reductions any time soon A Ventura County air pollution control official said that running one peaking power plant operated by Reliant Energy for one hour is the equivale nt of adding new cars to Ventura County highways for an hour Reliant Energy could not be reached for comment Monday night To the extent that they run when not needed for an emergency its going to put more air pollution into Ventura County skies and its going to make our air dirtier said Dick Baldwin air pollution control officer for Ventura County Los Angeles DWP Director David Wiggs hailed the order saying it was needed so the city can sell the state as much as megawatts of power this summer This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of our excess capacity to the state Wiggs said He added however that the city and state have not yet agreed on a price for the power Wiggs said the city is negotiating to get our cost as low as we can legally charge so that customers of the city utility distric t are not subsidizing consumers in the rest of the state Municipal utility districts elsewhere in the state also are expected to benefit from the orde r Though the order was aimed at spurring municipal utilities to sell pow er to the state it also applies to independent power producers such as Relian t Energy of Houston and Duke of North Carolinaboth of which have called on Davis to ease air pollution restrictions on their old natural gasfired facilities This puts more money in the Texans pockets

marketers cannot sell above cap and generators must be subject to cost filings if they do and the result is black outs Alan Tuesday July Copyright Las Vegas ReviewJournal POWER SHORTAGES LV valley endures blackouts Utility officials expect supplies to stay tight as hot weather continues this week By JOHN G EDWARDS REVIEWJOURNAL The first rolling blackouts in Southern Nevada history hit the Las Vegas Valley on Monday with a speed that surprised even Nevada Power Co The utility company declared a red alert and initiated rolling blackouts that left an estimated customers without power It had reported customers were affected but later revised the number of customers who lost electricity The blackouts started at pm and ended at pm the utility said Nevada Power attributed the power shortages to several factors unusually high temperatures for this time of year three generation unit outages the areas rapid growth power shortages in California and possibly the wholesale power price caps that federal regulators imposed last month What killed us was the temperature was unbelievable said Paul Heagan vice president of Sierra Pacific Resources the holding company for Nevada Power The Las Vegas temperature soared to a nearrecord degrees As for the rest of the week power supply is going to be tight Heagan said The prospects this week are kind of tough to call The company logged record demand for power megawatts at pm Monday The previous alltime high was megawatts on Aug A megawatt is roughly the amount of power needed to supply houses By contrast on July last year the utility hit megawatts when the temperature was degrees Heagan said The company targeted nonemergency areas for Mondays rolling blackouts which affected mostly residential customers Nevada Power spokesmen declined to identify the affected areas even after the emergency was over Witnesses said power went out in one area of the Northwest and one area of the east valley Electricity customers in the affected areas said the blackouts lasted between and minutes Several traffic signals went out including those at the intersections of Buffalo Drive and Lake Mead Boulevard Tenaya Way and Lake Mead and Boulder Highway at US Highway Las Vegas Police Department officials reported few traffic problems because of the blackouts For the most part people reported few problems We only had a few customers and we couldnt do Western Union transactions without a computer but with the other customers we just winged it said Michelle Hitt a customer service representative at Mail Boxes Etc W Lake Mead Blvd Hitt said power at his store was out about minutes Across the street an assistant manager for the Vons supermarket at W Lake Mead Blvd said customers could not check out when the stores power turned off The Roadhouse Grill at Lake Mead Boulevard and Tenaya Way was shut down for about minutes shortly after pm restaurant manager Kim Tuerk said We had to evacuate the building because of health department and fire codes but it was no big deal he said Heagan said Nevada Power will start its rolling blackouts in other areas of the valley if it needs to cut power again this week The utilitys policy calls for no notification to areas that will lose power unlike California where a minimum of hours notice is required Nevada Power fears that notification would be used by burglars to locate unoccupied houses during the emergency Tim Hay state consumer advocate said he thinks customers in affected areas should be notified of possible outages They need to provide notice to affected areas at least in general areas to help people prepare Hay said Elsewhere in the valley consumers and businesses continued operating normally during the emergency Meadows mall General Manager Frank Wheat said power was not affected at the shopping center We know rolling blackouts can occur he said We do have backup generators for emergency lighting during hours of darkness but not for all the stores Spokespeople at University Medical Center and Sunrise Hospital also said they were not affected by Mondays blackouts and have their own backup power supplies Minta Albietz vice president of maternalchild services at Sunrise We have our own little power plant in the back We can generate our own power for days longer as long as we have fuel The company said its power woes began Friday when it internally declared a yellow alert and warned employees that it was running short of power Heagan said On Friday Nevada Power customers were pulling down megawatts the second or thirdhighest peak in the company history he said Meanwhile one of Nevada Powers electrical generation units at the Reid Gardner site miles north of Las Vegas has been down since Friday because of a leaking boiler he said Also Southern California Edison which operates the Mohave Generating Station at Laughlin for several utilities notified the company Friday that two of Nevada Powers units were down Nevada Power said it was able to obtain additional power on the spot market and avoid blackouts last week and did not need to seek any power use curtailment by major users The yellow alert continued through the weekend a period when electric consumption usually declines because businesses are closed and many people are driving around The company made arrangements to buy another megawatts of electricity Monday when most businesses reopened That got eaten up by early afternoon Heagan said The utility said casinos reduced about megawatts by switching to backup generators and starting conservation measures But several Strip casino operators said they received no requests to conserve power or to turn on their backup generation units Nevada Power hasnt asked us to shed power load said Debbie Munch Park Place Entertainment spokeswoman They asked us to cut our power usage a couple of times last summer and we did so If they do ask us well do what we can to help the community Mandalay Resort Group and MGM Mirage executives said they were not asked to cut their power use Monday Our facilities guys said nobodys asked us for anything and we havent done anything said Fred Lewis Aladdin spokesman At first glance it appears the problem was handled very well said Don Soderberg chairman of the Public Utilities Commission which regulates Nevada Power Its always hard to predict when were going to have abnormal temperatures and power plants are going to go offline Soderberg said The situation he added underlines the need to build more power plants Mondays degree high was one degree shy of the record for the date The heat follows the warmest May on record said Joe Nemeth a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service Temperatures are expected to stay warm but tapering off as the week progresses and the risk for thunderstorms increases meteorologists reported Highs will stay in the tripledigit range but drop to degrees today on Wednesday on Thursday and on Friday A less than percent chance for rain exists today a chance that increases to percent Wednesday Forecasters expect a to percent chance of rain the rest of the week This story is located at

salary goes to consultant with one years experience in the field State officials say she is doing a good job By JEFFREY L RABIN DARYL KELLEY Times Staff Writers The Davis administration is paying a young business consultant with barely a years experience in the energy industry annually to head a team of traders who secure Californias daily electricity supply State officials hired Susan T Lee in April without competitive bidding under an emergency declaration by Gov Gray Davis Lees contract is equal to the a month that Davis pays his chief energy advisor S David Freeman a top utility executive for decades The twoyear contract will pay Lee up to to oversee the states daytoday energy purchases totaling billions of dollars a year Lees contract reflects the pressure and difficulties the state says it faces to fill key jobs in its new role as one of the nations largest power buyers a role that it took on in January as Californias utilities faltered Lees contract was one of about a dozen released Monday and among the largest Reached at her Sacramento office Lee would not discuss her contract She said only that she heads a person team of traders and schedulers that works long hours to keep Californias power flowing Pete Garris a contracts manager for the state Department of Water Resources who recruited Lee said he met her at industry meetings and had been impressed by her savvy He said he gave her a pay raise to lure her to state service in April after Ron Shimizu her boss at Mieco Inc a trading firm in Long Beach recommended her Shimizu refused comment Tuesday The state according to Garris must compete for employees against an aggressive energy industry and pay good salaries to stay in the game You can consider this situation to be very extraordinary Garris said Unless we can get permanent and fulltime positions approved these are the rules we have to follow to be able to hire consultants Garris insisted that it is unfair to compare Lees contract with the sixmonth deal that Freemanthe former boss at several major utilitiesstruck with the governor I dont want to compare Susan Lee to David Freeman Garris said David comes from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Susan came from a private power marketer With Susan we just followed the standard formula In her new job Lee will direct an immensely complicated aroundtheclock operation responsible for procuring energy scheduling power and associated transmission and reconciling deviations between contracts and deliveries according to her contract Lees resume attached to the contract shows that she had no experience in the energy field until March when she joined Mieco There she was a trader and power scheduler not a manager She was only here for a year or so said Dina Alvarez an administrative manager for the company A graduate of UCLA with a degree in economics she worked as a pension and benefits manager in Los Angeles and New York before joining Mieco Lees contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week not only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field She is being paid an hour and can earn a maximum of including expenses by April Another new consultant William L Green has almost a quarter of a century of experience working for the Bonneville Power Administration Pacific Gas Electric and the California Independent System Operator He is being paid an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the states accounting of energy purchases His twoyear deal is worth up to They are not alone in cutting lucrative deals Richard Ferreira the former assistant general manager at the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District has a contract and is being paid an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts He worked for the Department of Water Resources for years before joining the Sacramento agency in Hardy Energy Consulting also has a sixmonth contract that calls for Randy Harvey to be paid an hour Harvey has a quarter of a century of energy experience particularly at the Bonneville Power Administration where he was chief executive officer from to Lees recruiter Garris said her lack of experience is not a concern So far shes done an excellent job he said She has the skills and she has the ability She was doing a similar job Dozens of consultants including Lee have been hired since January when Davis declared an energy emergency and set up a special arm of government to buy power The state filled a vacuum when generators refused to sell to PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric because they were no longer considered creditworthy said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the Department of Water Resources Hidalgo said that about of the people now working for the division are consultants The rest are state employees As part of the process Lees unit oversees the purchase of power a day ahead of when it is needed Hidalgo said Lee is involved in contracts that extend no more than three months Copyright Los Angeles Times

Original Message From Onukogu Ernest ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESOnukoguCErnestCErnestEOnukogudowjones EcomE NRONcom Sent Friday July PM To undisclosedrecipientsENRON Subject POWER POINTSNevada Suffers FERC Unintended Consequences POWER POINTSNevada Suffers FERC Unintended Consequences By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesThose who have opposed wholesale electricity price controls have been labeled as extreme freemarket ideologues who are insensitive to the practical impacts on peoples lives of high electricity prices But the most common argument against price caps has been logical not ideological Price controls have never worked Market participants always find a way around the rules This week the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decided that it will have to consider at its meeting next week revisions to its June price control ruling The initial price cap rule set by the California Independent System Operator last spring was only a few paragraphs long Each successive price cap order has gotten longer though effectiveness still appears out of reach The FERCs April order was pages long the June order was pages And now additional rules are on call to plug the new loopholes The revisions will also try to repair damage done to the market by the June order During a spell of very hot weather Monday Sierra Pacific Resources SRP subsidiary Nevada Power had to initiate limited rolling blackouts to a small number of customers for minutes The company attributed the blackouts in part to the new price controls Sierra Pacifics chief spokesman Paul Heagen provided a birds eye view of the practical realities of the FERCs new price cap regime Power Points After having a few days to look into it can you say that price caps definitely contributed to blackouts in Nevada on Monday Paul Heagen Yes but first let me say that all of it was unintentional FERC was trying to do the right thing Price caps were a noble effort to solve a real problem in California But on Monday the market needed speed and clarity to function It had neither and that can be attributed to the price caps Normally in one or two phone calls we could have got what we needed On Monday we were five to six calls into it and still on the phone Price caps are having the unintended consequence of dragging other states into the California morass We have this artificial environment which we are all trying to sort through PP How specifically are the caps having this effect PH There are a couple of elements The premium for power sold to California is supposed to reflect concerns about credit That in an open market is no big deal but in a constrained situation the seller will grab it because now its his only chance to make money Also the way this is set up they look backwards They determine the price after the fact I cant think of any business in the world where you sell a product and find out later what price you sold at This had a very chilling effect on peoples willingness to sell Normally a cloud cover comes in and a utility has a little extra power to sell in the realtime market Normally those little megawatt packets move pretty easily and thats really important for maintaining reliability With the price cap utilities hunkered down Selling at wasnt worth the risk They figured they might as well hang on in case they needed it Also we have a voluntary curtailment program that allows us to share savings with customers who agree to curtail use If the market is say we might pay them MWh to curtail demand But in a mkt we can offer them such a small amount of money that they stay on PP Have you talked to FERC about these problems with the price controls PH Weve had a senior team in Washington DC at the FERC since last week Right away we saw another effect of the FERC order It penalizes companies like ours that signed longterm supply contracts before the order because many of those deals were done at prices above the price cap The biggest issue for us is did FERC really mean to penalize companies like us that planned ahead Its longterm contracts that provide price stability Its unfair to our customers to expect them to pay for longterm contracts that have been undercut by price caps If we get into a situation where we have a little extra to sell now we cant recover our costs PP With such high prices the past year a lot of small oilfired turbines have been dusted off and put into service on time for this summer Traders for other southwest utilities have said that all these little turbines have been very helpful when supplies got tight earlier in the year but they werent available this week because they cost more to run than the price cap Did you see the same thing PH We have some small turbines that we put in Reno and the Lake Tahoe area in the last few months They were supposed to provide peak power but they get uneconomic in a hurry under the price cap scheme You know weve tried to isolate ourselves as best we could from the California situation and behave very independent of how California behaves So Nevada is a great test case to see if price caps have an unintended effect outside of California We were able to minimize the impact on our customers Monday but the situation has maximized the attention of the country on the impact of price caps By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END DOW JONES NEWS PM PM EDT

California from a generator whose stock they owned setting up a clash of official duties personal interestsof the people fired disclosed below State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics The consultants were involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock they owned setting up a clash of official duties personal interests JEFFREY L RABIN DARYL KELLEY RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company The Davis administration stung by charges of excessive secrecy disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit according to state records All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned In addition the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled Top advisors to Gov Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements A review of those documents which included stock holdings showed that some of the consultants may have crossed the line said the governors senior advisor Nancy McFadden State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence the governor has not required some of his most influential privatesector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governors energy rescue plan which includes the largest state bond sale in US history The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid a month to among other things help pitch the billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers The companies stand to make an additional million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines Davis contends that Fichera Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor beyond the reach of the states political reform laws Critics question the distinction The governors approach may be convenient for him said Jim Knox executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause but it ignores the law Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest Knox said Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year More than million is being spent by the state on consultants according to state records In the process seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances including investments The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within days of starting work for state agencies Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted Most of the consultants for example failed to state when they bought the energy stocks One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year Jones has accused the governor of a conscious policy of secrecy in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp a San Josebased power generator that has landed the largest share of the billion in longterm state power contracts Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than records show While working for the state Department of Water Resources officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the states behalf More than million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year according to the most recent records available We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks the governors legal affairs secretary Barry Goode said in an interview The highestranking consultant removed Richard Ferreira was hired on a contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for longterm power and negotiating contracts records show A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Ferreira was paid an hour by the state After he disclosed owning as much as in Calpine stock officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the companys contracts Ferreira could not be reached for comment The governors office identified the other four as traders William F Mead Herman Leung Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange a nowdefunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of Californias electricity deregulation Hired by the state in February and March the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between and a month including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California Mead a former Edison engineer said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago He said he bought nearly all of his shares years ago for and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times doubling in value each time Mead said he was called by the head of the states energy buying team Thursday and fired I asked very directly Is this because of the stock and they wouldnt give me an answer Mead said He just said your services are terminated I came up here away from home living in a hotel room trying to keep the lights on trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if Im some sort of criminal I guess its just politics and were the pawns Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state That trader Elaine Griffin who also came from the Power Exchange left the state power buying operation July three days after disclosing her energy industry investment Griffin who the governors office said had obtained another job could not be reached for comment Griffin reported purchasing to of Calpine stock on Feb in her final days working at the electricity exchange A few days later Calpine signed and announced a billion year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources On Feb Griffin joined the state power buying agency just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional billion in power contracts One of those a year deal signed Feb was the longest The state has awarded Calpine about billion in contracts to supply power for up to years In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock two others reported owning stock in Texasbased power marketing giant Enron Corp And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation Bernard Barretto an energy trader who buys energy on the daily spot market said in an interview that he bought about in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb Purchase of Enron Stock Defended I dont see a conflict he said At the time we werent really dealing with Enron I still havent bought from Enron Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job That notice came from Goode the governors lawyer We expect and have always expected the states consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards he wrote That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today If he or she refuses the state will sever its contract with that person However the governors office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors Fichera and Hoffman Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors not consultants and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects Fichera is Davis point man on the governors energy rescue planincluding the unprecedented bond sale He has pitched the plan to lawmakers reporters and the Wall Street financial community Fichera refused to comment on the record Fichera and Hoffmans companies Saber Partners and Blackstone Group prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure intended to pay for past and future power buying Pact Specifies Financial Advice The states contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide financial advisory services to the state The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates That consulting firm was hired on a million contract Like the other two firms it too was hired to provide financial advisory services to the state That firms top advisor Douglas S Montague was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement He reported no power company interests The governors legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract PHOTO Barry Goode above governors legal affairs secretary Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights

December Honorable James Hoecker Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC Dear Chairman Hoecker I told you on November in San Diego that by December I would respond to your plan with my suggestions to protect the interests of the people and businesses of California by providing reliable electricity supplies at the lowest reasonable cost Obviously a complete plan by the State of Californ ia must await your review of my suggested changes to your proposed order and final action on that order on December This letter outlines the first steps toward a plan that my administration is developing based on extensive ongoing discussions with legislative leaders consumers business utilitie s generators environmentalists labor agricultural interests and other California stakeholders This emerging plan will indicate to you that I am prepared to act with the concurrence of the Legislature in California to fulfill our obligations to assure reliable service at reasonable costs to the consumer The free market applied to electricity can work but only if market conditions allow for real competition and if all parties act responsibly The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has found that the wholesal e market in California is dysfunctional and that the wholesale prices charged by generators in your jurisdiction are unjust and unreasonable For that reason I renew my call for the FERC to undertake the actions that are critical and clearly within your jurisdiction to order retroactiv e refunds to the consumers who have been harmed this year and to establish hard price and bid caps that will protect consumers until the energy marketplace becomes truly competitive I do not believe that your proposed MW clearing price limit will provide any real protection I again ask you to impose real price and bid caps in the MW range on a transitiona l basis over the next months If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale markets the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited in scope I cannot in good conscience however forego any measure that wou ld serve to protect the people of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale markets will not victimize Californians again Since our meeting in San Diego several things have occurred which influenc e my current thinking On November the California Energy Commission CEC published the results of a detailed bottomup study of available electricity supply for It shows that taking into account expected load growth firm and dynamically scheduled imports and new supply already under construction or under contract California should be able to avoid emergencies if supplie s are properly managed and scheduled This presumes of course no gaming or withholding by sellers in wholesale markets and an absence of panic buying But the CEC study also shows that supplies are sufficiently tight that mark et power will exist and will need to be mitigated during periods of high deman d The same opportunity for wholesale price gouging through the exercise of market power and withholding that existed in summer will exist in You must take decisive action to preclude such behavior During the week of November while you and regulatory commissioners from around the country were in San Diego California was subjected to several Stage Alerts reflecting severe shortages of generation even though these are the lowest load months of the year Prices were astronomical More than megawatts of generation were offline at the same time including over megawatts for unscheduled outages I will recommend steps to assure that existing resources in California are availab le to meet Californias local energy needs and that information and the authority necessary to prevent a recurrence of such events are available to state and local officials On November the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and Electricity Oversight Board EOB filed comments with you that summarize th e current status of their ongoing investigations They confirm the conclusion s of the independent market monitors that California has been victimized by t he exercise of market power by merchant generators and marketers during summer and fall The state agencies have been hampered in their investigation s by the refusal of merchant generators to provide information that will both assist in the understanding of last summers prices and in the fashionin g of remedies to assure that we are not victimized again I urge you to compel t he necessary disclosure of information to complete these investigations On November the CPUC issued an Environmental Impact Report EIR on the proposal by PGE to move its hydroelectric facilities out of the regulated utility The EIR concludes that such a project would cause significant unmitigated harm to the environment and recommends retention as the preferr ed alternative This suggests that Californias course of generation divest iture by utilities may be slowed or stopped With these events as background I want to describe the steps I have taken and plan to take to begin to address the energy problems in California Increase Supply and Expand Infrastructure During the years preceding my administration virtually no power plants were built in California Since April six power plants representing MW of new generation have been approved by the CEC Five of these plants are under construction and the sixth will begin construction no later than April Twenty more applicants have completed prefiling and have active applications under review by the commission staff Eleven more applications are in the prefiling stage This represents a significant change in policy and performance and responds to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and environmental protection Much has been made about the difficulty of siting and permitting generation in California With enactment of AB and the creation of the Governor s Clean Energy Green Team this September California has aggressively committ ed itself to continue to accelerate the siting and permitting of generation an d to coordinate local state and federal government agency review and action Federal and state air quality requirements present unique challenges to the construction and operation of new power plants Through the Green Team we are developing new and creative approaches to meet these challenges workin g with local air quality districts the California Air Resources Board and th e United States Environmental Protection Agency These might for example expand upon the case of the proposed Otay Mesa power plant where mobile emissions credits are being used to offset stationary source emissions that will be generated by the new facility If necessary I will seek legislatio n to enable these new approaches I am also calling on the CPUC to aggressively reduce barriers and to otherwise encourage the locating of distributed generation and cogeneratio n where it is viable cost effective and environmentally sound The CPUC has already initiated action that will provide a forum for expediting certificates for transmission facilities including environmental review Finally I believe it is important to assure that all supplies of electrici ty are available when emergency conditions exist to avoid interruptions such as those experienced last summer and as recently as last week Suggestions we are considering for achieving this include new means of coordinating powerplant maintenance and operations activities Forward Contracting by Utilities Many parties including the FERC have recommended expanding the use of forward contracting by the utilities including multiyear bilateral contracts as a way of reducing exposure to volatile spot market prices The contracts as a part of a larger utility energy portfolio represent an important tool to moderate price volatility and ensure reliability I am asking the CPUC to expeditiously develop benchmarks to assure the reasonableness of these contracts without unfairly second guessing these decisions in later years This process should be in place early in to provide adequate opportuni ty for contracts to be negotiated and in place before Summer Coupled with the forward contracting issue is the question of the obligatio n of utilities to buy and sell all of their electricity through the Californi a Power Exchange PX This issue requires careful consideration since these transactions through the PX are currently subject to full disclosure and safeguards are in place to assure delivery These protections for consumers and business must not be lost Among the suggestions that have been made to ensure that utilities have a costeffective portfolio of energy is the proposal that utilities retain their existing generation as was recommended in the CPUCs environmental impact report regarding PGEs hydroelectric facilities There is growing consensus around this matter I would hope that the paramount objective in this series of regulatory decisions will be the protection of the interests of consumers Invigorating the Demand Side Conservation and efficiency are the cornerstones of Californias energy future Under my Executive Order the State of California has achieved more than MW of load reduction earlier this year during Stage alerts and is moving quickly to add another MW of demand reduction for summer The federal government is following suit for federal facilities The state and federal governments should set an example for similar voluntary load reduction initiatives in the private sector I was pleased to work with the California Grocers Association this summer t o develop a voluntary percent demand reduction program during peak hours f or more than groceries statewide This program must be duplicated in oth er areas where feasible and the business community in California has pledged t o work cooperatively toward that end I am calling on the CPUC to expedite its investigation of the states de mand reduction programs for commercial and industrial users including the interruptible programs Those that are successful should be expanded Those that require change should be modified And new opportunities should be developed to reduce and shift loads during peak hours and short supply The se programs must be in place no later than March to provide adequate opportunity for private sector planning and participation I am also calling on the CPUC and CEC to coordinate efforts to demonstrate and implement programs which provide realtime price signals and energyreduction systems to sophisticated commercial electricity users and to recommend a process for voluntary participation by consumers and small businesses In September I signed historic urgency legislation that provides milli on for demand reduction programs that can be implemented by Summer I als o signed legislation that provides approximately million annually for th e next years for energy efficiency research and development and renewable resource support The CPUC and CEC are aggressively pursuing innovative demand reduction programs using these funds Institutional Reform As I testified at the FERC hearing on November I agree that the stakeholder boards of the California Independent System Operator CAISO an d California Power Exchange present inherent conflicts of interest for their members and must be replaced The composition of these boards is specified by state law both as to size and as to qualifications for directors I will propose legislation to replace the stakeholder boards with independe nt boards that are accountable for their actions and that will consider both the need to assure reliability and the most economic method to do so I intend to move quickly on this aspect of the problem Your concurrence in this effort is extremely important It will little serve the consumers utilities merchant generators or other parties to become embroiled in litigation over exactly what powers Congress conferred on the FERC in or what traditional state powers if any Congress meant to circumscribe or override Recognizing that there may be a need for more extensive reconstitution of these entities as some have suggested I do not intend to let the status q uo continue while those debates are carried on California will alter the composition and membership of the boards so that the entities are in positi on to contribute to achieving the paramount objectives of both state and feder al law protection of the consumers interests In Governor Pete Wilson and his CPUC reposed a great deal of trust in the FERC in moving Californias electricity system into an unbundled federalized mode Now is the time for you to justify that trust I want to cooperate with you in transitioning to a marketbased approach to provide this essential service However first and foremost I want you to do your job and to let me do mine Together we can protect the electricity consumer s of California and work to restore their confidence Sincerely GRAY DAVIS

rterHaddencom AM To Roger illiamscom cc Subject From Todays Electricity Daily Has FERC Gone Far Enough in California The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission isnt going far enough in its attempt to reform the California wholesale electric market according to a paper by three prominent economists done for San Diego Gas and Electric The paper by John D Chandley Scott M Harvey and William W Hogan argues that FERC should first end the artificial separation that divides the California Power Exchange and the California Independent System Operator rather than worrying about the governance of the two institutions The change in governance may help says the paper Electricity Market Reform in California but it is not likely to be decisive in the near term Explicit guidance from the commission regarding the nature and trajectory of reforms will be essential if market reform is to be accomplished within an acceptable time frame Hogan of the Kennedy School of Government has been writing since in opposition to Californias market separation Also argues the paper freeing the California utilities to engage in forward contracting is no panacea The expectation that merely allowing utilities to participate in forward contracting necessarily would be the solution to high prices is problematic and not supported by the commissions staff report says the analysis adding that putting pressure on buyers to sign contracts in the present environment may make things worse If the underlying problem in California is high cost and low capacity requiring forward contracting could harm not only California but also the entire Western US electric system FERCs socalled soft cap is a wild card that has the three economists scratching their heads It does not appear in the staff report and there is little critical analysis of their implications other than the discussion of Commissioner Curt Hebert If the intent of the soft cap is to move toward cost justification for bids above MWh then FERC is headed into an administrative morass that would rival those under wellhead price controls in the natural gas industry If on the other hand the soft cap is truly soft and would only require some paper work at FERC and the possibility of a refund if the price is eventually deemed not just and reasonable there might be little impact on consumer prices particularly if the principal sources of those high prices are high costs and regional capacity shortages rather than the exercise of market power Even so the proposal might serve to deter entry and new investments thus combining the worst of both worlds high consumer prices and little or no new investment FERCs proposed order in California also demonstrates confusion about just what constitutes market power The paper cites the proposed orders lawyerly obfuscatory conclusion that while this record does not support findings of specific exercises of market power and while we are not able to reach definite conclusions about the actions of individual sellers there is clear evidence that in California market structure and rules provide the opportunity for sellers to exercise market power when supply is tight and can result in unjust and unreasonable rates under the Federal Power Act The economists note In this regard the debate is confused because we are dancing around the words where the truth may be hard to face In the case of California say the economists there is no evidence of market power Even the practice of generators avoiding the dayahead market in favor of the realtime market is a response to bad market design and pricing incentives including price caps but does not demonstrate the exercise of market power Nor is bidding above marginal cost necessarily an exercise of market power they add The distinction between direct marginal cost and opportunity cost is sometimes lost in the discussion Hence a competitive bidder whose direct cost of generation is but who could sell the same energy outside California for should bid no less than This would not be an exercise of market power

Golden Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones When marketsavvy energy companies like Enron Calpine and Dynegy are selling like crazy that might be a sign its not a good time to buy Nevertheless the state of California is signing contracts for billion worth of power under supply deals stretching up to years Some industry experts say these contracts could be overpriced by billions of dollars in a matter of months Whats more deliveries for most of the supplies already signed for wont begin until after this summer which is likely when the power will be needed most The state should be involved in portfolio contracts to stabilize costs but signing year and year contracts is inappropriate said Michael Zenker director of western energy consulting services at Cambridge Energy Research Associates That could end up locking consumers into higher rates for many years to come The near bankruptcy of Californias two largest utilities has forced the state to step heavily into the power markets The states idea behind signing longterm contracts is to stabilize its power costs by spreading them out said Vikram Budhraja whose company Electric Power Group is advising the state on the contracts What we set out to do is get California out of the spot market bring stability to the market and get dependable supplies Budhraja said We believe we have done that But some said California could find cheaper prices for forward power if it waits Power prices will continue to be very volatile for the next months to months but the price of power for delivery in and beyond is likely to begin falling at the end of this summer said Gerald Keenan a senior partner for PricewaterhouseCoopers utility consulting group The best approach now is to sign contracts covering just a few months or years he said Its not a good bet that gas prices will stay high for such a long time he said And very little of that power will be delivered this summer anyway This week California Gov Gray Davis said the state has nailed down about megawatts for the summer more than half the difference between generation already controlled by the utilities and the projected peak demand on a very hot day But contract details released by Calpine Corp CPN Dynegy Inc DYN Duke Energy DUK and Williams Companies WMB belie the governors claim According to press releases from those generators only MW of the power theyre selling will be available this summer Not everyone agrees the state has overpaid To head off a meltdown independent power companies in California are giving the state prices slightly below the current forward market said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum These are probably good deals said Ackerman who added that potential outofstate suppliers are seeking higher prices because they dont have the same political motivation Never guess at what prices are going to do They can always go higher Still Californias inability to find much power for this summer means that the states imbalance between supply and demand will have to be solved in the near term on the demand side according to one perspective Once demand falls whether through higher prices voluntary conservation involuntary blackouts or even a recession forward electricity prices in California could come crashing down Davis has proposed conservation plans that he says will reduce electricity consumption by from expected levels this summer As part of the conservation program Davis wants to install new realtime meters before summer at industrial and commercial customers which will then get some market prices for their power and would be motivated to reduce consumption during peakuse hours The current forward market reflects a skepticism that the meters and other conservation efforts will be anywhere near as effective this summer as the governor says But some industry experts say the realtime meters alone could reduce power consumption by which would slash both spot and forward supply prices again reason for the state to wait The state should absolutely install the meters first before signing the longterm contracts Zenker said The governor agreed when asked about this in his press conference that conservation efforts will weaken forward markets But he said securing stable prices now is worth the cost Consumers will know approximately what it will cost them for power The first two or three years they will probably pay less than the real cost of power In the next five or six years they may pay a little bit more Davis said I think that is a bargain that Californians can learn to accept Moreover if the state had signed deals for just a couple of years the average price would be double the average price of the longerterm contracts announced this week Such prices in turn would have forced the state to raise electricity rates something that is politically unpalatable Zenker conceded Davis and his staff

the CAISO Turns CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWRs longterm contracts Everyone This is hot news showing that the CAISOCDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought I am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and FERCs attention According to two sources the CAISO is helping to bail Gov Davis out of his highpriced CDWR longterm power contracts by purchasing CDWRs excess energy as an Out Of Market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the CAISOs Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff The costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISOs surreptitious transactions This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy RealTime auction first CAISO Tariff Dispatch Protocol section d Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy bids can the CAISO buy Out Of Market OOM energy If the CAISO were following the Tariff CDWRs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energywhich is often as low as Therefore under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as Therefore the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it While there is no evidence that Gov Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first this behavior clearly benefits Davis Absent the CAISOs purchases of CDWRs excess energy CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers The media has been been making hay out of Daviss strategy of buying high and selling low Therefore Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts Of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the CAISO The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who frequently seeing minute Ex Post prices of expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to These SCs are in for a big surprise According to one source at Sierra Pacific the CAISO charged him as much as MWh for imbalance energy Where is the price mitigation here Who benefits under this scam Davis and CDWR Who loses under this scam Instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy Sources Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and the Friday Burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito There is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market OOM calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post BEEP market As one of our faithful observers told me The ISO will be billing some DRWCERS longterm contracts to SCs as OOM energy This has been confirmed by the ISO This means there is no realtime price transparency We may see an hourly expost price of say but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual RealTime settlement price There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesnt post that information The implication is that parties buying realtime energy will wait days before theyhave any idea of the price This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERCs goals of creating open transparent markets Here is the email from our CAISO representative Original Message From Almeida Keoni mailto Sent Thursday August PM To Emmert Caroline ONeil Murray P Gilbert Scotty Cc Sheidun Donna

Steve C Legal Cc DLPortland Volume Mgmt Subject Revelation Steve Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market and purchase power that exceeds mwh is the charge code they use to credit it back for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO His response was this that the CAISO is charging regardless of the INC and DEC prices to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS In effect they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS Kit

be married The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can heal its wounds Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by or possibly not sure of date Otherwise the utility will lose marketbased rates will be unable to get a merger approved and will have its transmission rev req scrutinized The commission favors market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure The goal is to essentially reissue the Order tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation Although California will be allowed to heal it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates Further summary prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt Affairs DC office is provided below Alan Comnes The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues The following is a summary of the meeting The meeting is still going on and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon regarding market power RTOs Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks organizational what will the RTO organizations look like and substantive once you set up the organizations what will they do Organizational Effort Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to marry up meaning I suppose that the two should consolidate Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems Structural Effort The Commission will initiate a section proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the functions established in Order No into RTO structures To achieve this goal the Commission is establishing an RTO week of advanced workshops from October in advance of issuing a NOPR to address structural issues such as congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability transmission rights Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No transmission tariff The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs Wood also recognized that some sticks are needed to entice RTO participation Therefore Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December with a declaration to join an RTO If they do not make this declaration these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis Furthermore Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs they should not be authorized to merge their facilities and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs Wood states that these sticks provide incentive but do not mandate RTO participation With regard to the pending requests for rehearing Wood asked legal staff to figure out how FERC can get there In other words I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals because she was not required to vote on anything today she only expressed her concern Upcoming Dates October RTO Workshops End of October further orders on Northeast Southeast Midwest RTOs December all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct Within the next few days FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on standards of conduct for transmission providers As explained at the meeting we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates not just marketers The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmissionowners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers As you know the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers As the interim general counsel noted these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR Breathitt may not support but if the industry does not support the proposal FERC will pull it We of course will strongly support the proposal Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity ICAP Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August and he is not that familiar with the issues Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days In sum Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability After the presentation Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply without politically unacceptable prolonged price spikes Commissioner Brownell from the Pennsylvania PUC has a better understanding of ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers Realizing that there are many positions on this topic Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process Sorry this is so long but a lot happened today We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over Let us know if you have any questions Sarah

that Californians havent been reduced to stoneage lifestyles running naked in the streets and eating each other The state barely had enough electricity to get through this past winter when demand was not yet pumped up with airconditioning Yet here they are surviving the summer with nary a blackout Gov Gray Davis must be some kind of a wizard pulling megawatts from his pointy hat He gave every indication of being a hapless cluck but obviously we underestimated him Naah Californias summer of surplus demonstrates just how flukey last winters rolling blackouts were Power there was aplenty or at least enough to get by What there wasnt was anybody to pay for it thanks to the political systems paralysis as the states private utilities ran out of cash and used up their credit trying to keep the lights on We wont rehearse the central pinion of this catastrophe a deregulation plan that created scarcity pricing in the absence of true scarcity A tweak here and there as late as last fall could have saved the states taxpayers and ratepayers literally billions of dollars at no real cost to anybody Instead the utilities were allowed simply to run out of money accumulating billion in unpayable IOUs to generators Now most of us tend to think of power plants as giant coal or nuclear operations that run hours a day supplying baseload power But the majority of plants are parttimers firing up to meet intermediate and peak demand Revving up their turbines means incurring fuel labor and maintenance costs which means operators like to get paid The crisis months saw three distinct waves of blackouts each related to plants dropping off line simply because they feared not getting paid In January it was British Columbia Hydro the big governmentowned operator of Canadian dams which had kept California afloat on credit for months In March it was dozens of small California generators known as qualifying facilities which no longer could meet their own fuel and labor bills because they werent getting paid by their utility customers In July it was the federal government imposing impenetrably complex price controls across the West making it impossible for generators to know what price they were allowed to charge Some shut down rather than take a chance and since the federal intervention meant the entire region was on the griddle for Californias mismanagement the blackouts just happened to land in Nevada There was no shortage in other words no energy crisis There was only the unaddressed credit problems of the utilities We opined in January that Californians would be surprised at how quickly power prices return to normal Yup The state threw open the treasury to pay for the power the utilities could no longer afford and suddenly sellers were everywhere and prices fell In the teeth of peak airconditioning season electricity prices are now back to normal In retrospect whats amazing is that so many plants not only kept operating month after month despite being stiffed by the state but produced more power than they had the year before to keep California lit Yet theyve gotten nothing but abuse from the governor who is still turning over every legal stone to try to avoid paying the IOUs There is no question that Western supplies were tighter than usual thanks to low water levels in Northwest river systems But the evidence shows that Western markets were flexible enough to accommodate the glitches All they needed was a creditworthy customer to deal with Unfortunately Californians wont be benefiting from the return of normal pricing In the throes of an energy crisis Gov Davis signed billion in longterm power contracts at ridiculously high prices Hardly was the ink dry on these deals before he was forced to begin selling this unneeded power back into the market at losses of cents on the dollar It gets worse Last week came the most humiliating revelation of all Officials have ordered one of the states most efficient suppliers a coalfired plant that delivers power at a cost of two cents per kilowatthour to dump its power into the ground so consumers can use Mr Daviss highcost power instead The truth being too gruesome to acknowledge politicians have devoted themselves to peddling false lessons from all this The states new energy czar David Freeman insists the mess points up the advantages of socialism to protect the public from shortages Less insanely others blame Californias rampant notinmybackyardism but even this wasnt really the cause of the meltdown Its true California didnt build a major power plant during the s thanks to lingering surpluses and a raucous debate over the future of deregulation But a regional wholesale market was already in full swing allowing the Wests existing complement of plants to be used more efficiently And California actually did manage to add about megawatts of output in the s from small plants thanks to joint federalstate rules that guaranteed a market for every erg they could churn out Never mind The one thing politicians of every stripe cant let voters understand is that there was never any energy crisis only a grotesque act of fiscal mismanagement Some billion in annual power consumption was transformed into a bill for billion for no good economic reason that anybody could possibly defend By refusing to look this fact in the eye Californians have set themselves up to keep paying inflated prices for decades to come URL for this Article archiveretrievecgiidSBdjm Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Printing distribution and use of this material is governed

will be organized as follows Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat ion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i ts customers in Northern and Central California It will hold percent o f the current utility assets in terms of book value and will employ people Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu ll range of utility services to one out of every Americans PGE Corporation in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus iness will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri c generation electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl y under Pacific Gas and Electric Company The new electric generation business will be a California company establish ed to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a ssociated lands and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district s now held by the utility In total the unit will have approximately megawatts of generation The facilities will be operated in accordance with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses and in ke eping with sound environmental stewardship policies The generating busine ss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com pany under a year contract at a stable marketbased rate The new electric transmission business will be a California company establi shed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u tility The system comprises circuit miles of electric transmission lines and cables The new gas transmission business will be a California company established to own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b y the utility including miles of transmission pipelines and three ga s storage facilities Following the reorganization the California Public Utilities Commission wi ll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company i ncluding retail electric and natural gas rates The Federal Energy Regulat ory Commission FERC will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses for the hydroelectric assets and the rates terms and conditions of servic e provided by the electric transmission business FERC will also assume ju risdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant and over the rates terms and conditions of service for the ga s transmission system which will become an interstate pipeline Glynn said This plan without raising retail rates provides a safe reli able and longterm electric supply to California customers It enables our company to maintain a qualified workforce And it enables us to keep our generating assets intact and integrated rather than selling them piecemeal to pay creditors The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent ially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga nization We envision essentially the same experienced dedicated team continuing to do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs said Glynn We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t he people who know how to run them best In addition to resolving creditors claims and maintaining stability for cu stomers and employees the plan also provides longterm benefits to the sta te It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power for customers by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect ric Company would be financially able to reassume the procurement responsi bility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R esources The Chapter process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented Paul Aronzon legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito rs said This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r esolve creditors claims and restore PGEs creditworthiness It has our f ull support and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the Chapte r process With this plan filed said Glynn we are now focused on bringing the Cha

Bankruptcy Code for Pacific Gas and Electric Company Utility These statements are necessarily subjec t to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to dif fer materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements Although PGE Corporation and the Utility are not able to predict all of th e factors that may affect whether the Plan will be confirmed or whether i f confirmed it will become effective some of the factors that could affec t the outcome materially include the pace of the Bankruptcy Court proceedi ngs the extent to which the Plan is amended or modified legislative and r egulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the elect ric and natural gas industries in the United States particularly in Califo rnia whether the Utility is able to obtain timely regulatory approvals or whether the Utility is able to obtain regulatory approvals at all risks re lating to the issuance of new debt securities by each of the disaggregated entities including higher interest rates than are assumed in the financial projections which could affect the amount of cash raised to satisfy allowe d claims and the inability to successfully market the debt securities due to among other reasons an adverse change in market conditions or in the c ondition of the disaggregated entities before completion of the offerings whether the Bankruptcy Court exercises its authority to preempt relevant n onbankruptcy law and if so whether and the extent to which such assertion of jurisdiction is successfully challenged whether a favorable tax ruling or opinion is obtained regarding the taxfree nature of the internal restr ucturings and spin off contemplated by the Plan and the ability of the Ut ility to successfully

natural gas rates The Federal Energy Regulat ory Commission FERC will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses for the hydroelectric assets and the rates terms and conditions of servic e provided by the electric transmission business FERC will also assume ju risdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant and over the rates terms and conditions of service for the ga s transmission system which will become an interstate pipeline Glynn said This plan without raising retail rates provides a safe reli able and longterm electric supply to California customers It enables our company to maintain a qualified workforce And it enables us to keep our generating assets intact and integrated rather than selling them piecemeal to pay creditors The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent ially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga nization We envision essentially the same experienced dedicated team continuing to do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs said Glynn We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t he people who know how to run them best In addition to resolving creditors claims and maintaining stability for cu stomers and employees the plan also provides longterm benefits to the sta te It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power for customers by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect ric Company would be financially able to reassume the procurement responsi bility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R esources The Chapter process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented Paul Aronzon legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito rs said This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r esolve creditors claims and restore PGEs creditworthiness It has our f ull support and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the Chapte r process With this plan filed said Glynn we are now focused on bringing the Cha pter process to completion reaffirming the financial health and creditw orthiness of our operations through this reorganization restoring customer s confidence and rebuilding value for our shareholders At AM Pacific Time today PGE Corporation

printerdcgstoryDnewsstoriesdjBThtm By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesFederal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of Californias wholesale electricity market has been manipula ting its powerpurchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under longterm contracts according to documents obtained Friday by Dow Jones Newswires Friday At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market The s tates need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro ven embarrassing for Gov Gray Davis who signed billion in deals to he ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators complaints The energy companies say that the California ISOs purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement The letter was sent to the ISO the California Department of Water Resource s which has been buying power in lieu of the states struggling utilities since midJanuary and several generators all of which were to attend th e meeting Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu res of the California ISO as they have had to change in the last nine mont hs are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st ructure Wolfman said in her letter The purpose of the meeting is to dev elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch generators utilities CDWR on appropriate practices and pr ocedures ISO Procedures Need Explaining FERC The ISOs main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the states electrical grid As part of that job the ISO determines wh ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from If the ISO cant explain how it makes its decisions FERC may conduct an au dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market Wolfmans office said As discussed FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud it of CAISO a second letter from FERCs market oversight and enforcement division states This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated The ISOs operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po wer first The information that generators have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe r at high prices and protect Gov Davis from political embarrassment the

chief Pete Garris has said but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWRs long term contracts The outofmarket purchases appear to be expensive

RTO West are to be married The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can heal its wounds Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by or possibly not sure of date Otherwise the utility will lose marketbased rates will be unable to get a merger approved and will have its transmission rev req scrutinized The commission favors market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure The goal is to essentially reissue the Order tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation Although California will be allowed to heal it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates Further summary prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt Affairs DC office is provided below Alan Comnes The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues The following is a summary of the meeting The meeting is still going on and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon regarding market power RTOs Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks organizational what will the RTO organizations look like and substantive once you set up the organizations what will they do Organizational Effort Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to marry up meaning I suppose that the two should consolidate Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems Structural Effort The Commission will initiate a section proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the functions established in Order No into RTO structures To achieve this goal the Commission is establishing an RTO week of advanced workshops from October in advance of issuing a NOPR to address structural issues such as congestion management cost recovery market monitoring transmission planning reliability transmission rights Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No transmission tariff The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs Wood also recognized that some sticks are needed to entice RTO participation Therefore Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December with a declaration to join an RTO If they do not make this declaration these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis Furthermore Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs they should not be authorized to merge their facilities and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs Wood states that these sticks provide incentive but do not mandate RTO participation With regard to the pending requests for rehearing Wood asked legal staff to figure out how FERC can get there In other words I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals because she was not required to vote on anything today she only expressed her concern Upcoming Dates October RTO Workshops End of October further orders on Northeast Southeast Midwest RTOs December all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct Within the next few days FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR on standards of conduct for transmission providers As explained at the meeting we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates not just marketers The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmissionowners marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers As you know the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers As the interim general counsel noted these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR Breathitt may not support but if the industry does not support the proposal FERC will pull it We of course will strongly support the proposal Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity ICAP Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August and he is not that familiar with the issues Therefore he asked Staff to prepare a presentation which they made at the meeting this morning The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days In sum Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability After the presentation Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply without politically unacceptable prolonged price spikes Commissioner Brownell from the Pennsylvania PUC has a better understanding of ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers Realizing that there are many positions on this topic Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process Sorry this is so long but a lot happened today We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over Let us know if you have any questions Sarah

news this summer is that Californians havent been reduced to stoneage lifestyles running naked in the streets and eating each other The state barely had enough electricity to get through this past winter when demand was not yet pumped up with airconditioning Yet here they are surviving the summer with nary a blackout Gov Gray Davis must be some kind of a wizard pulling megawatts from his pointy hat He gave every indication of being a hapless cluck but obviously we underestimated him Naah Californias summer of surplus demonstrates just how flukey last winters rolling blackouts were Power there was aplenty or at least enough to get by What there wasnt was anybody to pay for it thanks to the political systems paralysis as the states private utilities ran out of cash and used up their credit trying to keep the lights on We wont rehearse the central pinion of this catastrophe a deregulation plan that created scarcity pricing in the absence of true scarcity A tweak here and there as late as last fall could have saved the states taxpayers and ratepayers literally billions of dollars at no real cost to anybody Instead the utilities were allowed simply to run out of money accumulating billion in unpayable IOUs to generators Now most of us tend to think of power plants as giant coal or nuclear operations that run hours a day supplying baseload power But the majority of plants are parttimers firing up to meet intermediate and peak demand Revving up their turbines means incurring fuel labor and maintenance costs which means operators like to get paid The crisis months saw three distinct waves of blackouts each related to plants dropping off line simply because they feared not getting paid In January it was British Columbia Hydro the big governmentowned operator of Canadian dams which had kept California afloat on credit for months In March it was dozens of small California generators known as qualifying facilities which no longer could meet their own fuel and labor bills because they werent getting paid by their utility customers In July it was the federal government imposing impenetrably complex price controls across the West making it impossible for generators to know what price they were allowed to charge Some shut down rather than take a chance and since the federal intervention meant the entire region was on the griddle for Californias mismanagement the blackouts just happened to land in Nevada There was no shortage in other words no energy crisis There was only the unaddressed credit problems of the utilities We opined in January that Californians would be surprised at how quickly power prices return to normal Yup The state threw open the treasury to pay for the power the utilities could no longer afford and suddenly sellers were everywhere and prices fell In the teeth of peak airconditioning season electricity prices are now back to normal In retrospect whats amazing is that so many plants not only kept operating month after month despite being stiffed by the state but produced more power than they had the year before to keep California lit Yet theyve gotten nothing but abuse from the governor who is still turning over every legal stone to try to avoid paying the IOUs There is no question that Western supplies were tighter than usual thanks to low water levels in Northwest river systems But the evidence shows that Western markets were flexible enough to accommodate the glitches All they needed was a creditworthy customer to deal with Unfortunately Californians wont be benefiting from the return of normal pricing In the throes of an energy crisis Gov Davis signed billion in longterm power contracts at ridiculously high prices Hardly was the ink dry on these deals before he was forced to begin selling this unneeded power back into the market at losses of cents on the dollar It gets worse Last week came the most humiliating revelation of all Officials have ordered one of the states most efficient suppliers a coalfired plant that delivers power at a cost of two cents per kilowatthour to dump its power into the ground so consumers can use Mr Daviss highcost power instead The truth being too gruesome to acknowledge politicians have devoted themselves to peddling false lessons from all this The states new energy czar David Freeman insists the mess points up the advantages of socialism to protect the public from shortages Less insanely others blame Californias rampant notinmybackyardism but even this wasnt really the cause of the meltdown Its true California didnt build a major power plant during the s thanks to lingering surpluses and a raucous debate over the future of deregulation But a regional wholesale market was already in full swing allowing the Wests existing complement of plants to be used more efficiently And California actually did manage to add about megawatts of output in the s from small plants thanks to joint federalstate rules that guaranteed a market for every erg they could churn out Never mind The one thing politicians of every stripe cant let voters understand is that there was never any energy crisis only a grotesque act of fiscal mismanagement Some billion in annual power consumption was transformed into a bill for billion for no good economic reason that anybody could possibly defend By refusing to look this fact in the eye Californians have set themselves up to keep paying inflated prices for decades to come URL for this Article archiveretrievecgiidSBdjm Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Printing distribution and

Press Release Announcing Deal with Edison Importance High PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates The California Public Utilities Commission PUC and Southern California Edison Edison today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers limit ratepayers costs of paying off the debt and maintain the states role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable certain period of time The terms of the Settlement Agreement include Edison will apply cash on hand plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs to paying off its back debt The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August less the cash on hand on that date less an additional million adjustment The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be billion as of the end of this month The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through or on the full payment of its debt if sooner If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in Edison is free to resume paying dividends in Since Edisons annual dividend has typically been about million Edisons shareholders will have forgone at least billion in dividends and possibly more in addition to the million adjustment Edison will apply of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers The PUC can direct Edison to use million each year for other utility purposes including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt The PUC agrees not to lower Edisons retail rates below their current level through the end of unless the back debts are recovered However rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over and if Edisons back debt has not been recovered by the end of There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities Edison may make up to million in capital expenditures annually This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California said Loretta Lynch President of the PUC The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers This agreement settles a November federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC in which Edison claimed that the Commissions actions in not providing sufficient retail rates violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property Under this agreement Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commissions decisions implementing AB X AB X and the TURN accounting proposal Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Tuesday October PM To Dasovich Jeff Kean Steven J Belden Tim Sharp Vicki Blachman

Mellencamp Lisa Comnes Alan Subject California UpdatePart PUC Approves Edison Bailout In another surprise move the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a vote This item was not on the Commissions agenda other than as a placeholder regarding litigation We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edisons SVP of Regulatory Affairs and heres a summary The Commission will keep current rates in place through Any overcollection resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off B in Edisons past due accounts the socalled undercollection If Edison collects the B prior to then rates can change If Edison has not collected the B by the end of the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder Half the remainder will be collected in and the other half in Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the B undercollection Edison can keep of any refunds received after the B is paid off Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the B Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs ie if DWRs costs go up the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edisons rates The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edisons capital structure varies from the PUCapproved capital structure Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding the filed rate doctrine and the socalled TURN accounting method which effectively kept the rate freeze in place Edison agrees to cooperate with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the special session that the Governor recently announced We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them Best Jeff Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Tuesday October PM To Kean Steven J Belden Tim Sharp Vicki Blachman

Mellencamp Lisa Subject California Update PUC Turns Down Davis Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event the California PUC today voted down Davis proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC The vote was with the two Republicans voting with Davis handpicked appointees Lynch and Wood Davis proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointeeGeoff Brownwho made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis proposed rate agreement What is Davis proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs no questions asked What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis proposal With the vote it remains unclear how CaliforniaDWR will pay for the DWR power contracts The political pressure to renegotiateor breakthe DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably It remains unclear how CaliforniaDWR will pay for the B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months Under the structure devised by Davis the revenues flowing from the CPUCDWR rate agreement would be used to both pay for the DWR power contracts and service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay Californias General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January In short there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds Safe to say that todays PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis and left his approach to solving California electricity crisis in shambles What Next A broad leftright coalition of energy interests supported a bill XX that passed the Legislature with broad bipartisan support The bill would create a dedicated rate component on every customers bill to service the B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue Proponents of the billand just about everyone elseargue that the dedicated rate component is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget The bill is silent however on how California would pay for the DWR contracts and the bills opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill The leftright coalition from Nader types to oil companies is also working hard to get Davis to sign it Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel Given todays vote however Davis may have no

September Page A SACRAMENTO The lights are dimmed in the office of California Gov Gray D avis but his prospects of winning reelection next year and becoming a Democratic presidential possibility are looking a lot brighter than they w ere just a few months ago The office airconditioning is imperceptible despite the outside temperatu re of degrees as Davis practices the energy conservation he has been p reaching But overall the summer has been mild electric power usage is do wn percent from last year and there hasnt been a blackout anywhere in t he state since May Republicans who had set up a Web site to record the expected energy crisis concede that Davis has dodged a disaster Always cautious the governor s ays So far so good but you never talk about a possible nohitter in the middle of the game In fact Davis is not home free He is pushing a financial bailout bill to avert bankruptcy for Southern California Edison a bill opposed by both fre emarket Republicans and liberal Democrats in the legislature Sale of bond s to replace the billions the state spent buying power last winter and spri ng has been held up by litigation from already bankrupt Pacific Gas and Ele ctric leaving a potential hole in the currentyear budget and ensuring tha t the electionyear fiscal situation likely will be grim Drought condition s threaten a water shortage next year Private polls show clear vulnerabilities for Davis Despite a drop in publi c fears of an energy crisis and some increasing optimism about the overall direction of the state two August surveys I was shown found fewer than one third of Californians favor reelecting Davis while twothirds say he shou ld definitely be replaced or they would consider an alternative His job ap proval scores are as poor as those of President Bush who lost California i n a landslide last November The polls show a notable Davis weakness among Democrats and one veteran lo bbyist here told me that the governor was just one blackout away from draw ing a serious primary opponent one reason that Davis last week preempti vely staged a show of support from the Democratic mayors of seven big citie s But the potential vulnerability may never be tested Davis has million in the bank and is headed for a million war chest California has not d enied a sitting governor a second term since reelecting two Democrats and four Republicans most recently Pete Wilson who was in much worse sha pe politically in than Davis is now And all three potential Republican gubernatorial candidates have liabilitie s Wealthy businessman William Simon Jr son of the former Treasury secret ary has impressed Republican insiders as personable and smart But he has never run for office before and is unknown to the voters who have showed s kepticism about firsttime millionaire candidates in both parties Secretary of State Bill Jones the only Republican in statewide office has been Daviss most aggressive and effective critic zeroing in on conflicts of interest in the stock holdings of several Davis energy advisers and app ointees But Jones left the Bush campaign early in the battle for the nomination to endorse Sen John McCain and the White House reportedly has told GOP contributors not to help him Two McCain allies Sens Fred Thomps on and Chuck Hagel are coming out to raise money for Jones next month but his treasury is anemic The White House favorite is former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan who w on two races in that heavily Democratic city Riordan is and as Davis p oints out has never run statewide or in a partisan contest Conservatives question his liberal social policy positions and Jones notes pointedly R iordan and his wife have contributed more than million against Republi can candidates including to Gray Davis in past races With its growing population of minorities California looks even to busines s lobbyists more and more like a solidly Democratic state where Republican victories will be the exception GOP leaders in the legislature and the co ngressional delegation appeared last week to be ready to accept redistricti ng plans that would save their current seats but lock them into minority st atus for the next decade Bush who was once seen by California GOP leaders as their salvation now s eems to some of them to have turned his back on the state He has visited o nly once since taking office and one GOP official told me The only Cabin et member we ever see out here is former Californian Ann Veneman the se cretary of agriculture It is a complete reversal of fortune for the home base of Earl Warren Rich ard

items already copyrighted and received through wire services or o ther media Energy conservation efforts leave California blackouts in the dark State has reported no shutdowns since May By JOHN WOOLFOLK Knight Ridder News Service Tuesday September San Jose Calif This was supposed to be California s summer of darknes s but as the summer draws to a close without any blackouts the doomsayers are proving to be wrong Just a few months ago they talked about hours of rolling blackouts Or hours Even hours But the blackouts stopped in early May Mild weather and surprisingly strong consumer conservation saved the day w ith help from new power plants and market controls Consider State officials had hoped to lower peak power demand by megawatts about equal to a nuclear power plant with a million effort to pr omote conservation and efficiency Consumers saved as much as megawat ts Average temperatures were above normal in June but not as high as last year and cooler than normal in July and August More important there have nt been the severe regional heat waves that strain the power grid Six new power plants have gone online so far this summer totaling more than megawatts The three largest accounting for megawatts ha d been in the works for years The others were rushed into production under a state effort to boost peak supplies Tougher federal regulations enacted in May and June prohibit California power plant owners from withholding power from the grid in emergencies and appear to be curtailing megawatt laundering schemes Which played the greatest role may be debated for years But even if it was mostly just good weather Gov Gray Davis is praising Californians Davis had initially urged consumers to cut back then upped it to an d offered rebates to those who conserved over last year State officials expected to qualify for the rebates but about a third of customers are getting them and consumers have cut peak demand as much a s according to the California Energy Commission Conservation a surprise We were lucky to have the combination of bringing more power plants online extraordinary weather and the heroic efforts of Californians said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar A tremendous amount of the credit for not having the blackouts is directly a result of the efforts of Californians to conse rve energy Energyefficient products flew out of stores The Home Depot reported that sales of portable generators doubled lowwatt fluorescent bulbs were up and window films used to lower air conditioning demand were up said spokeswoman Kathryn Gallagher Those who spent the summer working in dim sweaty offices air drying thei r clothes and snapping up all things energy efficient say they didnt reall y buy the dire blackout forecasts I really do think they exaggerated said Agnes Grossinger of San Jose Bu t shes not ashamed of her efforts to save power by not using anything elec tric until the evening Its saved her in electric bills and she plan s to keep doing it Those who had predicted disaster say consumer conservation surprised them The big thing was that we didnt use the electricity said Lon House an energy consultant for the state who had forecast hours of blackouts based on meager conservation in San Diego last summer The energy conserv ation surprised everybody I didnt think we could do it Some say weather a factor Conservation advocates agree saying that lowered consumption played a big role in easing the states power demand We didnt get lucky with the weather said Ralph Cavanagh energy special ist with the Natural Resources Defense Council Theres no question in our opinion that the overwhelming factor in explaining the reduction in statew ide energy use is energy efficiency But energy market experts find that hard to believe The weather has obviously been the biggest contributor to avoiding blackou ts said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Ener gy Institute in Berkeley For the governors critics the summer blackout noshow has been deflating They snapped up Blackouts Gray Out bumper stickers an d launched a Web page screaming blackouts were unavoidable But the blackout counter remains frozen at the last on May Critics sa y the governor got lucky but concede he did well in motivating conservation Sunny California never lost power So much for predicted blackouts Thomas D Elias The Washington Times Page A Copyright LOS ANGELES Remember all those doomsday forecasts of blackouts rolling ac ross California day after day hour after hour all summer long They turne d out a lot like the warnings of the muchvaunted YK problem a lot of hot air a paper tiger a complete noshow With summer almost gone no part of California has experienced so much as o ne second of power outage as expected from the supply shortages that have plagued the state since May Wind damage to power lines yes Short circuits occasionally But systemat ic blackouts none Thats in stark contrast to the forecasts of socalled experts The California Independent System Operator which runs the states power gr id said in April that Californians could expect at least days of rollin g blackouts in the summer months if they used as much electricity as last y ear The North American Electric Reliability Council predicted hours of summ er blackouts The reasons for the debunking of those seemingly overblown predictions of d isaster vary from conservation to mild weather and brand new power generati ng capacity Several power plants also returned to service after being closed much of la st winter and spring for repairs or routine maintenance Both state and consumer groups maintain that many of those closures were de liberate attempts to drive up the price of power California Attorney General Bill Lockyer a Democrat with gubernatorial asp irations is currently investigating the possibility that a criminal conspi racy produced the shutdowns Whether the massive winter and spring price boosts were criminal or merely driven by market forces the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has indic ated it may approve as much as billion in rebates to California for over charges Democratic California Gov Gray Davis says he will sue unless the rebate am ount is much much higher Meanwhile wholesale power prices are down more than twothirds from winter averaging per megawatthour over the last month compared with a r ange of to per megawatthour in February and March Most analysts however point to the weather and consumer conservation as k ey factors that helped avoid blackouts altogether In June Californians consumed percent less electricity than one year earlier The reduction in use was percent for July as the weather in some parts of the state heated up a bit and many air conditioners started to run During peak hours when shortages are most likely usage was down perc ent in June and percent in July Consumers trimmed between and megawatts of usage during the dai ly peak hours from pm to pm enough to power between million and million homes Without the conservation there would have been a major problem said Gre g Fishman an official of the Independent System Operator And no one here is saying the danger of blackouts is completely gone Were not out of the woods yet said Mr Davis as he cut a ribbon to open a peaker power plant near Palm Springs two weeks ago We face our toughest test in early September when temperatures should hit three digits on a regular basis in many places But this much we do know C alifornians everywhere from the workers working day and night to build ne w plants to the families waiting to do laundry after pm all of them a re exceeding expectations and meeting this energy challenge Mother Nature has helped considerably especially in June and July Coolerthanexpected temperatures in Oregon and Washington state made more power than expected available from the dams of the federal Bonneville Power Administration along the Columbia River Overall it seems like most of the summer has been a little on the lowtem perature side said Dan Atkin a National Weather Service meteorologist st ationed in San Diego But no one in government or the power industry is ready to say the crisis i s over We certainly arent ready to stand down the bombers yet said Stephanie D onovan a spokeswoman for the San Diego Gas Electric Co But as Mr Atkin noted We didnt get agallon gasoline either Now y ou see how difficult forecasting is Public Power Utilities Outlook Stable Moodys Capital Markets Report Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc New York September The credit outlook for public power electri c utilities remains and will likely continue to be stable even as the ele ctric industry restructuring evolves into greater market competition and de spite deregulations failure in California Moodys says in a soontobe r eleased report Moodys believes most public power utilities have used the past several ye ars well to cut costs and to better position themselves to ensure that cust omers are satisfied and that the utilitys financial condition remains soun d says analyst Dan Aschenbach author of the Special Comment which conta ins ratings and outlooks for utilities whose debt totals more than b illion Armed with the advantage of local regulation and governance public power u tilitieseven those in California have derived operational strength from retaining ownership of electricity generation and maintaining longterm fi xed contracts and strong rate flexibility Challenges the utilities face include continued market volatility new and more competitive technology increasing industry consolidation environment al compliance costs re nitrogen oxide regulations and risks of major pl ant outages or major resource loss related to wholesale energy market volat ility The most important challenge involves implementing a resource strategy tha t is diverse and flexible enough to meet a more competitive and volatile en ergy market says Aschenbach He adds that Moodys analysis of this challenge and of utility credit stabi lity during industry restructuring depends as always on strong management competitive cost structure and financial flexibility Overall evaluation of public power utility credit risks and challenges sa ys Aschenbach should be viewed with the context of continued implementatio n of the National Energy Act of by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commi ssion FERC which aims for more open and easier transmission access and m ore vibrant regional energy markets Despite deregulations problems in California and increased state intervent ion in that market the nations wholesale market is already deregulated t he analyst says and the federal focus is on improving transmission grid ef ficiency Meanwhile states have varying timetables for implementing deregulation fr om which most public power utilities are exempt to the ire of investorown ed utilities Moodys predicts that as a result of deregulations failure in California conflicts will increase between federal deregulation polic ies and states taking a cautious position of protecting local customers fro m disruptive and costly power outages Moodys believes deregulations negative financial effects as exemplified by municipal utilities in Columbus Ohio and Springfield Illinois in and more recently in Seattle and Tacoma Washington will be repeated e lsewhere as the more competitive market evolves and some public power utili ties are caught in unpredictable marketplace conditions says Aschenbach In addition utilities may face significant competitive pressureseven wit hout federal legislationfrom increased levels of investorowned utility c onsolidation and market power in both electricity generation and transmissi on And then theres the uncertainty regarding the competitivenessaffecting is sue of privateuse restrictions on taxexempt bonds municipal utilities use to raise funds These federal restrictions whose relaxation investorowne d utilities strongly oppose limit the amount of bond proceeds that can ben efit privateend power users Finally public power electric utilities face proposals in Congress seeking their regulation by FERC Says Aschenbach The loss of the flexibility in remaining exempt from any restrictive regulatory order would be disruptive to public power utilities Preview WEEK OF SEPT SEPT Bill to Rescue Edison Is Set for Review Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C Copyright The Times Mirror Company A bill to rescue Edison Internationals utility from bankruptcy is set to b e considered Tuesday by a California Assembly fiscal committee which postp oned its review of the plan late last week The Assembly Appropriations Committee adjourned for the threeday weekend w ithout voting on the bill because of confusion over amendments being con sidered The committee members didnt receive analysis of some amendments b efore the start of the hearing Southern California Edison the states secondlargest electric utility ne eds the measure to help pay off billion in debt accumulated under the state deregulation law which froze consumer power rates while allowing who lesale costs to rise Under the bill the utility would be allowed to sell as much as billio n in bonds backed by utility fees paid by an estimated business cus tomers The state would have a fiveyear option to buy the utilitys transmission l ines at twice book value or about billion The appropriations committee has to vote before the full Assembly can consi der the plan If approved by the Assembly the plan must be merged with a s eparate bill passed by the state Senate last month Idea of Edison Bankruptcy Gains Currency Utilities With PGE as an example consumer and business groups are beginning to view reorganization as a pa latable option to a state rescue plan JERRY HIRSCH Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C Copyright The Times Mirror Company As state lawmakers enter what looks to be the final round of debate on a re scue plan for insolvent Southern California Edison Co consumer advocates and even some business groups are asking whether the utilitys million customers might be better off if SCE filed for bankruptcy Support for a legislative deal for SCE which is backed by Gov Gray Davis and the utility is difficult to gauge in part because the April bankruptc y filing of Californias largest utilityPacific Gas Electric Cohas p roved less disruptive to customers than first thought Many lawmakers analysts and others believe Bankruptcy Court might be a bet ter forum for SCE to settle its financial problems than the political arena If SCE and its nearly billion in power debt land in Bankruptcy Court th e logic goes the company its creditors and its lenders probably would hav e to make more concessions than would ratepayers to return the company to f iscal health That would be a far different formula than the rescue plan passed by a key Assembly committee last week That plan would require the utilitys largest customersprimarily businessesto pay for as much as billio n in bonds to cover much of SCEs debt through higher rates SCE would fina nce or negotiate away the remainder of its debt Edison International the utilitys Rosemeadbased parent company has spen t virtually the entire year fighting off bankruptcy arguing that it could cost as much as billion in legal and administrative fees and could lead to employee layoffs and higher rates for customers To emerge from bankruptcy the company maintains it might have to sell som e of its assets or curtail investment in its electrical grid The utility sank into insolvency after piling up billions of dollars in ene rgyrelated debt under Californias deregulation laws It was forced to buy power for more than what it could charge customers when prices spiked over the last year The accumulation of similar debt pushed San Franciscobased PGE to file fo r protection from creditors in US Bankruptcy Court in April Southern California Edison has been following a different path agreeing to a rescue deal negotiated with Davis The final version of that plan contin ues to be debated in the Assembly this week One reason for the tenuous nature of the deals support is that PGEs bank ruptcy thus far has had no disastrous effects Another reason is that bankr uptcy experts say the tab will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars not the billion Edison projects for a major utility bankruptcy And by not approving an SCE rescue bill politicians would be able to say that th ey did not vote in favor of raising electricity rates Clearly it is in ratepayers best interests for there to be a Southern C alifornia Edison bankruptcy said Kenneth Klee a bankruptcy expert at UCL A law school The advantage of bankruptcy is that creditors and Edison wou ld share in the pain too That would give ratepayers some cushioning Even with bankruptcy Klee said ratepayers probably would have some exposu re There is no free lunch he said Klees views are shared by consumer advocates who have mounted a spirited but so far unsuccessful lobbying campaign against a legislative rescue of E dison They argue that a variety of Edison missteps and its acquiescence to deregulation make it rather than rate payers responsible for huge debts Ratepayers are unlikely to be any worse off in a bankruptcy than in an abs olute bailout of the utility said Bob Finkelstein an attorney with the U tility Reform Network a consumer advocacy group But from what we have seen in the PGE case a bankruptcy would probably b e more fair for ratepayers Finkelstein said So far the judge has left rate matters with the Public Utilities Commission In June US Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Montali denied a Pacific Gas Electric challenge of state regulators authority to set its electricity ra tes He said he wanted to avoid jurisdictional chaos and added that the public interest is better served by deference to the regulatory scheme and leaving the entire regulatory function to the regulator But Finkelstein acknowledged that there isnt enough of a track record with utility bankruptcies to know for sure This is all uncharted territory he said Indeed one factor that could make a bankruptcy filing the least attractive option is an Edison lawsuit against the state that argues that regulatory law gives it the right to recover from customers what it paid for power und er federally approved rates Edison has said it would drop the lawsuit if i t can work out a legislative settlement Barring that the lawsuit could end up costing ratepayers more than they wo uld pay under a state rescue plan said Allan Zaramberg president of the C alifornia Chamber of Commerce who supports the Assembly bill Legal experts are divided over whether Edison would win its case The version of the rescue bill that the Assembly Committee on Energy Costs and Availability approved Wednesday night would allow the utility to issue ratepayersupported bonds to pay most of its debt but says it must find ot her ways to deal with the nearly billion it owes independent power produ cers Bankruptcy is better than the political football game that is being played now said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Assn a Menlo Park Calif trade group that represents many of the large power pr oducers and traders to which SCE is in debt and which would be barred from a share of the bond money under the current plan It brings order to an ot herwise chaotic process Bankruptcy also is where the utility is likely to wind up regardless of whe ther the Legislature passes the rescue plan said Benjamin Zycher of the S an Franciscobased Pacific Research Institute Lawmakers have left the big power producers out of the rescue bill because the state has accused the independent generators of price gouging The prob lem Zycher said is that those companies still have claims If they dont get their money they could push SCE into involuntary bankruptcy by pressin g their claims in federal court The downside to such a tactic Ackerman said is that bankruptcy proceeding s take time and cost money Moreover he said he understands that members of his trade group could end up collecting less than of what they are owed by Edison Others say any advantages of a bankruptcy are outweighed by unique problems that would arise from putting the states secondlargest electric utility through the process I dont think it is clearcut said state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey who chairs the Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee I think it is better to avoid a bankruptcy but it also wouldnt be the e nd of the world either Bowen sees a multitude of unknown outcomes as the biggest risks in a bankru ptcy A judge who tries aggressively to protect creditors might attempt to impose rate increases Such a move could be supported by the utility which would see its debt reduced through the rates customers pay Bowen said A bankruptcy also could sever the interests of the utility from the states policy agenda she said PGE has become a wild card in the states policymaking on energy and many lawmakers are fearful that Edison would be too if it took the bankruptcy r oute Since filing for bankruptcy PGE has raised objections to rate makin g and revenue projections by state agencies which could delay a bill ion bond offering to cover the state governments power purchases on behalf of the insolvent utilities Some lawmakers believe that as the beneficiary of a state rescue Edison w ould be more cooperative than the Northern California utility Though ratepayers might fare better in a bankruptcy in a narrow financial s ense Zycher said damage to the states image would undermine any financia l gain A world in which government can pass a misguided policy that imposes such costs on private companies and then leaves it all to Bankruptcy Court to se ttle out is dangerous to the investment environment in California he said Thomas Walper an attorney advising Southern California Edison on bankruptc y issues said the utility wants to reach an acceptable legislative soluti on that allows it to become solvent so the company has more control over i ts future and so the state can exit the power business sooner Though a bankruptcy certainly raises all of these issues many analysts out side SCE point to the case of PGE To date they say the actions of Bankr uptcy Judge Montali have not disrupted service or been procreditor at the expense of ratepayers We have seen it work orderly in the PGE case Ackerman said But the state still is in the early stages of the process Bowen said The real test will come when a judge approves PGEs stillundetermined plan fo r reorganization Then questions about who is responsible for the huge ener gy debts run up by the utilities will be answered Times staff writer Miguel Bustillo in Sacramento contributed to this report Williams files as creditor in PGE case Tulsa World FINAL

in April Now Davis Doing Too Much Energy Critics Say By ERIC BAILEY Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTO Faulted early on for responding sluggishly to the energy cris is Gov Gray Davis has reversed course in dramatic fashion wielding his e xecutive powers in a way critics now say edges toward imperiousness In recent months Davis has used his constitutional authority to issue a sw eeping series of executive orders He authorized the state to borrow bil lion for energy purchases weakened air pollution standards for power plant s and bypassed some of governments normal checks and balances Most recently he signed an order allowing Pacific Gas Electric to transf er a Kern County power plant to another company The move Davis said woul d let the new owner retool and begin producing power by next summer But it also allowed the company to skip review by the Public Utilities Commission and suspended a provision of state law Its the imperial governor said Barbara OConnor director of Cal State Sacramentos Institute for the Study of Politics and Media The Democratic governor has argued that initially he needed to step back an d study the evolving crisis Then once schooled in his options he was abl e to take decisive action to keep the lights on Extraordinary times demand extraordinary action said Davis press secret ary Steve Maviglio The governors aides point to polls showing that the public believes Davis is doing a better job than the Legislature of managing the crisis Surveys also show him running ahead of the three potential Republican candidates fo r governorSecretary of State Bill Jones former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and businessman William Simon My guess is most of the voters would rather have him act decisively and no t get caught up in the stalemate of Sacramento politics said Bruce Cain director of UC Berkeleys Institute of Governmental Studies They probably figure we can all worry about the niceties of representative democracy lat er on The energy crisis certainly has presented Davis with his stiffest challenge Unlike the earthquakes insect infestations fires droughts and floods t hat have tested past governors the power emergency has unfolded like no ot her Complex and persistent it has defied simple solutions because of the innum erable players scattered across the worlds of government business and fina nce and its multiple layers of interconnected problems Some Say Davis Doing Too Much Despite a January State of the State speech by Davis that highlighted the c risis and pledged more than billion to attack it legislators complained into the spring that he wasnt doing enough But now the governor is being criticized for doing too much in particular for his moves to slam through executive orders of extraordinary scope and volume Since declaring a state of emergency in midJanuary Davis has issued more than two dozen such orders terse decrees that allow a governor to bypass t he more timeconsuming legislative processand to avoid jousting with stat e lawmakers who may not be of a like mind This has only happened before in times of lifeordeath crisis The peak for former Gov Pete Wilson himself no stranger to using gubernat orial fiat in a pinch came when he issued executive orders during the year of the catastrophic Northridge earthquake when the normal rules were suspended to get Southern California up and running After the Loma Pr ieta earthquake in Gov George Deukmejian also used his executive pow ersalbeit to a lesser extentin bailing out the Bay Area During his first year in office Davis signed about a dozen executive order s mostly for narrowly focused issues a world apart from the latest batch which have fashioned huge changes in the way California does its power bus iness Executive orders have a role but not as the policymaking process for our state said Sal Russo a Republican political consultant running Simons c ampaign Its godlike power said Tom Hiltachk a Republican attorney who acknowle dged that Davis is within his constitutional rights But its supposed to be exercised only in extreme conditions And extreme conditions dont last for six or seven months Davis moves have hardly gone unnoticed Consumer advocates are howling over a Davis plan they say would essentially hand control of electricity rates to the governor Antitax crusaders say he has too eagerly embraced the notion that big governmentin particular t he takeover of powerbuying for Californias beleaguered utilitiesis the solution Orders Repercussions Will Last Long Past Crisis Federal energy regulators in Washington are scrutinizing the governors hol d over the Independent System Operator which shepherds the states power g rid The key issue a move by Davis since late last year to load up the ISO board with his own appointees More provocative than the volume of executive orders however have been th e consequenceswhich will last far beyond the current crisis As well as authorizing billions for power purchases the governor greased t he skids for quicker construction of gasfired power plants an action that frustrated backers of alternative sources such as wind and solar He relax ed state environmental reviews and rushed certification for smaller peaker plants designed to meet the surge of demand on hot summer days Davis cleared existing plants to boost output by up to megawatts without the usual bureaucratic procedures Openmeeting rules traditional review periods and other statutory checks and balances were suspended in some inst ances to speed the push to get more megawatts on line Such actions allowed Davis to jumpstart an otherwise tedious process crun ching regulatory time down from years to in some cases weeks Waiting periods regulatory delaysall those things stood in the way of k eeping the lights on said Maviglio the governors spokesman The biggest shift came at the state Department of Water Resources a previo usly lowprofile agency run by a Davis appointee The department made its f irst power purchase in Decemberunbeknownst to lawmakers at the timeand in January began buying power for the states financially hobbled private u tilities too broke to do so on their own Now the Davis administration supports a proposal by the Department of Water Resources to have the state PUC essentially rubberstamp any rate increase s the department deems necessary excluding consumers from the process Sev eral of his other actions have also weakened PUC oversight Though the administration argues that it makes no sense to have one state a gency regulate another consumer advocates fear the arrangement would allow Water Resources to raise rates whenever needed without adequate public ove rsight It seems the way he prefers to operate free of public scrutiny

likewise feel they have seen their powe r undermined by the executive branch Robert A Laurie appointed to the co mmission by Wilson said the independence of his agency has eroded under Da vis The reason we were made a commission in the first place in was that the Legislature wanted independent advice Laurie said In my opinion o ur advice is no longer independent but is thoroughly controlled by the exec utive branch Legislators Not Rushing to Help Share the Blame Legislative leaders have not exactly rushed to the defense of Davis who ev en on the best of occasions has an armslength attitude toward state lawma kers The damnedifhedoes damnedifhedoesnt response Davis is receivi ng contrasts sharply with the treatment accorded previous governors during a crisis Wilson for instance was lionized for his rapid executive moves after the Northridge quake a groundswell of support that helped the Republ ican capture a second term in Democrats at least say they understand that Davis is in a fix and most a re at least tacitly standing behind his efforts Obviously we would have been happy if more of these actions had been done jointly with the Legislature said Sen Byron Sher DStanford

enthusiastically s upporting Davis Several were irked that the governor refused to share details of key energy negotiations with top legislative brass even in private His secrecy has extended beyond energy matters Davis seemed to some around the Capitol to be oddly distant during Julys drawnout budget negotiation s breaking from tradition by convening only a single session of the socal led Big Five legislative leaders Administration officials counter that the governor was on the phone repeatedly with lawmakers to round up the needed votes When the governor talked of ordering the Legislature to stay in Sacramento through its summer recess to address a bailout plan for troubled Southern California Edison irritated lawmakers ignored the threat and went home People skills are not Grays strong suit said Cal State Sacramentos OC onnor Its an omnipotent Im smarter than you style If Davis use of executive orders has riled some concern remains in some q uarters about what he might yet do Lew Uhler president of the Sacramentobased National Tax Limitation Commit tee suggested that Davis needs to back away from wielding his executive po wers particularly now that the state seems to be skirting a power meltdown Its all part of his worldview that were all vassals of the state Uhle r said Oddly enough Davis also comes under criticism from those who believe he fa iled to wield his executive powers forcefully enough Peter Navarro a UC Irvine economist argued that the governor should have used eminent domain to seize power plants in an effort to bring prices into line Instead Davis has deployed mostly verbal weaponry against power gen erators Despite his rhetoric generators negotiated what critics contend a re pricey longterm power deals from the administration Davis is trying to renegotiate the contracts He has also asked federal ene rgy regulators to force generators to refund billion for what he conte nds was gouging during the past year But the prospects on those fronts are mixed Gray Davis used the considerable powers of the executive branch to make al l the wrong moves Navarro said Lights Still On but Glow Could Dim Later Davis defenders believe the governor has turned the corner on the energy cr isis at least in part because he took advantage of his emergency powers H e has also been lucky Mild weather has helped the state avoid summertime b lackouts Media attention has begun drifting to other events Believe me we didnt want to be in this business of purchasing energy s aid Maviglio Davis spokesman We only did it on an emergency basis to ke ep the lights on Yet Davis use of executive powers to help defuse the energy crisis could h ave negative political repercussions if the circumstances escalate again a ccording to UC Berkeleys Cain Some of the things that do go sour he said will be more easily pinned on him Times staff writers Dan Morain and Nancy Vogel contributed to this story Calif Consumer Group Has K Signatures Vs Edison Rescue LOS ANGELES Dow JonesA California consumer group will present Gov Gray Davis Tuesday with more than signatures on a petition protesting a rescue deal for insolvent utility Southern California Edison according to a news release In recent weeks the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights has stepped up efforts to protest legislation that would allow the Edison Internationa l unit to issue billion in bonds backed by business customers to pay part of its billion in debt The bill will be heard by the Assembly Ap propriations Committee Tuesday The Legislature adjourns Sept The foundation has said the bill will result in rate increases beyond two t hat were already instituted this year and has vowed to sponsor a ball ot measure to overturn an Edison bill if it passes Governor Davis and Legislators can protect ratepayers over the next two we eks or face a ratepayer revolt for the next months FTCR Organizing Dir ector Carmen Balber said The message of this petition is clear we wont pay for the failure of the utilities deregulation scheme By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Newswires jessica owjonescom mailto Eleventh Hour Chimes For Californias Edison Rescue Deal By Jason Leopold and Andrew Dowell Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES This article was originally published Friday SACRAMENTO Dow JonesEven a soap opera has to end sometime For Edison International utility Southern California Edison that time cou ld be Sept when the state Legislature adjourns for the year After more than seven months of haggling and missed deadlines there is wid espread agreement that lawmakers have just two more weeks to craft a state sponsored rescue for the utility If legislation isnt enacted by that date it never will be key lawmakers and Gov Gray Davis said And if that hap pens Southern California Edison will likely join PGE Corp utility Pacific Gas Electric in bankruptcy court This deadline is real Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said Every day we wait is one step closer to bankruptcy At issue is a rescue plan that could come up for a vote on the Assembly flo or as early as Tuesday The plan has already been approved by the Assembly Committee on Energy Costs and Availability and an earlier version was appr oved by the Senate The key details of the plan were first agreed to in principle in February a nd then formalized in a memorandum of understanding between Southern Califo rnia Edison and the state on April In essence the state would help the utility raise funds to recover some of the losses it sustained buying wholesale power at prices far higher than i t could collect from customers taking in exchange a claim on the utilitys transmission assets As currently conceived the plan would allow the utility to sell billi on in bonds that would be repaid by medium and large businesses In exchang e the state would hold a fiveyear option to purchase the companys power lines for billion or twice their book value Rescue Plan Uncertain Lawmakers and the utility say the bill still has a long way to go Senate E nergy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen DRedondo Beach when asked if the Senate would support the bill as amended by the Assembly had this to say At this point I think people may be better off buying a Power Ball ticket she said Theres still a long way to go before it gets to the Senate Even if the plan clears the Legislature it will likely have to get by the voters as well Consumer groups which want utility shareholders to foot th e bill are preparing a ballot initiative to overturn whatever lawmakers ap prove If lawmakers dont come to an agreement the governor could extend the spec ial session but Maviglio said Davis wont take that step Southern California Edison needs the package so it can deal with its credit ors who have been waiting since the utility first defaulted on power bills and debtservice obligations in January in an effort to conserve cash As of July the utility had billion in unpaid and overdue obligatio ns including million owed to power suppliers and million in debt payments Southern California Edison also owes billion to small power generators known as qualifying facilities Some of those generators had threatened ea rlier this summer to pull the utility into bankruptcy The utility has worked out a schedule to repay million in pastdue QF bills The QFs were paid of what theyre owed in June but the remainin g payments hinge on the rescue package Creditors will likely lose faith in a negotiated solution if lawmakers don t act by Sept said Richard Cortright a director at Standard Poors We could see another bankruptcy here Cortright said We really are at t he precipice An Opening On Bankruptcy The plan isnt necessarily a cureall As reported ratings agencies have s aid excluding large power suppliers from being compensated under the legisl ation which now appears to be the price of passage could delay the recove ry of Southern California Edisons credit ratings or even provoke creditors to push the utility into bankruptcy Pacific Gas Electric frustrated by the political and regulatory process scrapped talks on its own rescue package in April and put itself in the ha nds of the US Bankruptcy Court Southern California Edison on the other hand has long maintained it wont file for bankruptcy at least until recently Last week Edison said for the first time that the company may voluntarily seek bankruptcy protection if a deal isnt reached We would not foreclose on all of our options Brian Bennett Edison Inter national vice president of external affairs said last week If Southern California Edison followed Pacific Gas Electric threequarte rs of the states electricity consumers would be served by bankrupt utiliti es Small power suppliers could also be pulled down threatening the state s power supply To be sure this isnt the first time Edison and others have said deadlines were serious The most recent to elapse was Aug According to the Apri l MOU failure by the Legislature to act by that date would give Edison or the state the right to pull out of the agreement Neither did If lawmakers again fail to act Southern California Edison could return to the federal courts where it had pursued a case based on the socalled file d rate doctrine a set of precedents holding that utilities are entitled to recover costs incurred serving their customers If Edison were to win the case and legal experts consider the principle s olid it could recover its losses without going through Bankruptcy Court Some say having a real deadline could stiffen resolve to get a deal done Some people say negotiations dont come together until theres a deadline said Steve Fetter managing director of the global power group at Fitch Were at that point By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Fitch Rates California B RANs F FitchNYSeptember Fitch rates the State of Californias bill ion revenue anticipation notes RANsF The notes expected Sep t through negotiation with a syndicate led by Lehman Brothers will be dated the date of delivery and will be due on June The issue will include fixedrate notes and index notes the fixedrate notes will not be callable and the index notes will be callable to the extent specified by t he state treasurer at the time of sale The notes are not general obligations of California They are secured by unapplied moneys in the general fund including transfe rs and internal borrowings as permitted by law subject to prior use for sc hools and higher education debt service on general obligations and commerc ial paper and reimbursement of advances to the general fund from special fu nds as required by law The notes are being issued to provide liquidity for the general fund While Californias financial operations have been very successful in the past fe w years with revenues far in excess of estimates the general fund has thi s year advanced billion for the purchase of electric power pursuant to the state program administered by the Department of Water Resources Reimb ursement is anticipated from the proceeds of power revenue bonds to be issu ed by DWR but is not now expected until November In addition to this drai n revenues for were revised downward in May by some billion a nd expenditures for the year will be in excess of revenues The notes are well secured With the power purchase reimbursement received expected in November the notes will be covered times x by ending b alance and borrowable resources Should the reimbursement be delayed beyond June borrowable resources would cover note principal x With reimbursement ending balance and borrowable funds would be a generous of estimated receipts and without a much narrower The notes are a m oderate of cash flow or without the power purchase reimbursement At June with reimbursement the general fund cash balance would be billion held in the special fund for economic uncertainties and borro wable funds would hold billion without the borrowable funds would amou nt to billion This indicates that note repayment could be met if reimbursement is not rec eived but it would leave the state with a general fund deficit and a steep reduction in the balances of other funds Economic assumptions appear reasonable with employment dropping from more than growth to in and in and personal income at a nd respectively Revenues for this year were lowered in May and perso nal income taxes are expected to yield less than last year and sales tax es to increase only although the rate will automatically rise by in January Risks to the forecast include the difficulty in predicting t he volatile capital gains bonus and options portion of the income tax and uncertainty over the trend of the economy California has been outperformin g the nation but in July employment rose only the lowest rate since October Yet the first months revenues in July were over the e stimates with the income tax ahead by and the sales tax Bank a nd corporation taxes remain weak Dan Walters States infrastructure crisis grows but no one seems to have a plan Published Sept If the true outofpocket costs of Californias energy fiasco borne by rate payers taxpayers creditors and utility stockholders were to be totaled t he number could easily surpass billion And by happenstance thats ab out what experts say California needs to spend on critical infrastructure i mprovements such as new and remodeled schools waterworks and transportati on systems over the next decade The money wasted on the energy crisis is gone it remains only for politici ans including those who created or exacerbated the debacle to decide who gets stuck with the bill But as they pick at the carcass of the energy cri sis politicians also confront the harsh reality that the states evergrow ing population and rapidly changing economy are continuing to create pressu res for infrastructure investment And its clear that Gov Gray Davis leg islators and others charged with resolving Californias infrastructure cris is dont have a plan to do it With just two weeks remaining in the legislative session lawmakers ha ve barely started on fashioning bond issues to be placed before voters next year The Legislatures own budget office is renewing its perennial sugges tion that the governor and lawmakers devise a comprehensive multiyear capi tal improvement program rather than do what they usually do slap together a package of bond issues at the last moment with numbers plucked from thin air But while politicians pay lip service to such a rational and businessl ike approach theyre not likely to do it A twohouse conference committee was convened the other day to begin workin g on the single biggest piece of the bond package one that would finance s orely needed elementary and high schools and colleges not only new buildin gs but repairs and upgrades to old ones Funds from a billion school bond approved by voters in have been spent and a coalition of educators says billion more is needed The Le gislatures budget office says the state could issue up to billion in a dditional general obligation bonds for all purposes including schools if the borrowings were spaced out to avoid overloading the bond market But how big a bond package should be placed before voters is just one quest ion to be answered in the next couple of weeks Legislators must also decid e how the proceeds are to be divided among various educational levels and they must resolve a very nasty squabble over allocation of K money For years California parceled out school bond money on a moreorless firs tcome firstserved basis Districts that put together local financing and specific construction plans were given priority But those first in line t ended to be affluent suburban districts while big urban districts such as Los Angeles Unified dawdled A lawsuit was filed last year to overturn the state allocation process and the state agreed to change its method to one funneling more money to the urban schools That in turn has created a pol itical backlash among legislators from rural and suburban districts whose p rojects have suddenly been pushed back Publicly legislators on the conference committee say theyre committed to helping every district build and maintain safe uncrowded and attractive sc hools for every one of Californias nearly million K students But the y know that not every need can be satisfied and by deciding how big a bond issue is to be offered and settling on how the money is to be divvied the yll be engaging in a form of rationing In that sense the school bond wrangle is a metaphor for Californias large r infrastructure crisis There wont be enough to meet every demand Not ev ery car can be driven on the roadways simultaneously not every student can have a seat in a good classroom and not everyones thirst for water can b e satisfied The politics of rationing who gets what and at what cost will dominat e the Capitol for years to come even if the rword is never uttered public ly And that billion blown on the energy crisis would have come in ver y handy right about now States Long term Power Contracts Could be too High all the way to By Ed Mendel September SACRAMENTO One of the unintended legaci es of the failed electricity deregulation plan and the crisis it spawned may force the state to pay abovemarket prices for power for the rest of th e decade The dozens of longterm power contracts signed by the state earl ier this year as it desperately sought to reduce soaring prices will be p robed by a committee after the Legislature adjourns later this month I t hink it is important we discern whether there are opportunities for reshapi ng some of those contracts in the future said Assemblyman Fred Keeley D Boulder Creek chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee The plan pursued by the administration of Gov Gray Davis to tame soaring power pri ces on the spot market offered generators a deal Lower prices now in excha nge for prices likely to be a little above market in the future When powe r prices fell in June the administration declared that the plan had worked The spot market shrunk by the increasing amount of power obtained throug h contracts is now said to tilt toward buyers rather than sellers But ir onically as prices on the spot market fell they also raised questions abo ut whether the contracts are too much of a good thing both in price and qu antity The spot market has already fallen below contract prices at times this year In the initial administration forecast in April the longterm contracts were expected to be below average noncontracted prices through Now lower spotmarket prices have reversed the forecast An update in July by the same administration consultants Navigant ConsultingMontague DeRose expects the average price of power on the spot market to be well be low the average contracted price from through As for the volume under contract the forecast is that the amount of power that the state mu st buy on the spot market will shrink and nearly disappear in before beginning to grow again The state with contracts worth roughly bi llion has been forced to sell some surplus power at a loss Experts say a surplus is not unusual when power buyers make large purchases The large v olume of power under contract also creates other problems It limits the gr owth of power from clean renewable sources wind solar and geothermal that are not prone to price spikes like natural gas Businesses that wa nt to shop around for cheaper power which was the point of deregulation m ay be forced to stay in the state system to prevent the contract payments f rom falling too heavily on residential consumers Still Keeley faces an u phill battle as his committee looks at reopening the contracts The governo rs top energy adviser S David Freeman defends the contracts as insuran ce against runaway spotmarket prices And the two California generators Calpine and Sempra who hold the biggest state contracts and say they inte nd to be good citizens vigorously defend their contracts as being good dea ls for the state A Calpine senior vice president Jim Macias said its fo ur contracts to provide megawatts over years are at very competiti ve rates an average of per megawatt hour The president of Sempra Ene rgy Resources Michael Niggli said his firm has been buying power sometim es at a loss to meet its contract When new plants come on line in h e said Sempras rates will vary with the price of natural gas and be among the lowest

California from a generator whose stock they owned setting up a clash of official duties personal interestsof the people fired disclosed below State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics The consultants were involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock they owned setting up a clash of official duties personal interests JEFFREY L RABIN DARYL KELLEY RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company The Davis administration stung by charges of excessive secrecy disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit according to state records All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned In addition the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled Top advisors to Gov Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements A review of those documents which included stock holdings showed that some of the consultants may have crossed the line said the governors senior advisor Nancy McFadden State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence the governor has not required some of his most influential privatesector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governors energy rescue plan which includes the largest state bond sale in US history The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid a month to among other things help pitch the billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers The companies stand to make an additional million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines Davis contends that Fichera Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor beyond the reach of the states political reform laws Critics question the distinction The governors approach may be convenient for him said Jim Knox executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause but it ignores the law Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest Knox said Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year More than million is being spent by the state on consultants according to state records In the process seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances including investments The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within days of starting work for state agencies Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted Most of the consultants for example failed to state when they bought the energy stocks One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year Jones has accused the governor of a conscious policy of secrecy in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp a San Josebased power generator that has landed the largest share of the billion in longterm state power contracts Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than records show While working for the state Department of Water Resources officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the states behalf More than million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year according to the most recent records available We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks the governors legal affairs secretary Barry Goode said in an interview The highestranking consultant removed Richard Ferreira was hired on a contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for longterm power and negotiating contracts records show A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Ferreira was paid an hour by the state After he disclosed owning as much as in Calpine stock officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the companys contracts Ferreira could not be reached for comment The governors office identified the other four as traders William F Mead Herman Leung Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange a nowdefunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of Californias electricity deregulation Hired by the state in February and March the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between and a month including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California Mead a former Edison engineer said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago He said he bought nearly all of his shares years ago for and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times doubling in value each time Mead said he was called by the head of the states energy buying team Thursday and fired I asked very directly Is this because of the stock and they wouldnt give me an answer Mead said He just said your services are terminated I came up here away from home living in a hotel room trying to keep the lights on trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if Im some sort of criminal I guess its just politics and were the pawns Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state That trader Elaine Griffin who also came from the Power Exchange left the state power buying operation July three days after disclosing her energy industry investment Griffin who the governors office said had obtained another job could not be reached for comment Griffin reported purchasing to of Calpine stock on Feb in her final days working at the electricity exchange A few days later Calpine signed and announced a billion year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources On Feb Griffin joined the state power buying agency just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional billion in power contracts One of those a year deal signed Feb was the longest The state has awarded Calpine about billion in contracts to supply power for up to years In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock two others reported owning stock in Texasbased power marketing giant Enron Corp And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation Bernard Barretto an energy trader who buys energy on the daily spot market said in an interview that he bought about in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb Purchase of Enron Stock Defended I dont see a conflict he said At the time we werent really dealing with Enron I still havent bought from Enron Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job That notice came from Goode the governors lawyer We expect and have always expected the states consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards he wrote That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today If he or she refuses the state will sever its contract with that person However the governors office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors Fichera and Hoffman Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors not consultants and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects Fichera is Davis point man on the governors energy rescue planincluding the unprecedented bond sale He has pitched the plan to lawmakers reporters and the Wall Street financial community Fichera refused to comment on the record Fichera and Hoffmans companies Saber Partners and Blackstone Group prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure intended to pay for past and future power buying Pact Specifies Financial Advice The states contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide financial advisory services to the state The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates That consulting firm was hired on a million contract Like the other two firms it too was hired to provide financial advisory services to the state That firms top advisor Douglas S Montague was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement He reported no power company interests The governors legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract PHOTO Barry Goode above governors legal affairs secretary Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights

Unintended Consequences POWER POINTSNevada Suffers FERC Unintended Consequences By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesThose who have opposed wholesale electricity price controls have been labeled as extreme freemarket ideologues who are insensitive to the practical impacts on peoples lives of high electricity prices But the most common argument against price caps has been logical not ideological Price controls have never worked Market participants always find a way around the rules This week the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decided that it will have to consider at its meeting next week revisions to its June price control ruling The initial price cap rule set by the California Independent System Operator last spring was only a few paragraphs long Each successive price cap order has gotten longer though effectiveness still appears out of reach The FERCs April order was pages long the June order was pages And now additional rules are on call to plug the new loopholes The revisions will also try to repair damage done to the market by the June order During a spell of very hot weather Monday Sierra Pacific Resources SRP subsidiary Nevada Power had to initiate limited rolling blackouts to a small number of customers for minutes The company attributed the blackouts in part to the new price controls Sierra Pacifics chief spokesman Paul Heagen provided a birds eye view of the practical realities of the FERCs new price cap regime Power Points After having a few days to look into it can you say that price caps definitely contributed to blackouts in Nevada on Monday Paul Heagen Yes but first let me say that all of it was unintentional FERC was trying to do the right thing Price caps were a noble effort to solve a real problem in California But on Monday the market needed speed and clarity to function It had neither and that can be attributed to the price caps Normally in one or two phone calls we could have got what we needed On Monday we were five to six calls into it and still on the phone Price caps are having the unintended consequence of dragging other states into the California morass We have this artificial environment which we are all trying to sort through PP How specifically are the caps having this effect PH There are a couple of elements The premium for power sold to California is supposed to reflect concerns about credit That in an open market is no big deal but in a constrained situation the seller will grab it because now its his only chance to make money Also the way this is set up they look backwards They determine the price after the fact I cant think of any business in the world where you sell a product and find out later what price you sold at This had a very chilling effect on peoples willingness to sell Normally a cloud cover comes in and a utility has a little extra power to sell in the realtime market Normally those little megawatt packets move pretty easily and thats really important for maintaining reliability With the price cap utilities hunkered down Selling at wasnt worth the risk They figured they might as well hang on in case they needed it Also we have a voluntary curtailment program that allows us to share savings with customers who agree to curtail use If the market is say we might pay them MWh to curtail demand But in a mkt we can offer them such a small amount of money that they stay on PP Have you talked to FERC about these problems with the price controls PH Weve had a senior team in Washington DC at the FERC since last week Right away we saw another effect of the FERC order It penalizes companies like ours that signed longterm supply contracts before the order because many of those deals were done at prices above the price cap The biggest issue for us is did FERC really mean to penalize companies like us that planned ahead Its longterm contracts that provide price stability Its unfair to our customers to expect them to pay for longterm contracts that have been undercut by price caps If we get into a situation where we have a little extra to sell now we cant recover our costs PP With such high prices the past year a lot of small oilfired turbines have been dusted off and put into service on time for this summer Traders for other southwest utilities have said that all these little turbines have been very helpful when supplies got tight earlier in the year but they werent available this week because they cost more to run than the price cap Did you see the same thing PH We have some small turbines that we put in Reno and the Lake Tahoe area in the last few months They were supposed to provide peak power but they get uneconomic in a hurry under the price cap scheme You know weve tried to isolate ourselves as best we could from the California situation and behave very independent of how California behaves So Nevada is a great test case to see if price caps have an unintended effect outside of California We were able to minimize the impact on our customers Monday but the situation has maximized the attention of the country on the impact of price caps By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END DOW JONES NEWS PM PM EDT

salary goes to consultant with one years experience in the field State officials say she is doing a good job By JEFFREY L RABIN DARYL KELLEY Times Staff Writers The Davis administration is paying a young business consultant with barely a years experience in the energy industry annually to head a team of traders who secure Californias daily electricity supply State officials hired Susan T Lee in April without competitive bidding under an emergency declaration by Gov Gray Davis Lees contract is equal to the a month that Davis pays his chief energy advisor S David Freeman a top utility executive for decades The twoyear contract will pay Lee up to to oversee the states daytoday energy purchases totaling billions of dollars a year Lees contract reflects the pressure and difficulties the state says it faces to fill key jobs in its new role as one of the nations largest power buyers a role that it took on in January as Californias utilities faltered Lees contract was one of about a dozen released Monday and among the largest Reached at her Sacramento office Lee would not discuss her contract She said only that she heads a person team of traders and schedulers that works long hours to keep Californias power flowing Pete Garris a contracts manager for the state Department of Water Resources who recruited Lee said he met her at industry meetings and had been impressed by her savvy He said he gave her a pay raise to lure her to state service in April after Ron Shimizu her boss at Mieco Inc a trading firm in Long Beach recommended her Shimizu refused comment Tuesday The state according to Garris must compete for employees against an aggressive energy industry and pay good salaries to stay in the game You can consider this situation to be very extraordinary Garris said Unless we can get permanent and fulltime positions approved these are the rules we have to follow to be able to hire consultants Garris insisted that it is unfair to compare Lees contract with the sixmonth deal that Freemanthe former boss at several major utilitiesstruck with the governor I dont want to compare Susan Lee to David Freeman Garris said David comes from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Susan came from a private power marketer With Susan we just followed the standard formula In her new job Lee will direct an immensely complicated aroundtheclock operation responsible for procuring energy scheduling power and associated transmission and reconciling deviations between contracts and deliveries according to her contract Lees resume attached to the contract shows that she had no experience in the energy field until March when she joined Mieco There she was a trader and power scheduler not a manager She was only here for a year or so said Dina Alvarez an administrative manager for the company A graduate of UCLA with a degree in economics she worked as a pension and benefits manager in Los Angeles and New York before joining Mieco Lees contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week not only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field She is being paid an hour and can earn a maximum of including expenses by April Another new consultant William L Green has almost a quarter of a century of experience working for the Bonneville Power Administration Pacific Gas Electric and the California Independent System Operator He is being paid an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the states accounting of energy purchases His twoyear deal is worth up to They are not alone in cutting lucrative deals Richard Ferreira the former assistant general manager at the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District has a contract and is being paid an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts He worked for the Department of Water Resources for years before joining the Sacramento agency in Hardy Energy Consulting also has a sixmonth contract that calls for Randy Harvey to be paid an hour Harvey has a quarter of a century of energy experience particularly at the Bonneville Power Administration where he was chief executive officer from to Lees recruiter Garris said her lack of experience is not a concern So far shes done an excellent job he said She has the skills and she has the ability She was doing a similar job Dozens of consultants including Lee have been hired since January when Davis declared an energy emergency and set up a special arm of government to buy power The state filled a vacuum when generators refused to sell to PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric because they were no longer considered creditworthy said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the Department of Water Resources Hidalgo said that about of the people now working for the division are consultants The rest are state employees As part of the process Lees unit oversees the purchase of power a day ahead of when it is needed Hidalgo said Lee is involved in contracts

marketers cannot sell above cap and generators must be subject to cost filings if they do and the result is black outs Alan Tuesday July Copyright Las Vegas ReviewJournal POWER SHORTAGES LV valley endures blackouts Utility officials expect supplies to stay tight as hot weather continues this week By JOHN G EDWARDS REVIEWJOURNAL The first rolling blackouts in Southern Nevada history hit the Las Vegas Valley on Monday with a speed that surprised even Nevada Power Co The utility company declared a red alert and initiated rolling blackouts that left an estimated customers without power It had reported customers were affected but later revised the number of customers who lost electricity The blackouts started at pm and ended at pm the utility said Nevada Power attributed the power shortages to several factors unusually high temperatures for this time of year three generation unit outages the areas rapid growth power shortages in California and possibly the wholesale power price caps that federal regulators imposed last month What killed us was the temperature was unbelievable said Paul Heagan vice president of Sierra Pacific Resources the holding company for Nevada Power The Las Vegas temperature soared to a nearrecord degrees As for the rest of the week power supply is going to be tight Heagan said The prospects this week are kind of tough to call The company logged record demand for power megawatts at pm Monday The previous alltime high was megawatts on Aug A megawatt is roughly the amount of power needed to supply houses By contrast on July last year the utility hit megawatts when the temperature was degrees Heagan said The company targeted nonemergency areas for Mondays rolling blackouts which affected mostly residential customers Nevada Power spokesmen declined to identify the affected areas even after the emergency was over Witnesses said power went out in one area of the Northwest and one area of the east valley Electricity customers in the affected areas said the blackouts lasted between and minutes Several traffic signals went out including those at the intersections of Buffalo Drive and Lake Mead Boulevard Tenaya Way and Lake Mead and Boulder Highway at US Highway Las Vegas Police Department officials reported few traffic problems because of the blackouts For the most part people reported few problems We only had a few customers and we couldnt do Western Union transactions without a computer but with the other customers we just winged it said Michelle Hitt a customer service representative at Mail Boxes Etc W Lake Mead Blvd Hitt said power at his store was out about minutes Across the street an assistant manager for the Vons supermarket at W Lake Mead Blvd said customers could not check out when the stores power turned off The Roadhouse Grill at Lake Mead Boulevard and Tenaya Way was shut down for about minutes shortly after pm restaurant manager Kim Tuerk said We had to evacuate the building because of health department and fire codes but it was no big deal he said Heagan said Nevada Power will start its rolling blackouts in other areas of the valley if it needs to cut power again this week The utilitys policy calls for no notification to areas that will lose power unlike California where a minimum of hours notice is required Nevada Power fears that notification would be used by burglars to locate unoccupied houses during the emergency Tim Hay state consumer advocate said he thinks customers in affected areas should be notified of possible outages They need to provide notice to affected areas at least in general areas to help people prepare Hay said Elsewhere in the valley consumers and businesses continued operating normally during the emergency Meadows mall General Manager Frank Wheat said power was not affected at the shopping center We know rolling blackouts can occur he said We do have backup generators for emergency lighting during hours of darkness but not for all the stores Spokespeople at University Medical Center and Sunrise Hospital also said they were not affected by Mondays blackouts and have their own backup power supplies Minta Albietz vice president of maternalchild services at Sunrise We have our own little power plant in the back We can generate our own power for days longer as long as we have fuel The company said its power woes began Friday when it internally declared a yellow alert and warned employees that it was running short of power Heagan said On Friday Nevada Power customers were pulling down megawatts the second or thirdhighest peak in the company history he said Meanwhile one of Nevada Powers electrical generation units at the Reid Gardner site miles north of Las Vegas has been down since Friday because of a leaking boiler he said Also Southern California Edison which operates the Mohave Generating Station at Laughlin for several utilities notified the company Friday that two of Nevada Powers units were down Nevada Power said it was able to obtain additional power on the spot market and avoid blackouts last week and did not need to seek any power use curtailment by major users The yellow alert continued through the weekend a period when electric consumption usually declines because businesses are closed and many people are driving around The company made arrangements to buy another megawatts of electricity Monday when most businesses reopened That got eaten up by early afternoon Heagan said The utility said casinos reduced about megawatts by switching to backup generators and starting conservation measures But several Strip casino operators said they received no requests to conserve power or to turn on their backup generation units Nevada Power hasnt asked us to shed power load said Debbie Munch Park Place Entertainment spokeswoman They asked us to cut our power usage a couple of times last summer and we did so If they do ask us well do what we can to help the community Mandalay Resort Group and MGM Mirage executives said they were not asked to cut their power use Monday Our facilities guys said nobodys asked us for anything and we havent done anything said Fred Lewis Aladdin spokesman At first glance it appears the problem was handled very well said Don Soderberg chairman of the Public Utilities Commission which regulates Nevada Power Its always hard to predict when were going to have abnormal temperatures and power plants are going to go offline Soderberg said The situation he added underlines the need to build more power plants Mondays degree high was one degree shy of the record for the date The heat follows the warmest May on record said Joe Nemeth a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service Temperatures are expected to stay warm but tapering off as the week progresses and the risk for thunderstorms increases meteorologists reported Highs will stay in the tripledigit range but drop to degrees today on Wednesday on Thursday and on Friday A less than percent chance for rain exists today a chance that increases to percent Wednesday Forecasters expect a to percent chance of rain the rest of the week This story is located at

the ir orginal offset NOx quantities Alan Comnes Original Message From Schoen Mary Sent Monday June PM To Comnes Alan Cc Guerrero Janel Subject Re FW Davis Eases Power Plant Pollution Rules The following is more explanation about the recent Executive Order EO signed by the Governor of California on June In order to avoid future blackouts Governor Gray Davis is waiving limits on hours of operati on and the associated emissions for natural gasfired peaker units if they adhere to certain conditions He is requesting local air districts to allo w natural gasfired peaker power plants to operate in excess of their hourly daily quarterly andor annual emission limitations if they do the followin g Agree to sell power to the California Department of Water Resources or t o a utility located in California To serve an operating utilitys own load Agree to sell to another Californiabased utility The gasfired peaker units must also pay a mitigation fee to the local air districts of per pound of oxides of nitrogen NOx and per poun d of carbon monoxide CO emitted The Governor set this number it is however the same amount the South Coast AQMD is charging for NOx offsets i n the modifications it made to the RECLAIM program These mitigation fees wi ll be used to clean up or retire other sources of pollution in the same air basin The Governor is ordering the California Air Resources Board to work with the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that power plants willin g to operate under this order obtain the necessary approvals As you know there are many peaking plants that are close to exhausting the ir allowable operating hours Once these facilities exhaust the amount of allowable hours they would have to either shut down the units or negotiate an agreement with the local air agency to continue to operate With the exception of Mirant Potrero in San Francisco and Reliant Energy Mandalay in Ventura County no facilities have negotiated such agreements The EO issu ed by the Governor gives the peaker facilities a blanket approval to operate beyond the restrictions The Governor believes that waiving of the requirements will also minimize reliance on backup dieselfired generators which have even higher emissions than the natural gas peakers In my previous discussions with the US EPA Region they did say they were willi ng to work with the state to provide variances to power plants operating limits However in the two instances mentioned above the EPA required t he plants to agree to install pollution control equipment at a specific future date This aspect of the agreement was critical to EPA because the increased emissions from the peakers with increased hours are now significa nt enough major source status to trigger New Source Review which requires installation of Best Available Control Technology BACT The EO by the Governor makes no mention of future controls According to municipal utilities and other generators the Governors actio n could provide up to Megawatts of additional power this summer by expanding the number of hours of operation at natural gasfired plants T he EO will expire on October unless revoked modified or extended by further executive order The air director of the Ventura air board has already sent comments opposing this order due to its negative air impacts Environmentalists will also no doubt object The EPA has not yet responded Despite the potential negative environmental effects the political pressur e will be strong to let these plants operate I will keep my ears open for additional

Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOGov Gray Davis agreed Monday to lift air emission limits on heavily polluting power plants and allow them to run at capacity this summe r as long as the electricity they

the state pays for electricity produced by natural gasfired power plants said Catherine Witherspoon of the Californi a Air Resources Board Municipal utility districtsincluding the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powerand independent power companies could supply as much as megawatts from socalled peaker plants facilities that generally are permitted to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollu te so heavily That is enough power for more than million homes Other gasfired power plants that have been shut down because of air pollution restrictions also could be started up as a result of the order In a news conference Monday state officials said the order will have the effect of lowering air pollution by limiting the use of far dirtier diesel generators which

Monday We are hopeful and doing lobbying to push for for no action outside of California given the unworkability and meaninglessness of price controls outside of CA This is an effort and not a promise of course Some action in CA seems more than likely and the best bet seem to be extending the current proxy mitigation to all hours The article below raises the possibility of reissuing the refund orders recall that they began in March for the month of January to cover all hours and not just during Stage Such reissued refund order could extend back to Oct Alan Comnes Wednesday June Federal Panel May Extend Price Limits Utilities Regulatory commission weighs expanding the plan beyond emergencies and throughout the West By RICARDO ALONSOZALDIVAR Times Staff Writer WASHINGTONThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission responding to pressure from lawmakers state officials and consumers is considering a significant expansion of its plan to limit California electricity prices this summer senior agency officials said Tuesday Commissioners and staff members are engaged in intense negotiations in advance of a key meeting Monday to finalize an emergency plan for California and the West According to several commission officials the options being discussed include Extending FERCs current price limitsnow in effect only during power emergencies in Californiato hours a day seven days a week The limits intended to prevent price spikes were invoked during two emergencies last month and resulted in immediate cuts in the price of wholesale electricity FERC is also considering applying such limits throughout the West Requiring power generators in the entire Western region to sell available electricity to California or into their local power grids during emergencies reducing the threat of blackouts Establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell electricity back into the grid during peak usage times Some companies that have longterm power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by scaling back their operations and selling electricity Tightening rules on what energy marketersfirms that buy and resell power contracts much like stockbrokers trade sharescan charge for their electricity Expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies That refund order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies The measures under consideration stop short of the price caps being sought by Gov Gray Davis and California Democrats But they may go far enough to provide an acceptable compromise The whole thing is in flux but it is moving toward a much more effective price mitigation plan not only for California but for the West said an agency official Strong political pressure from Senate Democrats and House Republicans appears to have galvanized FERC into taking a more decisive role Were sort of the last to get it the official said FERC has been bitterly criticized by Davis for abandoning California FERC Chairman Curtis L Hebert Jr has responded by citing dozens of modest FERC actions to assist the state But Hebert has resisted Davis central demand that FERC use its legal authority to order a temporary return to fixed electricity rates Such fixed rates based on the cost of producing power plus an allowance for profit were standard before deregulation The politics of the situation have changed significantly and commissioners are not immune to politics said another senior agency official The message from Capitol Hill has gotten stronger with a Democratic Senate Even the Bush administration is saying we should make sure there is no price gouging FERC members have been summoned to testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen Joseph I Lieberman DConn a week from today Meanwhile Sen Jeff Bingaman DNM the new Senate Energy Committee chairman has told FERC he will move legislation to cap electricity rates in the West unless it acts soon Agency officials said commissioners do not want to face Lieberman next week emptyhanded House Republicans have also been prodding the agency On Tuesday Energy Committee Chairman WJ Billy Tauzin RLa wrote Hebert to urge Westernwide roundtheclock price limits We strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy within the entire Western Systems Coordinating Council wrote Tauzin referring to the Western power grid FERC officials said a strong effort is underway to achieve a consensus on the fivemember commission lately riven by ideology but now bolstered by two new pragmatic commissioners who favor active oversight of industry Commissioner William Massey who for months has been a lonely dissenter is continuing to press for the traditional price caps sought by Davis officials said Once marginalized Massey apparently is now being actively wooed by the other members S David Freeman an energy advisor to Gov Davis said Tuesday that expanding FERCs current price limits would be a positive step But he added that the governor continues to advocate a return to traditional fixed rates Any strengthening of the FERC plan is in the public interest Freeman told reporters at a Washington news conference FERCs price limits are not keyed to a particular dollar amount but are flexible When a power emergency is called by the state FERCs plan limits the price that generators can charge to what it costs to produce power at the least efficient plant running at that time The costs of all the plants are determined beforehand by Californias grid operator based on data filed by the generators Another requirement of the FERC plan forces generators using the California grid to sell any power they have available during emergency conditions When the price limits were tested in two emergencies late last month prices came down quickly But power sellers complained that the limits were too strict And by the second emergency there was evidence that some sellers had started finding ways around the limits Copyright Los Angeles Times

more production from heavily polluting peaker facilities By DAN MORAIN Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOGov Gray Davis agreed Monday to lift air emission limits on heavily polluting power plants and allow them to run at capacity this summer as long as the electricity they produce is sold in the state State officials said the plants must be pressed into use to avoid blackouts Davis executive order lets the generators build the cost of air pollution fines into the price the state pays for electricity produced by natural gasfired power plants said Catherine Witherspoon of the California Air Resources Board Municipal utility districtsincluding the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powerand independent power companies could supply as much as megawatts from socalled peaker plants facilities that generally are permitted to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollute so heavily That is enough power for more than million homes Other gasfired power plants that have been shut down because of air pollution restrictions also could be started up as a result of the order In a news conference Monday state officials said the order will have the effect of lowering air pollution

scrutiny Posted at pm PDT Sunday June BY JENNIFER BJORHUS Mercury News State officials investigating Californias extraordinary energy prices are zeroing in on how energy traders use the technology tools of their profession from email and specialized software to Internet energy data sites and online trading floors This technology may be key they say to helping traders acquire the intimate knowledge needed to manipulate Californias troubled energy market With minutetominute knowledge of market conditions some traders went even further two lawsuits charge illegally coordinating bids and sending electricity prices to recordbreaking levels The state Attorney Generals Office has subpoenaed from power generators software used to formulate bidding strategies names of employees providing computer support communications with a prominent industry Web site and the name of firms that handle computer networks And a state Senate committee has hired an information technology consultant to help them look into how traders tracked patterns on the states Internetbased spot market among other things Once you were knowledgeable about its operations the opportunity to game it became pretty obvious said Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove who chairs the committee Antitrust laws Working together or colluding to fix prices is illegal and violates state and federal antitrust laws Sharing sensitive industry data if it involved financial markets would be considered insider trading and would be treated far differently said Anjali Sheffrin head of market analysis for the Independent System Operator which manages the states power grid The Securities and Exchange Commission polices the nations stock markets but wholesale energy trading goes largely unwatched by federal regulators San Diego attorney Mike Aguirre agreed with Sheffrin Aguirre is part of a team of lawyers who have filed two lawsuits against leading power generators such as Dynegy Duke Energy and Williams Energy Services Its basically an embryonic kind of trading market that involves the sharing of inside information and the only reason theyre getting away with it is theres no SEC cop he said Energy companies dismiss these charges as speculation All of these What ifs said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel The fact of the matter is weve played by the rules weve acted ethically we havent done anything wrong Energy companies say the way they use technology is all above board Thats something that were proud of that we have all of the tools to do the best possible job in the trading said Paula HallCollins spokeswoman for Tulsabased Williams Co Not everyone is persuaded that energy companies actually conspired to hike prices Some public officials and energy industry players call the technology focus a red herring Californias energy problems are far more fundamental they say than clickhappy energy traders with spreadsheets The nowdefunct California Power Exchange for example was something of a sitting duck unable to freely shop around for the best electricity prices Wealth of data Other experts believe the sheer wealth of data floating around from river flows to day forecasts of power line outages gives traders an unfair advantage Thats exactly the issue said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute The issue is whether all this information is actually doing more harm to competition than benefit to the efficiency of procuring and selling power The best illustration of this is a somewhat legendary Web site blunder In that incident an energy industry association called the Western Systems Coordinating Council posted highly sensitive realtime data about transmission of extrahigh voltage electricity in California Alarmed that such information could be used to game the market the states grid operator last October demanded that the trade group take the information off the site which it did A former energy trader who spoke to the Mercury News on the condition that he not be identified said When you can calculate exactly what a market needs and where its surplus is going to come from then you have the ability to essentially fix prices Its like a linear equation You know exactly what the end equation is going to be At issue are how traders employ the tools that like the telephone and fax machine are standard in trading electricity software data Web sites and Internet energy exchanges Dunn and other public officials acknowledge that it isnt clear how technology was used in suspected abuses And no one has turned up slamdunk evidence of collusion The ISO has done extensive studies that conclude traders drove up prices through gaming The high prices have cost the state at least billion since May Energy traders trade information among themselves the ISOs Sheffrin charged comparing it to insidertrading These traders are calling each other up all the time The former energy trader who talked to the Mercury News agreed energy traders as a very incestuous group They talk and email every day Sometimes many many many times a day he said Some of them have instant messaging He said he believes it could amount to de facto collusion But proving collusion in court is extremely difficult The sticking point said UCs Borenstein is showing exactly what energy traders did with the information These guys arent actually sitting down in a room together Borenstein said They sort of watched each other and said Well other firms are keeping capacity out and we will too The former energy trader said he doubted that investigators would prove collusion because traders will cover their tracks Theyre expunging harddrive data as we speak he said The documents are long gone Lawsuits Two classaction lawsuits filed on behalf of taxpayers by San Francisco and by Lt Gov Cruz Bustamante accuse the energy companies of colluding to drive up prices Neither lawsuit clearly documents how the energy companies engaged in secretive datasharing The Bustamante suit however targets a new Internet site for wholesale energy trading launched last fall by heavyhitter energy companies such as Duke and Reliant The Atlantabased Web site IntercontinentalExchange is one of at least a dozen such electronic trading floors that have popped up on the Internet in the last four years None of these trading exchanges which analysts say are the wave of the future are regulated IntercontinentalExchange declined to comment since it is not a party to the suit The lawsuit charges the site has several features that support collusive behavior amongst market participants One is that only approved traders have access to IntercontinentalExchange and those traders can pick who they want to trade with and shut other traders out And more importantly Aguirre said the energy companies who own many of these Web exchanges get the tremendous benefit of having a record of all the trades It gives them an enormous amount of market data that no one else has access to he said Its a conduit for collusion Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at or

<1409875.1075843167337.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,alan.comnes@enron.com,2000-12-01 04:17:00,Re Governors Response to FERC Cc that Jeff D will give us his reactions but in the mean time here s the proposal December Honorable James Hoecker Chairman Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC Dear Chairman Hoecker I told you on November in San Diego that by December I would respond to your plan with my suggestions to protect the interests of the people and businesses of California by providing reliable electricity supplies at the lowest reasonable cost Obviously a complete plan by the State of Californ ia must await your review of my suggested changes to your proposed order and final action on that order on December This letter outlines the first steps toward a plan that my administration is developing based on extensive ongoing discussions with legislative leaders consumers business utilitie s generators environmentalists labor agricultural interests and other California stakeholders This emerging plan will indicate to you that I am prepared to act with the concurrence of the Legislature in California to fulfill our obligations to assure reliable service at reasonable costs to the consumer The free market applied to electricity can work but only if market conditions allow for real competition and if all parties act responsibly The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has found that the wholesal e market in California is dysfunctional and that the wholesale prices charged by generators in your jurisdiction are unjust and unreasonable For that reason I renew my call for the FERC to undertake the actions that are critical and clearly within your jurisdiction to order retroactiv e refunds to the consumers who have been harmed this year and to establish hard price and bid caps that will protect consumers until the energy marketplace becomes truly competitive I do not believe that your proposed MW clearing price limit will provide any real protection I again ask you to impose real price and bid caps in the MW range on a transitiona l basis over the next months If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale markets the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited in scope I cannot in good conscience however forego any measure that wou ld serve to protect the people of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale markets will not victimize Californians again Since our meeting in San Diego several things have occurred which influenc e my current thinking On November the California Energy Commission CEC published the results of a detailed bottomup study of available electricity supply for It shows that taking into account expected load growth firm and dynamically scheduled imports and new supply already under construction or under contract California should be able to avoid emergencies if supplie s are properly managed and scheduled This presumes of course no gaming or withholding by sellers in wholesale markets and an absence of panic buying But the CEC study also shows that supplies are sufficiently tight that mark et power will exist and will need to be mitigated during periods of high deman d The same opportunity for wholesale price gouging through the exercise of market power and withholding that existed in summer will exist in You must take decisive action to preclude such behavior During the week of November while you and regulatory commissioners from around the country were in San Diego California was subjected to several Stage Alerts reflecting severe shortages of generation even though these are the lowest load months of the year Prices were astronomical More than megawatts of generation were offline at the same time including over megawatts for unscheduled outages I will recommend steps to assure that existing resources in California are availab le to meet Californias local energy needs and that information and the authority necessary to prevent a recurrence of such events are available to state and local officials On November the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and Electricity Oversight Board EOB filed comments with you that summarize th e current status of their ongoing investigations They confirm the conclusion s of the independent market monitors that California has been victimized by t he exercise of market power by merchant generators and marketers during summer and fall The state agencies have been hampered in their investigation s by the refusal of merchant generators to provide information that will both assist in the understanding of last summers prices and in the fashionin g of remedies to assure that we are not victimized again I urge you to compel t he necessary disclosure of information to complete these investigations On November the CPUC issued an Environmental Impact Report EIR on the proposal by PGE to move its hydroelectric facilities out of the regulated utility The EIR concludes that such a project would cause significant unmitigated harm to the environment and recommends retention as the preferr ed alternative This suggests that Californias course of generation divest iture by utilities may be slowed or stopped With these events as background I want to describe the steps I have taken and plan to take to begin to address the energy problems in California Increase Supply and Expand Infrastructure During the years preceding my administration virtually no power plants were built in California Since April six power plants representing MW of new generation have been approved by the CEC Five of these plants are under construction and the sixth will begin construction no later than April Twenty more applicants have completed prefiling and have active applications under review by the commission staff Eleven more applications are in the prefiling stage This represents a significant change in policy and performance and responds to the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without abrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and environmental protection Much has been made about the difficulty of siting and permitting generation in California With enactment of AB and the creation of the Governor s Clean Energy Green Team this September California has aggressively committ ed itself to continue to accelerate the siting and permitting of generation an d to coordinate local state and federal government agency review and action Federal and state air quality requirements present unique challenges to the construction and operation of new power plants Through the Green Team we are developing new and creative approaches to meet these challenges workin g with local air quality districts the California Air Resources Board and th e United States Environmental Protection Agency These might for example expand upon the case of the proposed Otay Mesa power plant where mobile emissions credits are being used to offset stationary source emissions that will be generated by the new facility If necessary I will seek legislatio n to enable these new approaches I am also calling on the CPUC to aggressively reduce barriers and to otherwise encourage the locating of distributed generation and cogeneratio n where it is viable cost effective and environmentally sound The CPUC has already initiated action that will provide a forum for expediting certificates for transmission facilities including environmental review Finally I believe it is important to assure that all supplies of electrici ty are available when emergency conditions exist to avoid interruptions such as those experienced last summer and as recently as last week Suggestions we are considering for achieving this include new means of coordinating powerplant maintenance and operations activities Forward Contracting by Utilities Many parties including the FERC have recommended expanding the use of forward contracting by the utilities including multiyear bilateral contracts as a way of reducing exposure to volatile spot market prices The contracts as a part of a larger utility energy portfolio represent an important tool to moderate price volatility and ensure reliability I am asking the CPUC to expeditiously develop benchmarks to assure the reasonableness of these contracts without unfairly second guessing these decisions in later years This process should be in place early in to provide adequate opportuni ty for contracts to be negotiated and in place before Summer Coupled with the forward contracting issue is the question of the obligatio n of utilities to buy and sell all of their electricity through the Californi a Power Exchange PX This issue requires careful consideration since these transactions through the PX are currently subject to full disclosure and safeguards are in place to assure delivery These protections for consumers and business must not be lost Among the suggestions that have been made to ensure that utilities have a costeffective portfolio of energy is the proposal that utilities retain their existing generation as was recommended in the CPUCs environmental impact report regarding PGEs hydroelectric facilities There is growing consensus around this matter I would hope that the paramount objective in this series of regulatory decisions will be the protection of the interests of consumers Invigorating the Demand Side Conservation and efficiency are the cornerstones of Californias energy future Under my Executive Order the State of California has achieved more than MW of load reduction earlier this year during Stage alerts and is moving quickly to add another MW of demand reduction for summer The federal government is following suit for federal facilities The state and federal governments should set an example for similar voluntary load reduction initiatives in the private sector I was pleased to work with the California Grocers Association this summer t o develop a voluntary percent demand reduction program during peak hours f or more than groceries statewide This program must be duplicated in oth er areas where feasible and the business community in California has pledged t o work cooperatively toward that end I am calling on the CPUC to expedite its investigation of the states de mand reduction programs for commercial and industrial users including the interruptible programs Those that are successful should be expanded Those that require change should be modified And new opportunities should be developed to reduce and shift loads during peak hours and short supply The se programs must be in place no later than March to provide adequate opportunity for private sector planning and participation I am also calling on the CPUC and CEC to coordinate efforts to demonstrate and implement programs which provide realtime price signals and energyreduction systems to sophisticated commercial electricity users and to recommend a process for voluntary participation by consumers and small businesses In September I signed historic urgency legislation that provides milli on for demand reduction programs that can be implemented by Summer I als o signed legislation that provides approximately million annually for th e next years for energy efficiency research and development and renewable resource support The CPUC and CEC are aggressively pursuing innovative demand reduction programs using these funds Institutional Reform As I testified at the FERC hearing on November I agree that the stakeholder boards of the California Independent System Operator CAISO an d California Power Exchange present inherent conflicts of interest for their members and must be replaced The composition of these boards is specified by state law both as to size and as to qualifications for directors I will propose legislation to replace the stakeholder boards with independe nt boards that are accountable for their actions and that will consider both the need to assure reliability and the most economic method to do so I intend to move quickly on this aspect of the problem Your concurrence in this effort is extremely important It will little serve the consumers utilities merchant generators or other parties to become embroiled in litigation over exactly what powers Congress conferred on the FERC in or what traditional state powers if any Congress meant to circumscribe or override Recognizing that there may be a need for more extensive reconstitution of these entities as some have suggested I do not intend to let the status q uo continue while those debates are carried on California will alter the composition and membership of the boards so that the entities are in positi on to contribute to achieving the paramount objectives of both state and feder al law protection of the consumers interests In Governor Pete Wilson and his CPUC reposed a great deal of trust in the FERC in moving Californias electricity system into an unbundled federalized mode Now is the time for you to justify that trust I want to cooperate with you in transitioning to a marketbased approach to provide this essential service However first and foremost I want you to do your job and to let me do mine Together we can protect the electricity consumer s of California and work to restore their confidence Sincerely GRAY DAVIS

NRON Susan J NRON Alan CT cc Subject From Todays Electricity Daily FYI In bizarre times help can sometimes come from bizarre places Granted were likely to disagree strongly with Hogans continued obsession with Poolco but the discussion in his paper regarding market power may be helpfulIve read the Joskow paper but havent yet had a chance to review the Hogan piece Steve and I discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the JoskowKahn analysis remember its Ed Kahn not Alfred Kahn Seems that it would be very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power included in the paper done by Hogan Co If in the end there aint nothing useful so be it But seems like theres little downside to exploring it Jim my understanding is that Alan is already working with the fundamentals folks on the Portland desk to deconstruct the Joskow paper Might want to include the Hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull Seabron Adamson into the thinking too Ultimately may be preferable to have any assessment of Joskow andor Hogan to come from economists rather than directly from us Best Jeff Forwarded by Jeff DasovichNAEnron on AM Daniel Douglass rterHaddencom AM To Roger illiamscom cc Subject From Todays Electricity Daily Has FERC Gone Far Enough in California The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission isnt going far enough in its attempt to reform the California wholesale electric market according to a paper by three prominent economists done for San Diego Gas and Electric The paper by John D Chandley Scott M Harvey and William W Hogan argues that FERC should first end the artificial separation that divides the California Power Exchange and the California Independent System Operator rather than worrying about the governance of the two institutions The change in governance may help says the paper Electricity Market Reform in California but it is not likely to be decisive in the near term Explicit guidance from the commission regarding the nature and trajectory of reforms will be essential if market reform is to be accomplished within an acceptable time frame Hogan of the Kennedy School of Government has been writing since in opposition to Californias market separation Also argues the paper freeing the California utilities to engage in forward contracting is no panacea The expectation that merely allowing utilities to participate in forward contracting necessarily would be the solution to high prices is problematic and not supported by the commissions staff report says the analysis adding that putting pressure on buyers to sign contracts in the present environment may make things worse If the underlying problem in California is high cost and low capacity requiring forward contracting could harm not only California but also the entire Western US electric system FERCs socalled soft cap is a wild card that has the three economists scratching their heads It does not appear in the staff report and there is little critical analysis of their implications other than the discussion of Commissioner Curt Hebert If the intent of the soft cap is to move toward cost justification for bids above MWh then FERC is headed into an administrative morass that would rival those under wellhead price controls in the natural gas industry If on the other hand the soft cap is truly soft and would only require some paper work at FERC and the possibility of a refund if the price is eventually deemed not just and reasonable there might be little impact on consumer prices particularly if the principal sources of those high prices are high costs and regional capacity shortages rather than the exercise of market power Even so the proposal might serve to deter entry and new investments thus combining the worst of both worlds high consumer prices and little or no new investment FERCs proposed order in California also demonstrates confusion about just what constitutes market power The paper cites the proposed orders lawyerly obfuscatory conclusion that while this record does not support findings of specific exercises of market power and while we are not able to reach definite conclusions about the actions of individual sellers there is clear evidence that in California market structure and rules provide the opportunity for sellers to exercise market power when supply is tight and can result in unjust and unreasonable rates under the Federal Power Act The economists note In this regard the debate is confused because we are dancing around the words where the truth may be hard to face In the case of California say the economists there is no evidence of market power Even the practice of generators avoiding the dayahead market in favor of the realtime market is a response to bad market design and pricing incentives including price caps but does not demonstrate the exercise of market power Nor is bidding above marginal cost necessarily an exercise of market power they add The distinction between direct marginal cost and opportunity cost is sometimes lost in the discussion Hence a competitive bidder whose direct cost of generation is but who could sell the same energy outside California for should bid no less than This would not be an exercise of market power

driving wholesale electricity prices to levels that helped ignite Californias exploding energy crisis during the summer and fall according to public and confidential records For months Gov Gray Davis legislators and consumer advocates have chiefly blamed a few private power companies for throwing the state into darkness and economic chaos But they are just part of the equation A confidential document obtained by The Times names power providers that have allegedly manipulated the electricity market While the document does identify outofstate merchants criticized for gouging it also discloses for the first time the extent to which public entities allegedly have maximized profits in the volatile spot market The documentwhich decodes the identities of unnamed suppliers in a recent state studysingles out three governmentrun agencies as consistently trying to inflate prices They are the DWP the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest and the trading arm of Canadas BC Hydro in British Columbia Like a number of privately owned generators these three producers offered power at a range of high prices and sometimes in large amounts when the state was most desperate They also helped saddle Californias three largest utilities with billions of dollars in debtleading one Pacific Gas Electric to seek bankruptcy protection last week The study by the California Independent System Operator or CalISO analyzed thousands of hours of bidding practices for large suppliers in the spot or realtime market from May to November The study accounted for factors such as rising production costs increased demand periods of scarcity and profits that would be earned in a healthy competitive market Money earned above that was called excess profits No entitypublic or privateearned as much in alleged excess profits as British Columbias Powerex the state records show They were the most aggressive bidders said Anjali Sheffrin author of the coded study They had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in said Sheffrin who did not discuss any companies by name The Canadian agency reaped million in alleged excessive profitsseveral times the amount collected by all but one of the private generators Second on the list was Atlantabased Southern Co Energy Marketing now called Mirant which collected nearly million in alleged inflated earnings BC Hydro and Mirantalong with the DWP and other producerssay they played by the rules established under Californias flawed deregulation plan and did not exploit the states troubles But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of severe power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise overnight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity which could be produced inexpensively but sold for a premium It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity would be at any given time said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins We helped keep the lights on in California And the rates low for their own customers During the past year BC Hydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a rainy day account to ensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America Los Angeles Department of Water and Power although eighth on the list of alleged profiteers was among those singled out for seeking high prices during periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire spot market where emergency purchases are made This according to state documents was accomplished by offering power at incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest increases in demand The strategy also helped prop up prices keeping them from falling The DWPs average hourly bid or asking price for electricity ultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston and Tulsabased Williams Cos two major players in the national energy market In addition the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that could pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand the report said referring by code to DWP and four other suppliers The data shows they clearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load conditions DWP General Manager S David Freeman called the reports findings outrageous insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes unpunished in this state Freeman said noting that DWP power helped avert more blackouts across the state He did acknowledge however that the agency has charged high prices for surplus power at the th hour but said that was only because it cost more to produce We have consistently charged CalISO our cost plus he said Its not as though were up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down their throats Freeman said that when his staff reviewed the coded report they never took it personally If youre innocent he said you dont look at the criminal file Yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in Californias deregulated market was the US governments Bonneville Power Administration a nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at federal dams in the ColumbiaSnake River basin Bonneville actually bid slightly lower than the DWP records show but reaped millions more in alleged excessive profits apparently because it supplied greater amounts of power during the period studied Bonneville was in the top five accused of taking excessive profits Bonneville officials say some of its profits are used to pay back federal construction loans and fund an internationally recognized salmon recovery program Stephen Oliver a Bonneville vice president said his agency did not act improperly and has asked CalISO for detailed information on how it reached its conclusions He said the grid operator often came to Bonneville pleading for lastminute electricity and offering to pay high prices From our point of view we bid what we had when we had it and we operated precisely within the terms of their rules Oliver said Those rulesand the bidding practices criticized by CalISOso distorted the market that Aquila Power Corp of Missouri which tried to act responsibly has bailed out It offered the lowest average hourly price of any supplier studiedslightly more than per megawatthour compared to Mirants the highest But the spot market as initially designed made sure that all suppliers offering power received the highest price paid in any hour The result Aquila collected an hour for power it was willing to sell at a singledigit price They werent the culprits said CalISOs Sheffrin Someone else drove that up Aquila spokesman Al Butkus said the company pulled out of the California market because it was too unpredictable Although the company made money he said it also could have lost because of possible downward swings We looked at it and we didnt feel very comfortable with what we saw he said The market has since been adjusted to prevent high bids from setting the price for everyone But Sheffrin said it hasnt made much difference because the overall prices are still excessive Were saying the patient is sick Sheffrin said of Californias electricity market It needs help and may die

reviewed the coded report they never took it personally If youre innocent he said you dont look at the criminal file Yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in Californias deregulated market was the US governments Bonneville Power Administration a nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at federal dams in the ColumbiaSnake River basin Bonneville actually bid slightly lower than the DWP records show but reaped millions more in alleged excessive profits apparently because it supplied greater amounts of power during the period studied Bonneville was in the top five accused of taking excessive profits Bonneville officials say some of its profits are used to pay back federal construction loans and fund an internationally recognized salmon recovery program Stephen Oliver a Bonneville vice president said his agency did not act improperly and has asked CalISO for detailed information on how it reached its conclusions He said the grid operator often came to Bonneville pleading for lastminute electricity and offering to pay high prices From our point of view we bid what we had when we had it and we operated precisely within the terms of their rules Oliver said Those rulesand the bidding practices criticized by CalISOso distorted the market that Aquila Power Corp of Missouri which tried to act responsibly has bailed out It offered the lowest average hourly price of any supplier studiedslightly more than per megawatthour compared to Mirants the highest But the spot market as initially designed made sure that all suppliers offering power received the highest price paid in any hour The result Aquila collected an hour for power it was willing to sell at a singledigit price They werent the culprits said CalISOs Sheffrin Someone else drove that up Aquila spokesman Al Butkus said the company pulled out of the California market because it was too unpredictable Although the company made money he said it also could have lost because of possible downward swings We looked at it and we didnt feel very comfortable with what we saw he said The market has since been adjusted to prevent high bids from setting the price for everyone But Sheffrin said it hasnt made much difference because the overall prices are still excessive Were saying the patient is sick Sheffrin said of Californias electricity market It needs help and may die

SUMMARY OF FERCS ORDER ESTABLISHING PROSPECTIVE MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN FOR THE CALIFORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKETS AND ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION OF PUBLIC UTILITY RATES IN WHOLESALE WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS Issued April Effective Date Price mitigation is effective May ISO needs t o have its dayahead proxy price ready on Physical Withholding To prevent physical withholding the plan will require sellers with PGAs to offer all their available power in real time to the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade All California generators ev en those not subject to FERC price regulation will be required to sell into t he ISOs real time market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted This requirement to provide power is for all hours for yr Price Mitigation The plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market During Stage and emergencies in t he ISOs real time market each generator other than hydro with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generators heat curve emission rates gas costs and emission costs plus MWh for OM The gas cost wil l be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California emissions are to be based on Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services The ISO will publish by am the gas and emission figures to be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared These figures for the next day will be based on the prior days Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgerald data A single market clearing price is determined in rea l time for all generators Highest bid sets the clearing price Each gasfired generator must file with FERC and the ISO within days on a confidential basis heat and emission rates for each generating unit The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator including maintenance and operating costs Generators that submit bids at or below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability Although the following qualification is made However all public util ity rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on marketbased rates discussed infra Presumably this has to do with anomalous bidding behavior In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price the generator must within days of the end of each month file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price FERC explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the all delivery point index it has adopted FERC has days to review act No opportunity costs in real time Marketers are not held to any generator cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based o n specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost Underscheduling Penalites FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it is still in place Thus although it may be advantageous to wait to buy power in RT at capped prices doing so may make the scheduling coordinator subject to the currently effective MWh penalty See p of the FERC order New Generation New generation is NOT exempted from the Commissions price mitigation measures Demand Response Beginning June only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids FERC is attempting to make the demand curve more price responsive This requirement is in effect for all hours Outages PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages The ISO is required to make a tariff filing within days of the order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages including periodic reports to the Commission Term Order expires one year from date of issuance RTO Filing California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June or Order lapses with no further effect The RTO filing is to be consistent with the characteristics and functions in Order No ISO Reporting On September ISO must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built Comments are du e in days Quarterly reports thereafter Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds The market based ra te authority of all public utilities is conditioned on no physical withhol d of capacity and no inappropriate bidding behavior Inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate In addition hockey stick bids are expressly prohibited ie bidding at marginal cost and at a much higher level Other prohibited bidding practices identified include pricing a single unit much higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs WestWide Section Investigation Opens a section investigation concerning the JR of wholesale power in the WSCC other than sales to the CAISO market FERC requests comments on the scope and nature of price mitigation However its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in real time markets for power less than hours in advance of RT spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below within a control area FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California Comments are due in days on the investigations Althou gh it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the nonCalifornia PN W the FERC sets the refund effective date is days from publication of the Order NOx Limits in California Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law However it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement just include the fines as part of the price bid Also if NOx is limited may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price Surcharge to pay past amount due Comments are due in days on whether FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into a n escrow account to pay past costs and the effect this surcharge would ha ve on the PGE bankruptcy filing Treatment of the CAISOs Market Stabilization Plan MSP The FERC rejec ts the CAISOs MSP saying that FERCs plan for market mitigation is suff icient It expressly rejects CAISOs plan to create a dayahead and hourahead e nergy markets are expressly reject and tells CAISO to stop actions to implement software changes to effectuate such markets Unfortunately it does not expressly reject CAISOs plan to cut exports In general no mention wa s made as to issue of exports of power from California although the statement that CAISO must become a

Connole and Tom Doggett Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited WASHINGTON April Reuters A split US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved on Wednesday a plan to stabilize Californias volatile power market and stem market abuses Under the plan set to take effect in late May and last for one year price relief measures will be imposed on Californias wholesale power sales during severe energy shortages The threemember commission split sharply on the plan voting for an order that the majority believe will prevent power costs from soaring out of control in California this summer Wholesale power prices have jumped tenfold in California in the past year the result of growing demand from the states million residents following a decade that saw no major power plants added to its electric system FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert a Republican and Democrat Linda Breathitt supported the order Democrat William Massey dissented despite hours of talks aimed at reaching a consensus California consumers can rest assured that the commission has been attentive to their problems and has worked tirelessly to ensure that they receive necessary relief in a manner that does not compound current problems or undemine longerterm solutions Hebert said DISSENTING VOTE Massey said that by limiting price relief to declared power emergencies FERCs actions would fall short of solving the severe problems plaguing the California market The evidence is pervasive that the problem exists hours a day seven days a week Now is not the time for halfaloaf solutions Massey said Under the plan price mitigation would be triggered whenever the California Independent System Operator ISO declares a power emergency The ISO which manages most of the states power grid uses a threestage alert system with a Stage One called when power reserves drop to within seven percent of actual demand on the grid As demand eats further into the supply cushion Stage Two and Stage Three alerts are declared with Stage Three indicating rolling blackouts may be required to avoid overloading the grid and triggering far more widespread outages California has ordered rolling blackouts four days so far this year with state energy officials predicting more are likely this summer when air conditioning pushes demand to its annual peak FINDING A FAIR PRICE The mitigation and monitoring plans central element will require generators to offer available power in real time using a proxy price established a day ahead of actual delivery FERC said The proxy price reflects the marginal cost of the highestcost generator asked to supply power to the grid This price will vary daily according to demand the price of fuel used by generators such as natural gas and the cost of complying with environmental standards However generators could charge more than the proxy price if they can justify the higher cost when FERC reviews their sales records which they are required to submit at the end of each month If those costs cannot be justified FERC can order the generator to refund the buyer FERC said all generators in California even those not subject to the commissions price regulations are required to sell into the ISOs real time price market as a condition of their use of the ISOs interstate transmission lines Hydroelectric facilities were exempted from the plan because of their generation limitations which fluctuate according to reservoir levels and the competing needs of others for those same water resources REGIONAL SOLUTION The commission emphasized that the only real solution to the power supply problems affecting the western markets was to forge a regional response Toward this goal FERC said California ISO would need to file a plan to form a regional transmission organization RTO by June or forfeit the socalled crutch of FERCs pricerelief plan Among the many measures contained in the order FERC told California utilities to coordinate any temporary shutdowns of generating plants with the ISO to ensure the state has adequate electric supplies at all times The order also formally opened an investigation by commission staff into possible abusive wholesale practices behind power sales throughout the Western region FERC said the plan would expire in as the California power crisis eases The states rush to build new power plants is expected to put an

By Rebecca Smith The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Hewing more to the ideological position of the Bush administration than to the urgings of Gov Gray Davis and other California politicians a divided Federal Energy Regulatory Commission yesterday ordered limited price controls for the states flawed electricity market The new controls arent likely to restrain runaway wholesale power prices this summer The order was approved in a meeting that began hours late as the three commissioners locked horns over how far the agency should go to restrain wholesale prices that have pushed one of Californias big utilities into bankruptcy and which now threatens the states fiscal health The commission built on a staff recommendation issued in March that suggested it act only at those times when electricity supplies are in shortest supply In its order the commission decided to intervene whenever state electricity reserves drop below authorized levels socalled Stage I II and III emergencies The pricemitigation plan appears to ignore evidence filed by the gridoperating California Independent System Operator that generators can substantially raise market prices even when supplies arent technically short The ISO had recommended imposing price caps when individual generating plants tried to charge far more than fair production costs Commissioner William Massey dissented in part from the order in a sharply worded attack on the commission which he said hadnt done its duty to protect energy users by restraining generators that overcharge As a consequence he said the economic carnage is spreading throughout the West Mr Massey an Arkansas Democrat criticized the commission for acting only when electricity reserves fall below since this agency is obligated to ensure just and reasonable prices in all hours Under the order generators will be required to submit cost data to justify high prices during periods of electricity scarcity They will be allowed to collect the price they bid so long as it doesnt exceed the price charged by the oldest leastefficient plant operating at the time Such proxy price methodology enabled plant owners to collect as much as per megawatt hour in February or roughly times the prevailing price a year earlier Support for the order came from commission Chairman Curt Hebert a Mississippi Republican who said he didnt intend the commission to fall into a trap of limiting market forces to the extent that we hinder efforts to build new power plants and transmission lines that are badly needed to correct Californias supplyanddemand imbalance Linda Breathitt a Kentucky Democrat was the swing vote who eventually sided with Mr Hebert FERC staffers said she expressed doubts about whether the commission was doing as much as it should In the meeting she acknowledged the complexity and difficulty of the task but said she remained steadfast in my belief that market solutions are preferable to regulatory controls The commission attached an unexpected condition to its order saying the pricecap scheme will be revoked June unless the California grid operator has filed a plan to become part of a regionwide gridoperating organization Californias ISO had such a plan ready to file but it got yanked when a new board named by the states governor took control recently In recent months Mr Davis has urged increased isolationism even suggesting the state no longer export powerIt isnt clear whether FERC intends to permit California to continue to operate as a standalone gridrunning organization More likely it will be expected to show it intends to become part of a multistate organization to operate transmission lines in a nondiscriminatory manner The commission gave tentative approval yesterday to formation of a regional grid operator that would encompass eight other Western states and would include the transmission system of the federal Bonneville Power Administration the biggest

Calif DWR Power Contracts Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Dow Jones The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued an order late Thursday requiring electricity providers to file information regarding contracts they have entered into with the California Department of Water Resources The information due by the close of business Monday is being compiled on behalf of the House Government Reform Committee which held hearings in California this week as part of its oversight investigation into the states electricitysupply crisis Rep Dan Burton RInd the committees chairman requested the information from FERC to determine whether the commissions order Dec designed to move the state away from reliance on volatile spot markets for power supplies and into lowercost longterm contracts has been effective The state water department has been purchasing power for months on behalf of the states two financially troubled utilities spending more than billion at a rate of million daily Edison International unit Southern California Edison EIX and PGE Corp unit Pacific Gas Electric Co have amassed more than billion in liabilities because stateregulated retail rates dont allow them to pass through highcost wholesale power purchases PGE filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection on behalf of its utility unit a week ago Monday Edison entered into an agreement to sell the state its transmission lines in a bid to restore financial solvency FERCs order Thursday requests information from power suppliers on both short and longterm contracts they may have entered into with the department since Dec FERC said it will treat the information as confidential unless the supplier states otherwise One Democratic official in Washington suggested the House panel is engaged in a partisan bashing effort targeting California Gov Gray Davis who has widely been touted as a presidential prospect for the election Davis spokesman Steven Maviglio supported the officials assessment What a shock Dan Burton is at it again Maviglio said facetiously of Burton who derived a reputation as a partisan foe of former US President Bill Clinton with his many investigations into Clinton and his administration The bottom line is theyre aiding and abetting the generators Maviglio said of Burtons committee The governors spokesman also questioned

available By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Congressional Committee Members Question California Utility Officials Michelle Guido KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News San Jose Mercury News California Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Officials from Californias two major utilities and two of its smaller power generators were in the hot seat in San Jose on Wednesday fielding questions from federal lawmakers about their role in the states power crisis On Day of a threeday swing through California three Republican members of a US House subcommittee on energy policy and three local Democratic representatives heard testimony from utility officials and from the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The energy crisis is expected to bring rolling blackouts to California through the summer months and energy officials warned on Wednesday that the high prices consumers face here undoubtedly will spill over into neighboring states if FERC doesnt cap prices now But FERC Chairman Curt L Hebert Jr reiterated what he said Tuesday at a western energy summit in Boise He does not support price caps on electricity in California or any of the western states The energy is going to go where the caps are not and nine out of western state governors have said they dont want price caps in their states Hebert said A cap sends us in the wrong direction Instead he said by May FERC will unveil a plan to monitor energy prices and in some cases might mitigate the price of energy sold on Californias more expensive spot markets He wouldnt elaborate but made it clear those adjustments would not include price caps Government Reform Committee Chairman Dan Burton of Indiana opened the hearing by saying the committees mission was not to point fingers We wanted to see if there were ways the federal government and the state government could work together to get past this crisis At one point early in the hearing demonstrators attempted to address the lawmakers They were ushered out of the room by security personnel Burton was joined by Republican representatives Doug Ose of Woodland and Steve Horn of Lakewood Also participating in the hearings were Democratic representatives Zoe Lofgren and Michael Honda of San Jose and Barbara Lee of Oakland The Democrats pushed strongly for FERC to consider price caps We need to gain control of this outofcontrol market and gain control of the price gouging Lofgren said Honda concurred We believe that FERC has a responsibility and theyve even said that rates are unjust and unreasonable We need shortterm caps It was clear that Burton doesnt believe that price caps are the answer In fact on several occasions he suggested that capping energy prices might result in even more blackouts as summer approaches Lee suggested that some people believe the only way out of the crisis is some form of reregulation But Dede Hapner vice president of regulatory relations for PGE said she wasnt sure that was the answer We still think a correctly structured market could work Its certainly working in other states Hapner said In retrospect the way the deregulation market was structured was designed to fail Today the hearings move to San Diego where members will hear from representatives of generators that have been accused of overcharging California including Reliant

Calif ISO Inflates Outage Figures By Mark Golden Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow Jones The California Independent System Operator on Monday published on its Web site its list of offline generators as it has done every day since Jan as a way of showing why it is having such a hard time keeping the lights on Mondays bottom line megawatts of generating capacity out of service was stunning since electricity usage within the ISOs area peaked that day at MW But on Monday as it has every day since Jan the ISO padded the list It included power that isnt in any way considered resources of the ISO qualifying facilities that the ISO counts twice and generators that returned to service hours before the list was published When those are eliminated Mondays listed outage total falls to MW from The ISO list for example added MW to the total of its California Generation Curtailments because the MW Palo Verde nuclear unit was taken off line over the weekend for scheduled refueling But only one of the three investorowned utilities that the ISO represents Edison Internationals EIX Southern California Edison owns any of the electricity from the Palo Verde plant which is in Arizona Edisons take from the generator is just MW The same could be said for Four Corners unit which contributes MW to the ISO when its running but MW to Mondays ISO outage list The ISO list also includes dozens of generators owned by California municipal utilities that arent part of the ISOs system The ISO is responsible for managing the combined electricity load of Southern California Edison and Californias other two investorowned utilities PGE Corps PCG Pacific Gas Electric Co and Sempra Energys SRE San Diego Gas Electric Co Power plants owned by the three utilities are considered to be ISO resources as are the big power plants that the utilities sold to merchant power companies like Dynegy DYN and Reliant REI and smaller alternative power plants or qualifying facilities that provide juice to utilities under longterm contracts On Monday the ISO included MW of offline generation that isnt considered by anybody to be ISO resources in the first place The ISO agrees it shouldnt be counting the entire output from generators that the utilities only partially own Its a flaw in the calculation by the software Were trying to get that fixed and it should be within a week or two said Tracy Bibb the ISOs managing director of engineering and maintenance As for counting generators owned by municipal utilities in Pasadena and Sacramento that the ISO doesnt serve Bibb said the ISO has no choice but to include them The governor issued an emergency order that the ISO shall publish a list of all unit outages in California We contacted all the utilities and said that even though youre not part of the ISO you are required to report outages to us and were required to post them Bibb said The inflated daily outage list hurts the reputation of the states merchant power companies One of the primary uses of the list is to imply that outofstate generators as they are often called are keeping massive amounts of power off line to maintain false scarcity and pump up the wholesale power market California once again was threatened with blackouts Friday which put Reliant Energy on the spot when it announced it had taken one of its units out of service at its secondlargest power plant in the state the Houston Chronicle reported last week California critics have called power producers pirates saying practices like taking plants out of service at key times push up prices The ISO includes every little difference between maximum output and actual output however small or temporary Of the large instate generating units owned by merchant power companies Reliant Dynegy AES Corp AES Duke Energy DUK and Mirant MIR units were on the ISOs list Many are off line for scheduled spring maintenance but most are on the list because at some point in the day they werent generating at full capacity Dukes MW Morro bay unit for example appeared on Mondays list because at some point in the day it was generating just MW We hardly ever bring that yearold unit to full load It will stay on longer that way The MW maximum is running it flat out under perfect weather conditions said Duke spokesman Tom Williams And many units are run at partial capacity due to annual limits on emissions of nitrogen oxide which became far more strict this year Williams and others said The ISO doesnt want to hear the excuses A lot of them have been certified to a certain maximum capacity Any derate at all off of that does get picked up The unit is supposed to be good for that maximum Bibb said As for NOx limits Bibb agreed the limits are being reached because the units are running more than ever before But he said there are ways around the limits such as obtaining variances AES had to shut down several plants when it exhausted its emissions last year and this spring and fall AES is installing NOx reduction equipment at eight of its big generators But that raises another problem the merchant power companies have with the way the ISO breaks down its outages Of the MW shortfall listed Monday is listed as unplanned The merchant companies said most of these unplanned outages were coordinated with and approved by the ISO months ago The ISO has coordinated the schedule for all units in the LA basin that are going to be off line for SCR selective catalytic reduction installations this year The schedule was finalized in early March said AES spokesman Aaron Thomas Nevertheless three AES units out for SCR installation contributed MW to Mondays unplanned outage total Its the unplanned total that is often used to imply that merchant power companies are creating a false scarcity in order to drive up prices Weirdly if a unit is generating less than its maximum by different amounts at different times of the day the two curtailments are added together for the ISO list though Bibb says this will also be fixed in the new software program Also on Monday the ISO listed MW off line at Southern California Edisons Mohave plant even though the generators involved had returned to full operation hours before the ISO put its list out at am PDT The return of any capacity before the list is published is ignored but if a unit trips off line just before the list is published that gets included the ISOs Bibb said The grid operator doubledips when it cites the states smaller qualifying facilities The ISOs chief operator and spokesman have said repeatedly in press conferences interviews and press releases that the qualifying facilities that have been turned off due to lack of payment from utilities are separate from the ISO outage list And daily newspaper reports give both the outage total and the qualifying facility total separately But the outage list includes QFs every day On Monday for example MW of QF generation contributed to the outage total In the meantime its the lists inflated total that grabs attention We dont get that many questions on it from the media People pretty much take what they need from it the bottom line said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

Will Block Western Price Caps by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis News item from Energy Info Source Reuters is reporting that Curt HSbert FERC Chairman said he would block a move by fellow commissioners to impose a temporary price cap on wholesale electricity prices in the western United States HSbert reportedly said that even if a majority of the three member commission favored price caps he would prevent a vote from being taken because he does not believe price curbs would increase electricity supplies or reduce demand in the region Absent someone proving to me that price caps would bring more supply and less demand in California and the West my answer is yes HSbert said when asked by reporters if he would block a FERC vote on western price caps A FERC spokesman later downplayed HSberts remarks He did not say he would block any vote said FERC spokesman Hedley Burrell He said he would need to be shown that price caps would bring more supply or less demand to the West Analysis Just last week I discussed the growing dissension with the FERC over the price cap issue see IssueAlert The dissension appears to be coming to a head just as FERC grows from a threemember commission to its standard five members As the philosophical complexion of the new FERC is unknown it remains questionable whether or not HSberts adamant stand against price caps will be sufficient to keep the commission from moving in this direction HSberts hard line against price caps was espoused during the same week that the FERC chairman appeared at a Santa Fe NM conference and spoke about high wholesale prices in California and the fact that the states utilities could have saved about billion had they accepted proposals for longterm contracts six months ago First lets look at how the structure of FERC is presently changing and how this might impact the commissions divided position on price caps On March President Bush announced his intention to nominate state utility officials Nora Mead Brownell of Pennsylvania and Patrick Wood III of Texas to serve on FERC Word on the nomination of Wood was expected although rumors had indicated that Wood might be named to replace HSbert as chairman Brownell a commissioner with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission will be appointed to the remainder of a fiveyear term that expires June of this year and an additional term expiring in Wood who formerly served on FERC from to will be appointed to the remainder of a fiveyear term that expires in As I mentioned in the IssueAlert the FERC is presently divided on the issue of price caps Obviously HSbert has expressed strong opposition to any kind of restriction on pricing However Commissioner William Massey has said that he will continue to push for price caps to help calm the volatility of the California market Linda Key Breathitt the third commissioner presently at FERC has remained undecided on the issue What could change the balance of power at FERC with the two new appointments is the fact that both Brownell and Wood come from states in which some form of wholesale price caps are presently in place Consequently there is a real possibility that HSbert despite his role as chairman could soon find himself in the minority position with regard to the price cap issue HSbert seems unconcerned about this possibility and has made reference to likeminded friends in Washington who would side with him on the issue The rationale behind HSberts opposition to price caps has been well documented The FERC chairman has not been fully convinced that price caps would do anything to increase supply or reduce demand in the Western region or anywhere else for that matter Rather HSbert believes that price caps have the potential to cause serious damage and actually cause supply to decrease further as power generators will opt to build plants in other regions that do not place restrictions on prices The fact that HSbert opposes price caps but yet supports FERCs investigation into the unjust and unreasonable prices charged by power suppliers may seem like somewhat of a contradiction to some observers Earlier this month FERC put California power sellers on notice that they must either make refunds for certain power sales or provide further justification of their prices Total potential refunds or offsets in the ISO and PX markets are approximately million for January transactions Further FERC established a price screen of MWh that would be justified during periods of a Stage alert and that anything above this price would be considered excessive In addition the commission will determine a top wholesale power price for each month through April and then formulate a permanent plan for monitoring prices in California for transactions taking place after May FERC is utilizing a methodology to determine the price screen and scarcity pricing is a very important factor in the equation The commission uses a model that takes different factors into account for instance weighted gas weighted NOX etc to determine a price of electricity when the lights are about to go out Stage alert time That is the price that FERC uses to determine scarcity prices Therefore it can and will change month to month One may wonder how HSbert can reconcile the use of a market price screen and yet remain so opposed to price caps However it is important to realize that for the most part FERC is not prohibiting that power generators sell power above the price screen Rather FERC will simply demand that any company selling power above this price report to the commission and justify the higherthanaverage price That is an important but subtle difference between a price screen and a price cap which prohibits generators from exceeding a certain price As noted HSbert spoke earlier this week at a conference in Santa Fe entitled Current Issues Challenging the Utility Industry sponsored by the Center for Public Utilities HSbert spoke about a variety of topics including the current status of RTO applications and new technologies related to pipelines and generation However one thing that HSbert said related to the wholesale market in California struck me as particularly interesting HSbert said that last fall wholesale power suppliers offered California utilities longterm power contracts in the range of MWh The general consensus among the utilities and Gov Gray Davis was that the price was excessive and that they should wait to sign longterm deals until wholesale prices decreased or until the state could negotiate lower prices on behalf of the utilities HSberts point was that California utilities could have saved approximately billion had they signed on for longterm deals at that time Most of the contracts that the California Department of Water Resources is now signing with power suppliers are confidential and thus we do not know how the fixed prices of the contracts compare to the average MWh that was offered last fall However most reports indicate that the state of California already has spent billion to procure power and is expected to pay billion for power over the course of this year Meanwhile California and other western lawmakers continue to urge the Bush administration and FERC to enact temporary price caps in the West In fact bipartisan lawmakers from California Oregon and Washington met with Vice President Dick Cheney head of the Bush administrations energy task force to assert that soaring electricity prices in the West could lead the entire country into a recession Cheney responded that the White House opposes any price controls on energy as they would discourage new power plants from being built At the Santa Fe conference HSbert said that Washington doesnt do temporary very well What he meant by this statement was that although lawmakers are putting pressure on the federal government to put a temporary price cap into place if one were to be enacted it would most likely remain in place for some time Clearly HSbert will continue to oppose wholesale price caps in the West unless someone can make the case to him that price restrictions will lower demand or increase supply Yet at the same time just this week HSbert said that he was open to a request from New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to enact wholesale power prices in the Northeast Giuliani asked FERC to impose a temporary MWh cap on wholesale electricity prices to ensure that New York City gets through tight summer power supplies without large price spikes How FERC as a whole will rule on the larger issue of price caps across the country and particularly in California once the new commissioners come on board remains to be seen In any event FERC along with state regulators still faces the challenge of finding some longterm solution that will stabilize the market in California and the Pacific Northwest An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

to story Tuesday March Small Power Firms Cutbacks Contribute to Blackouts Outages Alternative generators of solar wind and biomass energy and smaller gasfired plants havent been paid since November By JULIE TAMAKI Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOThe rolling blackouts that swept California on Monday were sparked in part by a crucial group of small energy producers that have cut supplies to the states utilities because they are not being paid Californias power supply dropped Monday when alternative producers reduced output or went offline cutting their usual deliveries to utilities in half The lost electricitymore than seven times the cuts the companies were making just weeks agocould have served million homes I think were just getting at a breaking point for many of these businesses said Ed Tomeo president of UAE Energy Operations Corp a San Ramon company that operates a biomass plant and a small gasfired plant Tomeo said he expects to take his gasfired plant offline today because hes run out of money to buy natural gas Tomeos firm is among the nearly alternative energy producers that generate more than a fourth of the power consumed in California Collectively the group estimates it is owed billion by the states two largest utilities Big outofstate power producers are getting paid because the state stepped in to buy electricity for the foundering utilities But the California producers of solar wind and biomass energy and typically smaller gasfired generators have received no payments since November from Southern California Edison and only partial payments from Pacific Gas Electric Co for December and January deliveries Edisons debt to the producers is estimated at million as of March PGEs debt to the producers was million as of March Jim Detmers director of the California Independent System Operator the agency that operates the states power grid said Mondays shortfall from the alternative producers was mostly caused by reduced output by about a dozen companies that have been cutting back electricity deliveries for the past two months Detmers said he could not say whether the action was orchestrated but it appeared to be a business decision The cuts have grown from about megawatts a day in early February to megawatts over the last several days according to state officials Assemblyman Fred Keeley a Boulder Creek Democrat said he did not blame the small producers who are formally referred to as qualifying facilities for shutting down Although I feel it is unfortunate for consumers I dont blame them at all Keeley said Theyre the only ones generating electricity and not getting paid Keeley said he will revive efforts to pass legislation that would ensure that the alternative energy producers get paid while cutting their rates A previous effort to slash the rates paid to the group SB X by Keeley and Sen Jim Battin RLa Quinta appears doomed Gov Gray Davis huddled for more than two hours with Democratic legislative leaders Monday after keeping his distance for several weeks and an agreement emerged to give small generators a choice Take a higher price in exchange for shortterm commitments to buy their power or accept a lower price in exchange for a multiyear commitment to buy their power sources who attended the meeting said And the governor and Legislature would quickly devise a way to ensure that the producers start getting paid at least for power they continue to produce As long as the utilities are collecting money from their customers Davis later told a labor group theyre going to make the payments The alternative producers rates are pegged to the price of natural gas which has skyrocketed in recent months Driving down and stabilizing their prices is a critical factor in Davis overall plan of buying power without imposing additional consumer rate hikes As a growing number of unpaid producers have dropped offline state officials have been forced to purchase replacement supplies on the pricey spot market A worstcase scenario materialized Monday when a lack of electricity supplies forced state officials to order rolling blackouts A number of plants are out for maintenance but its very clear to me that there are a significant number that are off due to nonpayment said Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers My concern is that this is a prelude to what well see this summer PGE spokesman John Nelson described the alternative producers as victims of the states energy meltdown Many of these generators are relatively small enterprises that cannot afford to continue operating on a daily basis Nelson said his companys inability to fully pay the producers it has contracts with is caused by the rate freeze that bars PGE from passing the true cost of electricity on

Golden Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones When marketsavvy energy companies like Enron Calpine and Dynegy are selling like crazy that might be a sign its not a good time to buy Nevertheless the state of California is signing contracts for billion worth of power under supply deals stretching up to years Some industry experts say these contracts could be overpriced by billions of dollars in a matter of months Whats more deliveries for most of the supplies already signed for wont begin until after this summer which is likely when the power will be needed most The state should be involved in portfolio contracts to stabilize costs but signing year and year contracts is inappropriate said Michael Zenker director of western energy consulting services at Cambridge Energy Research Associates That could end up locking consumers into higher rates for many years to come The near bankruptcy of Californias two largest utilities has forced the state to step heavily into the power markets The states idea behind signing longterm contracts is to stabilize its power costs by spreading them out said Vikram Budhraja whose company Electric Power Group is advising the state on the contracts What we set out to do is get California out of the spot market bring stability to the market and get dependable supplies Budhraja said We believe we have done that But some said California could find cheaper prices for forward power if it waits Power prices will continue to be very volatile for the next months to months but the price of power for delivery in and beyond is likely to begin falling at the end of this summer said Gerald Keenan a senior partner for PricewaterhouseCoopers utility consulting group The best approach now is to sign contracts covering just a few months or years he said Its not a good bet that gas prices will stay high for such a long time he said And very little of that power will be delivered this summer anyway This week California Gov Gray Davis said the state has nailed down about megawatts for the summer more than half the difference between generation already controlled by the utilities and the projected peak demand on a very hot day But contract details released by Calpine Corp CPN Dynegy Inc DYN Duke Energy DUK and Williams Companies WMB belie the governors claim According to press releases from those generators only MW of the power theyre selling will be available this summer Not everyone agrees the state has overpaid To head off a meltdown independent power companies in California are giving the state prices slightly below the current forward market said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum These are probably good deals said Ackerman who added that potential outofstate suppliers are seeking higher prices because they dont have the same political motivation Never guess at what prices are going to do They can always go higher Still Californias inability to find much power for this summer means that the states imbalance between supply and demand will have to be solved in the near term on the demand side according to one perspective Once demand falls whether through higher prices voluntary conservation involuntary blackouts or even a recession forward electricity prices in California could come crashing down Davis has proposed conservation plans that he says will reduce electricity consumption by from expected levels this summer As part of the conservation program Davis wants to install new realtime meters before summer at industrial and commercial customers which will then get some market prices for their power and would be motivated to reduce consumption during peakuse hours The current forward market reflects a skepticism that the meters and other conservation efforts will be anywhere near as effective this summer as the governor says But some industry experts say the realtime meters alone could reduce power consumption by which would slash both spot and forward supply prices again reason for the state to wait The state should absolutely install the meters first before signing the longterm contracts Zenker said The governor agreed when asked about this in his press conference that conservation efforts will weaken forward markets But he said securing stable prices now is worth the cost Consumers will know approximately what it will cost them for power The first two or three years they will probably pay less than the real cost of power In the next five or six years they may pay a little bit more Davis said I think that is a bargain that Californians can learn to accept Moreover if the state had signed deals for just a couple of years the average price would be double the average price of the longerterm contracts announced this week Such prices in turn would have forced the state to raise electricity rates something that is politically unpalatable Zenker conceded Davis and his staff defended their approach saying that the problem for this summer will be so acute that it requires a multipronged attack rather than pursuing demand reductions first There is no one piece that is going to solve this problem Budhraja said All have to be pursued simultaneously By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved
