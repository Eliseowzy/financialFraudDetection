Three former San Diego Gas Electric Co employees who worked at a Duke Energy plant said Thursday that the generator destroyed working parts withheld power supply or otherwise took actions that they believe drove up the price of electricity State officials said the whistleblowers comments at a state Senate hearin g today could provide the most damaging illustration yet that power generator s held down production to inflate prices on the spot market Gov Gray Davis has long alleged that power companies have overcharged the state and utilities Jimmy Olkjer a former assistant control room operator at Dukes South Bay plant in San Diego said in a phone interview that during the states power shortages Duke cut supply Although Duke a Charlotte NCbased company owned the plant and it contracted with SDGE to operate the unit he said Rather than creating more power they were creating less Olkjer said I think there was manipulation of the market The California Public Utilities Commission and several state legislative committees continue to investigate price manipulation allegations and Attorney General Bill Lockyer has said he will take witnesses to a grand ju ry next month The generators have denied they manipulated the market We stand behind our maintenance practices and have done a good job keeping the power flowing Duke spokesman Tom Williams told the CBS television network But former mechanic Glenn Johnson said he saw generation units taken down for economics Ed Edwards also a mechanic said he was ordered to destroy pallets of working parts We were asked myself and other employees to disperse of perfectly good parts that were used to make repairs of systems and components Edwards said State Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana chairman of the marketmanipulation committee said his staff has been looking for employees or others with intimate knowledge of power plant operation to come forward and he promise d that others will testify at future hearings Its the first time that weve had evidence from directly within power plants in California that the ramping up and ramping down of power generati on was a response to price and not to demand Dunn said He said he would reach no conclusions until Duke and other generators testi fy next month but he added that the former employees testimony raises suspicions at first blush The Bees Kevin Yamamura can be reached at or Consumers cut their own power in protest By Silvina Martnez Bee Staff Writer Published June When the temperature hit degrees at pm Thursday Larry Lynch turned off the air conditioner unplugged the refrigerator pulled out the TV cord s and shut down all other appliances in the house Lynch a yearold newsletter publisher in Sacramento responded to the Roll Your Own Blackout Thursday and joined thousands throughout the state to protest energy policies and promote conservation by stopping the use of energy from pm But the data coming off the grid at the California Independent System Operator didnt show the effort During the first hour of the voluntary shutoff the demand for energy by PGE customers in Northern California was almost the same as at the same ti me Wednesday ISO officials said Protesters didnt expect significant changes on the grid I feel it will at least send a message that we dont have to depend on it energy said Jackie Bell a consultant at the Capitol joining the conservation drive from her apartment on Fulton Avenue Its just a symbolic act said Peter Lopez of Sacramento who decided to use the evening to meditate Maybe Ill just go outside stare at the star s and try to spot a few constellations in the night It was the longest day of the year and one of the hottest But those determined to advocate conservation didnt mind the sacrifice People are getting focused on the fact that we have power at our end sai d Joan Blades a spokeswoman for MoveOn a grassroots organization in the Ba y Area and one of hundreds of online groups passing along the call for the voluntary blackout An electrical engineer in Oakland started the Roll Your Own Blackout idea when he posted a note in a political chat room in April Then an artist in Los Angeles forwarded the email to a number of friends and from there it quickly spanned the globe By Thursday afternoon more than people had signed up at the MoveOn Web site to join the protest Blades said Many threw blackout parties In San Francisco the nonprofit group Global Exchange gathered hundreds around a big bonfire at Ocean Beach At his home in east Sacramento Lynch did fine without electricity for thre e hours He ate tuna salad for dinner watered the lawn and when it got dark he opened the windows and let some air in We should show that people are willing to shut the power off if the prices go too high he said ISO has not declared a power emergency since May We have seen a consistent conservation on a daytoday basis and its making the difference between blackouts and no blackouts ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said McCorkle encouraged initiatives like Roll Your Own Blackout People are conserving she said And we can only support this whole effort The Bees Silvina Martnez can be reached at or Davis consultants had contract with Edison The disclosures turn up the hea t on the governor for hiring the exClinton aides By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau Published June Two consultants hired to advise Gov Gray Davis on energy policy officially disclosed their contract with Southern California Edison on Thursday but Davis aides insisted it is not a conflict because Edison and the Governor s Office have the same goal Communications consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani have drawn intense criticism since they were hired last month to shape the Democratic governor s public response to the state energy crisis The former Clinton administration communication aides nicknamed the Masters of Disaster for their spin on the Whitewater travel office and fundraising controversies at the Clinton White House have come und er fire for receiving a sixmonth amonth contract more than the governor or anyone on his staff makes Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who is running for governor nex t year has called for an investigation into potential conflicts State Controller Kathleen Connell a Democrat has said she will not issue paychecks to the pair pending her own investigation The criticism mounted after the duos economic interest disclosure forms we re released late Thursday showing that each has received at least und er contract from Edison in the past year But Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean defended their credibility saying theres no conflict of interest because Lehane and Fabiani both disclosed that they had worked for Edison before they signed their contracts with the state Besides she added Edison and the governor are working toward the same goa l Both want the Legislature to adopt a memorandum of understanding a propose d agreement that would prevent Edison from going bankrupt by financing a sta te purchase of the utilitys transmission lines Its not a conflict because theres been full disclosure McLean said Edison and the Governors Office have the same goal passing the MOU Wer e working together at this point with Edison But opengovernment groups and Republican lawmakers bristled at the notion that disclosure negates any potential conflict Derek Cressman of the California Public Interest Research Group pointed to a section of state law that prohibits public officials from influencing decisions if it would have a material financial effect on a business enti ty that provided them or more within the last year You have two individuals on the government payroll who had previously been on the Edison payroll and its not clear to whom their loyalties are he said Just because theyve revealed it doesnt mean theres not a conflict there and that theyre not serving two masters On Thursday Jones said he is awaiting the results of the Fair Political Practices Commission investigation and agrees with Connells decision this week to withhold payment from the consultants This further calls into question the ethics of how these individuals were hired and contracts were let Jones said Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte believes theres no question that Lehan e and Fabiani are violating conflictofinterest laws and suggested that the two should be paid out of Davis campaign funds which had reached million by Jan Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga added that he would not vote for a state budge t as long as Lehane and Fabiani remain on the state payroll The state of California does not need to be paying political wordsmiths a month he said I just wish Davis were as frugal with the taxpayers money as he is with his campaign money The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at or State deal may ease blackout threat Canada to supply energy as summer demand rises By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO California may be able to avoid some of the blackouts predict ed for this summer thanks to a littleknown powerswapping agreement with a Canadian utility The arrangement is expected to give California electricity in July and Augu st from the hydroelectric generators of BC Hydro in British Columbia despite a serious drought in the Northwest California has sold surplus power in recent months to the governmentowned utility which is expected to return power to the state as heat drives up t he demand for electricity State deal may ease blackout threat Continuing coverage Californias Power Crisis Despite the energy crunch the state often finds itself with surplus power that can be sold or swapped For instance advance power purchases that provide energy at a better price may deliver more power than needed at any given time particularly during offpeak hours BC Hydros reservoirs and hydroelectric generators are a little like an electricity storage battery By importing California power BC Hydro has be en able to conserve water that can be released this summer to produce power fo r California As a result of the agreement and other factors state power buyers say they are in a stronger position going into the hot summer months than they had expected So far this week the state has managed to get through a heat wav e without so much as a Stage power alert We are in much better shape at this point than I imagined we would have be en as little as a month ago said Ray Hart head of the power purchasing unit in the state Department of Water Resources The North American Electric Reliability Council which last month predicted hours of rolling blackouts for California this summer has noticed a change in recent weeks We dont seem to have the crisis we were all expecting said Ellen Vancko a council spokeswoman But whether that is a shortterm or a longterm eve nt we dont think anyone knows yet Much of the credit for avoiding blackouts is given to unexpectedly high conservation by Californians and an increased supply of power Many generators that had been shut down for maintenance or lack of payment are n ow back on line But the hydroelectric power agreement had gone unnoticed until now Hart mentioned it during a Senate Energy Committee hearing this week But h e declined to reveal the amount of power banked with BC Hydro saying it coul d hurt the states competitive position in the market If I start talking specifics said Hart then I have to give out what I am doing every single day and I have no market position In the past California routinely sent power to a number of utilities in th e Pacific Northwest during the winter when residents there needed heat Northwest utilities returned power to California in the summer when air conditioning drove up demand Little was expected from the reciprocal arrangement this year because California was short of power last winter as electricity prices soared and drought has sharply lowered reservoirs in the Northwest But the agreement with BC Hydro will provide at least some power this summer The state was forced to begin buying power in January after its two largest utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric were unable to borrow because of a billion debt The rates that the utilitie s could charge their customers were frozen under a failed deregulation plan a s the cost of power on the wholesale market skyrocketed Hart said it took time to convince BC Hydro which has demanded cash for so me electricity that it could safely do business with California despite big debts owed to generators for power they supplied to the utilities We have only been able to do it for the last couple of months said Hart It took a long time to get them to do it because of credit issues A spokesman for BC Hydro said the utility engages in power swaps but does n ot release the name of the other parties or the terms of the agreements Our first priority is taking care of our own said Warren Cousins of BC Hydro We are still looking for opportunities to help out other entities when we can Hart said the state has another arrangement with the federal Bonneville Pow er Authority but again refused to provide details He said the state has sold surplus power to several buyers including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Information about state power purchases had been closely guarded until recently Gov Gray Davis pressured by lawsuits and a court ruling releas ed edited versions last week of longterm power contracts worth billion The Davis administration said it agreed to release contract information because power prices have dropped easing competitive pressures Exworker Duke manipulated market By Bill Ainsworth UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO A former operator at Duke Energys Chula Vista plant said he was told frequently by company officials during the past year to alter the plants output in a way that may have boosted electricity prices The operator Jimmy Olkjer said he was even ordered to cut power generatio n during energy emergencies when the state faced rolling blackouts because o f a scarce supply of electricity He said he believes reducing the electricity generation helped the company charge higher prices It looks like thats what they were doing Olkjer said in an interview He and another former plant employee said that during the past year the company regularly operated its leastefficient turbine possibly to justify higher prices The allegations which they plan to repeat today at a state Senate hearing investigating power generators provide the first insider evidence that Duk e Energy may have manipulated output at its South Bay plant to drive up price s Duke based in North Carolina leases the South Bay plant from the San Dieg o Unified Port District A March report by the Independent System Operator which manages California s electricity grid alleged that by withholding power Duke and four other owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollars in overcharges to California consumers Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy North America said that varying th e output of the generating units at the Chula Vista plant had nothing to do with trying to achieve higher prices He said the changes in output helped balance the states grid by dancing i n the market providing flexibility for grid managers by allowing the plan t to add or reduce power quickly Williams added that the aging South Bay plant produced as many megawatts la st year as it did in Olkjer served as a plant operator for years mostly when the plant was owned by San Diego Gas Electric Co After Duke took over the plant worke rs were guaranteed their jobs for two years In April when that period ended Duke laid off Olkjer and other workers Now he is retired During the two years Duke has managed the plant Olkjer said operators frequently got calls from officials with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in Salt Lake City telling them to adjust their production schedule Some employees at the plant monitored the hourly price of electricity poste d by the Independent System Operator and recognized a correlation he said We noticed that a lot of times when the price was down our megawatts wou ld go down he said If the price was up often the megawatts would go up Olkjer said he was never told why he was being ordered to turn the plants output up and down When he asked he said company officials told him it w as none of his business Still he was puzzled particularly when he was told to throttle down the plant during electricity emergency alerts as he says he did Jan when the state declared a Stage alert with the possibility of rolling blackouts It doesnt make sense to cycle up and down when theres a Stage alert he said Duke spokesman Williams said the company may turn down units at the orders of the ISO during a Stage alert because the grid manager can find cheaper power somewhere else Lisa Szot spokeswoman at the ISO said she couldnt determine whether the ISO had ordered Duke to power down its Chula Vista plant Jan Olkjer said the frequent adjustments of power production which sometimes occurred every halfhour wear out the plants equipment Its harder on the machinery he said Its like driving down the street putting your foot on the gas and then slamming on the brake Before deregulation Olkjer said the four units at Chula Vista which have the capacity to produce megawatts had been operated steadily during mu ch of their history S David Freeman formerly general manager of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and now chief energy adviser to Gov Gray Davis said rapid cycling had become more common under deregulation and is hard on equipment We had almost megawatts of generating capacity down for repair last winter said Freeman referring to what industry experts agreed was an extraordinary level of plant outages over several months SDGE which built the Chula Vista plant in the s sold it to the Port District for million In the port leased the plant to Duke Energy for years in what critics are now calling a sweetheart deal The company pays minimal rent but has made large profits In the first quarter of this year Duke which owns three other plants in California sa id profits rose percent to million from energy sales and trading Duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for electricity It asked per megawatthour this year By comparison before the energy crisis began electricity sold for around per megawatthour an amount which powers about homes Federal regulators have ordered the company to refund million to the state for charging excessive prices unless the company can justify them In May the company offered to pay the state to settle any price gouging investigations but Gov Gray Davis declined Olkjer and Ed Edwards Jr who worked at the plant for years before bein g laid off in April said they couldnt understand why Duke ran the inefficient highcost turbine unit during the past year while other generators sat idle They said they believed it may have been an attempt to fetch a higher price for electricity because the company got extra fees when it ran Williams the Duke spokesman said the opposite was true He said Duke ran the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive It ran on jet fuel which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the other units Edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destroyed It ran so frequently and so hard it needed extensive repairs he said Edwards told CBS News last night that plant outages at Chula Vista were prolonged because one supervisor ordered him to dump spare parts The former power plant employees said they felt compelled to come forward because they saw the impact the power crisis was having on their community It kind of irritated me because you know theres people on a fixed income that cant afford a big utility bill said Olkjer Staff writer Craig D Rose contributed to this story Estimates of Power Profits Disputed Electricity A study of overcharges by suppliers may be flawed state officials say Davis quoted the figures to Congress By DOUG SMITH ROBERT J LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL Times Staff Writers Gov Gray Davis contention that California has been nicked for billio ns of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study that state officials concede may have significant flaws according to interviews and confidential government documents Those costsestimated by the state to be as high as billionwere central to Davis testimony this week before a US Senate committee where he again denounced power wholesalers and urged federal regulators to give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us The governors impassioned demand however was based on shaky calculations The formulas are being reworked said Charles Robinson vice president of Californias grid operator which prepared the study Robinson said he had no idea how much the amount allegedly overcharg ed by the generators might change For now he said the agency stands by the numbers But internal documents from the California Independent System Operator warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quantify the alleged excess profits could be well off the mark Whats more the documents caution against relying on the agencys stu dy as a basis for allegations of overchargingas Davis did during his testimo ny Wednesday That warning was particularly important because the documents provide for the first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy supplier prospered from the states power troubles between last summer and February The largest amounts were charged by four outofstate power companies according to the confidential CalISO report Okalhomabased Williams Cos led the group with million followed by Duke Energy with million Southern Company Energy Marketing now Mirant with million and Relian t Energy Services with million When told of the alleged profiteering attributed to them executives o f the companies insisted the numbers were grossly overstated because of CalISOs poor methodology Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his companys entire energy earnings for North America were less than the amount it was accused of reaping unfairly in California It doesnt add up It doesnt come close to adding up Williams said What CalISO has done is highly irresponsible math Paula HallCollins a Williams Cos spokeswoman said the firm would need to study the ISO report further But generally she said such reports fail to fully account for electricity production costs We maintain that we have not overcharged and that we have operated legally Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley also questioned the figures saying Theres a lot of misinformation out of there A Mirant spokesman said We haven t overcharged We havent manipulated We havent withheld Even some firms alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree we re outraged Joe Ronan vice president for government and regulatory relations at Calpine said the million attributed to his company doesnt bear any relation to reality Anybody can throw out any number he said Its like McCarthyism Where is the evidence A spokeswoman for Davis conceded that his refund figure was an estimat e but defended it as reasonable Its no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute an estimate of how much theyre gouging us senior advisor Nancy McFadden sai d Despite the cautions expressed in the CalISO documents officials Thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to the agencys figures as potential overcharges The way it should be characterized is the amount paid above a competitive benchmark said Robinson who is also CalISOs general counse l The first version of the nowdisputed CalISO study was made public in March It estimated that power sellers earned billion in excess profit s between May and last February The report later revised upward to billion became a crucial element of the Davis Administrations campaign against alleged electricity price gougers This week just before Davis appearance in Congress the study was updated again adding another billions in alleged excess profits throu gh May The orginal study which did not include actual pricing data was most ly intended to prod federal regulators into seeking information from generator s that the state had been denied Robinson said Thus far the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered refunds of only million Next week FERC is convening an unusual settlement conference aimed at addressing the outstanding claims by the state as well as those of sellers who claim they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars by California utilities One encouraging signal for state officials came this week when FERC reiterated an earlier order that Duke Energy pay millions in refunds The order stemmed from the companys sale of electricity at a megawatt hourfor thousands of hours FERCs order said Dukes pricing had resulted in million in billings A fair price for that power would have been per megawatt hou r the agency said Tom Williams a Duke spokesman said the firm is willing to accept the lower price He said he company has yet to collect a dime Times staff writers Elizabeth Shogren and Dan Morain contributed to th is story Edison Plans Bond Offer at Rate Debt Yield is about double what a creditworthy company would pay analyst s say But will investors bite By JERRY HIRSCH Times Staff Writer Edison International is offering investors what analysts are calling a n unprecedented interest rate for billion in notes to refinance debt Even so its far from certain that the Rosemeadbased power company will find enough buyers to complete the deal A failure by Edison to refinance million in bank debt that comes due June and an additional million in notes due in July could put t he company precariously close to bankruptcy and cast a shadow on Californias plan to sell billion in bonds to pay for power purchases said Dan Scotto a bond analyst at PNB Paribas in New York Even though it would at first appear to be a company setback it woul d really be a major setback for the state said Scotto who added that Edisons credit troubles could translate into higher prices for California s proposed bond offering Edison however said Thursday that the deal is moving forward We believe our deal is going well and we are comfortable with it said Jo Ann Goddard vice president for investor relations She declined to discuss other details of the offering Goldman Sachs Group Edisons investment bank expects to formally pri ce the offering Monday Edison officials would not comment on the proposed pri ce of the note offering but Wall Street sources said the power company was shopping the issue at the rate Edison floated the plan earlier this month as a way to tap the borrowi ng power of a profitable subsidiary to trim debt that comes due this year and to insulate itself from a possible bankruptcy of its ailing utility unit The utility Southern California Edison has lost billions of dollars on electricity sales over the last year The high interest rate on Edisons proposed sale of sevenyear notes i s about double what a creditworthy company would pay for a similar bond or note issue and would add a premium amounting to tens of millions of dollars in annual interest costs to the companys already strapped financial condition analysts said Its a full two percentage points higher than the average rate for other junk or speculative bonds And corporate bonds wit h similar ratings are going out at to Edison originally started marketing the issue at a full two percentage points higher than what analysts initially expected but then raised the rate to in recent days because it was finding few takers on Wall Street The word is that they couldnt get people interested and that they might not be able to get it done said Kurt Stabel a money manager at Street Asset Management in Newport Beach The higher rate however might be pulling investors out of the woodwo rk and has increased the chance that Edison will pull off the deal Scotto sai d This never promised to be a day at the beach Scotto said I think it is really a question of find the right price the price at which people fee l comfortable with the risk Both Stabel and Scotto said that Edisons note offering is unusually complicated and requires far more explaining or selling than typical corporate offerings Mission Energy Holding Co a company created by Edison for the sole purpose of issuing these bonds will offer the notes The assets of Edison Mission Energy a subsidiary that owns a network of power plants across the United States and in Asia Australia and New Zealand will secure the debt Mission Energy Holding plans to issue the proceeds to Edison in the fo rm of dividends giving the parent company funds to pay off a substantial portion of its debt The notes will have a credit rating of BBminus and come due in according to bond rating agency Standard Poors Thats slightly higher than the neardefault CC rating now carried by Edison If the offering failed Edison would face a series of difficult choice s that range from depleting its cash cushion to going back to its bankers and begging for continued forbearance Its SCE subsidiary already has defaulted on million in bonds and notes That triggered a default in bank lines of credit at Edison International and SCE which has since operated under extensions from its lenders Edison has about billion in cash including billion held by SCE according to regulatory documents This could all still unravel but I have been impressed with Edison s effort to inch along so far said Ellen Lapson an analyst at Fitch Inc a corporate credit rating service Who would have thought that they could ha ve lasted so many months after their first default in January and still not be in bankruptcy Positive developments for Edison including a deal to hold small generators at bay with partial payments from SCE and progress at crafting a rescue plan in both the state Legislature and the Public Utilities Commissi on have sparked a small rally in the companys stock Edison shares have risen this month They gained cents Thursday to close at on the New York Stock Exchange Energy Company Abandons Plans for Baldwin Hills Plant Power Homeowners and environmentalists rejoice at decision The site is proposed as a acre state park By JOE MOZINGO Times Staff Writer In a victory for environmentalists and nearby homeowners an energy company announced Thursday that it was abandoning its plan to build a power plant on the site of a proposed state park in the Baldwin Hills La Jolla Energy Development Inc in a letter to the state Energy Commission said it was withdrawing its application for fasttrack approval of the megawatt plant and will not pursue the Baldwin facility in the future We listened to the community La Jolla President Steve Wilburn said in an interview Thursday We need to find another place for this equipment The project was to be a joint venture between La Jolla and Stocker Resources an oil company that leases the land where the trailersized naturalgas plant would sit Stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether they will pursue the project At this point its just La Jolla pulling out Stocker spokesman Steve Rusch said But most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the fasttrack schedule the state has implemented to relieve the energy crisis The state commission was scheduled to decide whether to approve the project today in Sacramento but the hearing has been canceled The news sparked elation among environmentalists and nearby homeowners who had fought the proposal on grounds that it would pollute neighborhoods and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together acres of public open space in the hills Were getting ready to have the biggest party said Tony Nicholas president of the hills United Homeowners Assn This shows how a community can come together for a common goal and mobilize the people in a matter of days About of the residents in the hills are African American and many saw the issue as a matter of environmental justice In addition Stocker and La Jolla were seeking approval for the plant within days of filing their application under the governors emergency power orders By following this fasttracked procedure they would have bee n able to avoid the normal timeconsuming environmental review process That angered opponents even further and nearly people showed up at a public hearing Monday to fight the project But what officials said turned the tide against the projectat a time when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possiblewa s testimony from a South Coast Air Quality Management official who said his agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly Executive Director Barry Wallerstein said his agency would have to conduct hearings that would take up to days pushing construction well beyond a Sept deadline set by the governor for fasttrack projects He also said it was unlikely Stocker could get needed exemptions from federal clean air laws In a letter to the Energy Commission this week Wallerstein wrote It appears that the Baldwin Energy Facility could not begin operation until so me time in the first part of at the earliest By Wednesday night the energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statemen t recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a plant citing Wallersteins concerns Conservationists embraced the outcome as a sign that the movement to create a park was gaining steam The Baldwin Hills Conservancy was created last year with the idea of creating green space for the densely populated neighborhoods of south Los Angeles With support from the governor and loca l politicians the state recently bought a acre parcel in the area for an unprecedented million This is a great day for the Baldwin Hills and all the people who have worked so hard to bring this worldclass vision to reality said Esther Feldman president of Community Conservancy International and the main organizer to build the park Also applauding La Jollas decision were state Sen Kevin Murray DCulver City and Assemblyman Herb Wesson DCulver City who had come o ut strongly against the project They and others questioned whether the small amount of power provided by the facilitycoming online after the dog days of summerwould do much to relieve the energy crisis Im ecstatic Wesson said At this point the environment has won The plant would have sat on what is a working oil field about feet from the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area And according to park proponents it would lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy on what would be a halfmile bridge of land arching over La Cienega Boulevard Rusch the spokesman for Stocker said much of the information circulating about the trailersized plant is false The plan did not call for a stack with billowing smoke he said If the issue is air quality weve cleaned air quality up In the last decade Rusch said the companys existing oil pumps on the property have reduc ed nitrogen oxide emissions from tons to tons a year The power plantwith two foot stackswould ultimately add about tons a year He said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing it s own power to pump oil while also contributing an extra megawatts to the state grid during the energy crisis Residents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve the energy problem Said Mary Ann Green president of the Blair Hills Homeowners Assn We just hope that Stocker would be responsive to the outcry from the community Western states could feel pinch from California pricing KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer Friday June Associated Press URL cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchiven ation alEDTDTLtypeDnews PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP When power supplies stretch thin across the West this summer who will deci de whether Silicon Valley computers Washington apple orchards or Las Vegas casinos get first dibs on whats left Its a key question raised by the decision of federal energy regulators thi s week to cap electricity prices throughout the West using a formula based o n Californias power costs Economists energy industry executives and officials in all states are beginning to analyze the fit of this new piece in the energy puzzle Though most call the order a good step that could prevent price gouging others worry the pricing system could lead to electricity shortages for Californias neighbors or prompt utilities to stock up on power contracts to fend off shortages That could diminish any leverage power buyers might hav e as they compete for the remaining megawatts available each day Tying the highest possible power price to California could cause a problem come winter when power demand drops in the Golden State said Gary Ackerma n director of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents most sellers of energy States where consumers need electricity to heat furnaces through the winter would be unable to outbid each other above the price cap which is usually determined by a formula based on the highest bid for lastminute power duri ng the most recent energy supply emergency in California That may leave power wholesalers and not a free market to decide who gets the energy Certainly California has a tremendous pull on our prices and has for probably the last year said Claudia Rapkoch spokeswoman for Montana Powe r Co which supplies natural gas and electricity to twothirds of the Big Sk y state What it means for this winter were just going to have to wait and see California utilities had much more control over power supplies before deregulation in obligated them to sell off their power plants to encourage competition This brought lower prices for a time but gave contr ol over power supplies to wholesalers that arent obligated by state law to serve the serve the best interests of local customers Rather than appointing one power grid manager to decide how to divide power in the West Ackerman predicts utilities in nonderegulated states will simply sell their power within their borders That would hurt California which this week imported about percent of its electricity and its remaining supply from local plants owned by outofstate power companies Price cap or not utilities in the region will watch out for each other as best they can because they might need the favor returned said Charles Reinhold executive consultant for Electric Resources Strategies in Ariz Saddled with rising bills that threatened to exhaust the states budget California recently began to sign longterm contracts with generators Gov Gray Davis credits the change for helping to drastically reduce prices on t he spot market which earlier this month fell below per megawatt hour for the first time in a year The longterm contracts though werent cheap California will pay an average of per megawatt

Energy Inc to avoid refunding millions of dollars to California for charging exorbitant electricity prices in January and February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission first ordered the refunds on March and Duke responded by filing a challenge But the commission on Monday rejected the companys appeal and reiterated its earlier order claiming Du ke had abused its power in the California energy market when it sold power for per megawatt hour We will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding or behavior the commission said Duke acknowledged this month that it had charged per megawatt for about megawatt hours sold to the states major utilities in January a nd February netting it more than million in receivables The commission did not specify how much money Duke should refund but it directed the company to readjust its January billings for those hours to a price of From a FERC document it appears that about hours occurred in January which would result in a total refund for that month of million Duke is one of the companies that have been identified by both the Californ ia Independent System Operator the manager of the states electricity grid a nd the FERC as having exercised market power and overcharged Californians for electricity Meanwhile employees at the South Bay power plant in San Diego run by Duke are expected to testify in a state Senate committee hearing today that the company ramped production up and down That allegedly was aimed at lowering power production during shortages and attempting to drive up electricity prices on the spot market The

Price cap victory may rob Democrats of campaign issue Marc Sandalow Washington Bureau Chief Friday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Washington There was a reason Gov Gray Davis donned a dark blue jacket and endured beastly humid degree heat this week in an area behind the Capitol known as the House swamp The nation was watching And after months of political free fall his messa ge seemed to be taking hold California has been bilked out of billion while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was asleep at the switch Davis declared repeating testimony he had delivered hours earlier in the airconditioned confines of a Senate hearing room Wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as television cameras and two dozen reporters recorded the scene the California governor apparently couldnt resist taking another shot For nearly a year Ive been pounding on this commission to enforce the law The states energy crisis with its volatile spot markets outofstate generators and dearth of alternative energy providers is a dizzyingly complex policy puzzle The politics are much simpler Democrats present themselves as consumer crusaders defending helpless utility customers from greedy energy conglomerates and misguided regulators Republicans portray themselves as stewards of the free market and longterm solutions rejecting price caps and refunds as heavyhanded overreactions with Sovietstyle results The Democratic populism seems to be winning the battle Though the debate i s far from settled the consumeroriented approach to Californias energy woe s has raised their hopes of winning back the House of Representatives in and the White House in Republicans are scared out of their minds about this said one gleeful Democrat on Capitol Hill who suggested that the White Houses lackadaisica l response to Californias problems would rile consumers from coast to coast This could rival Pete Wilsons alienation of Latinos said the Democrat referring to the former Republican governors strident stand against illega l immigrants which many blame for the partys weak standing in California A sign of the GOPs concern surfaced this week with television ads finance d by anonymous sources but produced by Republican Party strategists that bla me the Democratic governor for Californias energy problems Democrats who long have worried that the crisis could cost Davis a second term now take credit for having pressured the White House and federal regulators to take a more active role The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which had previously resisted suc h efforts took steps toward controlling wholesale electricity prices Monday Later in the week two commissioners appointed by President Bush testified that they might be open to further price restrictions and support huge refunds to California And just yesterday Vice President Dick Cheney who has been among Californias most vocal critics told Senate Democrats behin d closed doors that he could support refunds to California if federal regulators agreed according to those in the meeting There is no doubt in my mind that action taken by federal regulators was the direct result of pressure for price relief led primarily by the California delegation Davis said The pressure did not come only from Democrats Republican lawmakers some o f whom fear the crisis could cost them seats in wrote FERC last week requesting commissioners to take further actions to help the state The Democrats public relations success follows an effort by the party to raise the profile of its consumer crusade Hardly a day has passed in the past several weeks without a group of Democrats holding a news conference t o attack the White House the Republican controlled House or FERC for inactio n But it may have just as much to do with a White House that has been far mor e focused on longterm energy production than the immediate concerns of Californians Even as it engaged in a legitimate policy dispute over how to solve the power mess the Bush administration appeared indifferent to the plight of residents experiencing skyrocketing energy bills and rolling blackouts Bush tried to correct that impression with a trip to the state last month But the damage appears to have extended beyond California A CBS NewsNew York Times poll released this week of adults from acro ss the country showed that only one in three voters approved of the job Bush w as doing on energy More than half the respondents said that protecting the environment was a higher priority than producing energy yet barely one in said that Bush shared that priority Some Republicans say that Bush was in a nowin position contending that anything he did would have been attacked by Californias opportunistic governor Politics is Davis main objective and I dont see the Bush administrati on being that way said Rep George Radanovich RFresno The question for some analysts is whether Democrats might have been too successful By pressuring the federal government to take a more active role Democrats may lose their ability to point the finger at a convenient scapegoat Davis has always needed rate caps much less than he needed a scapegoat No w that FERC has given him what he wants or close enough to it its a lot harder for him to lay blame back on Washington when the blackouts kick in said

Matthew Yi Chronicle Staff Writer Friday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews As state legislators consider Gov Gray Davis deal to buy part of the powe r grid in California a public records advocacy group filed a lawsuit yesterd ay demanding that the state release a report on potential health hazards of living near highvoltage transmission lines The document could be vital to how legislators vote on the billion de al to buy Southern California Edisons power lines said Terry Francke genera l counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition which filed the lawsu it in Alameda County Superior Court The power line deal was brokered by the governor to help the cashstrapped utility Legislators must approve the power grid purchase by Aug or the utility can back out Davis also has a billion agreement to purchase San Diego G as and Electrics power grid which also would require the Legislatures approval Pacific Gas and Electric has not agreed to sell its transmission lines The power lines report was completed in April by California Electric and Magnetic Fields Program an agency set up by the state Department of Health Services to study the issue Francke said Both state agencies and their directors are named in the lawsuit Efforts to keep the report secret are suspect Francke said If its known theres some danger do you want the state owning that liability he asked The study began in after the state Public Utilities Commission committ ed million for research and education on the subject Francke said The state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and electric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies based on those findings he said The report was scheduled to be released to the public on May but at the last minute the Public Utilities Commission apparently instructed the staf f of the EMF Program to keep the reports secret the lawsuit said State health services spokeswoman Lea Brooks said that the report was only a draft and that her department was following orders from the PUC The PUC wanted to see the draft before it is released she said We prepared the report for them We are following their request Brooks refused comment on the lawsuit saying her office hadnt seen it PU C officials were not available for comment Studies on the effects of magnetic fields have resulted in no clear consens us on their effects Francke said Thats what makes the state study important for legislators to consider before voting on the governors deal to buy transmission lines he said Opponents of the power grid deals say the report may add to objections to Davis agreements with the utilities Some legislators would rather the sta te help build more power generators in California They are extra nails in the coffin said James Fisfis spokesman for stat e Assembly minority leader Dave Cox RFair Oaks We have fundamental issues with the transmission lines but when you start stacking these items up you have an undigestible deal Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said he believed the governor hadnt seen th e health hazard report Obviously if something pops up and is an issue youll take a look at it but I dont think were at that point yet he said An Alameda County Superior Court judge will hear the lawsuit on July Francke said Email Matthew Yi at San Francisco

cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive B UDTLtypeDnews Theres trouble in Texas Enron Corp the Houston power firm thats profited mightily during Californias energy crisis is suffering a surprising lack of popularity on Wall Street While all eyes have been on Enrons enormous profits here and its enormous pull in Washington DC the reputed titan of the newly incarnated free wheeling power industry has lost half its market capitalization more tha n billion since its peak in August Forgive Californians for savoring a bit of schadenfreude over the Houston boys reversal of fortunes But what gives Isnt this the company that was fattening up on the backs of the states beleaguered utilities residents a nd state budget Isnt this the company with such close ties to the Bush administration that Kenneth Lay Enrons chairman was reported to have interviewed a candidate for a job on the commission that regulates his company Yup That Enron On Monday Enron shares hit a week low of after the Federal Ener gy Regulatory Commission decided to apply the same price controls to power marketers such as Enron that had applied to powergenerating companies for months Thats a far cry from August when the companys shares peaked at Theres a whole kaleidoscope of issues that Enron is being challenged with in the marketplace right now none of which on the surface is a major deal said Donato J Eassey an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities in Houston But when you combine them all I think whats happening here is you have a crescendo with this FERC announcement You have people saying OK the growth rate is now in question That growth rate was an eyepopping percent in revenues for the Unite d States on a twoyear average and nearly percent in the rest of the worl d Enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews but as the sto ck continued to drop Tuesday morning chief executive Jeff Skilling issued a statement to the markets in which he reiterated strong confidence in its earnings guidance The stock rebounded slightly throughout the week closin g at yesterday In a speech at the Commonwealth Club last night Skilling blamed regulatory interference with the free market for investor flight from his company Our stock prices have gotten hammered he said Theyre half what they were a year ago Tumbling stock prices werent the only bad news for Skilling last night A protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began speaking As Skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face a woman was arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges Enron isnt the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with Californias power crisis and are now suddenly headed south Shares of Reliant Energy Inc AES Inc and Williams Companies Inc which generate a nd sell electricity in California and El Paso Energy Corp which sells natur al gas here are all trading near week lows The main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in Washington abou t power price controls reregulation and now the possibility of big refunds being ordered for California Even Calpine Corp of San Jose which has developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played th e spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics dropped nearl y percent yesterday to But none of the companies has been hit as hard as Enron Such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any company It leaves it less money to invest in its own growth and because executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price a sharp decline makes it more difficult to retain talented leaders While Enrons power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine the firm h as been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other regio ns in recent months In the financial press the continuing knock on Enron is that its business lines are so new and complex and the company is so secretive about its operations that analysts and fund managers dont feel confident in their understanding of what it does A look at the firms recent troubles exemplifies its diversity For instance Enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state governme nt of Maharashtra in India over a megawatt power plant there The Dahbol Power Co which is percent controlled by Enron stopped construction on a second phase of the project on Sunday claiming it is owed million by t he Maharashtra State Electricity Board The state has accused Enron of chargin g too much and not generating enough and stopped buying power from the plant last month Closer to home Enron has struggled with its investments in fiberoptic bandwidth The company buys and sells unused highspeed bandwidth space treating it like a commodity as it does electricity coal or natural gas B ut the fiberoptic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear that for all the longdistance cable laid in the ground there have not bee n enough last mile connections set up for users to actually take advantage of it Earlier this year Enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with Blockbuster to offer what it called video on demand in which customers a t home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it transmitted via fiberoptic cables Then there was the FERC ruling For months the agency had resisted aggressive price controls in the West preferring to let the market run its course But as control of the US Senate was handed to Democrats this mont h and President Bush appointed a tough Texan regulator named Patrick Wood III to the commission the agency changed its tune It expanded price controls to all hours of the day spread the controls throughout the Western region and brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent So under current calculations that means Enron could sell power for no mor e than per megawatt in a shortage and about during normal hours f ar short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly charging during the past year In part the companys gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of the businesses Enron has decided to pursue And the hardcharging company h as a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets But sometime s that approach gets it in trouble as was the case last year when Enron had to take a million charge for its failed investment in Azurix a global water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply the same way it had done for electricity service as governments privatized their water systems The opportunities never materialized Add it all together and Enron has a tough time supporting a priceearnings ratio of nearly considerably above the liberal standard of health whic h is The company had less than billion in profits on more than billion in revenues last year Still a survey by Thomson FinancialFirst Call found that analysts expect Enron to deliver earnings of cents per share in the second quarter up from cents last year and per sha re on the year Most maintain a strong buy rating on the stock But investors with big positions in Enron have taken a hit Hardestput of them will be the Janus funds which as Enrons largest mutual fund investo r held nearly billion of its stock as of the end of April In a semiannual report to investors John Schreiber a portfolio manager said the stock price of the newage energy merchant was a victim of negative psychology resulting from the California energy crisis Janus declined to make fund managers available for interviews

Former employees say Duke Energy slowed production of electricity to create an artificial shortage boost profits BY DION NISSENBAUM Mercury News Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO One of the largest companies producing power in California ordered workers to throw out spare parts and shut down equipment in an effo rt to drive up the price of electricity former power plant workers said Thursday Speaking out on the eve of appearances at a state Senate hearing the three men offered the strongest evidence yet that at least one power producer Duke Energy sought to make more money by creating an artificial shortage that may have created huge electricity price spikes Their intent in my opinion was to boost the price up said Glenn Johnson a mechanic who worked for two decades at the Chula Vista power pla nt now run by Duke If Ive got the only box of penicillin in town and your e sick I can charge a million dollars a box he said If you want to liv e youre going to have to pay Officials at Duke angrily challenged the accusations calling them irresponsible charges by disgruntled workers who were let go in April Their allegations are just comical just highly erroneous said Tom Williams a spokesman for Duke which runs four plants in California that produce enough energy for nearly million homes The charges come as the state heads into negotiations next week with generators over the billion the state claims its consumers have been overcharged Duke based in Charlotte NC came under considerable criticism when it disclosed that it charged the state a record a megawatthour for power in January Federal officials have called the charg e unreasonable and ordered Duke to refund California the money The employees who first made their allegations public on CBS Evening News Thursday night will be the only witnesses today at an energy crisis hearing headed by lawmakers who suspect that power companies have been illegally gouging California State Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove chairman of a committee investigating price gouging said the allegations raise serious concerns While we stil l need to hear the other side of the story from Duke if theres any truth to the information I believe it would be devastating to the generators he said Perfectly good parts In interviews with the Mercury News Thursday night the three former plant workers said that they were directed to scale back energy production and throw out good spare parts that kept the plant from getting up to full powe r for weeks Ed Edwards who worked in the Southern California plant said that he was told to get rid of many boxes of good spare parts Edwards said he tossed more than pallets of parts into a dumpster I dont know why they were throwing away perfectly good parts he said It didnt make sense Johnson said the lack of onsite parts prevented workers from quickly fixin g problems that reduced the amount of power the plant could produce Sometime s he said it took weeks to get parts Johnsons suspicions of gouging were echoed by Jimmey Olkjer who spent years in the plant and worked as an assistant control operator Even at times when California regulators were warning residents the state might not be able to find enough energy to prevent imminent blackouts Olkj er said he was directed to scale back the amount of electricity the plant was producing In hindsight it looks to me like they were manipulating the power Olkjer said Duke called the allegations baseless and said the workers didnt understand the reasons for the actions Continued accusations repetitive investigations and inflammatory rhetoric concerning the companys operation s in the state are distracting attention from the true issue of solving Californias energy crisis Duke said in a statement Williams did not directly dispute the workers allegations But he said the y did not understand the reasons behind the decisions State directives Duke cut back on the amount of power it was producing in response to directives from state regulators at the Independent System Operator which runs the power grid Williams said They did not know that the ISO was instructing them to go up and down to meet supply and demand he said An ISO spokeswoman said that the grid manager sometimes asks generators to produce more or less power to adjust traffic on the transmission system or respond to the states electricity needs Some companies bid power into the reserve market which means these plants run only when the extra energy is tapped ISO officials say they are prohibited from discussing individual bids As for the spare parts Williams said they were eliminated as unnecessary after Duke bought the plants from San Diego Gas Electric Williams said Duke has one of the best performance records in the state wi th its power plants offline for unscheduled maintenance only about percen t of the time All three workers were given severance packages and let go in April But Edwards disputed any contention that they were trying to get back at Duke Im not a disgruntled employee he said Im just telling the truth o f what I saw the last two years I worked there No matter what the reasons were for the decisions Duke has made huge profi ts during the California energy crisis And those profits apparently created good cheer among Duke executives At one party Johnson said executives gleefully celebrated their good fortune Were making more money than we ever thought possible Johnson quoted t he plants manager as saying Mercury News staff writer John Woolfolk contributed to this report Contact Dion Nissenbaum at or Enron chief Gov Davis not to blame for energy crisis BY KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO AP California Gov Gray Davis isnt to blame for Californias power crisis and neither are electricity wholesalers a Texas energy executive told a crowd at the Commonwealth Club of California Jeffrey Skilling CEO and president of Houstonbased Enron Corp wiped awa y the remnants of a pie hurled by a protester Thursday and placed the blame squarely on Californias energy regulators The state Public Utilities Commission in the early s put together a broken market by preventing utilities to pass along the full cost of power and discouraging power contracts that would have lowered dependence on buyi ng lastminute power Skilling said Because of these rules the power consumers of the state of California we re thrown totally to the mercy of the spot market Skilling said PUC president Loretta Lynch defended the regulators actions last week saying utilities have been free to enter into longterm contracts Utilitie s countered that the PUC never made clear what contracts it would accept whi ch left open the possibility they would later be overruled I think consumers in California are angry and they should be Skilling said Prices in California shouldnt be as high as they are Skilling also Congratulated Davis for Californias unprecedented conservation Denied accusations that Enron chairman Kenneth Lay personally interviewed candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees interstate energy markets Told the audience to expect a report that would show California municipal utilities have profited the most selling power to the state Said price caps ordered by FERC earlier this week would likely damage the markets and would only exacerbate the problem Acknowledged that municipal utilities in the state have managed to provid e cheaper power to their customers and even profit from the power crisis by selling off extra power despite public control Enron has come under fire after accusations from Davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply Enron denies such claims and joins other power producers in arguing that t he state and utilities still owe them billions in unpaid bills Davis acknowledges that Pacific Gas Electric Co which has declared bankruptcy and Southern California Edison together still owe generators such as Enron Duke Energy Mirant and Reliant Energy about billion for past electricity sales Our success is linked to efficient markets not higher prices in Californ ia or anywhere else Skilling said Protesters gathered outside the building wearing pig masks and carrying handmade signs one of which read Greed is the only power crisis Its basically Enron and the other companies raising prices said Berna rd Greening a Santa Clara computer programmer who said hes unhappy with the record prices for electricity and natural gas Pete Snoek of Tiburon said he believed what Skilling had to say I believe the energy situation has been politicized so badly Snoek sai d saying he was one of several in the audience to shush protesters during the meeting I hear the same people out there as if its a sin to make any money in this country State officials counter that wholesalers charged as much as billion in illegal overcharges dating back to May Companies have said Californias claims are wildly exaggerated The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already estimated that wholesalers owe California million in overcharges for the first four months of the year Davis and others say thats a mere drop in the bucket Enron has also been tied to President Bushs handsoff approach to the ener gy crisis Company chairman Kenneth Lay is a friend and one of the largest campaign contributors to Bush and the GOP Several prominent members of the Bush administration hold stock in the company Enron is one of several major GOP donors accused of meeting secretly with Vice President Dick Cheney as he drafted the Bush administrations energy plan Enron is one of the worlds leading electricity natural gas and communications companies with billion in revenues in It owns miles of pipeline has employees and is active in countrie s During the first quarter of this year Enrons revenues increased perce nt to billion Three say company purposely cut power ExDuke workers say repairs were curbed in order to manipulate output June By KIMBERLY KINDY The Orange County Register FORMER DUKE ENERGY employees Ed Edwards left Glenn Johnson center and Jimmy Olkjer are to appear before a state Senate committee today Photo Dave Yoder The Register Three former Duke Energy workers say they were ordered to tamper with equipment at a San Diego County power plant causing mechanical problems that helped drive up electricity prices during the states energy crisis The workers say they will offer eyewitness testimony to a state Senate committee today the first public accounts from power plant employees of h ow energy production may have been manipulated Duke officials deny most of the allegations The whistleblowers mechanic s Ed Edwards and Glenn Johnson and control room operator Jimmy Olkjer lost their jobs four months ago State Sen Joe Dunn the Santa Ana Democrat who is chairing the investigati ve committee on pricefixing said his staff will attempt to verify the accoun ts from the whistleblowers But their mere presence in a Capitol hearing room is expected to set off a media circus And if the accusations are true it could have wideranging effects on the North Carolina companys operations in California Duke officials were working late into the night to prepare for the hearing and have scheduled a news conference later today They were doing all kinds of things that didnt make sense Johnson said in an interview But if you asked them why to explain they told you to shut up and do your job The testimony comes on the heels of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruling Thursday ordering Duke to refund million in overcharges for January This information lends credence to the concern that there was a deliberate strategy for outages for the sole purpose of impacting price Dunn said What they are saying is disturbing Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said the fact that the former workers lo st their jobs may be shaping their testimony The proof is in the pudding Production is up and weve had fewer forced outages since weve taken over said Williams But controlroom logs obtained by The Orange County Register show Dukes trading arm ordered its South Bay power plant in Chula Vista to reduce production minutes after Stage Three alerts were issued The logs are for January the same month that Duke was accused of overcharging in California The three former Duke workers each worked at the Chula Vista plant for more than two decades when it was owned by San Diego Gas Electric They lost their jobs when Duke assembled a new team to run the plant The three whistleblowers outlined their accusations in interviews with the Register The accusations include The company ordered workers to throw unopened boxes of bolts steam seals valves and other parts into Dumpsters The parts were needed to perform routine maintenance but were no longer available when repairs were required Duke officials acknowledge that new parts were discarded but say the high inventory tax made it more efficient to order parts as needed because they could be delivered within hours Edwards and Johnson say they were ordered to dismantle critical equipment necessary for the generating units to run at full capacity Because parts were thrown away they couldnt make repairs and generators ran at diminish ed capacity for days or weeks Energy experts say this allegation if true would allow Duke to withhold energy from the marketplace which could drive up the price Duke officials counter that production has increased at its power plants and forced outages have decreased since they took over But in late there was a spike in outages at the Chula Vista plant according to records kept by the states powergrid operator The plant reported hours of outages from October through December There were relatively few outages before that The mechanics say the inability to perform repairs forced them to use a small expensive generator that was rarely powered up before Duke took over the plant Experts say that could have been used to exploit federal rules allowing generators to justify prices based on the costliest units online Olkjer says he received orders from Dukes trading arm to reduce production Then when energy prices jumped he would get new instructions to power up again Duke officials did not respond to Olkjers claim Stanford professor Frank Wolak an expert in Californias energy market sa id that if their testimony can be proven the state could be refunded millions of dollars and future energy prices could be dramatically reduced What they are saying is amazing This is a classic plot Ive always wondered how they kept the generators out for so long said Wolak who heads an electricity market surveillance for the California agency that oversees the buying and selling of power They were very happy to have the m offline because it allowed them to make more money Wolak said the testimony seems to back up research conducted by the state Independent System Operator which runs most of the states power grid and oversees the buying and selling of electricity in California In a report to federal regulators ISO said that from May to November Duke withheld electricity from the states power grid percent of the tim e The report accused more than a dozen power plant companies of powering down generators to create scarcity in the marketplace that would in turn drive u p prices In a separate report the state power grid operator accused Duke of overcharging California again in January of this year resulting in the million refund order Duke officials say charging a megawatthour wa s justified during a short period of time Federal regulators disagreed and said the power merchant should have charged no more than per megawatthour Williams Dukes spokesman said that the company has been an ethical operator All but percent of the time we were operating Thats very good sa id Williams adding that when SDGE owned the plant forced outages took place percent of the time But Dunn said that if the testimony from the whistleblowers is true and Duke had the ability to manipulate prices federal regulators would be required under the Federal Power Act to move them out of the competitive marketplace This would mean they would be moved back into a costbased market structu re and would only be allowed to recover costs at a fair rate of return This would bring the prices down dramatically in California Dunn said What generators fear most is being returned to costbased rate regulation Allegations of market manipulation Nearly a dozen investigations are under way to determine if energy producers illegally manipulated Californias dysfunctional electricity market Here a re the main allegations Was power deliberately withheld to boost prices Several investigators including the Public Utilities Commission the California attorney general and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a re trying to determine if the largest generators and power marketers includi ng Duke Reliant Mirant and Dynegy shut down power plants at key times Federal Environmental Protection Agency records showed times in December when Tulsabased Williams throttled back at midday letting Williams boost profits at other plants it controlled including a Huntington Beach plant owned by AES Corp Were financial incentives offered to plant operators who shut down Federal regulators have settled a case for million with Williams Among the allegations Williams offered ffinancial incentives to AES if it would keep its plants offline Williams has denied any wrongdoing Did companies collude Traders and producers were able to share information on Web sites that helped them determine when to get the

They must be required to give us back our money Davis told the Senate Government Affairs Committee during two hours of testimony and questioning It was the first time Californias chief executive has testified on the states crisis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The billion is the amount Californias Independent System Operator says generators overcharged utilities and the state from May to May of this year It had initially calculated that between May and February there were billion in overcharges Davis said Those figures are a far cry from the million that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say s were overcharges Thats because FERC only looked at three months of rates and only when the state was in an energy alert The governor faced tough pointed questioning from Republican members and glowing praise and sympathy for his states plight from Democratic colleagues Everything from refunds to longterm contracts will be on the table at next weeks settlement meeting FERC has given the parties until July to make a deal If they cant the administrative judge overseeing the talks will make a recommendation to FERC which can order the paybacks Sen Barbara Boxer introduced a bill Wednesday to require refunds if FERC doesnt act Not surprisingly generators dont see the refund issue the governors way Its just crazy said Tom Williams a spokesman at Duke Energy I dont know how theyre coming up with these numbers And theres skepticism about next weeks talks The negotiations are going to be like the SALT Treaty said Gary Ackerman president of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents power suppliers I question whether it can happen and work out Also at issue is money generators say they are owed by the utilities Davis said thats about billion But power companies say its more like billion to billion Whatever the figure Davis said we want to see their money in our pockets before we talk about working anything out on their end The settlement conference was part of FERCs order instituting aroundtheclock price caps for California and its Western neighbors Those price caps were made possible experts agree because California lawmakers from both sides of the aisle riled up the public enough over the issue that the Bush administration felt the heat The question is whether that can work with refunds Pressure could come from a number of places said Charles Cook a nonpartisan political analyst who has followed Californias crisis It cou ld come from Republican members from the state from party donors in Californi a who President George W Bush is going to have to go back to and then may be from his economic advisers who say that California cant be allowed to go belly up Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said new FERC Commissioner Patri ck Wood a confidant of Bush has been receptive to their refund pleas That w as the case Wednesday when Wood expected to be named FERC chairman sometime this year told members of the Senate panel that refunds may be an important tool in the regulatory toolbox If were to be a vigilant market cop we need to make sure that our bite matches our bark Wood and the other new commissioner Nora Mead Brownell will meet with Dav is in Sacramento on Monday RELATED STORY Energy notebook Energy notebook Blackouts are still a hot prospect officials warn June By the Associated Press BERKELEY Experts at the University of California Energy Institute say residents statewide should not be comforted by the fact that widespread blackouts have been avoided recently I would say this is not a great sign that were going to skate by later th is summer said Severen Borenstein a UC Berkeley economist who heads the institute It doesnt look like the system right now can handle a blazing hot day If its real hot in Northern and Southern California were going to have blackouts Greg Fishman a spokesman for the California Independent System Operator which controls the states electricity grid said ISO preferred to look on the bright side Does the fact that were meeting electricity demand today mean were out o f the woods No but is the fact that were meeting demand today good Sure i t is Fishman said Air conditioners are the single biggest factor in summer electricity demand If thermostats on air conditioners were turned to degrees

transmission system owned by parent company Sempra Energy is getting mixed reaction Under the plan unveiled Monday the state would buy the system for billion and a million debt owed to the utility by its customers would be forgiven It would seem that anything that in the short term lets the ratepayers off the hook particularly small businesses that can ill afford drastic balloon payments is a good thing said Suzanne Strassburger of Escondidos Downto wn Business Association Douglas Heller a consumer advocate with the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights called the deal a cruel joke on the part of Gov Davis to say that hes burst the balloon payment because were going to be paying f or it Were applying that much to buy out Sempras transmission lines GE tries to enter states transmissionlines business SACRAMENTO Through an alliance with a littleknown startup company General Electric Co is trying to enter Californias transmission lines business Although TransElect a yearold company based in Washington has no experience in the transmission business it has the financial support of GE s billion financial arm GE Capital TransElects latest offer comes as Gov Gray Davis seeks legislative approval for his plan to buy the transmission lines of both San Diego Gas Electric and Southern California Edison Any involvement by GE in the states transmission grid could be a conflict of interest said a lawmaker involved in the efforts to end Californias power crisis Youve got someone with generation and transmission systems how do they keep them separate and do they said Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek Thats a concern for me Would they have the ability to restrict competitors access to transmissions Bob Mitchell TransElects vice president said the company made its offer believing that the Legislature wont approve the deals to buy the two utilities lines GE joined forces with TransElect on March when GE Capital Services Structured Finances Group Inc

averted Wednesday as power reserves remained above percent Track the states blackout warnings on the Web at wwwcaisocomSystemStatushtml In rolling blackouts together is all relative June I have a confession to make Im an N And as an N I cant help feeli ng a little guilty I feel guilty that I wont be called upon to share the pain of all those As in Irvine and Laguna Woods or the Ms in Costa Mesa and Cypress While the Ms in Fountain Valley suffer and sweat through rolling blackouts Ill be sitting pretty Because Im an N And the dirty little secret about rolling power blackouts is how many of us are out there Allow me to explain As you may have heard Southern California Edison has been required to set up a public notification system for rolling blackouts If you hear on the news that the power guys are expecting rolling blackouts you can go to a Web si te wwwscecom or call a tollfree phone number to see if you r rotating outage group is on the list for going temporarily dark How do you know which group youre in On your Edison power bill next to your account number theres a code that starts with A or M A A M M and so on Thats your outage group number But wait Theres another category of outage group If your power bill has the code number N on it it means that youre exempt from rolling blackouts You see under Public Utilities Commission rules electric power customers who provide essential public health safety and security services such as fire and police stations hospitals jails and so on are automatically exempt from rolling blackouts even if they have emergency generators on site And because of the way electric power service is set up anybody who s on the same circuit with an essential service provider is also exempt from rolling blackouts For example my house shares a circuit with a fire station So Im an exemp t N as are the other power customers on the same circuit But heres the kicker According to an Edison spokesman percent of all Edison customers are Ns that is they share circuits with essential service providers and thus are currently exempt from rolling blackouts Let me repeat that Half of all Edison customers are exempt from rolling blackouts For San Diego Gas Electric customers its percent Mind you this isnt something Edison likes to publicize When I asked abou t it for a column three months ago Edison said it didnt know how many power customers are automatically exempt And when the company unveiled its blackout warning plan this week neither the Edison press release nor news reports mentioned the percent exemption figure True even exempt power customers can be affected by rolling blackouts at work at the store at a traffic light Still the next time you hear some power company or government official say Were all in this together dont believe it When it comes to rolling blackouts the truth is that only half of us are really all in this togethe r And even an N can see that isnt fair

Three former San Diego Gas Electric Co employees who worked at a Duke Energy plant said Thursday that the generator destroyed working parts withheld power supply or otherwise took actions that they believe drove up the price of electricity State officials said the whistleblowers comments at a state Senate hearin g today could provide the most damaging illustration yet that power generator s held down production to inflate prices on the spot market Gov Gray Davis has long alleged that power companies have overcharged the state and utilities Jimmy Olkjer a former assistant control room operator at Dukes South Bay plant in San Diego said in a phone interview that during the states power shortages Duke cut supply Although Duke a Charlotte NCbased company owned the plant and it contracted with SDGE to operate the unit he said Rather than creating more power they were creating less Olkjer said I think there was manipulation of the market The California Public Utilities Commission and several state legislative committees continue to investigate price manipulation allegations and Attorney General Bill Lockyer has said he will take witnesses to a grand ju ry next month The generators have denied they manipulated the market We stand behind our maintenance practices and have done a good job keeping the power flowing Duke spokesman Tom Williams told the CBS television network But former mechanic Glenn Johnson said he saw generation units taken down for economics Ed Edwards also a mechanic said he was ordered to destroy pallets of working parts We were asked myself and other employees to disperse of perfectly good parts that were used to make repairs of systems and components Edwards said State Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana chairman of the marketmanipulation committee said his staff has been looking for employees or others with intimate knowledge of power plant operation to come forward and he promise d that others will testify at future hearings Its the first time that weve had evidence from directly within power plants in California that the ramping up and ramping down of power generati on was a response to price and not to demand Dunn said He said he would reach no conclusions until Duke and other generators testi fy next month but he added that the former employees testimony raises suspicions at first blush The Bees Kevin Yamamura can be reached at or Consumers cut their own power in protest By Silvina Martnez Bee Staff Writer Published June When the temperature hit degrees at pm Thursday Larry Lynch turned off the air conditioner unplugged the refrigerator pulled out the TV cord s and shut down all other appliances in the house Lynch a yearold newsletter publisher in Sacramento responded to the Roll Your Own Blackout Thursday and joined thousands throughout the state to protest energy policies and promote conservation by stopping the use of energy from pm But the data coming off the grid at the California Independent System Operator didnt show the effort During the first hour of the voluntary shutoff the demand for energy by PGE customers in Northern California was almost the same as at the same ti me Wednesday ISO officials said Protesters didnt expect significant changes on the grid I feel it will at least send a message that we dont have to depend on it energy said Jackie Bell a consultant at the Capitol joining the conservation drive from her apartment on Fulton Avenue Its just a symbolic act said Peter Lopez of Sacramento who decided to use the evening to meditate Maybe Ill just go outside stare at the star s and try to spot a few constellations in the night It was the longest day of the year and one of the hottest But those determined to advocate conservation didnt mind the sacrifice People are getting focused on the fact that we have power at our end sai d Joan Blades a spokeswoman for MoveOn a grassroots organization in the Ba y Area and one of hundreds of online groups passing along the call for the voluntary blackout An electrical engineer in Oakland started the Roll Your Own Blackout idea when he posted a note in a political chat room in April Then an artist in Los Angeles forwarded the email to a number of friends and from there it quickly spanned the globe By Thursday afternoon more than people had signed up at the MoveOn Web site to join the protest Blades said Many threw blackout parties In San Francisco the nonprofit group Global Exchange gathered hundreds around a big bonfire at Ocean Beach At his home in east Sacramento Lynch did fine without electricity for thre e hours He ate tuna salad for dinner watered the lawn and when it got dark he opened the windows and let some air in We should show that people are willing to shut the power off if the prices go too high he said ISO has not declared a power emergency since May We have seen a consistent conservation on a daytoday basis and its making the difference between blackouts and no blackouts ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said McCorkle encouraged initiatives like Roll Your Own Blackout People are conserving she said And we can only support this whole effort The Bees Silvina Martnez can be reached at or Davis consultants had contract with Edison The disclosures turn up the hea t on the governor for hiring the exClinton aides By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau Published June Two consultants hired to advise Gov Gray Davis on energy policy officially disclosed their contract with Southern California Edison on Thursday but Davis aides insisted it is not a conflict because Edison and the Governor s Office have the same goal Communications consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani have drawn intense criticism since they were hired last month to shape the Democratic governor s public response to the state energy crisis The former Clinton administration communication aides nicknamed the Masters of Disaster for their spin on the Whitewater travel office and fundraising controversies at the Clinton White House have come und er fire for receiving a sixmonth amonth contract more than the governor or anyone on his staff makes Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who is running for governor nex t year has called for an investigation into potential conflicts State Controller Kathleen Connell a Democrat has said she will not issue paychecks to the pair pending her own investigation The criticism mounted after the duos economic interest disclosure forms we re released late Thursday showing that each has received at least und er contract from Edison in the past year But Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean defended their credibility saying theres no conflict of interest because Lehane and Fabiani both disclosed that they had worked for Edison before they signed their contracts with the state Besides she added Edison and the governor are working toward the same goa l Both want the Legislature to adopt a memorandum of understanding a propose d agreement that would prevent Edison from going bankrupt by financing a sta te purchase of the utilitys transmission lines Its not a conflict because theres been full disclosure McLean said Edison and the Governors Office have the same goal passing the MOU Wer e working together at this point with Edison But opengovernment groups and Republican lawmakers bristled at the notion that disclosure negates any potential conflict Derek Cressman of the California Public Interest Research Group pointed to a section of state law that prohibits public officials from influencing decisions if it would have a material financial effect on a business enti ty that provided them or more within the last year You have two individuals on the government payroll who had previously been on the Edison payroll and its not clear to whom their loyalties are he said Just because theyve revealed it doesnt mean theres not a conflict there and that theyre not serving two masters On Thursday Jones said he is awaiting the results of the Fair Political Practices Commission investigation and agrees with Connells decision this week to withhold payment from the consultants This further calls into question the ethics of how these individuals were hired and contracts were let Jones said Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte believes theres no question that Lehan e and Fabiani are violating conflictofinterest laws and suggested that the two should be paid out of Davis campaign funds which had reached million by Jan Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga added that he would not vote for a state budge t as long as Lehane and Fabiani remain on the state payroll The state of California does not need to be paying political wordsmiths a month he said I just wish Davis were as frugal with the taxpayers money as he is with his campaign money The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at or State deal may ease blackout threat Canada to supply energy as summer demand rises By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO California may be able to avoid some of the blackouts predict ed for this summer thanks to a littleknown powerswapping agreement with a Canadian utility The arrangement is expected to give California electricity in July and Augu st from the hydroelectric generators of BC Hydro in British Columbia despite a serious drought in the Northwest California has sold surplus power in recent months to the governmentowned utility which is expected to return power to the state as heat drives up t he demand for electricity State deal may ease blackout threat Continuing coverage Californias Power Crisis Despite the energy crunch the state often finds itself with surplus power that can be sold or swapped For instance advance power purchases that provide energy at a better price may deliver more power than needed at any given time particularly during offpeak hours BC Hydros reservoirs and hydroelectric generators are a little like an electricity storage battery By importing California power BC Hydro has be en able to conserve water that can be released this summer to produce power fo r California As a result of the agreement and other factors state power buyers say they are in a stronger position going into the hot summer months than they had expected So far this week the state has managed to get through a heat wav e without so much as a Stage power alert We are in much better shape at this point than I imagined we would have be en as little as a month ago said Ray Hart head of the power purchasing unit in the state Department of Water Resources The North American Electric Reliability Council which last month predicted hours of rolling blackouts for California this summer has noticed a change in recent weeks We dont seem to have the crisis we were all expecting said Ellen Vancko a council spokeswoman But whether that is a shortterm or a longterm eve nt we dont think anyone knows yet Much of the credit for avoiding blackouts is given to unexpectedly high conservation by Californians and an increased supply of power Many generators that had been shut down for maintenance or lack of payment are n ow back on line But the hydroelectric power agreement had gone unnoticed until now Hart mentioned it during a Senate Energy Committee hearing this week But h e declined to reveal the amount of power banked with BC Hydro saying it coul d hurt the states competitive position in the market If I start talking specifics said Hart then I have to give out what I am doing every single day and I have no market position In the past California routinely sent power to a number of utilities in th e Pacific Northwest during the winter when residents there needed heat Northwest utilities returned power to California in the summer when air conditioning drove up demand Little was expected from the reciprocal arrangement this year because California was short of power last winter as electricity prices soared and drought has sharply lowered reservoirs in the Northwest But the agreement with BC Hydro will provide at least some power this summer The state was forced to begin buying power in January after its two largest utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric were unable to borrow because of a billion debt The rates that the utilitie s could charge their customers were frozen under a failed deregulation plan a s the cost of power on the wholesale market skyrocketed Hart said it took time to convince BC Hydro which has demanded cash for so me electricity that it could safely do business with California despite big debts owed to generators for power they supplied to the utilities We have only been able to do it for the last couple of months said Hart It took a long time to get them to do it because of credit issues A spokesman for BC Hydro said the utility engages in power swaps but does n ot release the name of the other parties or the terms of the agreements Our first priority is taking care of our own said Warren Cousins of BC Hydro We are still looking for opportunities to help out other entities when we can Hart said the state has another arrangement with the federal Bonneville Pow er Authority but again refused to provide details He said the state has sold surplus power to several buyers including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Information about state power purchases had been closely guarded until recently Gov Gray Davis pressured by lawsuits and a court ruling releas ed edited versions last week of longterm power contracts worth billion The Davis administration said it agreed to release contract information because power prices have dropped easing competitive pressures Exworker Duke manipulated market By Bill Ainsworth UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO A former operator at Duke Energys Chula Vista plant said he was told frequently by company officials during the past year to alter the plants output in a way that may have boosted electricity prices The operator Jimmy Olkjer said he was even ordered to cut power generatio n during energy emergencies when the state faced rolling blackouts because o f a scarce supply of electricity He said he believes reducing the electricity generation helped the company charge higher prices It looks like thats what they were doing Olkjer said in an interview He and another former plant employee said that during the past year the company regularly operated its leastefficient turbine possibly to justify higher prices The allegations which they plan to repeat today at a state Senate hearing investigating power generators provide the first insider evidence that Duk e Energy may have manipulated output at its South Bay plant to drive up price s Duke based in North Carolina leases the South Bay plant from the San Dieg o Unified Port District A March report by the Independent System Operator which manages California s electricity grid alleged that by withholding power Duke and four other owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollars in overcharges to California consumers Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy North America said that varying th e output of the generating units at the Chula Vista plant had nothing to do with trying to achieve higher prices He said the changes in output helped balance the states grid by dancing i n the market providing flexibility for grid managers by allowing the plan t to add or reduce power quickly Williams added that the aging South Bay plant produced as many megawatts la st year as it did in Olkjer served as a plant operator for years mostly when the plant was owned by San Diego Gas Electric Co After Duke took over the plant worke rs were guaranteed their jobs for two years In April when that period ended Duke laid off Olkjer and other workers Now he is retired During the two years Duke has managed the plant Olkjer said operators frequently got calls from officials with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in Salt Lake City telling them to adjust their production schedule Some employees at the plant monitored the hourly price of electricity poste d by the Independent System Operator and recognized a correlation he said We noticed that a lot of times when the price was down our megawatts wou ld go down he said If the price was up often the megawatts would go up Olkjer said he was never told why he was being ordered to turn the plants output up and down When he asked he said company officials told him it w as none of his business Still he was puzzled particularly when he was told to throttle down the plant during electricity emergency alerts as he says he did Jan when the state declared a Stage alert with the possibility of rolling blackouts It doesnt make sense to cycle up and down when theres a Stage alert he said Duke spokesman Williams said the company may turn down units at the orders of the ISO during a Stage alert because the grid manager can find cheaper power somewhere else Lisa Szot spokeswoman at the ISO said she couldnt determine whether the ISO had ordered Duke to power down its Chula Vista plant Jan Olkjer said the frequent adjustments of power production which sometimes occurred every halfhour wear out the plants equipment Its harder on the machinery he said Its like driving down the street putting your foot on the gas and then slamming on the brake Before deregulation Olkjer said the four units at Chula Vista which have the capacity to produce megawatts had been operated steadily during mu ch of their history S David Freeman formerly general manager of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and now chief energy adviser to Gov Gray Davis said rapid cycling had become more common under deregulation and is hard on equipment We had almost megawatts of generating capacity down for repair last winter said Freeman referring to what industry experts agreed was an extraordinary level of plant outages over several months SDGE which built the Chula Vista plant in the s sold it to the Port District for million In the port leased the plant to Duke Energy for years in what critics are now calling a sweetheart deal The company pays minimal rent but has made large profits In the first quarter of this year Duke which owns three other plants in California sa id profits rose percent to million from energy sales and trading Duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for electricity It asked per megawatthour this year By comparison before the energy crisis began electricity sold for around per megawatthour an amount which powers about homes Federal regulators have ordered the company to refund million to the state for charging excessive prices unless the company can justify them In May the company offered to pay the state to settle any price gouging investigations but Gov Gray Davis declined Olkjer and Ed Edwards Jr who worked at the plant for years before bein g laid off in April said they couldnt understand why Duke ran the inefficient highcost turbine unit during the past year while other generators sat idle They said they believed it may have been an attempt to fetch a higher price for electricity because the company got extra fees when it ran Williams the Duke spokesman said the opposite was true He said Duke ran the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive It ran on jet fuel which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the other units Edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destroyed It ran so frequently and so hard it needed extensive repairs he said Edwards told CBS News last night that plant outages at Chula Vista were prolonged because one supervisor ordered him to dump spare parts The former power plant employees said they felt compelled to come forward because they saw the impact the power crisis was having on their community It kind of irritated me because you know theres people on a fixed income that cant afford a big utility bill said Olkjer Staff writer Craig D Rose contributed to this story Estimates of Power Profits Disputed Electricity A study of overcharges by suppliers may be flawed state officials say Davis quoted the figures to Congress By DOUG SMITH ROBERT J LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL Times Staff Writers Gov Gray Davis contention that California has been nicked for billio ns of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study that state officials concede may have significant flaws according to interviews and confidential government documents Those costsestimated by the state to be as high as billionwere central to Davis testimony this week before a US Senate committee where he again denounced power wholesalers and urged federal regulators to give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us The governors impassioned demand however was based on shaky calculations The formulas are being reworked said Charles Robinson vice president of Californias grid operator which prepared the study Robinson said he had no idea how much the amount allegedly overcharg ed by the generators might change For now he said the agency stands by the numbers But internal documents from the California Independent System Operator warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quantify the alleged excess profits could be well off the mark Whats more the documents caution against relying on the agencys stu dy as a basis for allegations of overchargingas Davis did during his testimo ny Wednesday That warning was particularly important because the documents provide for the first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy supplier prospered from the states power troubles between last summer and February The largest amounts were charged by four outofstate power companies according to the confidential CalISO report Okalhomabased Williams Cos led the group with million followed by Duke Energy with million Southern Company Energy Marketing now Mirant with million and Relian t Energy Services with million When told of the alleged profiteering attributed to them executives o f the companies insisted the numbers were grossly overstated because of CalISOs poor methodology Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his companys entire energy earnings for North America were less than the amount it was accused of reaping unfairly in California It doesnt add up It doesnt come close to adding up Williams said What CalISO has done is highly irresponsible math Paula HallCollins a Williams Cos spokeswoman said the firm would need to study the ISO report further But generally she said such reports fail to fully account for electricity production costs We maintain that we have not overcharged and that we have operated legally Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley also questioned the figures saying Theres a lot of misinformation out of there A Mirant spokesman said We haven t overcharged We havent manipulated We havent withheld Even some firms alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree we re outraged Joe Ronan vice president for government and regulatory relations at Calpine said the million attributed to his company doesnt bear any relation to reality Anybody can throw out any number he said Its like McCarthyism Where is the evidence A spokeswoman for Davis conceded that his refund figure was an estimat e but defended it as reasonable Its no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute an estimate of how much theyre gouging us senior advisor Nancy McFadden sai d Despite the cautions expressed in the CalISO documents officials Thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to the agencys figures as potential overcharges The way it should be characterized is the amount paid above a competitive benchmark said Robinson who is also CalISOs general counse l The first version of the nowdisputed CalISO study was made public in March It estimated that power sellers earned billion in excess profit s between May and last February The report later revised upward to billion became a crucial element of the Davis Administrations campaign against alleged electricity price gougers This week just before Davis appearance in Congress the study was updated again adding another billions in alleged excess profits throu gh May The orginal study which did not include actual pricing data was most ly intended to prod federal regulators into seeking information from generator s that the state had been denied Robinson said Thus far the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered refunds of only million Next week FERC is convening an unusual settlement conference aimed at addressing the outstanding claims by the state as well as those of sellers who claim they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars by California utilities One encouraging signal for state officials came this week when FERC reiterated an earlier order that Duke Energy pay millions in refunds The order stemmed from the companys sale of electricity at a megawatt hourfor thousands of hours FERCs order said Dukes pricing had resulted in million in billings A fair price for that power would have been per megawatt hou r the agency said Tom Williams a Duke spokesman said the firm is willing to accept the lower price He said he company has yet to collect a dime Times staff writers Elizabeth Shogren and Dan Morain contributed to th is story Edison Plans Bond Offer at Rate Debt Yield is about double what a creditworthy company would pay analyst s say But will investors bite By JERRY HIRSCH Times Staff Writer Edison International is offering investors what analysts are calling a n unprecedented interest rate for billion in notes to refinance debt Even so its far from certain that the Rosemeadbased power company will find enough buyers to complete the deal A failure by Edison to refinance million in bank debt that comes due June and an additional million in notes due in July could put t he company precariously close to bankruptcy and cast a shadow on Californias plan to sell billion in bonds to pay for power purchases said Dan Scotto a bond analyst at PNB Paribas in New York Even though it would at first appear to be a company setback it woul d really be a major setback for the state said Scotto who added that Edisons credit troubles could translate into higher prices for California s proposed bond offering Edison however said Thursday that the deal is moving forward We believe our deal is going well and we are comfortable with it said Jo Ann Goddard vice president for investor relations She declined to discuss other details of the offering Goldman Sachs Group Edisons investment bank expects to formally pri ce the offering Monday Edison officials would not comment on the proposed pri ce of the note offering but Wall Street sources said the power company was shopping the issue at the rate Edison floated the plan earlier this month as a way to tap the borrowi ng power of a profitable subsidiary to trim debt that comes due this year and to insulate itself from a possible bankruptcy of its ailing utility unit The utility Southern California Edison has lost billions of dollars on electricity sales over the last year The high interest rate on Edisons proposed sale of sevenyear notes i s about double what a creditworthy company would pay for a similar bond or note issue and would add a premium amounting to tens of millions of dollars in annual interest costs to the companys already strapped financial condition analysts said Its a full two percentage points higher than the average rate for other junk or speculative bonds And corporate bonds wit h similar ratings are going out at to Edison originally started marketing the issue at a full two percentage points higher than what analysts initially expected but then raised the rate to in recent days because it was finding few takers on Wall Street The word is that they couldnt get people interested and that they might not be able to get it done said Kurt Stabel a money manager at Street Asset Management in Newport Beach The higher rate however might be pulling investors out of the woodwo rk and has increased the chance that Edison will pull off the deal Scotto sai d This never promised to be a day at the beach Scotto said I think it is really a question of find the right price the price at which people fee l comfortable with the risk Both Stabel and Scotto said that Edisons note offering is unusually complicated and requires far more explaining or selling than typical corporate offerings Mission Energy Holding Co a company created by Edison for the sole purpose of issuing these bonds will offer the notes The assets of Edison Mission Energy a subsidiary that owns a network of power plants across the United States and in Asia Australia and New Zealand will secure the debt Mission Energy Holding plans to issue the proceeds to Edison in the fo rm of dividends giving the parent company funds to pay off a substantial portion of its debt The notes will have a credit rating of BBminus and come due in according to bond rating agency Standard Poors Thats slightly higher than the neardefault CC rating now carried by Edison If the offering failed Edison would face a series of difficult choice s that range from depleting its cash cushion to going back to its bankers and begging for continued forbearance Its SCE subsidiary already has defaulted on million in bonds and notes That triggered a default in bank lines of credit at Edison International and SCE which has since operated under extensions from its lenders Edison has about billion in cash including billion held by SCE according to regulatory documents This could all still unravel but I have been impressed with Edison s effort to inch along so far said Ellen Lapson an analyst at Fitch Inc a corporate credit rating service Who would have thought that they could ha ve lasted so many months after their first default in January and still not be in bankruptcy Positive developments for Edison including a deal to hold small generators at bay with partial payments from SCE and progress at crafting a rescue plan in both the state Legislature and the Public Utilities Commissi on have sparked a small rally in the companys stock Edison shares have risen this month They gained cents Thursday to close at on the New York Stock Exchange Energy Company Abandons

and nearby homeowners an energy company announced Thursday that it was abandoning its plan to build a power plant on the site of a proposed state park in the Baldwin Hills La Jolla Energy Development Inc in a letter to the state Energy Commission said it was withdrawing its application for fasttrack approval of the megawatt plant and will not pursue the Baldwin facility in the future We listened to the community La Jolla President Steve Wilburn said in an interview Thursday We need to find another place for this equipment The project was to be a joint venture between La Jolla and Stocker Resources an oil company that leases the land where the trailersized naturalgas plant would sit Stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether they will pursue the project At this point its just La Jolla pulling out Stocker spokesman Steve Rusch said But most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the fasttrack schedule the state has implemented to relieve the energy crisis The state commission was scheduled to decide whether to approve the project today in Sacramento but the hearing has been canceled The news sparked elation among environmentalists and nearby homeowners who had fought the proposal on grounds that it would pollute neighborhoods and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together acres of public open space in the hills Were getting ready to have the biggest party said Tony Nicholas president of the hills United Homeowners Assn This shows how a community can come together for a common goal and mobilize the people in a matter of days About of the residents in the hills are African American and many saw the issue as a matter of environmental justice In addition Stocker and La Jolla were seeking approval for the plant within days of filing their application under the governors emergency power orders By following this fasttracked procedure they would have bee n able to avoid the normal timeconsuming environmental review process That angered opponents even further and nearly people showed up at a public hearing Monday to fight the project But what officials said turned the tide against the projectat a time when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possiblewa s testimony from a South Coast Air Quality Management official who said his agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly Executive Director Barry Wallerstein said his agency would have to conduct hearings that would take up to days pushing construction well beyond a Sept deadline set by the governor for fasttrack projects He also said it was unlikely Stocker could get needed exemptions from federal clean air laws In a letter to the Energy Commission this week Wallerstein wrote It appears that the Baldwin Energy Facility could not begin operation until so me time in the first part of at the earliest By Wednesday night the energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statemen t recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a plant citing Wallersteins concerns Conservationists embraced the outcome as a sign that the movement to create a park was gaining steam The Baldwin Hills Conservancy was created last year with the idea of creating green space for the densely populated neighborhoods of south Los Angeles With support from the governor and loca l politicians the state recently bought a acre parcel in the area for an unprecedented million This is a great day for the Baldwin Hills and all the people who have worked so hard to bring this worldclass vision to reality said Esther Feldman president of Community Conservancy International and the main organizer to build the park Also applauding La Jollas decision were state Sen Kevin Murray DCulver City and Assemblyman Herb Wesson DCulver City who had come o ut strongly against the project They and others questioned whether the small amount of power provided by the facilitycoming online after the dog days of summerwould do much to relieve the energy crisis Im ecstatic Wesson said At this point the environment has won The plant would have sat on what is a working oil field about feet from the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area And according to park proponents it would lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy on what would be a halfmile bridge of land arching over La Cienega Boulevard Rusch the spokesman for Stocker said much of the information circulating about the trailersized plant is false The plan did not call for a stack with billowing smoke he said If the issue is air quality weve cleaned air quality up In the last decade Rusch said the companys existing oil pumps on the property have reduc ed nitrogen oxide emissions from tons to tons a year The power plantwith two foot stackswould ultimately add about tons a year He said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing it s own power to pump oil while also contributing an extra megawatts to the state grid during the energy crisis Residents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve the energy problem Said Mary Ann Green president of the Blair Hills Homeowners Assn We just hope that Stocker would be responsive to the outcry from the community Western states could feel pinch from California pricing KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer Friday June Associated Press URL cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchiven ation alEDTDTLtypeDnews PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP When power supplies stretch thin across the West this summer who will deci de whether Silicon Valley computers Washington apple orchards or Las Vegas casinos get first dibs on whats left Its a key question raised by the decision of federal energy regulators thi s week to cap electricity prices throughout the West using a formula based o n Californias power costs Economists energy industry executives and officials in all states are beginning to analyze the fit of this new piece in the energy puzzle Though most call the order a good step that could prevent price gouging others worry the pricing system could lead to electricity shortages for Californias neighbors or prompt utilities to stock up on power contracts to fend off shortages That could diminish any leverage power buyers might hav e as they compete for the remaining megawatts available each day Tying the highest possible power price to California could cause a problem come winter when power demand drops in the Golden State said Gary Ackerma n director of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents most sellers of energy States where consumers need electricity to heat furnaces through the winter would be unable to outbid each other above the price cap which is usually determined by a formula based on the highest bid for lastminute power duri ng the most recent energy supply emergency in California That may leave power wholesalers and not a free market to decide who gets the energy Certainly California has a tremendous pull on our prices and has for probably the last year said Claudia Rapkoch spokeswoman for Montana Powe r Co which supplies natural gas and electricity to twothirds of the Big Sk y state What it means for this winter were just going to have to wait and see California utilities had much more control over power supplies before deregulation in obligated them to sell off their power plants to encourage competition This brought lower prices for a time but gave contr ol over power supplies to wholesalers that arent obligated by state law to serve the serve the best interests of local customers Rather than appointing one power grid manager to decide how to divide power in the West Ackerman predicts utilities in nonderegulated states will simply sell their power within their borders That would hurt California which this week imported about percent of its electricity and its remaining supply from local plants owned by outofstate power companies Price cap or not utilities in the region will watch out for each other as best they can because they might need the favor returned said Charles Reinhold executive consultant for Electric Resources Strategies in Ariz Saddled with rising bills that threatened to exhaust the states budget California recently began to sign longterm contracts with generators Gov Gray Davis credits the change for helping to drastically reduce

refunds Christian Berthelsen Chronicle Staff Writer Friday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Federal regulators have rejected attempts by Duke Energy Inc to avoid refunding millions of dollars to California for charging exorbitant electricity prices in January and February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission first ordered the refunds on March and Duke responded by filing a challenge But the commission on Monday rejected the companys appeal and reiterated its earlier order claiming Du ke had abused its power in the California energy market when it sold power for per megawatt hour We will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding or behavior the commission said Duke acknowledged this month that it had charged per megawatt for about megawatt hours sold to the states major utilities in January a nd February netting it more than million in receivables The commission did not specify how much money Duke should refund but it directed the company to readjust its January billings for those hours to a price of From a FERC document it appears that about hours occurred in January which would result in a total refund for that month of million Duke is one of the companies that have been identified by both the Californ ia Independent System Operator the manager of the states electricity grid a nd the FERC as having exercised market power and overcharged Californians for electricity Meanwhile employees at the South Bay power plant in San Diego run by Duke are expected to testify in a state Senate committee hearing today that the company ramped production up and down That allegedly was aimed at lowering power production during shortages and attempting to drive up electricity prices on the spot market The

There was a reason Gov Gray Davis donned a dark blue jacket and endured beastly humid degree heat this week in an area behind the Capitol known as the House swamp The nation was watching And after months of political free fall his messa ge seemed to be taking hold California has been bilked out of billion while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was asleep at the switch Davis declared repeating testimony he had delivered hours earlier in the airconditioned confines of a Senate hearing room Wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as television cameras and two dozen reporters recorded the scene the California governor apparently couldnt resist taking another shot For nearly a year Ive been pounding on this commission to enforce the law The states energy crisis with its volatile spot markets outofstate generators and dearth of alternative energy providers is a dizzyingly complex policy puzzle The politics are much simpler Democrats present themselves as consumer crusaders defending helpless utility customers from greedy energy conglomerates and misguided regulators Republicans portray themselves as stewards of the free market and longterm solutions rejecting price caps and refunds as heavyhanded overreactions with Sovietstyle results The Democratic populism seems to be winning the battle Though the debate i s far from settled the consumeroriented approach to Californias energy woe s has raised their hopes of winning back the House of Representatives in and the White House in Republicans are scared out of their minds about this said one gleeful Democrat on Capitol Hill who suggested that the White Houses lackadaisica l response to Californias problems would rile consumers from coast to coast This could rival Pete Wilsons alienation of Latinos said the Democrat referring to the former Republican governors strident stand against illega l immigrants which many blame for the partys weak standing in California A sign of the GOPs concern surfaced this week with television ads finance d by anonymous sources but produced by Republican Party strategists that bla me the Democratic governor for Californias energy problems Democrats who long have worried that the crisis could cost Davis a second term now take credit for having pressured the White House and federal regulators to take a more active role The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which had previously resisted suc h efforts took steps toward controlling wholesale electricity prices Monday Later in the week two commissioners appointed by President Bush testified that they might be open to further price restrictions and support huge refunds to California And just yesterday Vice President Dick Cheney who has been among Californias most vocal critics told Senate Democrats behin d closed doors that he could support refunds to California if federal regulators agreed according to those in the meeting There is no doubt in my mind that action taken by federal regulators was the direct result of pressure for price relief led primarily by the California delegation Davis said The pressure did not come only from Democrats Republican lawmakers some o f whom fear the crisis could cost them seats in wrote FERC last week requesting commissioners to take further actions to help the state The Democrats public relations success follows an effort by the party to raise the profile of its consumer crusade Hardly a day has passed in the past several weeks without a group of Democrats holding a news conference t o attack the White House the Republican controlled House or FERC for inactio n But it may have just as much to do with a White House that has been far mor e focused on longterm energy production than the immediate concerns of Californians Even as it engaged in a legitimate policy dispute over how to solve the power mess the Bush administration appeared indifferent to the plight of residents experiencing skyrocketing energy bills and rolling blackouts Bush tried to correct that impression with a trip to the state last month But the damage appears to have extended beyond California A CBS NewsNew York Times poll released this week of adults from acro ss the country showed that only one in three voters approved of the job Bush w as doing on energy More than half the respondents said that protecting the environment was a higher priority than producing energy yet barely one in said that Bush shared that priority Some Republicans say that Bush was in a nowin position contending that anything he did would have been attacked by Californias opportunistic governor Politics is Davis main objective and I dont see the Bush administrati on being that way said Rep George Radanovich RFresno The question for some analysts is whether Democrats might have been too successful By pressuring the federal government to take a more active role Democrats may lose their ability to point the finger at a convenient scapegoat Davis has always needed rate caps much less than he needed a scapegoat No w that FERC has given him what he wants or close enough to it its a lot harder for him to lay blame back on Washington when the blackouts kick in said

The document could be vital to how legislators vote on the billion de al to buy Southern California Edisons power lines said Terry Francke genera l counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition which filed the lawsu it in Alameda County Superior Court The power line deal was brokered by the governor to help the cashstrapped utility Legislators must approve the power grid purchase by Aug or the utility can back out Davis also has a billion agreement to purchase San Diego G as and Electrics power grid which also would require the Legislatures approval Pacific Gas and Electric has not agreed to sell its transmission lines The power lines report was completed in April by California Electric and Magnetic Fields Program an agency set up by the state Department of Health Services to study the issue Francke said Both state agencies and their directors are named in the lawsuit Efforts to keep the report secret are suspect Francke said If its known theres some danger do you want the state owning that liability he asked The study began in after the state Public Utilities Commission committ ed million for research and education on the subject Francke said The state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and electric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies based on those findings he said The report was scheduled to be released to the public on May but at the last minute the Public Utilities Commission apparently instructed the staf f of the EMF Program to keep the reports secret the lawsuit said State health services spokeswoman Lea Brooks said that the report was only a draft and that her department was following orders from the PUC The PUC wanted to see the draft before it is released she said We prepared the report for them We are following their request Brooks refused comment on the lawsuit saying her office hadnt seen it PU C officials were not available for comment Studies on the effects of magnetic fields have resulted in no clear consens us on their effects Francke said Thats what makes the state study important for legislators to consider before voting on the governors deal to buy transmission lines he said Opponents of the power grid deals say the report may add to objections to Davis agreements with the utilities Some legislators would rather the sta te help build more power generators in California They are extra nails in the coffin said James Fisfis spokesman for stat e Assembly minority leader Dave Cox RFair Oaks We have fundamental issues with the transmission lines but when you

of popularity on Wall Street While all eyes have been on Enrons enormous profits here and its enormous pull in Washington DC the reputed titan of the newly incarnated free wheeling power industry has lost half its market capitalization more tha n billion since its peak in August Forgive Californians for savoring a bit of schadenfreude over the Houston boys reversal of fortunes But what gives Isnt this the company that was fattening up on the backs of the states beleaguered utilities residents a nd state budget Isnt this the company with such close ties to the Bush administration that Kenneth Lay Enrons chairman was reported to have interviewed a candidate for a job on the commission that regulates his company Yup That Enron On Monday Enron shares hit a week low of after the Federal Ener gy Regulatory Commission decided to apply the same price controls to power marketers such as Enron that had applied to powergenerating companies for months Thats a far cry from August when the companys shares peaked at Theres a whole kaleidoscope of issues that Enron is being challenged with in the marketplace right now none of which on the surface is a major deal said Donato J Eassey an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities in Houston But when you combine them all I think whats happening here is you have a crescendo with this FERC announcement You have people saying OK the growth rate is now in question That growth rate was an eyepopping percent in revenues for the Unite d States on a twoyear average and nearly percent in the rest of the worl d Enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews but as the sto ck continued to drop Tuesday morning chief executive Jeff Skilling issued a statement to the markets in which he reiterated strong confidence in its earnings guidance The stock rebounded slightly throughout the week closin g at yesterday In a speech at the Commonwealth Club last night Skilling blamed regulatory interference with the free market for investor flight from his company Our stock prices have gotten hammered he said Theyre half what they were a year ago Tumbling stock prices werent the only bad news for Skilling last night A protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began speaking As Skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face a woman was arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges Enron isnt the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with Californias power crisis and are now suddenly headed south Shares of Reliant Energy Inc AES Inc and Williams Companies Inc which generate a nd sell electricity in California and El Paso Energy Corp which sells natur al gas here are all trading near week lows The main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in Washington abou t power price controls reregulation and now the possibility of big refunds being ordered for California Even Calpine Corp of San Jose which has developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played th e spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics dropped nearl y percent yesterday to But none of the companies has been hit as hard as Enron Such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any company It leaves it less money to invest in its own growth and because executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price a sharp decline makes it more difficult to retain talented leaders While Enrons power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine the firm h as been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other regio ns in recent months In the financial press the continuing knock on Enron is that its business lines are so new and complex and the company is so secretive about its operations that analysts and fund managers dont feel confident in their understanding of what it does A look at the firms recent troubles exemplifies its diversity For instance Enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state governme nt of Maharashtra in India over a megawatt power plant there The Dahbol Power Co which is percent controlled by Enron stopped construction on a second phase of the project on Sunday claiming it is owed million by t he Maharashtra State Electricity Board The state has accused Enron of chargin g too much and not generating enough and stopped buying power from the plant last month Closer to home Enron has struggled with its investments in fiberoptic bandwidth The company buys and sells unused highspeed bandwidth space treating it like a commodity as it does electricity coal or natural gas B ut the fiberoptic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear that for all the longdistance cable laid in the ground there have not bee n enough last mile connections set up for users to actually take advantage of it Earlier this year Enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with Blockbuster to offer what it called video on demand in which customers a t home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it transmitted via fiberoptic cables Then there was the FERC ruling For months the agency had resisted aggressive price controls in the West preferring to let the market run its course But as control of the US Senate was handed to Democrats this mont h and President Bush appointed a tough Texan regulator named Patrick Wood III to the commission the agency changed its tune It expanded price controls to all hours of the day spread the controls throughout the Western region and brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent So under current calculations that means Enron could sell power for no mor e than per megawatt in a shortage and about during normal hours f ar short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly charging during the past year In part the companys gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of the businesses Enron has decided to pursue And the hardcharging company h as a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets But sometime s that approach gets it in trouble as was the case last year when Enron had to take a million charge for its failed investment in Azurix a global water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply the same way it had done for electricity service as governments privatized their water systems The opportunities never materialized Add it all together and Enron has a tough time supporting a priceearnings ratio of nearly considerably above the liberal standard of health whic h is The company had less than billion in profits on more than billion in revenues last year Still a survey by Thomson FinancialFirst Call found that analysts expect Enron to deliver earnings of cents per share in the second quarter up from cents last year and per sha re on the year Most maintain a strong buy rating on the stock But investors with big positions in Enron have taken a hit Hardestput of them will be the Janus funds which as Enrons largest mutual fund investo r held nearly billion of its stock as of the end of April In a semiannual report to investors John Schreiber a portfolio manager said the stock price of the newage energy merchant was a victim of negative psychology resulting from the California energy crisis Janus declined to make fund managers available for interviews

Former employees say Duke Energy slowed production of electricity to create an artificial shortage boost profits BY DION NISSENBAUM Mercury News Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO One of the largest companies producing power in California ordered workers to throw out spare parts and shut down equipment in an effo rt to drive up the price of electricity former power plant workers said Thursday Speaking out on the eve of appearances at a state Senate hearing the three men offered the strongest evidence yet that at least one power producer Duke Energy sought to make more money by creating an artificial shortage that may have created huge electricity price spikes Their intent in my opinion was to boost the price up said Glenn Johnson a mechanic who worked for two decades at the Chula Vista power pla nt now run by Duke If Ive got the only box of penicillin in town and your e sick I can charge a million dollars a box he said If you want to liv e youre going to have to pay Officials at Duke angrily challenged the accusations calling them irresponsible charges by disgruntled workers who were let go in April Their allegations are just comical just highly erroneous said Tom Williams a spokesman for Duke which runs four plants in California that produce enough energy for nearly million homes The charges come as the state heads into negotiations next week with generators over the billion the state claims its consumers have been overcharged Duke based in Charlotte NC came under considerable criticism when it disclosed that it charged the state a record a megawatthour for power in January Federal officials have called the charg e unreasonable and ordered Duke to refund California the money The employees who first made their allegations public on CBS Evening News Thursday night will be the only witnesses today at an energy crisis hearing headed by lawmakers who suspect that power companies have been illegally gouging California State Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove chairman of a committee investigating price gouging said the allegations raise serious concerns While we stil l need to hear the other side of the story from Duke if theres any truth to the information I believe it would be devastating to the generators he said Perfectly good parts In interviews with the Mercury News Thursday night the three former plant workers said that they were directed to scale back energy production and throw out good spare parts that kept the plant from getting up to full powe r for weeks Ed Edwards who worked in the Southern California plant said that he was told to get rid of many boxes of good spare parts Edwards said he tossed more than pallets of parts into a dumpster I dont know why they were throwing away perfectly good parts he said It didnt make sense Johnson said the lack of onsite parts prevented workers from quickly fixin g problems that reduced the amount of power the plant could produce Sometime s he said it took weeks to get parts Johnsons suspicions of gouging were echoed by Jimmey Olkjer who spent years in the plant and worked as an assistant control operator Even at times when California regulators were warning residents the state might not be able to find enough energy to prevent imminent blackouts Olkj er said he was directed to scale back the amount of electricity the plant was producing In hindsight it looks to me like they were manipulating the power Olkjer said Duke called the allegations baseless and said the workers didnt understand the reasons for the actions Continued accusations repetitive investigations and inflammatory rhetoric concerning the companys operation s in the state are distracting attention from the true issue of solving Californias energy crisis Duke said in a statement Williams did not directly dispute the workers allegations But he said the y did not understand the reasons behind the decisions State directives Duke cut back on the amount of power it was producing in response to directives from state regulators at the Independent System Operator which runs the power grid Williams said They did not know that the ISO was instructing them to go up and down to meet supply and demand he said An ISO spokeswoman said that the grid manager sometimes asks generators to produce more or less power to adjust traffic on the transmission system or respond to the states electricity needs Some companies bid power into the reserve market which means these plants run only when the extra energy is tapped ISO officials say they are prohibited from discussing individual bids As for the spare parts Williams said they were eliminated as unnecessary after Duke bought the plants from San Diego Gas Electric Williams said Duke has one of the best performance records in the state wi th its power plants offline for unscheduled maintenance only about percen t of the time All three workers were given severance packages and let go in April But Edwards disputed any contention that they were trying to get back at Duke Im not a disgruntled employee he said Im just telling the truth o f what I saw the last two years I worked there No matter what the reasons were for the decisions Duke has made huge profi ts during the California energy crisis And those profits apparently created good cheer among Duke executives At one party Johnson said executives gleefully celebrated their good

electricity wholesalers a Texas energy executive told a crowd at the Commonwealth Club of California Jeffrey Skilling CEO and president of Houstonbased Enron Corp wiped awa y the remnants of a pie hurled by a protester Thursday and placed the blame squarely on Californias energy regulators The state Public Utilities Commission in the early s put together a broken market by preventing utilities to pass along the full cost of power and discouraging power contracts that would have lowered dependence on buyi ng lastminute power Skilling said Because of these rules the power consumers of the state of California we re thrown totally to the mercy of the spot market Skilling said PUC president Loretta Lynch defended the regulators actions last week saying utilities have been free to enter into longterm contracts Utilitie s countered that the PUC never made clear what contracts it would accept whi ch left open the possibility they would later be overruled I think consumers in California are angry and they should be Skilling said Prices in California shouldnt be as high as they are Skilling also Congratulated Davis for Californias unprecedented conservation Denied accusations that Enron chairman Kenneth Lay personally interviewed candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees interstate energy markets Told the audience to expect a report that would show California municipal utilities have profited the most selling power to the state Said price caps ordered by FERC earlier this week would likely damage the markets and would only exacerbate the problem Acknowledged that municipal utilities in the state have managed to provid e cheaper power to their customers and even profit from the power crisis by selling off extra power despite public control Enron has come under fire after accusations from Davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply Enron denies such claims and joins other power producers in arguing that t he state and utilities still owe them billions in unpaid bills Davis acknowledges that Pacific Gas Electric Co which has declared bankruptcy and Southern California Edison together still owe generators such as Enron Duke Energy Mirant and Reliant Energy about billion for past electricity sales Our success is linked to efficient markets not higher prices in Californ ia or anywhere else Skilling said Protesters gathered outside the building wearing pig masks and carrying handmade signs one of which read Greed is the only power crisis Its basically Enron and the other companies raising prices said Berna rd Greening a Santa Clara computer programmer who said hes unhappy with the record prices for electricity and natural gas Pete Snoek of Tiburon said he believed what Skilling had to say I believe the energy situation has been politicized so badly Snoek sai d saying he was one of several in the audience to shush protesters during the meeting I hear the same people out there as if its a sin to make any money in this country State officials counter that wholesalers charged as much as billion in illegal overcharges dating back to May Companies have said Californias claims are wildly exaggerated The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already estimated that wholesalers owe California million in overcharges for the first four months of the year Davis and others say thats a mere drop in the bucket Enron has also been tied to President Bushs handsoff approach to the ener gy crisis Company chairman Kenneth Lay is a friend and one of the largest campaign contributors to Bush and the GOP Several prominent members of the Bush administration hold stock in the company Enron is one of several major GOP donors accused of meeting secretly with Vice President Dick Cheney as he drafted the Bush administrations energy plan Enron is one of the worlds leading electricity natural gas and communications companies with

center and Jimmy Olkjer are to appear before a state Senate committee today Photo Dave Yoder The Register Three former Duke Energy workers say they were ordered to tamper with equipment at a San Diego County power plant causing mechanical problems that helped drive up electricity prices during the states energy crisis The workers say they will offer eyewitness testimony to a state Senate committee today the first public accounts from power plant employees of h ow energy production may have been manipulated Duke officials deny most of the allegations The whistleblowers mechanic s Ed Edwards and Glenn Johnson and control room operator Jimmy Olkjer lost their jobs four months ago State Sen Joe Dunn the Santa Ana Democrat who is chairing the investigati ve committee on pricefixing said his staff will attempt to verify the accoun ts from the whistleblowers But their mere presence in a Capitol hearing room is expected to set off a media circus And if the accusations are true it could have wideranging effects on the North Carolina companys operations in California Duke officials were working late into the night to prepare for the hearing and have scheduled a news conference later today They were doing all kinds of things that didnt make sense Johnson said in an interview But if you asked them why to explain they told you to shut up and do your job The testimony comes on the heels of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruling Thursday ordering Duke to refund million in overcharges for January This information lends credence to the concern that there was a deliberate strategy for outages for the sole purpose of impacting price Dunn said What they are saying is disturbing Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said the fact that the former workers lo st their jobs may be shaping their testimony The proof is in the pudding Production is up and weve had fewer forced outages since weve taken over said Williams But controlroom logs obtained by The Orange County Register show Dukes trading arm ordered its South Bay power plant in Chula Vista to reduce production minutes after Stage Three alerts were issued The logs are for January the same month that Duke was accused of overcharging in California The three former Duke workers each worked at the Chula Vista plant for more than two decades when it was owned by San Diego Gas Electric They lost their jobs when Duke assembled a new team to run the plant The three whistleblowers outlined their accusations in interviews with the Register The accusations include The company ordered workers to throw unopened boxes of bolts steam seals valves and other parts into Dumpsters The parts were needed to perform routine maintenance but were no longer available when repairs were required Duke officials acknowledge that new parts were discarded but say the high inventory tax made it more efficient to order parts as needed because they could be delivered within hours Edwards and Johnson say they were ordered to dismantle critical equipment necessary for the generating units to run at full capacity Because parts were thrown away they couldnt make repairs and generators ran at diminish ed capacity for days or weeks Energy experts say this allegation if true would allow Duke to withhold energy from the marketplace which could drive up the price Duke officials counter that production has increased at its power plants and forced outages have decreased since they took over But in late there was a spike in outages at the Chula Vista plant according to records kept by the states powergrid operator The plant reported hours of outages from October through December There were relatively few outages before that The mechanics say the inability to perform repairs forced them to use a small expensive generator that was rarely powered up before Duke took over the plant Experts say that could have been used to exploit federal rules allowing generators to justify prices based on the costliest units online Olkjer says he received orders from Dukes trading arm to reduce production Then when energy prices jumped he would get new instructions to power up again Duke officials did not respond to Olkjers claim Stanford professor Frank Wolak an expert in Californias energy market sa id that if their testimony can be proven the state could be refunded millions of dollars and future energy prices could be dramatically reduced What they are saying is amazing This is a classic plot Ive always wondered how they kept the generators out for so long said Wolak who heads an electricity market surveillance for the California agency that oversees the buying and selling of power They were very happy to have the m offline because it allowed them to make more money Wolak said the testimony seems to back up

ISO said that from May to November Duke withheld electricity from the states power grid percent of the tim e The report accused more than a dozen power plant companies of powering down generators to create scarcity in the marketplace that would in turn drive u p prices In a separate report the state power grid operator accused Duke of overcharging California again in January of this year resulting in the million refund order Duke officials say charging a megawatthour wa s justified during a short period of time Federal regulators disagreed and said the power merchant should have charged no more than per megawatthour Williams Dukes spokesman said that the company has been an ethical operator All but percent of the time we were operating Thats very good sa id Williams adding that when SDGE owned the plant forced outages took place percent of the time But Dunn said that if the testimony from the whistleblowers is true and Duke had the ability to manipulate prices federal regulators would be required under the Federal Power Act to move them out of the competitive marketplace This would mean they would be moved back into a costbased market structu re and would only be allowed to recover costs at a fair rate of return This would bring the prices down dramatically in California Dunn said What generators fear most is being returned to costbased rate regulation Allegations of market manipulation Nearly a dozen investigations are under way to determine if energy producers illegally manipulated Californias dysfunctional electricity market Here a re the main

chief judge for years His years of government service includes being a lawyer with the military and Justice Department And beginning Monday hell have Californias electricity crisis in his hands All the players from the state to utilities to power generators will be in one room trying to settle who owes whom money and how much The state wants billion in refunds from generators they say charged too much for electricity The generators want billions from the utilities and t he state that they say didnt pay the bill for other power they bought And Californias ratepayers just want to keep the lights on I dont think theres billion Wagner said Thursday from his office at FERC headquarters I think there may be a billion or so He spent much of the day fielding calls from some of the several hundred people who could show up in his hearing room Monday Lets see Ive talked to Reliant to Dynergy once Mirant Im going to talk to Dynergy again this afternoon And Ive talked to the governors office and Ive talked to some FERC folks to someone from Oregon and some municipalities in California Oh and Ive talked to the fellow who is goin g to represent the city of Los Angeles Wagner likes to know what hes getting into ahead of time He makes a habit of talking to everyone individually Mondays is the kind of deal Wagner likes best Rather than a formal trial where he wears the robe pounds the gavel and renders a decision after both sides make their cases settlement conferences give him a chance to wheel a nd deal First thing Ill make an opening statement of some kind give em a pep talk Wagner said And if we have any big wheels there Ill let them say a thing or two After the introductions hell start to work through the issues Hell take one guy aside he said then maybe two Then maybe a group And little by little he hopes to bring them together By all accounts this case could be more difficult than any he has handled This has got more dollars Wagner said Thursday Wagner asked Californias Independent System Operator and the pow er sellers for information that can help him sort out the complicated issues He wants the ISO to calculate what wholesale electricity prices wold have been had the price caps FERC ordered Monday been in effect in the fall of And he wants the power companies to tell him how much power they have to se ll short and long term And as if his task wasnt difficult enough FERC has asked Wagner to make this deal in days Its pretty tight he said but it can be done Stephen Angle a Washington lawyer who represents power producers and utilities ran FERCs trial section for years The California case is on e of the most difficult hes seen But hes not counting Wagner out I have learned that its unwise to assume he wont be successful Angle said The

Californias energy crisis Last December he got the parties together to try to break the logjam over the longterm contracting issue But just as he was getting a head of steam on that says Wood the Clinton administration yanked the deal away from Wagner and tried to broker it themselves I know hes too much of a gentleman to say it But that was a missed opportunity Now hell be reuniting some of the same parties that were together six mont hs ago Because of Wagners longevity on the bench almost every lawyer or energy executive who is likely to be in the hearing Monday will have had some

refund The governor tells a Senate panel that power operators bilked our state June By DENA BUNIS and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register WASHINGTON Gov Gray Davis told anyone here who would listen Wednesday th at overcharges from what he calls greedy power generators have now risen to billion billion more than earlier reported And he wants that money back The governor said if the meetings federal regulators have ordered next week to try and hammer out the differences between power companies utilities an d the state do not end with that kind of money in Californias pocket hell be back They must be required to give us back our money Davis told the Senate Government Affairs Committee during two hours of testimony and questioning It was the first time Californias chief executive has testified on the states crisis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The billion is the amount Californias Independent System Operator says generators overcharged utilities and the state from May to May of this year It had initially calculated that between May and February there were billion in overcharges Davis said Those figures are a far cry from the million that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say s were overcharges Thats because FERC only looked at three months of rates and only when the state was in an energy alert The governor faced tough pointed questioning from Republican members and glowing praise and sympathy for his states plight from Democratic colleagues Everything from refunds to longterm contracts will be on the table at next weeks settlement meeting FERC has given the parties until July to make a deal If they cant the administrative judge overseeing the talks will make a recommendation to FERC which can order the paybacks Sen Barbara Boxer introduced a bill Wednesday to require refunds if FERC doesnt act Not surprisingly generators dont see the refund issue the governors way Its just crazy said Tom Williams a spokesman at Duke Energy I dont know how theyre coming up with these numbers And theres skepticism about next weeks talks The negotiations are going to be like the SALT Treaty said Gary Ackerman president of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents power suppliers I question whether it can happen and work out Also at issue is money generators say they are owed by the utilities Davis said thats about billion But power companies say its more like billion to billion Whatever the figure Davis said we want to see their money in our pockets before we talk about working anything out on their end The settlement conference was part of FERCs order instituting aroundtheclock price caps for California and its Western neighbors Those price caps were made possible experts agree because California lawmakers from both sides of the aisle riled up the public enough over the issue that the Bush administration felt the heat The question is whether that can work with refunds Pressure could come from a number of places said Charles Cook a nonpartisan political analyst who has followed Californias crisis It cou ld come from Republican members from the state from party donors in Californi a who President George W Bush is going to have to go back to and then may be from his economic advisers who say that California cant be allowed to go belly up Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said new FERC Commissioner Patri ck Wood a confidant of Bush has been receptive to their refund pleas That w as the case Wednesday when Wood expected to be named FERC chairman sometime this year told members of the Senate panel that refunds may be an important tool in the regulatory toolbox If were to be a vigilant market cop we need to make sure that our bite

confession to make Im an N And as an N I cant help feeli ng a little guilty I feel guilty that I wont be called upon to share the pain of all those As in Irvine and Laguna Woods or the Ms in Costa Mesa and Cypress While the Ms in Fountain Valley suffer and sweat through rolling blackouts Ill be sitting pretty Because Im an N And the dirty little secret about rolling power blackouts is how many of us are out there Allow me to explain As you may have heard Southern California Edison has been required to set up a public notification system for rolling blackouts If you hear on the news that the power guys are expecting rolling blackouts you can go to a Web si te wwwscecom or call a tollfree phone number to see if you r rotating outage group is on the list for going temporarily dark How do you know which group youre in On your Edison power bill next to your account number theres a code that starts with A or M A A M M and so on Thats your outage group number But wait Theres another category of outage group If your power bill has the code number N on it it means that youre exempt from rolling blackouts You see under Public Utilities Commission rules electric power customers who provide essential public health safety and security services such as fire and police stations hospitals jails and so on are automatically exempt from rolling blackouts even if they have emergency generators on site And because of the way electric power service is set up anybody who s on the same circuit with an essential service provider is also exempt from rolling blackouts For example my house shares a circuit with a fire station So Im an exemp t N as are the other power customers on the same circuit But heres the kicker According to an Edison spokesman percent of all Edison customers are Ns that is they share circuits with essential service providers and thus are currently exempt from rolling blackouts Let me repeat that Half of all Edison customers are exempt from rolling blackouts For San Diego Gas Electric customers its percent Mind you this isnt something Edison likes to publicize When I asked abou t it for a column three months ago Edison said it didnt know how many power customers are automatically exempt And when the company unveiled its blackout warning plan this week neither the Edison press release nor news reports mentioned the percent exemption figure True even exempt power customers can be affected by rolling blackouts at work at the store at a traffic light Still the next time you hear some power company or government official say Were all in this together dont believe it When it comes to rolling blackouts the truth is that only half of us are really all in this togethe r And even an N can see that isnt fair

Three former San Diego Gas Electric Co employees who worked at a Duke Energy plant said Thursday that the generator destroyed working parts withheld power supply or otherwise took actions that they believe drove up the price of electricity State officials said the whistleblowers comments at a state Senate hearin g today could provide the most damaging illustration yet that power generator s held down production to inflate prices on the spot market Gov Gray Davis has long alleged that power companies have overcharged the state and utilities Jimmy Olkjer a former assistant control room operator at Dukes South Bay plant in San Diego said in a phone interview that during the states power shortages Duke cut supply Although Duke a Charlotte NCbased company owned the plant and it contracted with SDGE to operate the unit he said Rather than creating more power they were creating less Olkjer said I think there was manipulation of the market The California Public Utilities Commission and several state legislative committees continue to investigate price manipulation allegations and Attorney General Bill Lockyer has said he will take witnesses to a grand ju ry next month The generators have denied they manipulated the market We stand behind our maintenance practices and have done a good job keeping the power flowing Duke spokesman Tom Williams told the CBS television network But former mechanic Glenn Johnson said he saw generation units taken down for economics Ed Edwards also a mechanic said he was ordered to destroy pallets of working parts We were asked myself and other employees to disperse of perfectly good parts that were used to make repairs of systems and components Edwards said State Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana chairman of the marketmanipulation committee said his staff has been looking for employees or others with intimate knowledge of power plant operation to come forward and he promise d that others will testify at future hearings Its the first time that weve had evidence from directly within power plants in California that the ramping up and ramping down of power generati on was a response to price and not to demand Dunn said He said he would reach no

the effort During the first hour of the voluntary shutoff the demand for energy by PGE customers in Northern California was almost the same as at the same ti me Wednesday ISO officials said Protesters

for dinner watered the lawn and when it got dark he opened the windows and let some air in We should show that people are willing to shut the power off if the prices go too high he said ISO has not

McCorkle encouraged initiatives like Roll Your Own Blackout People are conserving she said And we can only support this whole effort The Bees Silvina Martnez can be reached at or Davis consultants had contract with Edison The disclosures turn up the hea t on the governor for hiring the exClinton aides By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau Published June Two consultants hired to advise Gov Gray Davis on energy policy officially disclosed their contract with Southern California Edison on Thursday but Davis aides insisted it is not a conflict because Edison and the Governor s Office have the same goal Communications consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani have drawn intense criticism since they were hired last month to shape the Democratic governor s public response to the state energy crisis The former Clinton administration communication aides nicknamed the Masters of Disaster for their spin on the Whitewater travel office and fundraising controversies at the Clinton White House have come und er fire for receiving a sixmonth amonth contract more than the governor or anyone on his staff makes Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who is running for governor nex t year has called for an investigation into potential conflicts State Controller Kathleen Connell a Democrat has said she will not issue paychecks to the pair pending her own investigation The criticism mounted after the duos economic interest disclosure forms we re released late Thursday showing that each has received at least und er contract from Edison in the past year But Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean defended their credibility saying theres no conflict of interest because Lehane and Fabiani both disclosed that they had worked for Edison before they signed their contracts with the state Besides she added Edison and the governor are working toward the same goa l Both want the Legislature to adopt a memorandum of understanding a propose d agreement that would prevent Edison from going bankrupt by financing a sta te purchase of the utilitys transmission lines Its not a conflict because theres been full disclosure McLean said Edison and the Governors Office have the same goal passing the MOU Wer e working together at this point with Edison But opengovernment groups and Republican lawmakers bristled at the notion that disclosure negates any potential conflict Derek Cressman of the California Public Interest Research Group pointed to a section of state law that prohibits public officials from influencing decisions if it would have a material financial effect on a business enti ty that provided them or more within the last year You have two individuals on the government payroll who had previously been on the Edison payroll and its not clear to whom their loyalties are he said Just because theyve revealed it doesnt mean theres not a conflict there and that theyre not serving two masters On Thursday Jones said he is awaiting the results of the Fair Political Practices Commission investigation and agrees with Connells decision this week to withhold payment from the consultants This further calls into question the ethics of how these individuals were hired and contracts were let Jones said Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte believes theres no question that Lehan e and Fabiani are violating conflictofinterest laws and suggested that the two should be paid out of Davis campaign funds which had reached million by Jan Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga added that he would not vote for a state budge t as long as Lehane and Fabiani remain on the state payroll The state of California does not need to be paying political wordsmiths a month he said I just wish Davis were as frugal with the taxpayers money as he is with his campaign money The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at or State deal may ease blackout threat Canada to supply energy as summer demand rises By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO California may be able to avoid some of the blackouts predict ed for this summer thanks to a littleknown powerswapping agreement with a Canadian utility The arrangement is expected to give California electricity in July and Augu st from the hydroelectric generators of BC Hydro in British Columbia despite a serious drought in the Northwest California has sold surplus power in recent months to the governmentowned utility which is expected to return power to the state as heat drives up t he demand for electricity State deal may ease blackout threat Continuing coverage Californias Power Crisis Despite the energy crunch the state often finds itself with surplus power that can be sold or swapped For instance advance power purchases that provide energy at a better price may deliver more power than needed at any given time particularly during offpeak hours BC Hydros reservoirs and hydroelectric generators are a little like an electricity storage battery By importing California power BC Hydro has be en able to conserve water that can be released this summer to produce power fo r California As a result of the agreement and other factors state power buyers say they are in a stronger position going into the hot summer months than they had expected So far this week the state has managed to get through a heat wav e without so much as a Stage power alert We are in much better shape at this point than I imagined we would have be en as little as a month ago said Ray Hart head of the power purchasing unit in the state Department of Water Resources The North American Electric Reliability Council which last month predicted hours of rolling blackouts for California this summer has noticed a change in recent weeks We dont seem to have the crisis we were all expecting said Ellen Vancko a council spokeswoman But whether that is a shortterm or a longterm eve nt we dont think anyone knows yet Much of the credit for avoiding blackouts is given to unexpectedly high conservation by Californians and an increased supply of power Many generators that had been shut down for maintenance or lack of payment are n ow back on line But the hydroelectric power agreement had gone unnoticed until now Hart mentioned it during a Senate Energy Committee hearing this week But h e declined to reveal the amount of power banked with BC Hydro saying it coul d hurt the states competitive position in the market If I start talking specifics said Hart then I have to give out what I am doing every single day and I have no market position In the past California routinely sent power to a number of utilities in th e Pacific Northwest during the winter when residents there needed heat Northwest utilities returned power to California in the summer when air conditioning drove up demand Little was expected from the reciprocal arrangement this year because California was short of power last winter as electricity prices soared and drought has sharply lowered reservoirs in the Northwest But the agreement with BC Hydro will provide at least some power this summer The state was forced to begin buying power in January after its two largest utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric were unable to borrow because of a billion debt The rates that the utilitie s could charge their customers were frozen under a failed deregulation plan a s the cost of power on the wholesale market skyrocketed Hart said it took time to convince BC Hydro which has demanded cash for so me electricity that it could safely do business with California despite big debts owed to generators for power they supplied to the utilities We have only been able to do it for the last couple of months said Hart It took a long time to get them to do it because of credit issues A spokesman for BC Hydro said the utility engages in power swaps but does n ot release the name of the other parties or the terms of the agreements Our first priority is taking care of our own said Warren Cousins of BC Hydro We are still looking for opportunities to help out other entities when we can Hart said the state has another arrangement with the federal Bonneville Pow er Authority but again refused to provide details He said the state has sold surplus power to several buyers including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Information about state power purchases had been closely guarded until recently Gov Gray Davis pressured by lawsuits and a court ruling releas ed edited versions last week of longterm power contracts worth billion The Davis administration said it agreed to release contract information because power prices have dropped easing competitive pressures Exworker Duke manipulated market By Bill Ainsworth UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO A former operator at Duke Energys Chula Vista plant said he was told frequently by company officials during the past year to alter the plants output in a way that may have boosted electricity prices The operator Jimmy Olkjer said he was even ordered to cut power generatio n during energy emergencies when the state faced rolling blackouts because o f a scarce supply of electricity He said he believes reducing the electricity generation helped the company charge higher prices It looks like thats what they were doing Olkjer said in an interview He and another former plant employee said that during the past year the company regularly operated its leastefficient turbine possibly to justify higher prices The allegations which they plan to repeat today at a state Senate hearing investigating power generators provide the first insider evidence that Duk e Energy may have manipulated output at its South Bay plant to drive up price s Duke based in North Carolina leases the South Bay plant from the San Dieg o Unified Port District A March report by the Independent System Operator which manages California s electricity grid alleged that by withholding power Duke and four other owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollars in overcharges to California consumers Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy North America said that varying th e output of the generating units at the Chula Vista plant had nothing to do with trying to achieve higher prices He said the changes in output helped balance the states grid by dancing i n the market providing flexibility for grid managers by allowing the plan t to add or reduce power quickly Williams added that the aging South Bay plant produced as many megawatts la st year as it did in Olkjer served as a plant operator for years mostly when the plant was owned by San Diego Gas Electric Co After Duke took over the plant worke rs were guaranteed their jobs for two years In April when that period ended Duke laid off Olkjer and other workers Now he is retired During the two years Duke has managed the plant Olkjer said operators frequently got calls from officials with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in Salt Lake City telling them to adjust their production schedule Some employees at the plant monitored the hourly price of electricity poste d by the Independent System Operator and recognized a correlation he said We noticed that a lot of times when the price was down our megawatts wou ld go down he said If the price was up often the megawatts would go up Olkjer said he was never told why he was being ordered to turn the plants output up and down When he asked he said company officials told him it w as none of his business Still he was puzzled particularly when he was told to throttle down the plant during electricity emergency alerts as he says he did Jan when the state declared a Stage alert with the possibility of rolling blackouts It doesnt make sense to cycle up and down when theres a Stage alert he said Duke spokesman Williams said the company may turn down units at the orders of the ISO during a Stage alert because the grid manager can find cheaper power somewhere else Lisa Szot spokeswoman at the ISO said she couldnt determine whether the ISO had ordered Duke to power down its Chula Vista plant Jan Olkjer said the frequent adjustments of power production which sometimes occurred every halfhour wear out the plants equipment Its harder on the machinery he said Its like driving down the street putting your foot on the gas and then slamming on the brake Before deregulation Olkjer said the four units at Chula Vista which have the capacity to produce megawatts had been operated steadily during mu ch of their history S David Freeman formerly general manager of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and now chief energy adviser to Gov Gray Davis said rapid cycling had become more common under deregulation and is hard on equipment We had almost megawatts of generating capacity down for repair last winter said Freeman referring to what industry experts agreed was an extraordinary level of plant outages over several months SDGE which built the Chula Vista plant in the s sold it to the Port District for million In the port leased the plant to Duke Energy for years in what critics are now calling a sweetheart deal The company pays minimal rent but has made large profits In the first quarter of this year Duke which owns three other plants in California sa id profits rose percent to million from energy sales and trading Duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for electricity It asked per megawatthour this year By comparison before the energy crisis began electricity sold for around per megawatthour an amount which powers about homes Federal regulators have ordered the company to refund million to the state for charging excessive prices unless the company can justify them In May the company offered to pay the state to settle any price gouging investigations but Gov Gray Davis declined Olkjer and Ed Edwards Jr who worked at the plant for years before bein g laid off in April said they couldnt understand why Duke ran the inefficient highcost turbine unit during the past year while other generators sat idle They said they believed it may have been an attempt to fetch a higher price for electricity because the company got extra fees when it ran Williams the Duke spokesman said the opposite was true He said Duke ran the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive It ran on jet fuel which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the other units Edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destroyed It ran so frequently and so hard it needed extensive repairs he said Edwards told CBS News last night that plant outages at Chula Vista were prolonged because one supervisor ordered him to dump spare parts The former power plant employees said they felt compelled to come forward because they saw the impact the power crisis was having on their community It kind of irritated me because you know theres people on a fixed income that cant afford a big utility bill said Olkjer Staff writer Craig D Rose contributed to this

overcharg ed by the generators might change For now he said the agency stands by the numbers But internal documents from the California Independent System Operator warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quantify the alleged excess profits could be well off the mark Whats more the documents caution against relying on the agencys stu dy as a basis for allegations of overchargingas Davis did during his testimo ny Wednesday That warning was particularly important because the documents provide for the first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy supplier prospered from the states power troubles between last summer and February The largest amounts were charged by four outofstate power companies according to the confidential CalISO report Okalhomabased Williams Cos led the group with million followed by Duke Energy with million Southern Company Energy Marketing now Mirant with million and Relian t Energy Services with million When told of the alleged profiteering attributed to them executives o f the companies insisted the numbers were grossly overstated because of CalISOs poor methodology Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his companys entire energy earnings for North America were less than the amount it was accused of reaping unfairly in California It doesnt add up It doesnt come close to adding up Williams said What CalISO has done is highly irresponsible math Paula HallCollins a Williams Cos spokeswoman said the firm would need to study the ISO report further But generally she said such reports fail to fully account for electricity production costs We maintain that we have not overcharged and that we have operated legally Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley also questioned the figures saying Theres a lot of misinformation out of there A Mirant spokesman said We haven t overcharged We havent manipulated We havent withheld Even some firms alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree we re outraged Joe Ronan vice president for government and regulatory relations at Calpine said the million attributed to his company doesnt bear any relation to reality Anybody can throw out any number he said Its like McCarthyism Where is the evidence A spokeswoman for Davis conceded that his refund figure was an estimat e but defended it as reasonable Its no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute an estimate of how much theyre gouging us senior advisor Nancy McFadden sai d Despite the cautions expressed in the CalISO documents officials Thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to the agencys figures as potential overcharges The way it should be characterized is the amount paid above a competitive benchmark said Robinson who is also CalISOs general counse l The first version of the nowdisputed CalISO study was made public in March It estimated that power sellers earned billion in excess profit s between May and last February The report later revised upward to billion became a crucial element of the Davis Administrations campaign against alleged electricity price gougers This week just before Davis appearance in Congress the study was updated again adding another billions in alleged excess profits throu gh May The orginal study which did not include actual pricing data was most ly intended to prod federal regulators into seeking information from generator s that the state had been denied Robinson said Thus far the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered refunds of only million Next week FERC is convening an unusual settlement conference aimed at addressing the outstanding claims by the state as well as those of sellers who claim they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars by California utilities One encouraging signal for state officials came this week when FERC reiterated an earlier order that Duke Energy pay millions in refunds The order stemmed from the companys sale of electricity at a megawatt hourfor thousands of hours FERCs order said Dukes pricing had resulted in million in billings A fair price for that power would have been per megawatt hou r the agency said Tom Williams a Duke spokesman said the firm is willing to accept the lower price He said he company has yet to collect a dime Times staff writers Elizabeth Shogren and Dan Morain contributed to th is story Edison Plans Bond Offer at Rate Debt Yield is about double what a creditworthy company would pay analyst s say But will investors bite By JERRY HIRSCH Times Staff Writer Edison International is offering investors what analysts are calling a n unprecedented interest rate for billion in notes to refinance debt Even so its far from certain that the Rosemeadbased power company will find enough buyers to complete the deal A failure by Edison to refinance million in bank debt that comes due June and an additional million in notes due in July could put t he company precariously close to bankruptcy and cast a shadow on Californias plan to sell billion in bonds to pay for power purchases said Dan Scotto a bond analyst at PNB Paribas in New York Even though it would at first appear to be a company setback it woul d really be a major setback for the state said Scotto who added that Edisons credit troubles could translate into higher prices for California s proposed bond offering Edison however said Thursday that the deal is moving forward We believe our deal is going well and we are comfortable with it said Jo Ann Goddard vice president for investor relations She declined to discuss other details of the offering Goldman Sachs Group Edisons investment bank expects to formally pri ce the offering Monday Edison officials would not comment on the proposed pri ce of the note offering but Wall Street sources said the power company was shopping the issue at the rate Edison floated the plan earlier this month as a way to tap the borrowi ng power of a profitable subsidiary to trim debt that comes due this year and to insulate itself from a possible bankruptcy of its ailing utility unit The utility Southern California Edison has lost billions of dollars on electricity sales over the last year The high interest rate on Edisons proposed sale of sevenyear notes i s about double what a creditworthy company would pay for a similar bond or note issue and would add a premium amounting to tens of millions of dollars in annual interest costs to the companys already strapped financial condition analysts said Its a full two percentage points higher than the average rate for other junk or speculative bonds And corporate bonds wit h similar ratings are going out at to Edison originally started marketing the issue at a full two percentage points higher than what analysts initially expected but then raised the rate to in recent days because it was finding few takers on Wall Street The word is that they couldnt get people interested and that they might not be able to get it done said Kurt Stabel a money manager at Street Asset Management in Newport Beach The higher rate however might be pulling investors out of the woodwo rk and has increased the chance that Edison will pull off the deal Scotto sai d This never promised to be a day at the beach Scotto said I think it is really a question of find the right price the price at which people fee l comfortable with the risk Both Stabel and Scotto said that Edisons note offering is unusually complicated and requires far more explaining or selling than typical corporate offerings Mission Energy Holding Co a company created by Edison for the sole purpose of issuing these bonds will offer the notes The assets of Edison Mission Energy a subsidiary that owns a network of power plants across the United States and in Asia Australia and New Zealand will secure the debt Mission Energy Holding plans to issue the proceeds to Edison in the fo rm of dividends giving the parent company funds to pay off a substantial portion of its debt The notes will have a credit rating of BBminus and come due in according to bond rating agency Standard Poors Thats slightly higher than the neardefault CC rating now carried by Edison If the offering failed Edison would face a series of difficult choice s that range from depleting its cash cushion to going back to its bankers and begging for continued forbearance Its SCE subsidiary already has defaulted on million in bonds and notes That triggered a default in bank lines of credit at Edison International and SCE which has since operated under extensions from its lenders Edison has about billion in cash including billion held by SCE according to regulatory documents This could all still unravel but I have been impressed with Edison s effort to inch along so far said Ellen Lapson an analyst at Fitch Inc a corporate credit rating service Who would have thought that they could ha ve lasted so many months after their first default in January and still not be in bankruptcy Positive developments for Edison including a deal to hold small generators at bay with partial payments from SCE and progress at crafting a rescue plan in both the state Legislature and the Public

Plans for Baldwin Hills Plant Power Homeowners and environmentalists rejoice at decision The site is proposed as a acre state park By JOE MOZINGO Times Staff Writer In a victory for environmentalists and nearby homeowners an energy company announced Thursday that it was abandoning its plan to build a power plant on the site of a proposed state park in the Baldwin Hills La Jolla Energy Development Inc in a letter to the state Energy Commission said it was withdrawing its application for fasttrack approval of the megawatt plant and will not pursue the Baldwin facility in the future We listened to the community La Jolla President Steve Wilburn said in an interview Thursday We need to find another place for this equipment The project was to be a joint venture between La Jolla and Stocker Resources an oil company that leases the land where the trailersized naturalgas plant would sit Stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether they will pursue the project At this point its just La Jolla pulling out Stocker spokesman Steve Rusch said But most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the fasttrack schedule the state has implemented to relieve the energy crisis The state commission was scheduled to decide whether to approve the project today in Sacramento but the hearing has been canceled The news sparked elation among environmentalists and nearby homeowners who had fought the proposal on grounds that it would pollute neighborhoods and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together acres of public open space in the hills Were getting ready to have the biggest party said Tony Nicholas president of the hills United Homeowners Assn This shows how a community can come together for a common goal and mobilize the people in a matter of days About of the residents in the hills are African American and many saw the issue as a matter of environmental justice In addition Stocker and La Jolla were seeking approval for the plant within days of filing their application under the governors emergency power orders By following this fasttracked procedure they would have bee n able to avoid the normal timeconsuming environmental review process That angered opponents even further and nearly people showed up at a public hearing Monday to fight the project But what officials said turned the tide against the projectat a time when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possiblewa s testimony from a South Coast Air Quality Management official who said his agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly Executive Director Barry Wallerstein said his agency would have to conduct hearings that would take up to days pushing construction well beyond a Sept deadline set by the governor for fasttrack projects He also said it was unlikely Stocker could get needed exemptions from federal clean air laws In a letter to the Energy Commission this week Wallerstein wrote It appears that the Baldwin Energy Facility could not begin operation until so me time in the first part of at the earliest By Wednesday night the energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statemen t recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a plant citing Wallersteins concerns Conservationists embraced the outcome as a sign that the movement to create a park was gaining steam The Baldwin Hills Conservancy was created last year with the idea of creating green space for the densely populated neighborhoods of south Los Angeles With support from the governor and loca l politicians the state recently bought a acre parcel in the area for an unprecedented million This is a great day for the Baldwin Hills and all the people who have worked so hard to bring this worldclass vision to reality said Esther Feldman president of Community Conservancy International and the main organizer to build the park Also applauding La Jollas decision were state Sen Kevin Murray DCulver City and Assemblyman Herb Wesson DCulver City who had come o ut strongly against the project They and others questioned whether the small amount of power provided by the facilitycoming online after the dog days of summerwould do much to relieve the energy crisis Im ecstatic Wesson said At this point the environment has won The plant would have sat on what is a working oil field about feet from the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area And according to park proponents it would lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy on what would be a halfmile bridge of land arching over La Cienega Boulevard Rusch the spokesman for Stocker said much of the information circulating about the trailersized plant is false The plan did not call for a stack with billowing smoke he said If the issue is air quality weve cleaned air quality up In the last decade Rusch said the companys existing oil pumps on the property have reduc ed nitrogen oxide emissions from tons to tons a year The power plantwith two foot stackswould ultimately add about tons a year He said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing it s own power to pump oil while also contributing an extra megawatts to the state grid during the energy crisis Residents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve the energy problem Said Mary Ann Green president of the Blair Hills Homeowners Assn We just hope that Stocker would be responsive to the outcry from the community Western states could feel pinch from California pricing KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer Friday June Associated Press URL cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchiven ation alEDTDTLtypeDnews PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP When power supplies stretch thin across the West this summer who will deci de whether Silicon Valley computers Washington apple orchards or Las Vegas casinos get first dibs on whats left Its a key question raised by the decision of federal energy regulators thi s week to cap electricity prices throughout the West using a formula based o n Californias power costs Economists energy industry executives and officials in all states are beginning to analyze the fit of this new piece in the energy puzzle Though most call the order a good step that could prevent price gouging others worry the pricing system could lead to electricity shortages for Californias neighbors or prompt utilities to stock up on power contracts to fend off shortages That could diminish any leverage power buyers might hav e as they compete for the remaining megawatts available each day Tying the highest possible power price to California could cause a problem come winter when power demand drops in the Golden State said Gary Ackerma n director of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents most sellers of energy States where consumers need electricity to heat furnaces through the winter would be unable to outbid each other above the price cap which is usually determined by a formula based on the highest bid for lastminute power duri ng the most recent energy supply emergency in California That may leave power wholesalers and not a free market to decide who gets the energy Certainly California has a tremendous pull on our prices and has for probably the last year said Claudia Rapkoch spokeswoman for Montana Powe r Co which supplies natural gas and electricity to twothirds of the Big Sk y state What it means for this winter were just going to have to wait and see California utilities had much more control over power supplies before deregulation in obligated them to sell off their power plants to encourage competition This brought lower prices for a time but gave contr ol over power supplies to wholesalers that arent obligated by state law to serve the serve the best interests of local customers Rather than appointing one power grid manager to decide how to divide power in the West Ackerman predicts utilities in nonderegulated states will simply sell their power within their borders That would hurt California which this week imported about percent of its electricity and its remaining supply from local plants owned by outofstate power companies Price cap or not utilities in the region will watch out for each other as best they can because they might need the favor returned said Charles Reinhold executive consultant for Electric Resources Strategies in Ariz Saddled with rising bills that threatened to exhaust the states budget California recently began to sign longterm contracts with generators Gov Gray Davis credits the change for helping to drastically reduce

Energy Inc to avoid refunding millions of dollars to California for charging exorbitant electricity prices in January and February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission first ordered the refunds on March and Duke responded by filing a challenge But the commission on Monday rejected the companys appeal and reiterated its earlier order claiming Du ke had abused its power in the California energy market when it sold power for per megawatt hour We will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding or behavior the commission said Duke acknowledged this month that it had charged per megawatt for about megawatt hours sold to the states major utilities in January a nd February netting it more than million in receivables The commission did not specify how much money Duke should refund but it directed the company to readjust its January billings for those hours to a price of From a FERC document it appears that about hours occurred in January which would result in a total refund for that month of million Duke is one of the companies that have been identified by both the Californ ia Independent System Operator the manager of the states electricity grid a nd the FERC as having exercised market power and overcharged Californians for electricity Meanwhile employees at the South Bay power plant in San Diego run by Duke are expected to testify in a state Senate committee

There was a reason Gov Gray Davis donned a dark blue jacket and endured beastly humid degree heat this week in an area behind the Capitol known as the House swamp The nation was watching And after months of political free fall his messa ge seemed to be taking hold California has been bilked out of billion while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was asleep at the switch Davis declared repeating testimony he had delivered hours earlier in the airconditioned confines of a Senate hearing room Wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as television cameras and two dozen reporters recorded the scene the California governor apparently couldnt resist taking another shot For nearly a year Ive been pounding on this commission to enforce the law The states energy crisis with its volatile spot markets outofstate generators and dearth of alternative energy providers is a dizzyingly complex policy puzzle The politics are much simpler Democrats present themselves as consumer crusaders defending helpless utility customers from greedy energy conglomerates and misguided regulators Republicans portray themselves as stewards of the free market and longterm solutions rejecting price caps and refunds as heavyhanded overreactions with Sovietstyle results The Democratic populism seems to be winning the battle Though the debate i s far from settled the consumeroriented approach to Californias energy woe s has raised their hopes of winning back the House of Representatives in and the White House in Republicans are scared out of their minds about this said one gleeful Democrat on Capitol Hill who suggested that the White Houses lackadaisica l response to Californias problems would rile consumers from coast to coast This could rival Pete Wilsons alienation of Latinos said the Democrat referring to the former Republican governors strident stand against illega l immigrants which many blame for the partys weak standing in California A sign of the GOPs concern surfaced this week with television ads finance d by anonymous sources but produced by Republican Party strategists that bla me the Democratic governor for Californias energy problems Democrats who long have worried that the crisis could cost Davis a second term now take credit for having pressured the White House and federal regulators to take a more active role The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which had previously resisted suc h efforts took steps toward controlling wholesale electricity prices Monday Later in the week two commissioners appointed by President Bush testified that they might be open to further price restrictions and support huge refunds to California And just yesterday Vice President Dick Cheney who has been among Californias most vocal critics told Senate Democrats behin d closed doors that he could support refunds to California if federal regulators agreed according to those in the meeting There is no doubt in my mind that action taken by federal regulators was the direct result of pressure for price relief led primarily by the California delegation Davis said The pressure did not come only from Democrats Republican lawmakers some o f whom fear the crisis could cost them seats in wrote FERC last week requesting commissioners to take further actions to help the state The Democrats public relations success follows an effort by the party to raise the profile of its consumer crusade Hardly a day has passed in the past several weeks without a group of Democrats holding a news conference t o attack the White House the Republican controlled House or FERC for inactio n But it may have just as much to do with a White House that has been far mor e focused on longterm energy production than the immediate concerns of Californians Even as it engaged in a legitimate policy dispute over how to solve the power mess the Bush administration appeared indifferent to the plight of residents experiencing skyrocketing energy bills and rolling blackouts Bush tried to correct that impression with a trip to the state last month But the damage appears to have extended beyond California A CBS NewsNew York Times poll released this week of adults from acro ss the country showed that only one in three voters approved of the job Bush w as doing on energy More than half the respondents said that protecting the environment was a higher priority than producing energy yet barely one in said that Bush shared that priority Some Republicans say that Bush was in a nowin position contending that anything he did would have been attacked by Californias opportunistic governor Politics is Davis main objective and I dont see the Bush administrati on being that way said Rep George Radanovich RFresno The question for some analysts is whether Democrats might have been too successful By pressuring the federal government to take a more active role Democrats may lose their ability to point the finger at a convenient scapegoat Davis has always needed rate caps much less than he needed a scapegoat No w that FERC has given him what he wants or close enough to it its a lot harder for him to lay blame back on Washington when the blackouts kick in said

powe r grid in California a public records advocacy group filed a lawsuit yesterd ay demanding that the state release a report on potential health hazards of living near highvoltage transmission lines The document could be vital to how legislators vote on the billion de al to buy Southern California Edisons power lines said Terry Francke genera l counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition which filed the lawsu it in Alameda County Superior Court The power line deal was brokered by the governor to help the cashstrapped utility Legislators must approve the power grid purchase by Aug or the utility can back out Davis also has a billion agreement to purchase San Diego G as and Electrics power grid which also would require the Legislatures approval Pacific Gas and Electric has not agreed to sell its transmission lines The power lines report was completed in April by California Electric and Magnetic Fields Program an agency set up by the state Department of Health Services to study the issue Francke said Both state agencies and their directors are named in the lawsuit Efforts to keep the report secret are suspect Francke said If its known theres some danger do you want the state owning that liability he asked The study began in after the state Public Utilities Commission committ ed million for research and education on the subject Francke said The state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and electric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies based on those findings he said The report was scheduled to be released to the public on May but at the last minute the Public Utilities Commission apparently instructed the staf f of the EMF Program to keep the reports secret the lawsuit said State health services spokeswoman Lea Brooks said that the report was only a draft and that her department was following orders from the PUC The PUC wanted to see the draft before it is released she said We prepared the report for them We are following their request Brooks refused comment on the lawsuit saying her office hadnt seen it PU C officials were not available for comment Studies on the effects of magnetic fields have resulted in no clear consens us on their effects Francke said Thats what makes the state study important for legislators to consider before voting on the governors deal to buy transmission lines he

of popularity on Wall Street While all eyes have been on Enrons enormous profits here and its enormous pull in Washington DC the reputed titan of the newly incarnated free wheeling power industry has lost half its market capitalization more tha n billion since its peak in August Forgive Californians for savoring a bit of schadenfreude over the Houston boys reversal of fortunes But what gives Isnt this the company that was fattening up on the backs of the states beleaguered utilities residents a nd state budget Isnt this the company with such close ties to the Bush administration that Kenneth Lay Enrons chairman was reported to have interviewed a candidate for a job on the commission that regulates his company Yup That Enron On Monday Enron shares hit a week low of after the Federal Ener gy Regulatory Commission decided to apply the same price controls to power marketers such as Enron that had applied to powergenerating companies for months Thats a far cry from August when the companys shares peaked at Theres a whole kaleidoscope of issues that Enron is being challenged with in the marketplace right now none of which on the surface is a major deal said Donato J Eassey an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities in Houston But when you combine them all I think whats happening here is you have a crescendo with this FERC announcement You have people saying OK the growth rate is now in question That growth rate was an eyepopping percent in revenues for the Unite d States on a twoyear average and nearly percent in the rest of the worl d Enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews but as the sto ck continued to drop Tuesday morning chief executive Jeff Skilling issued a statement to the markets in which he reiterated strong confidence in its earnings guidance The stock rebounded slightly throughout the week closin g at yesterday In a speech at the Commonwealth Club last night Skilling blamed regulatory interference with the free market for investor flight from his company Our stock prices have gotten hammered he said Theyre half what they were a year ago Tumbling stock prices werent the only bad news for Skilling last night A protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began speaking As Skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face a woman was arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges Enron isnt the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with Californias power crisis and are now suddenly headed south Shares of Reliant Energy Inc AES Inc and Williams Companies Inc which generate a nd sell electricity in California and El Paso Energy Corp which sells natur al gas here are all trading near week lows The main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in Washington abou t power price controls reregulation and now the possibility of big refunds being ordered for California Even Calpine Corp of San Jose which has developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played th e spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics dropped nearl y percent yesterday to But none of the companies has been hit as hard as Enron Such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any company It leaves it less money to invest in its own growth and because executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price a sharp decline makes it more difficult to retain talented leaders While Enrons power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine the firm h as been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other regio ns in recent months In the financial press the continuing knock on Enron is that its business lines are so new and complex and the company is so secretive about its operations that analysts and fund managers dont feel confident in their understanding of what it does A look at the firms recent troubles exemplifies its diversity For instance Enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state governme nt of Maharashtra in India over a megawatt power plant there The Dahbol Power Co which is percent controlled by Enron stopped construction on a second phase of the project on Sunday claiming it is owed million by t he Maharashtra State Electricity Board The state has accused Enron of chargin g too much and not generating enough and stopped buying power from the plant last month Closer to home Enron has struggled with its investments in fiberoptic bandwidth The company buys and sells unused highspeed bandwidth space treating it like a commodity as it does electricity coal or natural gas B ut the fiberoptic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear that for all the longdistance cable laid in the ground there have not bee n enough last mile connections set up for users to actually take advantage of it Earlier this year Enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with Blockbuster to offer what it called video on demand in which customers a t home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it transmitted via fiberoptic cables Then there was the FERC ruling For months the agency had resisted aggressive price controls in the West preferring to let the market run its course But as control of the US Senate was handed to Democrats this mont h and President Bush appointed a tough Texan regulator named Patrick Wood III to the commission the agency changed its tune It expanded price controls to all hours of the day spread the controls throughout the Western region and brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent So under current calculations that means Enron could sell power for no mor e than per megawatt in a shortage and about during normal hours f ar short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly charging during the past year In part the companys gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of the businesses Enron has decided to pursue And the hardcharging company h as a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets But sometime s that approach gets it in trouble as was the case last year when Enron had to take a million charge for its failed investment in Azurix a global water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply the same way it had done for electricity service as governments privatized their water systems The opportunities never materialized Add it all together and Enron has a tough time supporting a priceearnings ratio of nearly considerably above the liberal standard of health whic h is The company had less than billion in profits on more than billion in revenues last year Still a survey by Thomson FinancialFirst Call found that analysts expect Enron to deliver earnings of cents per share in the second quarter up from cents last year and per sha re on the year Most maintain a strong buy rating on the stock But investors with big positions in Enron have taken a hit Hardestput of them will be the Janus funds which as Enrons largest mutual fund investo r held nearly billion of its stock as of the end of April In a semiannual report to investors John Schreiber a portfolio manager said the stock price of the newage energy merchant was a victim of negative psychology resulting from the California energy crisis Janus declined to make fund managers available for interviews There are tremendous rewards for being first into new markets said Raymo nd Niles an energy analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in New York When your e an aggressive firstmover from time to time youre going to make mistakes But I dont think any of the mistakes Enron has made hit the core of the company Email Christian Berthelsen at San Francisco Chronicle PageB Power firm accused of pricefixing Former employees say Duke Energy slowed production of electricity to create an artificial shortage boost profits BY DION NISSENBAUM Mercury News Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO One of the largest companies producing power in California ordered workers to throw out spare parts and shut down equipment in an effo rt to drive up the price of electricity former power plant workers said Thursday Speaking out on the eve of appearances at a state Senate hearing the three men offered the strongest evidence yet that at least one power producer Duke Energy sought to make more money by creating an artificial shortage that may have created huge electricity price spikes Their intent in my opinion was to boost the price up said Glenn Johnson a mechanic who worked for two decades at the Chula Vista power pla nt now run by Duke If Ive got the only box of penicillin in town and your e sick I can charge a million dollars a box he said If you want to liv e youre going to have to pay Officials at Duke angrily challenged the accusations calling them irresponsible charges by disgruntled workers who were let go in April Their allegations are just comical just highly erroneous said Tom Williams a spokesman for Duke which runs four plants in California that produce enough energy for nearly million homes The charges come as the state heads into negotiations next week with generators over the billion the state claims its consumers have been overcharged Duke based in Charlotte NC came under considerable criticism when it disclosed that it charged the state a record a megawatthour for power in January Federal officials have called the charg e unreasonable and ordered Duke to refund California the money The employees who first made their allegations public on CBS Evening News Thursday night will be the only witnesses today at an energy crisis hearing headed by lawmakers who suspect that power companies have been illegally gouging California State Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove chairman of a committee investigating price gouging said the allegations raise serious concerns While we stil l need to hear the other side of the story from Duke if theres any truth to the information I believe it would be devastating to the generators he said Perfectly good parts In interviews with the Mercury News Thursday night the three former plant workers said that they were directed to scale back energy production and throw out good spare parts that kept the plant from getting up to full powe r for weeks Ed Edwards who worked in the Southern California plant said that he was told to get rid of many boxes of good spare parts Edwards said he tossed more than pallets of parts into a dumpster I dont know why they were throwing away perfectly good parts he said It didnt make sense Johnson said the lack of onsite parts prevented workers from quickly fixin g problems that reduced the amount of power the plant could produce Sometime s he said it took weeks to get parts Johnsons suspicions of gouging were echoed by Jimmey Olkjer who spent years in the plant and worked as an assistant control operator Even at times when California regulators were warning residents the state might not be able to find enough energy to prevent imminent blackouts Olkj er said he was directed to scale back the amount of electricity the plant was producing In hindsight it looks to me like they were manipulating the power Olkjer said Duke called the allegations baseless and said the workers didnt understand the reasons for the actions Continued accusations repetitive investigations and inflammatory rhetoric concerning the companys operation s in the state are distracting attention from the true issue of solving Californias energy crisis Duke said in a statement Williams did not directly dispute the workers allegations But he said the y did not understand the reasons behind the decisions State directives Duke cut back on the amount of power it was producing in response to directives from state regulators at the Independent System Operator which runs the power grid Williams said They did not know that the ISO was instructing them to go up and down to meet supply and demand he said An ISO spokeswoman said that the grid manager sometimes asks generators to produce more or less power to adjust traffic on the transmission system or respond to the states electricity needs Some companies bid power into the reserve market which means these plants run only when the extra energy is tapped ISO officials say they are prohibited from discussing individual bids As for the spare parts Williams said they were eliminated as unnecessary after Duke bought the plants from San Diego Gas Electric Williams said Duke has one of the best performance records in the state wi th its power plants offline for unscheduled maintenance only about percen t of the time All three workers were given severance packages and let go in April But Edwards disputed any contention that they were trying to get back at Duke Im not a disgruntled employee he said Im just telling the truth o f what I saw the last two years I worked there No matter what the reasons were for the decisions Duke has made huge profi ts during the California energy crisis And those profits apparently created good cheer among Duke executives At one party Johnson said executives gleefully celebrated their good fortune Were making more money than we ever thought possible Johnson quoted t he plants manager as saying Mercury News staff writer John Woolfolk contributed to this report Contact Dion Nissenbaum at or Enron chief Gov Davis not to blame for energy crisis BY KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO AP California Gov Gray Davis isnt to blame for Californias power crisis and neither are electricity wholesalers a Texas energy executive told a crowd at the Commonwealth Club of California Jeffrey Skilling CEO and president of Houstonbased Enron Corp wiped awa y the remnants of a pie hurled by a protester Thursday and placed the blame squarely on Californias energy regulators The state Public Utilities Commission in the early s put together a broken market by preventing utilities to pass along the full cost of power and discouraging power contracts that would have lowered dependence on buyi ng lastminute power Skilling said Because of these rules the power consumers of the state of California we re thrown totally to the mercy of the spot market Skilling said PUC president Loretta Lynch defended the regulators actions last week saying utilities have been free to enter into longterm contracts Utilitie s countered that the PUC never made clear what contracts it would accept whi ch left open the possibility they would later be overruled I think consumers in California are angry and they should be Skilling said Prices in California shouldnt be as high as they are Skilling also Congratulated Davis for Californias unprecedented conservation Denied accusations that Enron chairman Kenneth Lay personally interviewed candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees interstate energy markets Told the audience to expect a report that would show California municipal utilities have profited the most selling power to the state Said price caps ordered by FERC earlier this week would likely damage the markets and would only exacerbate the problem Acknowledged that municipal utilities in the state have managed to provid e cheaper power to their customers and even profit from the power crisis by selling off extra power despite public control Enron has come under fire after accusations from Davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply Enron denies such claims and joins other power producers in arguing that t he state and utilities still owe them billions in unpaid bills Davis acknowledges that Pacific Gas Electric Co which has declared bankruptcy and Southern California Edison together still owe generators such as Enron Duke Energy Mirant and Reliant Energy about billion for past electricity sales Our success is linked to efficient markets not higher prices in Californ ia or anywhere else Skilling said Protesters gathered outside the building wearing pig masks and carrying handmade signs one of which read Greed is the only power crisis Its basically Enron and the other companies raising prices said Berna rd Greening a Santa Clara computer programmer who said hes unhappy with the record prices for electricity and natural gas Pete Snoek of Tiburon said he believed what Skilling had to say I believe the energy situation has been politicized so badly Snoek sai d saying he was one of several in the audience to shush protesters during the meeting I hear the same people out there as if its a sin to make any money in this country State officials counter that wholesalers charged as much as billion in illegal overcharges dating back to May Companies have said Californias claims are wildly exaggerated The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already estimated that wholesalers owe California million in overcharges for the first four months of the year Davis and others say thats a mere drop in the bucket Enron has also been tied to President Bushs handsoff approach to the ener gy crisis Company chairman Kenneth Lay is a friend and one of the largest campaign contributors to Bush and the GOP Several prominent members of the Bush administration hold stock in the company Enron is one of several major GOP donors accused of meeting secretly with Vice President Dick Cheney as he drafted the Bush administrations energy plan Enron is one of the worlds leading electricity natural gas and communications companies with billion in revenues in It owns miles of pipeline has employees and is active in countrie s During the first quarter of this year Enrons revenues increased perce nt to billion Three say company purposely cut power ExDuke workers say repairs were curbed in order to manipulate output June By KIMBERLY KINDY The Orange County Register FORMER DUKE ENERGY employees Ed Edwards left Glenn Johnson center and Jimmy Olkjer are to appear before a state Senate committee today Photo Dave Yoder The Register Three former Duke Energy workers say they were ordered to tamper with equipment at a San Diego County power plant causing mechanical problems that helped drive up electricity prices during the states energy crisis The workers say they will offer eyewitness testimony to a state Senate committee today the first public accounts from power plant employees of h ow energy production may have been manipulated Duke officials deny most of the allegations The whistleblowers mechanic s Ed Edwards and Glenn Johnson and control room operator Jimmy Olkjer lost their jobs four months ago State Sen Joe Dunn the Santa Ana Democrat who is chairing the investigati ve committee on pricefixing said his staff will attempt to verify the accoun ts from the whistleblowers But their mere presence in a Capitol hearing room is expected to set off a media circus And if the accusations are true it could have wideranging effects on the North Carolina companys operations in California Duke officials were working late into the night to prepare for the hearing and have scheduled a news conference later today They were doing all kinds of things that didnt make sense Johnson said in an interview But if you asked them why to explain they told you to shut up and do your job The testimony comes on the heels of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruling Thursday ordering Duke to refund million in overcharges for January This information lends credence to the concern that there was a deliberate strategy for outages for the sole purpose of impacting price Dunn said What they are saying is disturbing Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said the fact that the former workers lo st their jobs may be shaping their testimony The proof is in the pudding Production is up and weve had fewer forced outages since weve taken over said Williams But controlroom logs obtained by The Orange County Register show Dukes trading arm ordered its South Bay power plant in Chula Vista to reduce production minutes after Stage Three alerts were issued The logs are for January the same month that Duke was accused of overcharging in California The three former Duke workers each worked at the Chula Vista plant for more than two decades when it was owned by San Diego Gas Electric They lost their jobs when Duke assembled a new team to run the plant The three whistleblowers outlined their accusations in interviews with the Register The accusations include The company ordered workers to throw unopened boxes of bolts steam seals valves and other parts into Dumpsters The parts were needed to perform routine maintenance but were no longer available when repairs were required Duke officials acknowledge that new parts were discarded but say the high inventory tax made it more efficient to order parts as needed because they could be delivered within hours Edwards and Johnson say they were ordered to dismantle critical equipment necessary for the generating units to run at full capacity Because parts were thrown away they couldnt make repairs and generators ran at diminish ed capacity for days or weeks Energy experts say this allegation if true would allow Duke to withhold energy from the marketplace which could drive up the price Duke officials counter that production has increased at its power plants and forced outages have decreased since they took over But in late there was a spike in outages at the Chula Vista plant according to records kept by the states powergrid operator The plant reported hours of outages from October through December There were relatively few outages before that The mechanics say the inability to perform repairs forced them to use a small expensive generator that was rarely powered up before Duke took over the plant Experts say that could have been used to exploit federal rules allowing generators to justify prices based on the costliest units online Olkjer says he received orders from Dukes trading arm to reduce production Then when energy prices jumped he would get new instructions to power up again Duke officials did not respond to Olkjers claim Stanford professor Frank Wolak an expert in Californias energy market sa id that if their testimony can be proven the state could be refunded millions of dollars and future energy prices could be dramatically reduced What they are saying is amazing This is a classic plot Ive always wondered how they kept the generators out for so long said Wolak who heads an electricity market surveillance for the California agency that oversees the buying and selling of power They were very happy to have the m offline because it allowed them to make more money Wolak said the testimony seems to back up research conducted by the state Independent System Operator which runs most of the states power grid and oversees the buying and selling of electricity in California In a report to federal regulators ISO said that from May to November Duke withheld electricity from the states power grid percent of the tim e The report accused more than a dozen power plant companies of powering down generators to create scarcity in the marketplace that would in turn drive u p prices In a separate report the state power grid operator accused Duke of overcharging California again in January of this year resulting in the million refund order Duke officials say charging a megawatthour wa s justified during a short period of time Federal regulators disagreed and said the power merchant should have charged no more than per megawatthour Williams Dukes spokesman said that the company has been an ethical operator All but percent of the time we were operating Thats very good sa id Williams adding that when SDGE owned the plant forced outages took place percent of the time But Dunn said that if the testimony from the whistleblowers is true and Duke had the ability to manipulate prices federal regulators would be required under the Federal Power Act to move them out of the competitive marketplace This would mean they would be moved back into a costbased market structu re and would only be allowed to recover costs at a fair rate of return This would bring the prices down dramatically in California Dunn said What generators fear most is being returned to costbased rate regulation Allegations of market manipulation Nearly a dozen investigations are under way to determine if energy producers illegally manipulated Californias dysfunctional electricity market Here a re the main allegations Was power deliberately withheld to boost prices Several investigators including the Public Utilities Commission the California attorney general and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a re trying to determine if the largest generators and power marketers includi ng Duke Reliant Mirant and Dynegy shut down power plants at key times Federal Environmental Protection Agency records showed times in December when Tulsabased Williams throttled back at midday letting Williams boost profits at other plants it controlled including a Huntington Beach plant owned by AES Corp Were financial incentives offered to plant operators who shut down Federal regulators have settled a case for million with Williams Among the allegations Williams offered ffinancial incentives to AES if it would keep its plants offline Williams has denied any wrongdoing Did companies collude Traders and producers were able to share information on Web sites that helped them determine when to get the highest prices for electricity Attorney General Bill Lockyer is investigating othe r allegations of collusion Were workers ordered to fake outages Three former Duke employees will testify today that they were ordered to create malfunctions at a San Diego County power plant allowing the company to command higher prices at other Dukeowned power plants Duke denies this RELATED STORIES FERC judge

for years He can tell a story that always fits the situation But cross him and h e can slice you up like a VegOMatic The yearold Tennessee lawyer has been the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions chief judge for years His years of government service includes being a lawyer with the military and Justice Department And beginning Monday hell have Californias electricity crisis in his hands All the players from the state to utilities to power generators will be in one room trying to settle who owes whom money and how much The state wants billion in refunds from generators they say charged too much for electricity The generators want billions from the utilities and t he state that they say didnt pay the bill for other power they bought And Californias ratepayers just want to keep the lights on I dont think theres billion Wagner said Thursday from his office at FERC headquarters I think there may be a billion or so He spent much of the day fielding calls from some of the several hundred people who could show up in his hearing room Monday Lets see Ive talked to Reliant to Dynergy once Mirant Im going to talk to Dynergy again this afternoon And Ive talked to the governors office and Ive talked to some FERC folks to someone from Oregon and some municipalities in California Oh and Ive talked to the fellow who is goin g to represent the city of Los Angeles Wagner likes to know what hes getting into ahead of time He makes a habit of talking to everyone individually Mondays is the kind of deal Wagner likes best Rather than a formal trial where he wears the robe pounds the gavel and renders a decision after both sides make their cases settlement conferences give him a chance to wheel a nd deal First thing Ill make an opening statement of some kind give em a pep talk Wagner said And if we have any big wheels there Ill let them say a thing or two After the introductions hell start to work through the issues Hell take one guy aside he said then maybe two Then maybe a group And little by little he hopes to bring them together By all accounts this case could be more difficult than any he has handled This has got more dollars Wagner said Thursday Wagner asked Californias Independent System Operator and the pow er sellers for information that can help him sort out the complicated issues He wants the ISO to calculate what wholesale electricity prices wold have been had the price caps FERC ordered Monday been in effect in the fall of And he wants the power companies to tell him how much power they have to se ll short and long term And as if his task wasnt difficult enough FERC has asked Wagner to make this deal in days Its pretty tight he said but it can be done Stephen Angle a Washington lawyer who represents power producers and utilities ran FERCs trial section for years The California case is on e of the most difficult hes seen But hes not counting Wagner out I have learned that its unwise to assume he wont be successful Angle said The odds that Wagner will get a deal Fiftyfifty This is not the only highprofile case thats taking up the chiefs time these days Hes presiding over a FERC inquiry into whether El Paso Energy Corp a large natural gas pipeline owner is overcharging California Wagner has a history of taking impossible cases Angle says he recently worked with the judge on a dispute in the Midwest That was a case where few people thought would be successful Angle said It had been on FERCs docket for years Wagner got the people talking and emerged with a settlement And Monday wont be Wagners first effort at solving Californias energy crisis Last December he got the parties together to try to break the logjam over the longterm contracting issue But just as he was getting a head of steam on that says Wood the Clinton administration yanked the deal away from Wagner and tried to broker it themselves I know hes too much of a gentleman to say it But that was a missed opportunity Now hell be reuniting some of the same parties that were together six mont hs ago Because of Wagners longevity on the bench almost every lawyer or energy executive who is likely to be in the hearing Monday will have had some dealings with him Hell be very clear He will not mince words said former FERC Chairman James Hoecker He will make his impatience with any dawdling very very obvious to everyone Davis seeks billion refund The governor tells a Senate panel that power operators bilked our state June By DENA BUNIS and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register WASHINGTON Gov Gray Davis told anyone here who would listen Wednesday th at overcharges from what he calls greedy power generators have now risen to billion billion more than earlier reported And he wants that money back The governor said if the meetings federal regulators have ordered next week to try and hammer out the differences between power companies utilities an d the state do not end with that kind of money in Californias pocket hell be back They must be required to give us back our money Davis told the Senate Government Affairs Committee during two hours of testimony and questioning It was the first time Californias chief executive has testified on the states crisis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The billion is the amount Californias Independent System Operator says generators overcharged utilities and the state from May to May of this year It had initially calculated that between May and February there were billion in overcharges Davis said Those figures are a far cry from the million that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say s were overcharges Thats because FERC only looked at three months of rates and only when the state was in an energy alert The governor faced tough pointed questioning from Republican members and glowing praise and sympathy for his states plight from Democratic colleagues Everything from refunds to longterm contracts will be on the table at next weeks settlement meeting FERC has given the parties until July to make a deal If they cant the administrative judge overseeing the talks will make a recommendation to FERC which can order the paybacks Sen Barbara Boxer introduced a bill Wednesday to require refunds if FERC doesnt act Not surprisingly generators dont see the refund issue the governors way Its just crazy said Tom Williams a spokesman at Duke Energy I dont know how theyre coming up with these numbers And theres skepticism about next weeks talks The negotiations are going to be like the SALT Treaty said Gary Ackerman president of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents power suppliers I question whether it can happen and work out Also at issue is money generators say they are owed by the utilities Davis said thats about billion But power companies say its more like billion to billion Whatever the figure Davis said we want to see their money in our pockets before we talk about working anything out on their end The settlement conference was part of FERCs order instituting aroundtheclock price caps for California and its Western neighbors Those price caps were made possible experts agree because California lawmakers from both sides of the aisle riled up the public enough over the issue that the Bush administration felt the heat The question is whether that can work with refunds Pressure could come from a number of places said Charles Cook a nonpartisan political analyst who has followed Californias crisis It cou ld come from Republican members from the state from party donors in Californi a who President George W Bush is going to have to go back to and then may be from his economic advisers who say that California cant be allowed to go belly up Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said new FERC Commissioner Patri ck Wood a confidant of Bush has been receptive to their refund pleas That w as the case Wednesday when Wood expected to be named FERC chairman sometime this year told members of the Senate panel that refunds may be an important tool in the regulatory toolbox If were to be a vigilant market cop we need to make sure that our bite

confession to make Im an N And as an N I cant help feeli ng a little guilty I feel guilty that I wont be called upon to share the pain of all those As in Irvine and Laguna Woods or the Ms in Costa Mesa and Cypress While the Ms in Fountain Valley suffer and sweat through rolling blackouts Ill be sitting pretty Because Im an N And the dirty little secret about rolling power blackouts is how many of us are out there Allow me to explain As you may have heard Southern California Edison has been required to set up a public notification system for rolling blackouts If you hear on the news that the power guys are expecting rolling blackouts you can go to a Web si te wwwscecom or call a tollfree phone number to see if you r rotating outage group is on the list for going temporarily dark How do you know which group youre in On your Edison power bill next to your account number theres a code that starts with A or M A A M M and so on Thats your outage group number But wait Theres another category of outage group If your power bill has the code number N on it it means that youre exempt from rolling blackouts You see under Public Utilities Commission rules electric power customers who provide essential public health safety and security services such as fire and police stations hospitals jails and so on are automatically exempt from rolling blackouts even if they have emergency generators on site And because of the way electric power service is set up anybody who s on the same circuit with an essential service provider is also exempt from rolling blackouts For example my house shares a circuit with a fire station So Im an exemp t N as are the other power customers on the same circuit But heres the kicker According to an Edison spokesman percent of all Edison customers are Ns that is they share circuits with essential service providers and thus are currently exempt from rolling blackouts Let me repeat that Half of all Edison customers are exempt from rolling blackouts For San Diego Gas Electric customers its percent Mind you this isnt something Edison likes to publicize When I asked abou t it for a column three months ago Edison said it didnt know how many power customers are automatically exempt And when the company unveiled its blackout warning plan this week neither the Edison press release nor news reports mentioned the percent exemption figure True even exempt power customers can be affected by rolling blackouts at work at the store at a traffic light Still the next time you hear some power company or government official say Were all in this together dont believe it When it comes to rolling blackouts the truth is that only half of us are really all in this togethe r And even an N can see that isnt fair

insisted it is not a confl ict because Edison and the Governors Office have the same goal Communi cations consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani have drawn intense critic ism since they were hired last month to shape the Democratic governors pub lic response to the state energy crisis The former Clinton administration communication aides nicknamed the Masters of Disaster for their spin on the

Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who is running for governor n ext year has called for an investigation into potential conflicts State C ontroller Kathleen Connell a Democrat has said she will not issue paychec ks to the pair pending her own investigation The criticism mounted after the duos economic interest disclosure forms were released late Thursday s howing that each has received at least under contract from Edison i n the past year But Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean defended their credib ility saying theres no conflict of interest because Lehane and Fabiani bo th disclosed that they had worked for Edison before they signed their contr acts with the state Besides she added Edison and the governor are worki ng toward the same goal Both want the Legislature to adopt a memorandum of understanding a proposed agreement that would prevent Edison from going bankrupt by financing a state purchase of the utilitys transmission lines Its not a conflict because theres been full disclosure McLean said Edison and the Governors Office have the same goal passing the MOU Wer e working together at this point with Edison But opengovernment groups and Republican lawmakers bristled at the notion that disclosure negates any potential conflict Derek Cressman of the California Public Interest Rese arch Group pointed to a section of state law that prohibits public official s from influencing decisions if it would have a material financial effect on a business entity that provided them or more within the last year You have two individuals on the government payroll who had previously be en on the Edison payroll and its not clear to whom their loyalties are h e said Just because theyve revealed it doesnt mean theres not a confli ct there and that theyre not serving two masters On Thursday Jones sa id he is awaiting the results of the Fair Political Practices Commission in vestigation and agrees with Connells decision this week to withhold paymen t from the consultants This further calls into question the ethics of ho w these individuals were hired and contracts were let Jones said Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte believes theres no question that Lehane and Fabiani are violating conflictofinterest laws and suggested that the two should be paid out of Davis campaign funds which had reached million by Jan Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga added that he would not vote for a state budget as long as Lehane and Fabiani remain on the state payroll The state of California does not need to be paying political wordsmiths a month he said I just wish Davis

dont seem to have the crisis we were all expect ing said Ellen Vancko a council spokeswoman But whether that is a shor tterm or a longterm event we dont think anyone knows yet Much of the credit for avoiding blackouts is given to unexpectedly high conservation by Californians and an increased supply of power Many generators that had be en shut down for maintenance or lack of payment are now back on line But the hydroelectric power agreement had gone unnoticed until now Hart menti oned it during a Senate Energy Committee hearing this week But he declined to reveal the amount of power banked with BC Hydro saying it could hurt t he states competitive position in the market If I start talking specifi cs said Hart then I have to give out what I am doing every single day and I have no market position In the past California routinely sent pow er to a number of utilities in the Pacific Northwest during the winter when residents there needed heat Northwest utilities returned power to Califor nia in the summer when air conditioning drove up demand Little was expect ed from the reciprocal arrangement this year because California was short o f power last winter as electricity prices soared and drought has sharply l owered reservoirs in the Northwest But the agreement with BC Hydro will pr ovide at least some power this summer The state was forced to begin buyin g power in January after its two largest utilities Southern California Edi son and Pacific Gas and Electric were unable to borrow because of a bi llion debt The rates that the utilities could charge their customers were frozen under a failed deregulation plan as the cost of power on the wholesa le market skyrocketed Hart said it took time to convince BC Hydro which has demanded cash for some electricity that it could safely do business wi th California despite big debts owed to generators for power they supplied to the utilities We have only been able to do it for the last couple of months said Hart It took a long time to get them to do it because of cr edit issues A spokesman for BC Hydro said the utility engages in power s waps but does not release the name of the other parties or the terms of the agreements Our first priority is taking care of our own said Warren C ousins of BC Hydro We are still looking for opportunities to help out oth er entities when we can Hart said the state has another arrangement

worth billion The Davis administration s aid it agreed to release contract information because power prices have dro pped easing competitive pressures Exworker Duke manipulated market By Bill Ainsworth UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO A former operator at Duke Energys Chula Vista plant said he was told freq uently by company officials during the past year to alter the plants outpu t in a way that may have boosted electricity prices The operator Jimmy O lkjer said he was even ordered to cut power generation during energy emerg encies when the state faced rolling blackouts because of a scarce supply o f electricity He said he believes reducing the electricity generation hel ped the company charge higher prices It looks like thats what they were doing Olkjer said in an interview He and another former plant employee said that during the past year the company regularly operated its leasteff icient turbine possibly to justify higher prices The allegations which they plan to repeat today at a state Senate hearing investigating power gen erators provide the first insider evidence that Duke Energy may have manip ulated output at its South Bay plant to drive up prices Duke based in No rth Carolina leases the South Bay plant from the San Diego Unified Port Di strict A March report by the Independent System Operator which manages C alifornias electricity grid alleged that by withholding power Duke and fo ur other owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollar s in overcharges to California consumers Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy North America said that varying the output of the generating units at the Chula Vista plant had nothing to do with trying to achieve higher p rices He said the changes in output helped balance the states grid by d ancing in the market providing flexibility for grid managers by allowin g the plant to add or reduce power quickly Williams added that the aging South Bay plant produced as many megawatts last year as it did in Ol kjer served as a plant operator for years mostly when the plant was own ed by San Diego Gas Electric Co After Duke took over the plant workers were guaranteed their jobs for two years In April when that period ended Duke laid off Olkjer and other workers Now he is retired During the two years Duke has managed the plant Olkjer said operators frequently got ca lls from officials with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in Salt Lake City telling them to adjust their production schedule Some employees at the p lant monitored the hourly price of electricity posted by the Independent Sy stem Operator and recognized a correlation he said We noticed that a lo t of times when the price was down our megawatts would go down he said If the price was up often the megawatts would go up Olkjer said he wa s never told why he was being ordered to turn the plants output up and dow n When he asked he said company officials told him it was none of his bu siness Still he was puzzled particularly when he was told to throttle d own the plant during electricity emergency alerts as he says he did Jan when the state declared a Stage alert with the possibility of rollin g blackouts It doesnt make sense to cycle up and down when theres a St age alert he said Duke spokesman Williams said the company may turn d own units at the orders of the ISO during a Stage alert because the grid manager can find cheaper power somewhere else Lisa Szot spokeswoman at t he ISO said she couldnt determine whether the ISO had ordered Duke to pow er down its Chula Vista plant Jan Olkjer said the frequent adjustment s of power production which sometimes occurred every halfhour wear out t he plants equipment Its harder on the machinery he said Its like driving down the street putting your foot on the gas and then slamming on the brake Before deregulation Olkjer said the four units at Chula Vis ta which have the capacity to produce megawatts had been operated ste adily during much of their history S David Freeman formerly general man ager of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and now chief energy adv iser to Gov Gray Davis said rapid cycling had become more common under de regulation and is hard on equipment We had almost megawatts of ge nerating capacity down for repair last winter said Freeman referring to what industry experts agreed was an extraordinary level of plant outages ov er several months SDGE which built the Chula Vista plant in the s sold it to the Port District for million In the port leased the plant to Duke Energy for years in what critics are now calling a swee theart deal The company pays minimal rent but has made large profits In the first quarter of this year Duke which owns three other plants in Cal ifornia said profits rose percent to million from energy sales an d trading Duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for ele ctricity It asked per megawatthour this year By comparison befor e the energy crisis began electricity sold for around per megawatthou r an amount which powers about homes Federal regulators have ordered the company to refund million to the state for charging excessive pric es unless the company can justify them In May the company offered to pay the state to settle any price gouging investigations but Gov Gray Davis declined Olkjer and Ed Edwards Jr who worked at the plant for years before being laid off in April said they couldnt understand why Duke ran the inefficient highcost turbine unit during the past year while other ge nerators sat idle They said they believed it may have been an attempt to fetch a higher price for electricity because the company got extra fees whe n it ran Williams the Duke spokesman said the opposite was true He sai d Duke ran the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive It ran on jet fuel which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the ot her units Edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destr oyed It ran so frequently and so hard it needed extensive repairs he said Edwards told CBS News last night that plant outages at Chula Vista w ere prolonged because one supervisor ordered him to dump spare parts The former power plant employees said they felt compelled to come forward becau se they saw the impact the power crisis was having on their community It kind of irritated me because you know theres people on a fixed income tha t cant afford a big utility bill said Olkjer Staff writer Craig D Ros e contributed to this story Estimates of Power Profits Disputed Electricity A study of overcharges by suppliers may be flawed state officials say Davis quoted the figures to Congress By DOUG SMITH ROBERT J LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL Times Staff Wr iters Gov Gray Davis contention that California has been nicked fo r billions of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study tha t state officials concede may have significant flaws according to intervie ws and confidential government documents Those costsestimated by th e state to be as high as billionwere central to Davis testimony this week before a US Senate committee where he again denounced power wholesa lers and urged federal regulators to give us back the money that was wrong ly taken from us The governors impassioned demand however was bas ed on shaky calculations The formulas are being reworked said Charles Rob inson vice president of Californias grid operator which prepared the stu dy Robinson said he had no idea how much the amount allegedly overc harged by the generators might change For now he said the agency stands by the numbers But internal documents from the California Independent System Operator warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quanti fy the alleged excess profits could be well off the mark Whats more the documents caution against relying on the agencys study as a basis for allegations of overchargingas Davis did during his testimony Wednesday That warning was particularly important because the documents provide for t he first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy supplier prospe red from the states power troubles between last summer and February The largest amounts were charged by four outofstate power companies acco rding to the confidential CalISO report Okalhomabased Williams Cos led the group with million followed by Duke Energy with million Sou thern Company Energy Marketing now Mirant with million and Reliant E nergy Services with million When told of the alleged profiteerin g attributed to them executives of the companies insisted the numbers were grossly overstated because of CalISOs poor methodology Duke spokes man Tom Williams said his companys entire energy earnings for North Americ a were less than the amount it was accused of reaping unfairly in Californi a It doesnt add up It doesnt come close to adding up Williams s aid What CalISO has done is highly irresponsible math Paula Hal lCollins a Williams Cos spokeswoman said the firm would need to study t he ISO report further But generally she said such reports fail to fully account for electricity production costs We maintain that we have no t overcharged and that we have operated legally Reliant spokesman R ichard Wheatley also questioned the figures saying Theres a lot of misi nformation out of there A Mirant spokesman said We haven t overch arged We havent manipulated We havent withheld Even some firms alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree were outraged Joe Ronan vice president for government and regulatory relations at Calpine said the million attributed to his company doesnt bear any relation to reality Anybody can throw out any number he said Its like M cCarthyism Where is the evidence A spokeswoman for Davis conc eded that his refund figure was an estimate but defended it as reasonable Its no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute an estimate of how much theyre gouging us senior advisor Nancy McFadden said Despite the cautions expressed in the CalISO documents officia ls Thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to t he agencys figures as potential overcharges The way it should be c haracterized is the amount paid above a competitive benchmark said Robins on who is also CalISOs general counsel The first version of the no wdisputed CalISO study was made public in March It estimated that power sellers earned billion in excess profits between May and last Feb ruary The report later revised upward to billion became a crucial e lement of the Davis Administrations campaign against alleged electricity p rice gougers This week just before Davis appearance in Congress th e study was updated again adding another billions in alleged excess p rofits through May The orginal study which did not include actual pr icing data was mostly intended to prod federal regulators into seeking inf ormation from generators that the state had been denied Robinson said Thus far the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered refunds of only million Next week FERC is convening an unusual settlement confe rence aimed at addressing the outstanding claims by the state as well as t hose of sellers who claim they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars by California utilities One encouraging signal for state officials came this week when FERC reiterated an earlier order that Duke Energy pay millio ns in refunds The order stemmed from the companys sale of electricity at a megawatt hourfor thousands of hours FERCs order said

itself from a possible bankruptcy of its ailing utility uni t The utility Southern California Edison has lost billions of dollars on electricity sales over the last year The high interest rate on

corporate bonds with similar ratings are going out at t o Edison originally started marketing the issue at a full tw o percentage points higher than what analysts initially expected but then raised the rate to in recent days because it was finding few takers on Wall Street The word is that they couldnt get people interested and that they might not be able to get it done said Kurt Stabel a money man ager at Street Asset Management in Newport Beach The higher rate how ever might be pulling investors out of the woodwork and has increased the chance that Edison will pull off the deal Scotto said This never pr omised to be a day at the beach Scotto said I think it is really a ques tion of find the right price the price at which people feel comfortable wi th the risk Both Stabel and Scotto said

have a credit rating of BBminus and come due in according to bond rating agency Standard Poors Thats slightly higher than the neardefault CC rating now carried by Edison If the offering failed Edison

nearby homeowners an energy company announced Thurs day that it was abandoning its plan to build a power plant on the site of a proposed state park in the Baldwin Hills La Jolla Energy Developmen t Inc in a letter to the state Energy Commission said it was withdrawing its application for fasttrack approval of the megawatt plant and will not pursue the Baldwin facility in the future We listened to the c ommunity La Jolla President Steve Wilburn said in an interview Thursday We need to find another place for this equipment The project was to be a joint venture between La Jolla and Stocker Resources an oil company that leases the land where the trailersized naturalgas plant would sit Stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether th ey will pursue the project At this point its just La Jolla pulling out Stocker spokesman Steve Rusch said But most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the fasttrack schedule the state has imple mented to relieve the energy crisis The state commission was schedule d to decide whether to approve the project today in Sacramento but the hea ring has been canceled The news sparked elation among environmentalis ts and nearby homeowners who had fought the proposal on grounds that it wou ld pollute neighborhoods and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together acres of public open space in the hills Were getting ready to have the biggest party said Tony Nicholas president of the hills United Homeowners Assn This shows how a community can come together for a commo n goal and mobilize the people in a matter of days About of the residents in the hills are African American and many saw the issue as a mat ter of environmental justice In addition Stocker and La Jolla were seeking approval for the plant within days of filing their application under the governors emergency power orders By following this fasttracked procedure they would have been able to avoid the normal timeconsuming e nvironmental review process That angered opponents even further and nearly people showed up at a public hearing Monday to fight the proje ct But what officials said turned the tide against the projectat a time when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possibl ewas testimony from a South Coast Air Quality Management official who sai d his agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly Executive Director Barry Wallerstein said his agency would have to conduct hearings that would take up to days pushing construction well beyond a Sept deadline set by the governor for fasttrack projects He also said it was u nlikely Stocker could get needed exemptions from federal clean air laws In a letter to the Energy Commission this week Wallerstein wrote It a ppears that the Baldwin Energy Facility could not begin operation until som e time in the first part of at the earliest By Wednesday night the energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statemen t recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a p lant citing Wallersteins concerns Conservationists embraced the out come as a sign that the movement to create a park was gaining steam The Ba ldwin Hills Conservancy was created last year with the idea of creating gre en space for the densely populated neighborhoods of south Los Angeles With support from the governor and local politicians the state recently bought a acre parcel in the area for an unprecedented million This is a great day for the Baldwin Hills and all the people who have worked so hard to bring this worldclass vision to reality said Esther Feldman pre sident of Community Conservancy International and the main organizer to bui ld the park Also applauding La Jollas decision were state Sen Kevin Murray DCulver City and Assemblyman Herb Wesson DCulver City who ha d come out strongly against the project They and others questioned whether the small amount of power provided by the facilitycoming online after th e dog days of summerwould do much to relieve the energy crisis Im ecstatic Wesson said At this point the environment has won The p lant would have sat on what is a working oil field about feet from the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area And according to park proponents it wo uld lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy on what would be a halfmile bridge of land arching over La Cienega Boulevard Rusch the spokesman for Stocker said much of the information circulating about the trailersized plant is false The plan did not call for a stack with billowing smoke he said If the issue is air quality weve cleaned air quality up In the last decade Rusch said the companys existing oil pumps on the property have reduced nitrogen oxide emissions from tons to tons a year The power plantwith two foot stackswould ultimatel y add about tons a year He said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing its own power to pump oil while also contributin g an extra megawatts to the state grid during the energy crisis Re sidents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve the ene rgy problem Said Mary Ann Green president of

Writer Friday June Associated Press URL cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchive nationalEDTDTLtypeDnews PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP When power supplies stretch thin across the West this summer who will deci de whether Silicon Valley computers Washington apple orchards or Las Vegas casinos get first dibs on whats left Its a key question raised by the decision of federal energy regulators thi s week to cap electricity prices throughout the West using a formula based on Californias power costs Economists energy industry executives and officials in all states are b eginning to analyze the fit of this new piece in the energy puzzle Though most call the order a good step that could prevent price gouging ot hers worry the pricing system could lead to electricity shortages for Calif ornias neighbors or prompt utilities to stock up on power contracts to fe nd off shortages That could diminish any leverage power buyers might have as they compete for the remaining megawatts available each day Tying the highest possible power price to California could cause a problem come winter when power demand drops in the Golden State said Gary Ackerma n director of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents most selle rs of energy States where consumers need electricity to heat furnaces through the winter would be unable to outbid each other above the price cap which is usually determined by a formula based on the highest bid for lastminute power dur ing the most recent energy supply emergency in California That may leave power wholesalers and not a free market to decide who gets the energy Certainly California has a tremendous pull on our prices and has for prob ably the last year said Claudia Rapkoch spokeswoman for Montana Power Co which supplies natural gas and electricity to twothirds of the Big Sky state What it means for this winter were just going to have to wait and see California utilities had much more control over power supplies before dereg ulation in obligated them to sell off their power plants to encourage competition This brought lower prices for a time but gave control over po wer supplies to wholesalers that arent obligated by state law to serve the serve the best interests of local customers Rather than appointing one power grid manager to decide how to divide power in the West Ackerman predicts utilities in nonderegulated states will si mply sell their power within their borders That would hurt California whi ch this week imported about percent of its electricity and its remaining supply from local plants owned by outofstate power companies Price cap or not utilities in the region will watch out for each other as best they can because they might need the favor returned said Charles Rei nhold executive consultant for Electric

this FERC announcement You have people say ing OK the growth rate is now in question That growth rate was an eyepopping percent in revenues for the Unite d States on a twoyear average and nearly percent in the rest of the wo rld Enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews but as th e stock continued to drop Tuesday morning chief executive Jeff Skilling is sued a statement to the markets in which he reiterated strong confidence in its earnings guidance The stock rebounded slightly throughout the week closing at yesterday In a speech at the Commonwealth Club last night Skilling blamed regulatory interference with the free market for investor flight from his company Our stock prices have gotten hammered he said Theyre half what they w ere a year ago Tumbling stock prices werent the only bad news for Skilling last night A protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began speaki ng As Skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face a woman wa s arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges Enron isnt the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with C alifornias power crisis and are now suddenly headed south Shares of Relia nt Energy Inc AES Inc and Williams Companies Inc which generate and se ll electricity in California and El Paso Energy Corp which sells natural gas here are all trading near week lows The main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in Washington abou t power price controls reregulation and now the possibility of big refun ds being ordered for California Even Calpine Corp of San Jose which has developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played th e spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics dropped nea rly percent yesterday to But none of the companies has been hit as hard as Enron Such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any company It leaves it less money to invest in its own growth and because executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price a sharp decline m akes it more difficult to retain talented leaders While Enrons power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine the firm h as been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other re gions in recent months In the financial press the continuing knock on Enr on is that its business lines are so new and complex and the company is so secretive about its operations that analysts and fund managers dont feel confident in their understanding of what it does A look at the firms recent troubles exemplifies its diversity For instance Enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state governme nt of Maharashtra in India over a megawatt power plant there The Dah bol Power Co which is percent controlled by Enron stopped constructio n on a second phase of the project on Sunday claiming it is owed milli on by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board The state has accused Enron of charging too much and not generating enough and stopped buying power fr om the plant last month Closer to home Enron has struggled with its investments in fiberoptic ban dwidth The company buys and sells unused highspeed bandwidth space trea ting it like a commodity as it does electricity coal or natural gas But t he fiberoptic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear t hat for all the longdistance cable laid in the ground there have not been enough last mile connections set up for users to actually take advantage of it Earlier this year Enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with Bl ockbuster to offer what it called video on demand in which customers at home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it transmitted via fiberoptic cables Then there was the FERC ruling For months the agency had resisted aggress ive price controls in the West preferring to let the market run its course But as control of the US Senate was handed to Democrats this month and President Bush appointed a tough Texan regulator named Patrick Wood III to the commission the agency changed its tune It expanded price controls to all hours of the day spread the controls throughout the Western region and brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent So under current calculations that means Enron could sell power for no mor e than per megawatt in a shortage and about during normal hours far short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly chargin g during the past year In part the companys gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of the businesses Enron has decided to pursue And the hardcharging company has a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets But some times that approach gets it in trouble as was the case last year when Enr on had to take a million charge for its failed investment in Azurix a global water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply the same way it had done for electricity service as governments privatized their water systems The opportunities never materialized Add it all together and Enron has a tough time supporting a priceearnings ratio of nearly considerably above the liberal standard of health whic h is The company had less than billion in profits on more than billion in revenues last year Still a survey by Thomson FinancialFirst C all found that analysts expect Enron to deliver earnings of cents per sh are in the second quarter up from cents last year and per share on the year Most maintain a strong buy rating on the stock But investors with big positions in Enron have taken a hit Hardestput of them will be the Janus funds which as Enrons largest mutual fund investo r held nearly billion of its stock as of the end of April In a semiannual report to investors John Schreiber a portfolio manager s aid the stock price of the newage energy merchant was a victim of negati ve psychology resulting from the California energy crisis Janus declined t o make fund managers available for interviews There are tremendous rewards for being first into new markets said Raymo nd Niles an energy analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in New York

Francisco Chronicle Page B Power firm accused of pricefixing Former employees say Duke Energy slowed production of electricity to create an artificial shortage boost profits BY DION NISSENBAUM Mercury News Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO One of th e largest companies producing power in California ordered workers to throw out spare parts and shut down equipment in an effort to drive up the price of electricity former power plant workers said Thursday Speaking out on the eve of appearances at a state Senate hearing the three men offered the strongest evidence yet that at least one power producer Duke Energy sought to make more money by creating an artificial shortage that may have created huge electricity price spikes Their intent in my opinion was to boost the price up said Glenn Johnson a mechanic who worked for two decades at the Chula Vista power plant now run by Duke If Ive got the o nly box of penicillin in town and youre sick I can charge a million dolla rs a box he said If you want to live youre going to have to pay Officials at Duke angrily challenged the accusations calling them irrespo nsible charges by disgruntled workers who were let go in April Their al legations are just comical just highly erroneous said Tom Williams a s pokesman for Duke which runs four plants in California that produce enough energy for nearly million homes The charges come as the state heads into negotiations next week with generators over the billion the state claims its consumers have been overcharged Duke based in Charlotte NC came under considerable criticism when it disclosed that it charged the s tate a record a megawatthour for power in January Federal official s have called the charge unreasonable and ordered Duke to refund California the money The employees who first made their allegations public on CB S Evening News Thursday night will be the only witnesses today at an ene rgy crisis hearing headed by lawmakers who suspect that power companies hav e been illegally gouging California State Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove chairman of a committee investigating price gouging said the allegations r aise serious concerns While we still need to hear the other side of the story from Duke if theres any truth to the information I believe it woul d be devastating to the generators he said Perfectly good parts In interviews with the Mercury News Thursday night the three former plant wor kers said that they were directed to scale back energy production and throw out good spare parts that kept the plant from getting up to full power for weeks Ed Edwards who worked in the Southern California plant said that he was told to get rid of many boxes of good spare parts Edwards said he tossed more than pallets of parts into a dumpster I dont know why t hey were throwing away perfectly good parts he said It didnt make se nse Johnson said the lack of onsite parts prevented workers from quick ly fixing problems that reduced the amount of power the plant could produce Sometimes he said it took weeks to get parts Johnsons suspicions of gouging were echoed by Jimmey Olkjer who spent years in the plant and w orked as an assistant control operator Even at times when California regu lators were warning residents the state might not be able to find enough en ergy to prevent imminent blackouts Olkjer said he was directed to scale b ack the amount of electricity the plant was producing In hindsight it looks to me like they were manipulating the power Olkjer said Duke cal led the allegations baseless and said the workers didnt understand the reasons for the actions Continued accusations repetitive investigation s and inflammatory rhetoric concerning the companys operations in the stat e are distracting attention from the true issue of solving Californias ene rgy crisis Duke said in a statement Williams did not directly dispute the workers allegations But he said they did not understand the reasons b ehind the decisions State directives Duke cut back on the amount of powe r it was producing in response to directives from state regulators at the I ndependent System Operator which runs the power grid Williams said Th ey did not know that the ISO was instructing them to go up and down to meet supply and demand he said An ISO spokeswoman said that the grid manag er sometimes asks generators to produce more or less power to adjust traffi c on the transmission system or respond to the states electricity needs Some companies bid power into the reserve market which means these pla nts run only when the extra energy is tapped ISO officials say they are pr ohibited from discussing individual bids As for the spare parts Williams said they were eliminated as unnecessary after Duke bought the plants from San Diego Gas Electric Williams said Duke has one of the best performa nce records in the state with its power plants offline for unscheduled ma intenance only about percent of the time All three workers were given severance packages and let go in April But Edwards disputed any contenti on that they were trying to get back at Duke Im not a disgruntled empl oyee he said Im just telling the truth of what I saw the last two ye ars I worked there No matter what the reasons were for the decisions D uke has made huge profits during the California energy crisis And those pr ofits apparently created good cheer among Duke executives At one party J ohnson said executives gleefully celebrated their good fortune Were m aking more money than we ever thought possible Johnson quoted the plant s manager as saying Mercury News staff writer John Woolfolk contributed t o this report Contact Dion Nissenbaum at or Enron chief Gov Davis not to blame for energy crisis BY KAREN GAUDETTE As sociated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO AP California Gov Gray Davis isn t to blame for Californias power crisis and neither are electricity whole salers a Texas energy executive told a crowd at the Commonwealth Club of C alifornia Jeffrey Skilling CEO and president of Houstonbased Enron Corp wiped away the remnants of a pie hurled by a protester Thursday and plac ed the blame squarely on Californias energy regulators The state Public Utilities Commission in the early s put together a broken market by pre venting utilities to pass along the full cost of power and discouraging pow er contracts that would have lowered dependence on buying lastminute power Skilling said Because of these rules the power consumers of the stat e of California were thrown totally to the mercy of the spot market Skil ling said PUC president Loretta Lynch defended the regulators actions la st week saying utilities have been free to enter into longterm contracts Utilities countered that the PUC never made clear what contracts it would accept which left open the possibility they would later be overruled I think consumers in California are angry and they should be Skilling sai d Prices in California shouldnt be as high as they are Skilling als o Congratulated Davis for Californias unprecedented conservation Denied accusations that Enron chairman Kenneth Lay personally interviewed candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees in terstate energy markets Told the audience to expect a report that would show California municipal utilities have profited the most selling power to the state Said price caps ordered by FERC earlier this week would likel y damage the markets and would only exacerbate the problem Acknowledged that municipal utilities in the state have managed to provide cheaper power to their customers and even profit from the power crisis by selling off ex tra power despite public control Enron has come under fire after accusatio ns from Davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply Enron denies such clai ms and joins other power producers in arguing that the state and utilities still owe them billions in unpaid bills Davis acknowledges that Pacific G as Electric Co which has declared bankruptcy and Southern California E dison together still owe generators such as Enron Duke Energy Mirant and Reliant Energy about billion for past electricity sales Our succes s is linked to efficient markets not higher prices in California or anywhe re else Skilling said Protesters gathered outside the building wearing pig masks and carrying handmade signs one of which read Greed is the o nly power crisis Its basically Enron and the other companies raising prices said Bernard Greening a Santa Clara computer programmer who sai d hes unhappy with the record prices for electricity and natural gas Pet e Snoek of Tiburon said he believed what Skilling had to say I believe the energy situation has been politicized so badly Snoek said saying he was one of several in the audience to shush protesters during the meeting I hear the same people out there as if its a sin to make any money in this country State officials counter that wholesalers charged as much a s billion in illegal overcharges dating back to May Companies hav e said Californias claims are wildly exaggerated The Federal Energy Regu latory Commission has already estimated that wholesalers owe California million in overcharges for the first four months of the year Davis and o thers say thats a mere drop in the bucket Enron has also been tied to Pr esident Bushs handsoff approach to the energy crisis Company chairman Ke nneth Lay is a friend and one of the largest campaign contributors to Bush and the GOP Several prominent members of the Bush administration hold stoc k in the company Enron is one of several major GOP donors accused of meet ing secretly with Vice President Dick Cheney as he drafted the Bush adminis trations energy plan Enron is one of the worlds leading electricity na tural gas and communications companies with billion in revenues in It owns miles of pipeline has employees and is active in countries During the first quarter of this year Enrons revenues incr eased percent to billion Three say company purposely cut power ExDuke workers say repairs we re curbed in order to manipulate output June By KIMBERLY KINDY The Orange County Register FORMER DUKE ENERGY employees Ed Edwards left Glenn Johnson center and Jimmy Olkjer are to appear before a state Senate committee today Photo Dave Yoder The Register Three former Duke Energy workers say they were ordered to tamper with equipment at a San Diego County power plant causing mechanical problems that helped drive u p electricity prices during the states energy crisis The workers say the y will offer eyewitness testimony to a state Senate committee today the f irst public accounts from power plant employees of how energy production ma y have been manipulated Duke officials deny most of the allegations The whistleblowers mechanics Ed Edwards and Glenn Johnson and control room o perator Jimmy Olkjer lost their jobs four months ago State Sen Joe Dun n the Santa Ana Democrat who is chairing the investigative committee on pr icefixing said his staff will attempt to verify the accounts from the whi stleblowers But their mere presence in a Capitol hearing room is expected to set off a media circus And if the accusations are true it could have wideranging effects on the North Carolina companys operations in Californ ia Duke officials were working late into the night to prepare for the hear ing and have scheduled a news conference later today They were doing all kinds of things that didnt make sense Johnson said in an interview Bu t if you asked them why to explain they told you to shut up and do your j ob The testimony comes on the heels of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commi ssion ruling Thursday ordering Duke to refund million in overcharges fo r January This information lends credence to the concern that there was a deliberate strategy for outages for the sole purpose of impacting pr ice Dunn said What they are saying is disturbing Duke Energy spokesm an Tom Williams said the fact that the former workers lost their jobs may b e shaping their testimony The proof is in the pudding Production is up and weve had fewer forced outages since weve taken over said Williams But controlroom logs obtained by The Orange County Register show Dukes trading arm ordered its South Bay power plant in Chula Vista to reduce prod uction minutes after Stage Three alerts were issued The logs are for Janua ry the same month that Duke was accused of overcharging in Californi a The three former Duke workers each worked at the Chula Vista plant for more than two decades when it was owned by San Diego Gas Electric They l ost their jobs when Duke assembled a new team to run the plant The three whistleblowers outlined their accusations in interviews with the Register The accusations include The company ordered workers to throw unopened bo xes of bolts steam seals valves and other parts into Dumpsters The parts were needed to perform routine maintenance but were no longer available wh en repairs were required Duke officials acknowledge that new parts were di scarded but say the high inventory tax made it more efficient to order par ts as needed because they could be delivered within hours Edwards and Johnson say they were ordered to dismantle critical equipment necessary for the generating units to run at full capacity Because parts were thrown aw ay they couldnt make repairs and generators ran at diminished capacity fo r days or weeks Energy experts say this allegation if true would allow D uke to withhold energy from the marketplace which could drive up the price Duke officials counter that production has increased at its power plants and forced outages have decreased since they took over But in late t here was a spike in outages at the Chula Vista plant according to records kept by the states powergrid operator The plant reported hours of outages from October through December There were relatively few outages be fore that The mechanics say the inability to perform repairs forced them to use a small expensive generator that was rarely powered up before Duke took over the plant Experts say that could have been used to exploit feder al rules allowing generators to justify prices based on the costliest units online Olkjer says he received orders from Dukes trading arm to reduce production Then when energy prices jumped he would get new instructions to power up again Duke officials did not respond to Olkjers claim Stanf ord professor Frank Wolak an expert in Californias energy market said th at if their testimony can be proven the state could be refunded millions o f dollars and future energy prices could be dramatically reduced What th ey are saying is amazing This is a classic plot Ive always wondered how they kept the generators out for so long said Wolak who heads an electr icity market surveillance for the California agency that oversees the buyin g and selling of power They were very happy to have them offline because it allowed them to make more money Wolak said the testimony seems to bac k up research conducted by the state Independent System Operator which run s most of the states power grid and oversees the buying and selling of ele ctricity in California In a report to federal regulators ISO said that f rom May to November Duke withheld electricity from the states power grid percent of the time The report accused more than a dozen power pla nt companies of powering down generators to create scarcity in the marketpl ace that would in turn drive up prices In a separate report the state po wer grid operator accused Duke of overcharging California again in January of this year resulting in the million refund order Duke officials say charging a megawatthour was justified during a short period of tim e Federal regulators disagreed and said the power merchant should have cha rged no more than per megawatthour Williams Dukes spokesman said that the company has been an ethical operator All but percent of th e time we were operating Thats very good said Williams adding that w hen SDGE owned the plant forced outages took place percent of the time But Dunn said that if the testimony from the whistleblowers is true an d Duke had the ability to manipulate prices federal regulators would be re quired under the Federal Power Act to move them out of the competitive mark etplace This would mean they would be moved back into a costbased mark et structure and would only be allowed to recover costs at a fair rate of r eturn This would bring the prices down dramatically in California Dun n said What generators fear most is being returned to costbased rate reg ulation Allegations of market manipulation Nearly a dozen in vestigations are under way to determine if energy producers illegally man ipulated Californias dysfunctional electricity market Here are the main a llegations Was power deliberately withheld to boost prices Several inv estigators including the Public Utilities Commission the California attor ney general and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are trying to det ermine if the largest

refund The governor tells a Senate panel that power operators bilked our state June By DENA BUNIS and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register WASHINGTON Gov Gray Davis told anyone here who would listen Wednesday that overcharges from what he calls greedy power generators have now risen to billion billion more than earli er reported And he wants that money back The governor said if the meeti ngs federal regulators have ordered next week to try and hammer out the dif ferences between power companies utilities and the state do not end with t hat kind of money in Californias pocket hell be back They must be req uired to give us back our money Davis told the Senate Government Affairs Committee during two hours of testimony and questioning It was the first time Californias chief executive has testified on the states crisis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bil ked our state for up to billion The billion is the amount Californ ias Independent System Operator says generators overcharged utilities and the state from May to May of this year It had initially calculated th at between May and February there were billion in overcharge s Davis said Those figures are a far cry from the million that the F ederal Energy Regulatory Commission says were overcharges Thats because F ERC only looked at three months of rates and only when the state was in an energy alert The governor faced tough pointed questioning from Republica n members and glowing praise and sympathy for his states plight from Democ ratic colleagues Everything from refunds to longterm contracts will be o n the table at next weeks settlement meeting FERC has given the parties u ntil July to make a deal If they cant the administrative judge overse eing the talks will make a recommendation to FERC which can order the payb acks Sen Barbara Boxer introduced a bill Wednesday to require refunds if FERC doesnt act Not surprisingly generators dont see the refund issue the governors way Its just crazy said Tom Williams a spokesman at D uke Energy I dont know how theyre coming up with these numbers And t heres skepticism about next weeks talks The negotiations are going to be like the SALT Treaty said Gary Ackerman president of the Western Powe r Trading Forum which represents power suppliers I question whether it c an happen and work out Also at issue is money generators say they are ow ed by the utilities Davis said thats about billion But power compan ies say its more like billion to billion Whatever the figure Davis said we want to see their money in our pockets before we talk about working anything out on their end The settlement conference was part of FERCs order instituting aroundtheclock price caps for California and it s Western neighbors Those price caps were made possible experts agree because California lawmakers from both sides of the aisle riled up the pub lic enough over the issue that the Bush administration felt the heat The question is whether that can work with refunds Pressure could come from a number of places said Charles Cook a nonpartisan political analyst who has followed Californias crisis It could come from Republican members f rom the state from party donors in California who President George W Bu sh is going to have to go back to and then maybe from his economic adviser s who say that California cant be allowed to go belly up Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said new FERC Commissioner Patrick Wood a con fidant of Bush has been receptive to their refund pleas That was the case Wednesday when Wood

power blackouts is how many of us are out there Allow me to explain As you may have heard Southern California Ed ison has been required to set up a public notification system for rolling b lackouts If you hear on the news that the power guys are expecting rolling blackouts you can go to a Web site wwwscecom or call a tollfree pho ne number to see if your rotating outage group is on the l ist for

rules electri c power customers who provide essential public health safety and security services such as fire and police stations hospitals jails and so on are automatically exempt from rolling blackouts even if they have emergen cy generators on site And because of the way electric power service is set up anybody whos on the same circuit with an essential service provider i s also exempt from rolling blackouts For example my house shares a circu it with a fire station So Im an exempt N as are the other power custo mers on the same circuit But heres the kicker According to an Edison sp

Three former San Diego Gas Electric Co employees who worked at a Duke Energy plant said Thursday that the generator destroyed working parts withheld power supply or otherwise took actions that they believe drove up the price of electricity State officials said the whistleblowers comments at a state Senate hearin g today could provide the most damaging illustration yet that power generator s held down production to inflate prices on the spot market Gov Gray Davis has long alleged that power companies have overcharged the state and utilities Jimmy Olkjer a former assistant control room operator at Dukes South Bay plant in San Diego said in a phone interview that during the states power shortages Duke cut supply Although Duke a Charlotte NCbased company owned the plant and it contracted with SDGE to operate the unit he said Rather than creating more power they were creating less Olkjer said I think there was manipulation of the market The California Public Utilities Commission and several state legislative committees continue to investigate price manipulation allegations and Attorney General Bill Lockyer has said he will take witnesses to a grand ju ry next month The generators have denied they manipulated the market We stand behind our maintenance practices and have done a good job keeping the power flowing Duke spokesman Tom Williams told the CBS television network But former mechanic Glenn Johnson said he saw generation units taken down for economics Ed Edwards also a mechanic said he was ordered to destroy pallets of working parts We were asked myself and other employees to disperse of perfectly good parts that were used to make repairs of systems and components Edwards said State Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana chairman of the marketmanipulation committee said his staff has been looking for employees or others with intimate knowledge of power plant operation to come forward and he promise d that others will testify at future hearings Its the first time that weve had evidence from directly within power plants in California that the ramping up and ramping down of power generati on was a response to price and not to demand Dunn said He said he would reach no conclusions until Duke and other generators testi fy next month but he added that the former employees testimony raises suspicions at first blush The Bees Kevin Yamamura can be reached at or Consumers cut their own power in protest By Silvina Martnez Bee Staff Writer Published June When the temperature hit degrees at pm Thursday Larry Lynch turned off the air conditioner unplugged the refrigerator pulled out the TV cord s and shut down all other appliances in the house Lynch a yearold newsletter publisher in Sacramento responded to the Roll Your Own Blackout Thursday and joined thousands throughout the state to protest energy policies and promote conservation by stopping the use of energy from pm But the data coming off the grid at the California Independent System Operator didnt show the effort During the first hour of the voluntary shutoff the demand for energy by PGE customers in Northern California was almost the same as at the same ti me Wednesday ISO officials said Protesters didnt expect significant changes on the grid I feel it will at least send a message that we dont have to depend on it energy said Jackie Bell a consultant at the Capitol joining the conservation drive from her apartment on Fulton Avenue Its just a symbolic act said Peter Lopez of Sacramento who decided to use the evening to meditate Maybe Ill just go outside stare at the star s and try to spot a few constellations in the night It was the longest day of the year and one of the hottest But those determined to advocate conservation didnt mind the sacrifice People are getting focused on the fact that we have power at our end sai d Joan Blades a spokeswoman for MoveOn a grassroots organization in the Ba y Area and one of hundreds of online groups passing along the call for the voluntary blackout An electrical engineer in Oakland started the Roll Your Own Blackout idea when he posted a note in a political chat room in April Then an artist in Los Angeles forwarded the email to a number of friends and from there it quickly spanned the globe By Thursday afternoon more than people had signed up at the MoveOn Web site to join the protest Blades said Many threw blackout parties In San Francisco the nonprofit group Global Exchange gathered hundreds around a big bonfire at Ocean Beach At his home in east Sacramento Lynch did fine without electricity for thre e hours He ate tuna salad for dinner watered the lawn and when it got dark he opened the windows and let some air in We should show that people are willing to shut the power off if the prices go too high he said ISO has not declared a power emergency since May We have seen a consistent conservation on a daytoday basis and its making the difference between blackouts and no blackouts ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said McCorkle encouraged initiatives like Roll Your Own Blackout People are conserving she said And we can only support this whole effort The Bees Silvina Martnez can be reached at or Davis consultants had contract with Edison The disclosures turn up the hea t on the governor for hiring the exClinton aides By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau Published June Two consultants hired to advise Gov Gray Davis on energy policy officially disclosed their contract with Southern California Edison on Thursday but Davis aides insisted it is not a conflict because Edison and the Governor s Office have the same goal Communications consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani have drawn intense criticism since they were hired last month to shape the Democratic governor s public response to the state energy crisis The former Clinton administration communication aides nicknamed the Masters of Disaster for their spin on the Whitewater travel office and fundraising controversies at the Clinton White House have come und er fire for receiving a sixmonth amonth contract more than the governor or anyone on his staff makes Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who is running for governor nex t year has called for an investigation into potential conflicts State Controller Kathleen Connell a Democrat has said she will not issue paychecks to the pair pending her own investigation The criticism mounted after the duos economic interest disclosure forms we re released late Thursday showing that each has received at least und er contract from Edison in the past year But Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean defended their credibility saying theres no conflict of interest because Lehane and Fabiani both disclosed that they had worked for Edison before they signed their contracts with the state Besides she added Edison and the governor are working toward the same goa l Both want the Legislature to adopt a memorandum of understanding a propose d agreement that would prevent Edison from going bankrupt by financing a sta te purchase of the utilitys transmission lines Its not a conflict because theres been full disclosure McLean said Edison and the Governors Office have the same goal passing the MOU Wer e working together at this point with Edison But opengovernment groups and Republican lawmakers bristled at the notion that disclosure negates any potential conflict Derek Cressman of the California Public Interest Research Group pointed to a section of state law that prohibits public officials from influencing decisions if it would have a material financial effect on a business enti ty that provided them or more within the last year You have two individuals on the government payroll who had previously been on the Edison payroll and its not clear to whom their loyalties are he said Just because theyve revealed it doesnt mean theres not a conflict there and that theyre not serving two masters On Thursday Jones said he is awaiting the results of the Fair Political Practices Commission investigation and agrees with Connells decision this week to withhold payment from the consultants This further calls into question the ethics of how these individuals were hired and contracts were let Jones said Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte believes theres no question that Lehan e and Fabiani are violating conflictofinterest laws and suggested that the two should be paid out of Davis campaign funds which had reached million by Jan Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga added that he would not vote for a state budge t as long as Lehane and Fabiani remain on the state payroll The state of California does not need to be paying political wordsmiths a month he said I just wish Davis were as frugal with the taxpayers money as he is with his campaign money The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at or State deal may ease blackout threat Canada to supply energy as summer demand rises By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO California may be able to avoid some of the blackouts predict ed for this summer thanks to a littleknown powerswapping agreement with a Canadian utility The arrangement is expected to give California electricity in July and Augu st from the hydroelectric generators of BC Hydro in British Columbia despite a serious drought in the Northwest California has sold surplus power in recent months to the governmentowned utility which is expected to return power to the state as heat drives up t he demand for electricity State deal may ease blackout threat Continuing coverage Californias Power Crisis Despite the energy crunch the state often finds itself with surplus power that can be sold or swapped For instance advance power purchases that provide energy at a better price may deliver more power than needed at any given time particularly during offpeak hours BC Hydros reservoirs and hydroelectric generators are a little like an electricity storage battery By importing California power BC Hydro has be en able to conserve water that can be released this summer to produce power fo r California As a result of the agreement and other factors state power buyers say they are in a stronger position going into the hot summer months than they had expected So far this week the state has managed to get through a heat wav e without so much as a Stage power alert We are in much better shape at this point than I imagined we would have be en as little as a month ago said Ray Hart head of the power purchasing unit in the state Department of Water Resources The North American Electric Reliability Council which last month predicted hours of rolling blackouts for California this summer has noticed a change in recent weeks We dont seem to have the crisis we were all expecting said Ellen Vancko a council spokeswoman But whether that is a shortterm or a longterm eve nt we dont think anyone knows yet Much of the credit for avoiding blackouts is given to unexpectedly high conservation by Californians and an increased supply of power Many generators that had been shut down for maintenance or lack of payment are n ow back on line But the hydroelectric power agreement had gone unnoticed until now Hart mentioned it during a Senate Energy Committee hearing this week But h e declined to reveal the amount of power banked with BC Hydro saying it coul d hurt the states competitive position in the market If I start talking specifics said Hart then I have to give out what I am doing every single day and I have no market position In the past California routinely sent power to a number of utilities in th e Pacific Northwest during the winter when residents there needed heat Northwest utilities returned power to California in the summer when air conditioning drove up demand Little was expected from the reciprocal arrangement this year because California was short of power last winter as electricity prices soared and drought has sharply lowered reservoirs in the Northwest But the agreement with BC Hydro will provide at least some power this summer The state was forced to begin buying power in January after its two largest utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric were unable to borrow because of a billion debt The rates that the utilitie s could charge their customers were frozen under a failed deregulation plan a s the cost of power on the wholesale market skyrocketed Hart said it took time to convince BC Hydro which has demanded cash for so me electricity that it could safely do business with California despite big debts owed to generators for power they supplied to the utilities We have only been able to do it for the last couple of months said Hart It took a long time to get them to do it because of credit issues A spokesman for BC Hydro said the utility engages in power swaps but does n ot release the name of the other parties or the terms of the agreements Our first priority is taking care of our own said Warren Cousins of BC Hydro We are still looking for opportunities to help out other entities when we can Hart said the state has another arrangement with the federal Bonneville Pow er Authority but again refused to provide details He said the state has sold surplus power to several buyers including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Information about state power purchases had been closely guarded until recently Gov Gray Davis pressured by lawsuits and a court ruling releas ed edited versions last week of longterm power contracts worth billion The Davis administration said it agreed to release contract information because power prices have dropped easing competitive pressures Exworker Duke manipulated market By Bill Ainsworth UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO A former operator at Duke Energys Chula Vista plant said he was told frequently by company officials during the past year to alter the plants output in a way that may have boosted electricity prices The operator Jimmy Olkjer said he was even ordered to cut power generatio n during energy emergencies when the state faced rolling blackouts because o f a scarce supply of electricity He said he believes reducing the electricity generation helped the company charge higher prices It looks like thats what they were doing Olkjer said in an interview He and another former plant employee said that during the past year the company regularly operated its leastefficient turbine possibly to justify higher prices The allegations which they plan to repeat today at a state Senate hearing investigating power generators provide the first insider evidence that Duk e Energy may have manipulated output at its South Bay plant to drive up price s Duke based in North Carolina leases the South Bay plant from the San Dieg o Unified Port District A March report by the Independent System Operator which manages California s electricity grid alleged that by withholding power Duke and four other owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollars in overcharges to California consumers Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy North America said that varying th e output of the generating units at the Chula Vista plant had nothing to do with trying to achieve higher prices He said the changes in output helped balance the states grid by dancing i n the market providing flexibility for grid managers by allowing the plan t to add or reduce power quickly Williams added that the aging South Bay plant produced as many megawatts la st year as it did in Olkjer served as a plant operator for years mostly when the plant was owned by San Diego Gas Electric Co After Duke took over the plant worke rs were guaranteed their jobs for two years In April when that period ended Duke laid off Olkjer and other workers Now he is retired During the two years Duke has managed the plant Olkjer said operators frequently got calls from officials with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in Salt Lake City telling them to adjust their production schedule Some employees at the plant monitored the hourly price of electricity poste d by the Independent System Operator and recognized a correlation he said We noticed that a lot of times when the price was down our megawatts wou ld go down he said If the price was up often the megawatts would go up Olkjer said he was never told why he was being ordered to turn the plants output up and down When he asked he said company officials told him it w as none of his business Still he was puzzled particularly when he was told to throttle down the plant during electricity emergency alerts as he says he did Jan when the state declared a Stage alert with the possibility of rolling blackouts It doesnt make sense to cycle up and down when theres a Stage alert he said Duke spokesman Williams said the company may turn down units at the orders of the ISO during a Stage alert because the grid manager can find cheaper power somewhere else Lisa Szot spokeswoman at the ISO said she couldnt determine whether the ISO had ordered Duke to power down its Chula Vista plant Jan Olkjer said the frequent adjustments of power production which sometimes occurred every halfhour wear out the plants equipment Its harder on the machinery he said Its like driving down the street putting your foot on the gas and then slamming on the brake Before deregulation Olkjer said the four units at Chula Vista which have the capacity to produce megawatts had been operated steadily during mu ch of their history S David Freeman formerly general manager of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and now chief energy adviser to Gov Gray Davis said rapid cycling had become more common under deregulation and is hard on equipment We had almost megawatts of generating capacity down for repair last winter said Freeman referring to what industry experts agreed was an extraordinary level of plant outages over several months SDGE which built the Chula Vista plant in the s sold it to the Port District for million In the port leased the plant to Duke Energy for years in what critics are now calling a sweetheart deal The company pays minimal rent but has made large profits In the first quarter of this year Duke which owns three other plants in California sa id profits rose percent to million from energy sales and trading Duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for electricity It asked per megawatthour this year By comparison before the energy crisis began electricity sold for around per megawatthour an amount which powers about homes Federal regulators have ordered the company to refund million to the state for charging excessive prices unless the company can justify them In May the company offered to pay the state to settle any price gouging investigations but Gov Gray Davis declined Olkjer and Ed Edwards Jr who worked at the plant for years before bein g laid off in April said they couldnt understand why Duke ran the inefficient highcost turbine unit during the past year while other generators sat idle They said they believed it may have been an attempt to fetch a higher price for electricity because the company got extra fees when it ran Williams the Duke spokesman said the opposite was true He said Duke ran the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive It ran on jet fuel which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the other units Edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destroyed It ran so frequently and so hard it needed extensive repairs he said Edwards told CBS News last night that plant outages at Chula Vista were prolonged because one supervisor ordered him to dump spare parts The former power plant employees said they felt compelled to come forward because they saw the impact the power crisis was having on their community It kind of irritated me because you know theres people on a fixed income that cant afford a big utility bill said Olkjer Staff writer Craig D Rose contributed to this story Estimates of Power Profits Disputed Electricity A study of overcharges by suppliers may be flawed state officials say Davis quoted the figures to Congress By DOUG SMITH ROBERT J LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL Times Staff Writers Gov Gray Davis contention that California has been nicked for billio ns of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study that state officials concede may have significant flaws according to interviews and confidential government documents Those costsestimated by the state to be as high as billionwere central to Davis testimony this week before a US Senate committee where he again denounced power wholesalers and urged federal regulators to give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us The governors impassioned demand however was based on shaky calculations The formulas are being reworked said Charles Robinson vice president of Californias grid operator which prepared the study Robinson said he had no idea how much the amount allegedly overcharg ed by the generators might change For now he said the agency stands by the numbers But internal documents from the California Independent System Operator warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quantify the alleged excess profits could be well off the mark Whats more the documents caution against relying on the agencys stu dy as a basis for allegations of overchargingas Davis did during his testimo ny Wednesday That warning was particularly important because the documents provide for the first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy supplier prospered from the states power troubles between last summer and February The largest amounts were charged by four outofstate power companies according to the confidential CalISO report Okalhomabased Williams Cos led the group with million followed by Duke Energy with million Southern Company Energy Marketing now Mirant with million and Relian t Energy Services with million When told of the alleged profiteering attributed to them executives o f the companies insisted the numbers were grossly overstated because of CalISOs poor methodology Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his companys entire energy earnings for North America were less than the amount it was accused of reaping unfairly in California It doesnt add up It doesnt come close to adding up Williams said What CalISO has done is highly irresponsible math Paula HallCollins a Williams Cos spokeswoman said the firm would need to study the ISO report further But generally she said such reports fail to fully account for electricity production costs We maintain that we have not overcharged and that we have operated legally Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley also questioned the figures saying Theres a lot of misinformation out of there A Mirant spokesman said We haven t overcharged We havent manipulated We havent withheld Even some firms alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree we re outraged Joe Ronan vice president for government and regulatory relations at Calpine said the million attributed to his company doesnt bear any relation to reality Anybody can throw out any number he said Its like McCarthyism Where is the evidence A spokeswoman for Davis conceded that his refund figure was an estimat e but defended it as reasonable Its no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute an estimate of how much theyre gouging us senior advisor Nancy McFadden sai d Despite the cautions expressed in the CalISO documents officials Thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to the agencys figures as potential overcharges The way it should be characterized is the amount paid above a competitive benchmark said Robinson who is also CalISOs general counse l The first version of the nowdisputed CalISO study was made public in March It estimated that power sellers earned billion in excess profit s between May and last February The report later revised upward to billion became a crucial element of the Davis Administrations campaign against alleged electricity price gougers This week just before Davis appearance in Congress the study was updated again adding another billions in alleged excess profits throu gh May The orginal study which did not include actual pricing data was most ly intended to prod federal regulators into seeking information from generator s that the state had been denied Robinson said Thus far the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered refunds of only million Next week FERC is convening an unusual settlement conference aimed at addressing the outstanding claims by the state as well as those of sellers who claim they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars by California utilities One encouraging signal for state officials came this week when FERC reiterated an earlier order that Duke Energy pay millions in refunds The order stemmed from the companys sale of electricity at a megawatt hourfor thousands of hours FERCs order said Dukes pricing had resulted in million in billings A fair price for that power would have been per megawatt hou r the agency said Tom Williams a Duke spokesman said the firm is willing to accept the lower price He said he company has yet to collect a dime Times staff writers Elizabeth Shogren and Dan Morain contributed to th is story Edison Plans Bond Offer at Rate Debt Yield is about double what a creditworthy company would pay analyst s say But will investors bite By JERRY HIRSCH Times Staff Writer Edison International is offering investors what analysts are calling a n unprecedented interest rate for billion in notes to refinance debt Even so its far from certain that the Rosemeadbased power company will find enough buyers to complete the deal A failure by Edison to refinance million in bank debt that comes due June and an additional million in notes due in July could put t he company precariously close to bankruptcy and cast a shadow on Californias plan to sell billion in bonds to pay for power purchases said Dan Scotto a bond analyst at PNB Paribas in New York Even though it would at first appear to be a company setback it woul d really be a major setback for the state said Scotto who added that Edisons credit troubles could translate into higher prices for California s proposed bond offering Edison however said Thursday that the deal is moving forward We believe our deal is going well and we are comfortable with it said Jo Ann Goddard vice president for investor relations She declined to discuss other details of the offering Goldman Sachs Group Edisons investment bank expects to formally pri ce the offering Monday Edison officials would not comment on the proposed pri ce of the note offering but Wall Street sources said the power company was shopping the issue at the rate Edison floated the plan earlier this month as a way to tap the borrowi ng power of a profitable subsidiary to trim debt that comes due this year and to insulate itself from a possible bankruptcy of its ailing utility unit The utility Southern California Edison has lost billions of dollars on electricity sales over the last year The high interest rate on Edisons proposed sale of sevenyear notes i s about double what a creditworthy company would pay for a similar bond or note issue and would add a premium amounting to tens of millions of dollars in annual interest costs to the companys already strapped financial condition analysts said Its a full two percentage points higher than the average rate for other junk or speculative bonds And corporate bonds wit h similar ratings are going out at to Edison originally started marketing the issue at a full two percentage points higher than what analysts initially expected but then raised the rate to in recent days because it was finding few takers on Wall Street The word is that they couldnt get people interested and that they might not be able to get it done said Kurt Stabel a money manager at Street Asset Management in Newport Beach The higher rate however might be pulling investors out of the woodwo rk and has increased the chance that Edison will pull off the deal Scotto sai d This never promised to be a day at the beach Scotto said I think it is really a question of find the right price the price at which people fee l comfortable with the risk Both Stabel and Scotto said that Edisons note offering is unusually complicated and requires far more explaining or selling than typical corporate offerings Mission Energy Holding Co a company created by Edison for the sole purpose of issuing these bonds will offer the notes The assets of Edison Mission Energy a subsidiary that owns a network of power plants across the United States and in Asia Australia and New Zealand will secure the debt Mission Energy Holding plans to issue the proceeds to Edison in the fo rm of dividends giving the parent company funds to pay off a substantial portion of its debt The notes will have a credit rating of BBminus and come due in according to bond rating agency Standard Poors Thats slightly higher than the neardefault CC rating now carried by Edison If the offering failed Edison would face a series of difficult choice s that range from depleting its cash cushion to going back to its bankers and begging for continued forbearance Its SCE subsidiary already has defaulted on million in bonds and notes That triggered a default in bank lines of credit at Edison International and SCE which has since operated under extensions from its lenders Edison has about billion in cash including billion held by SCE according to regulatory documents This could all still unravel but I have been impressed with Edison s effort to inch along so far said Ellen Lapson an analyst at Fitch Inc a corporate credit rating service Who would have thought that they could ha ve lasted so many months after their first default in January and still not be in bankruptcy Positive developments for Edison including a deal to hold small generators at bay with partial payments from SCE and progress at crafting a rescue plan in both the state Legislature and the Public Utilities Commissi on have sparked a small rally in the companys stock Edison shares have risen this month They gained cents Thursday to close at on the New York Stock Exchange Energy Company Abandons Plans for Baldwin Hills Plant Power Homeowners and environmentalists rejoice at decision The site is proposed as a acre state park By JOE MOZINGO Times Staff Writer In a victory for environmentalists and nearby homeowners an energy company announced Thursday that it was abandoning its plan to build a power plant on the site of a proposed state park in the Baldwin Hills La Jolla Energy Development Inc in a letter to the state Energy Commission said it was withdrawing its application for fasttrack approval of the megawatt plant and will not pursue the Baldwin facility in the future We listened to the community La Jolla President Steve Wilburn said in an interview Thursday We need to find another place for this equipment The project was to be a joint venture between La Jolla and Stocker Resources an oil company that leases the land where the trailersized naturalgas plant would sit Stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether they will pursue the project At this point its just La Jolla pulling out Stocker spokesman Steve Rusch said But most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the fasttrack schedule the state has implemented to relieve the energy crisis The state commission was scheduled to decide whether to approve the project today in Sacramento but the hearing has been canceled The news sparked elation among environmentalists and nearby homeowners who had fought the proposal on grounds that it would pollute neighborhoods and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together acres of public open space in the hills Were getting ready to have the biggest party said Tony Nicholas president of the hills United Homeowners Assn This shows how a community can come together for a common goal and mobilize the people in a matter of days About of the residents in the hills are African American and many saw the issue as a matter of environmental justice In addition Stocker and La Jolla were seeking approval for the plant within days of filing their application under the governors emergency power orders By following this fasttracked procedure they would have bee n able to avoid the normal timeconsuming environmental review process That angered opponents even further and nearly people showed up at a public hearing Monday to fight the project But what officials said turned the tide against the projectat a time when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possiblewa s testimony from a South Coast Air Quality Management official who said his agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly Executive Director Barry Wallerstein said his agency would have to conduct hearings that would take up to days pushing construction well beyond a Sept deadline set by the governor for fasttrack projects He also said it was unlikely Stocker could get needed exemptions from federal clean air laws In a letter to the Energy Commission this week Wallerstein wrote It appears that the Baldwin Energy Facility could not begin operation until so me time in the first part of at the earliest By Wednesday night the energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statemen t recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a plant citing Wallersteins concerns Conservationists embraced the outcome as a sign that the movement to create a park was gaining steam The Baldwin Hills Conservancy was created last year with the idea of creating green space for the densely populated neighborhoods of south Los Angeles With support from the governor and loca l politicians the state recently bought a acre parcel in the area for an unprecedented million This is a great day for the Baldwin Hills and all the people who have worked so hard to bring this worldclass vision to reality said Esther Feldman president of Community Conservancy International and the main organizer to build the park Also applauding La Jollas decision were state Sen Kevin Murray DCulver City and Assemblyman Herb Wesson DCulver City who had come o ut strongly against the project They and others questioned whether the small amount of power provided by the facilitycoming online after the dog days of summerwould do much to relieve the energy crisis Im ecstatic Wesson said At this point the environment has won The plant would have sat on what is a working oil field about feet from the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area And according to park proponents it would lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy on what would be a halfmile bridge of land arching over La Cienega Boulevard Rusch the spokesman for Stocker said much of the information circulating about the trailersized plant is false The plan did not call for a stack with billowing smoke he said If the issue is air quality weve cleaned air quality up In the last decade Rusch said the companys existing oil pumps on the property have reduc ed nitrogen oxide emissions from tons to tons a year The power plantwith two foot stackswould ultimately add about tons a year He said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing it s own power to pump oil while also contributing an extra megawatts to the state grid during the energy crisis Residents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve the energy problem Said Mary Ann Green president of the Blair Hills Homeowners Assn We just hope that Stocker would be responsive to the outcry from the community Western states could feel pinch from California pricing KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer Friday June Associated Press URL cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchiven ation alEDTDTLtypeDnews PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP When power supplies stretch thin across the West this summer who will deci de whether Silicon Valley computers Washington apple orchards or Las Vegas casinos get first dibs on whats left Its a key question raised by the decision of federal energy regulators thi s week to cap electricity prices throughout the West using a formula based o n Californias power costs Economists energy industry executives and officials in all states are beginning to analyze the fit of this new piece in the energy puzzle Though most call the order a good step that could prevent price gouging others worry the pricing system could lead to electricity shortages for Californias neighbors or prompt utilities to stock up on power contracts to fend off shortages That could diminish any leverage power buyers might hav e as they compete for the remaining megawatts available each day Tying the highest possible power price to California could cause a problem come winter when power demand drops in the Golden State said Gary Ackerma n director of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents most sellers of energy States where consumers need electricity to heat furnaces through the winter would be unable to outbid each other above the price cap which is usually determined by a formula based on the highest bid for lastminute power duri ng the most recent energy supply emergency in California That may leave power wholesalers and not a free market to decide who gets the energy Certainly California has a tremendous pull on our prices and has for probably the last year said Claudia Rapkoch spokeswoman for Montana Powe r Co which supplies natural gas and electricity to twothirds of the Big Sk y state What it means for this winter were just going to have to wait and see California utilities had much more control over power supplies before deregulation in obligated them to sell off their power plants to encourage competition This brought lower prices for a time but gave contr ol over power supplies to wholesalers that arent obligated by state law to serve the serve the best interests of local customers Rather than appointing one power grid manager to decide how to divide power in the West Ackerman predicts utilities in nonderegulated states will simply sell their power within their borders That would hurt California which this week imported about percent of its electricity and its remaining supply from local plants owned by outofstate power companies Price cap or not utilities in the region will watch out for each other as best they can because they might need the favor returned said Charles Reinhold executive consultant for Electric Resources Strategies in Ariz Saddled with rising bills that threatened to exhaust the states budget California recently began to sign longterm contracts with generators Gov Gray Davis credits the change for helping to drastically reduce prices on t he spot market which earlier this month fell below per megawatt hour for the first time in a year The longterm contracts though werent cheap California will pay an average of per megawatt

refunds Christian Berthelsen Chronicle Staff Writer Friday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Federal regulators have rejected attempts by Duke Energy Inc to avoid refunding millions of dollars to California for charging exorbitant electricity prices in January and February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission first ordered the refunds on March and Duke responded by filing a challenge But the commission on Monday rejected the companys appeal and reiterated its earlier order claiming Du ke had abused its power in the California energy market when it sold power for per megawatt hour We will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding or behavior the commission said Duke acknowledged this month that it had charged per megawatt for about megawatt hours sold to the states major utilities in January a nd February netting it more than million in receivables The commission did not specify how much money Duke should refund but it directed the company to readjust its January billings for those hours to a price of From a FERC document it appears that about hours occurred in January which would result in a total refund for that month of million Duke is one of the companies that have been identified by both the Californ ia Independent System Operator the manager of the states electricity grid a nd the FERC as having exercised market power and overcharged Californians for electricity Meanwhile employees at the South Bay power plant in San Diego run by Duke are expected to testify in a state Senate committee

There was a reason Gov Gray Davis donned a dark blue jacket and endured beastly humid degree heat this week in an area behind the Capitol known as the House swamp The nation was watching And after months of political free fall his messa ge seemed to be taking hold California has been bilked out of billion while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was asleep at the switch Davis declared repeating testimony he had delivered hours earlier in the airconditioned confines of a Senate hearing room Wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as television cameras and two dozen reporters recorded the scene the California governor apparently couldnt resist taking another shot For nearly a year Ive been pounding on this commission to enforce the law The states energy crisis with its volatile spot markets outofstate generators and dearth of alternative energy providers is a dizzyingly complex policy puzzle The politics are much simpler Democrats present themselves as consumer crusaders defending helpless utility customers from greedy energy conglomerates and misguided regulators Republicans portray themselves as stewards of the free market and longterm solutions rejecting price caps and refunds as heavyhanded overreactions with Sovietstyle results The Democratic populism seems to be winning the battle Though the debate i s far from settled the consumeroriented approach to Californias energy woe s has raised their hopes of winning back the House of Representatives in and the White House in Republicans are scared out of their minds about this said one gleeful Democrat on Capitol Hill who suggested that the White Houses lackadaisica l response to Californias problems would rile consumers from coast to coast This could rival Pete Wilsons alienation of Latinos said the Democrat referring to the former Republican governors strident stand against illega l immigrants which many blame for the partys weak standing in California A sign of the GOPs concern surfaced this week with television ads finance d by anonymous sources but produced by Republican Party strategists that bla me the Democratic governor for Californias energy problems Democrats who long have worried that the crisis could cost Davis a second term now take credit for having pressured the White House and federal regulators to take a more active role The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which had previously resisted suc h efforts took steps toward controlling wholesale electricity prices Monday Later in the week two commissioners appointed by President Bush testified that they might be open to further price restrictions and support huge refunds to California And just yesterday Vice President Dick Cheney who has been among Californias most vocal critics told Senate Democrats behin d closed doors that he could support refunds to California if federal regulators agreed according to those in the meeting There is no doubt in my mind that action taken by federal regulators was the direct result of pressure for price relief led primarily by the California delegation Davis said The pressure did not come only from Democrats Republican lawmakers some o f whom fear the crisis could cost them seats in wrote FERC last week requesting commissioners to take further actions to help the state The Democrats public relations success follows an effort by the party to raise the profile of its consumer crusade Hardly a day has passed in the past several weeks without a group of Democrats holding a news conference t o attack the White House the Republican controlled House or FERC for inactio n But it may have just as much to do with a White House that has been far mor e focused on longterm energy production than the immediate concerns of Californians Even as it engaged in a legitimate policy dispute over how to solve the power mess the Bush administration appeared indifferent to the plight of residents experiencing skyrocketing energy bills and rolling blackouts Bush tried to correct that impression with a trip to the state last month But the damage appears to have extended beyond California A CBS NewsNew York Times poll released this week of adults from acro ss the country showed that only one in three voters approved of the job Bush w as doing on energy More than half the respondents said that protecting the environment was a higher priority than producing energy yet barely one in said that Bush shared that priority Some Republicans say that Bush was in a nowin position contending that anything he did would have been attacked by Californias opportunistic governor Politics is Davis main objective and I dont see the Bush administrati on being that way said Rep George Radanovich RFresno The question for some analysts is whether Democrats might have been too successful By pressuring the federal government to take a more active role Democrats may lose their ability to point the finger at a convenient scapegoat Davis has always needed rate caps much less than he needed a scapegoat No w that FERC has given him what he wants or close enough to it its a lot harder for him to lay blame back on Washington when the blackouts kick in said

Matthew Yi Chronicle Staff Writer Friday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews As state legislators consider Gov Gray Davis deal to buy part of the powe r grid in California a public records advocacy group filed a lawsuit yesterd ay demanding that the state release a report on potential health hazards of living near highvoltage transmission lines The document could be vital to how legislators vote on the billion de al to buy Southern California Edisons power lines said Terry Francke genera l counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition which filed the lawsu it in Alameda County Superior Court The power line deal was brokered by the governor to help the cashstrapped utility Legislators must approve the power grid purchase by Aug or the utility can back out Davis also has a billion agreement to purchase San Diego G as and Electrics power grid which also would require the Legislatures approval Pacific Gas and Electric has not agreed to sell its transmission lines The power lines report was completed in April by California Electric and Magnetic Fields Program an agency set up by the state Department of Health Services to study the issue Francke said Both state agencies and their directors are named in the lawsuit Efforts to keep the report secret are suspect Francke said If its known theres some danger do you want the state owning that liability he asked The study began in after the state Public Utilities Commission committ ed million for research and education on the subject Francke said The state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and electric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies based on those findings he said The report was scheduled to be released to the public on May but at the last minute the Public Utilities Commission apparently instructed the staf f of the EMF Program to keep the reports secret the lawsuit said State health services spokeswoman Lea Brooks said that the report was only a draft and that her department was following orders from the PUC The PUC wanted to see the draft before it is released she said We prepared the report for them We are following their request Brooks refused comment on the lawsuit saying her office hadnt seen it PU C officials were not available for comment Studies on the effects of magnetic fields have resulted in no clear consens us on their effects Francke said Thats what makes the state study important for legislators to consider before voting on the governors deal to buy transmission lines he said Opponents of the power grid deals say the report may add to objections to Davis agreements with the utilities Some legislators would rather the sta te help build more power generators in California They are extra nails in the coffin said James Fisfis spokesman for stat e Assembly minority leader Dave Cox RFair Oaks We have fundamental issues with the transmission lines but when you start stacking these items up you have an undigestible deal Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said he believed the governor hadnt seen th e health hazard report Obviously if something pops up and is an issue youll take a look at it but I dont think were at that point yet he said An Alameda County Superior Court judge will hear the lawsuit on July Francke said Email Matthew Yi at San Francisco

cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive B UDTLtypeDnews Theres trouble in Texas Enron Corp the Houston power firm thats profited mightily during Californias energy crisis is suffering a surprising lack of popularity on Wall Street While all eyes have been on Enrons enormous profits here and its enormous pull in Washington DC the reputed titan of the newly incarnated free wheeling power industry has lost half its market capitalization more tha n billion since its peak in August Forgive Californians for savoring a bit of schadenfreude over the Houston boys reversal of fortunes But what gives Isnt this the company that was fattening up on the backs of the states beleaguered utilities residents a nd state budget Isnt this the company with such close ties to the Bush administration that Kenneth Lay Enrons chairman was reported to have interviewed a candidate for a job on the commission that regulates his company Yup That Enron On Monday Enron shares hit a week low of after the Federal Ener gy Regulatory Commission decided to apply the same price controls to power marketers such as Enron that had applied to powergenerating companies for months Thats a far cry from August when the companys shares peaked at Theres a whole kaleidoscope of issues that Enron is being challenged with in the marketplace right now none of which on the surface is a major deal said Donato J Eassey an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities in Houston But when you combine them all I think whats happening here is you have a crescendo with this FERC announcement You have people saying OK the growth rate is now in question That growth rate was an eyepopping percent in revenues for the Unite d States on a twoyear average and nearly percent in the rest of the worl d Enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews but as the sto ck continued to drop Tuesday morning chief executive Jeff Skilling issued a statement to the markets in which he reiterated strong confidence in its earnings guidance The stock rebounded slightly throughout the week closin g at yesterday In a speech at the Commonwealth Club last night Skilling blamed regulatory interference with the free market for investor flight from his company Our stock prices have gotten hammered he said Theyre half what they were a year ago Tumbling stock prices werent the only bad news for Skilling last night A protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began speaking As Skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face a woman was arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges Enron isnt the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with Californias power crisis and are now suddenly headed south Shares of Reliant Energy Inc AES Inc and Williams Companies Inc which generate a nd sell electricity in California and El Paso Energy Corp which sells natur al gas here are all trading near week lows The main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in Washington abou t power price controls reregulation and now the possibility of big refunds being ordered for California Even Calpine Corp of San Jose which has developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played th e spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics dropped nearl y percent yesterday to But none of the companies has been hit as hard as Enron Such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any company It leaves it less money to invest in its own growth and because executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price a sharp decline makes it more difficult to retain talented leaders While Enrons power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine the firm h as been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other regio ns in recent months In the financial press the continuing knock on Enron is that its business lines are so new and complex and the company is so secretive about its operations that analysts and fund managers dont feel confident in their understanding of what it does A look at the firms recent troubles exemplifies its diversity For instance Enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state governme nt of Maharashtra in India over a megawatt power plant there The Dahbol Power Co which is percent controlled by Enron stopped construction on a second phase of the project on Sunday claiming it is owed million by t he Maharashtra State Electricity Board The state has accused Enron of chargin g too much and not generating enough and stopped buying power from the plant last month Closer to home Enron has struggled with its investments in fiberoptic bandwidth The company buys and sells unused highspeed bandwidth space treating it like a commodity as it does electricity coal or natural gas B ut the fiberoptic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear that for all the longdistance cable laid in the ground there have not bee n enough last mile connections set up for users to actually take advantage of it Earlier this year Enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with Blockbuster to offer what it called video on demand in which customers a t home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it transmitted via fiberoptic cables Then there was the FERC ruling For months the agency had resisted aggressive price controls in the West preferring to let the market run its course But as control of the US Senate was handed to Democrats this mont h and President Bush appointed a tough Texan regulator named Patrick Wood III to the commission the agency changed its tune It expanded price controls to all hours of the day spread the controls throughout the Western region and brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent So under current calculations that means Enron could sell power for no mor e than per megawatt in a shortage and about during normal hours f ar short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly charging during the past year In part the companys gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of the businesses Enron has decided to pursue And the hardcharging company h as a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets But sometime s that approach gets it in trouble as was the case last year when Enron had to take a million charge for its failed investment in Azurix a global water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply the same way it had done for electricity service as governments privatized their water systems The opportunities never materialized Add it all together and Enron has a tough time supporting a priceearnings ratio of nearly considerably above the liberal standard of health whic h is The company had less than billion in profits on more than billion in revenues last year Still a survey by Thomson FinancialFirst Call found that analysts expect Enron to deliver earnings of cents per share in the second quarter up from cents last year and per sha re on the year Most maintain a strong buy rating on the stock But investors with big positions in Enron have taken a hit Hardestput of them will be the Janus funds which as Enrons largest mutual fund investo r held nearly billion of its stock as of the end of April In a semiannual report to investors John Schreiber a portfolio manager said the stock price of the newage energy merchant was a victim of negative psychology resulting from the California energy crisis Janus declined to make fund managers available for interviews

Former employees say Duke Energy slowed production of electricity to create an artificial shortage boost profits BY DION NISSENBAUM Mercury News Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO One of the largest companies producing power in California ordered workers to throw out spare parts and shut down equipment in an effo rt to drive up the price of electricity former power plant workers said Thursday Speaking out on the eve of appearances at a state Senate hearing the three men offered the strongest evidence yet that at least one power producer Duke Energy sought to make more money by creating an artificial shortage that may have created huge electricity price spikes Their intent in my opinion was to boost the price up said Glenn Johnson a mechanic who worked for two decades at the Chula Vista power pla nt now run by Duke If Ive got the only box of penicillin in town and your e sick I can charge a million dollars a box he said If you want to liv e youre going to have to pay Officials at Duke angrily challenged the accusations calling them irresponsible charges by disgruntled workers who were let go in April Their allegations are just comical just highly erroneous said Tom Williams a spokesman for Duke which runs four plants in California that produce enough energy for nearly million homes The charges come as the state heads into negotiations next week with generators over the billion the state claims its consumers have been overcharged Duke based in Charlotte NC came under considerable criticism when it disclosed that it charged the state a record a megawatthour for power in January Federal officials have called the charg e unreasonable and ordered Duke to refund California the money The employees who first made their allegations public on CBS Evening News Thursday night will be the only witnesses today at an energy crisis hearing headed by lawmakers who suspect that power companies have been illegally gouging California State Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove chairman of a committee investigating price gouging said the allegations raise serious concerns While we stil l need to hear the other side of the story from Duke if theres any truth to the information I believe it would be devastating to the generators he said Perfectly good parts In interviews with the Mercury News Thursday night the three former plant workers said that they were directed to scale back energy production and throw out good spare parts that kept the plant from getting up to full powe r for weeks Ed Edwards who worked in the Southern California plant said that he was told to get rid of many boxes of good spare parts Edwards said he tossed more than pallets of parts into a dumpster I dont know why they were throwing away perfectly good parts he said It didnt make sense Johnson said the lack of onsite parts prevented workers from quickly fixin g problems that reduced the amount of power the plant could produce Sometime s he said it took weeks to get parts Johnsons suspicions of gouging were echoed by Jimmey Olkjer who spent years in the plant and worked as an assistant control operator Even at times when California regulators were warning residents the state might not be able to find enough energy to prevent imminent blackouts Olkj er said he was directed to scale back the amount of electricity the plant was producing In hindsight it looks to me like they were manipulating the power Olkjer said Duke called the allegations baseless and said the workers didnt understand the reasons for the actions Continued accusations repetitive investigations and inflammatory rhetoric concerning the companys operation s in the state are distracting attention from the true issue of solving Californias energy crisis Duke said in a statement Williams did not directly dispute the workers allegations But he said the y did not understand the reasons behind the decisions State directives Duke cut back on the amount of power it was producing in response to directives from state regulators at the Independent System Operator which runs the power grid Williams said They did not know that the ISO was instructing them to go up and down to meet supply and demand he said An ISO spokeswoman said that the grid manager sometimes asks generators to produce more or less power to adjust traffic on the transmission system or respond to the states electricity needs Some companies bid power into the reserve market which means these plants run only when the extra energy is tapped ISO officials say they are prohibited from discussing individual bids As for the spare parts Williams said they were eliminated as unnecessary after Duke bought the plants from San Diego Gas Electric Williams said Duke has one of the best performance records in the state wi th its power plants offline for unscheduled maintenance only about percen t of the time All three workers were given severance packages and let go in April But Edwards disputed any contention that they were trying to get back at Duke Im not a disgruntled employee he said Im just telling the truth o f what I saw the last two years I worked there No matter what the reasons were for the decisions Duke has made huge profi ts during the California energy crisis And those profits apparently created good cheer among Duke executives At one party Johnson said executives gleefully celebrated their good fortune Were making more money than we ever thought possible Johnson quoted t he plants manager as saying Mercury News staff writer John Woolfolk contributed to this report Contact Dion Nissenbaum at or Enron chief Gov Davis not to blame for energy crisis BY KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO AP California Gov Gray Davis isnt to blame for Californias power crisis and neither are electricity wholesalers a Texas energy executive told a crowd at the Commonwealth Club of California Jeffrey Skilling CEO and president of Houstonbased Enron Corp wiped awa y the remnants of a pie hurled by a protester Thursday and placed the blame squarely on Californias energy regulators The state Public Utilities Commission in the early s put together a broken market by preventing utilities to pass along the full cost of power and discouraging power contracts that would have lowered dependence on buyi ng lastminute power Skilling said Because of these rules the power consumers of the state of California we re thrown totally to the mercy of the spot market Skilling said PUC president Loretta Lynch defended the regulators actions last week saying utilities have been free to enter into longterm contracts Utilitie s countered that the PUC never made clear what contracts it would accept whi ch left open the possibility they would later be overruled I think consumers in California are angry and they should be Skilling said Prices in California shouldnt be as high as they are Skilling also Congratulated Davis for Californias unprecedented conservation Denied accusations that Enron chairman Kenneth Lay personally interviewed candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees interstate energy markets Told the audience to expect a report that would show California municipal utilities have profited the most selling power to the state Said price caps ordered by FERC earlier this week would likely damage the markets and would only exacerbate the problem Acknowledged that municipal utilities in the state have managed to provid e cheaper power to their customers and even profit from the power crisis by selling off extra power despite public control Enron has come under fire after accusations from Davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply Enron denies such claims and joins other power producers in arguing that t he state and utilities still owe them billions in unpaid bills Davis acknowledges that Pacific Gas Electric Co which has declared bankruptcy and Southern California Edison together still owe generators such as Enron Duke Energy Mirant and Reliant Energy about billion for past electricity sales Our success is linked to efficient markets not higher prices in Californ ia or anywhere else Skilling said Protesters gathered outside the building wearing pig masks and carrying handmade signs one of which read Greed is the only power crisis Its basically Enron and the other companies raising prices said Berna rd Greening a Santa Clara computer programmer who said hes unhappy with the record prices for electricity and natural gas Pete Snoek of Tiburon said he believed what Skilling had to say I believe the energy situation has been politicized so badly Snoek sai d saying he was one of several in the audience to shush protesters during the meeting I hear the same people out there as if its a sin to make any money in this country State officials counter that wholesalers charged as much as billion in illegal overcharges dating back to May Companies have said Californias claims are wildly exaggerated The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already estimated that wholesalers owe California million in overcharges for the first four months of the year Davis and others say thats a mere drop in the bucket Enron has also been tied to President Bushs handsoff approach to the ener gy crisis Company chairman Kenneth Lay is a friend and one of the largest campaign contributors to Bush and the GOP Several prominent members of the Bush administration hold stock in the company Enron is one of several major GOP donors accused of meeting secretly with Vice President Dick Cheney as he drafted the Bush administrations energy plan Enron is one of the worlds leading electricity natural gas and communications companies with billion in revenues in It owns miles of pipeline has employees and is active in countrie s During the first quarter of this year Enrons revenues increased perce nt to billion Three say company purposely cut power ExDuke workers say repairs were curbed in order to manipulate output June By KIMBERLY KINDY The Orange County Register FORMER DUKE ENERGY employees Ed Edwards left Glenn Johnson center and Jimmy Olkjer are to appear before a state Senate committee today Photo Dave Yoder The Register Three former Duke Energy workers say they were ordered to tamper with equipment at a San Diego County power plant causing mechanical problems that helped drive up electricity prices during the states energy crisis The workers say they will offer eyewitness testimony to a state Senate committee today the first public accounts from power plant employees of h ow energy production may have been manipulated Duke officials deny most of the allegations The whistleblowers mechanic s Ed Edwards and Glenn Johnson and control room operator Jimmy Olkjer lost their jobs four months ago State Sen Joe Dunn the Santa Ana Democrat who is chairing the investigati ve committee on pricefixing said his staff will attempt to verify the accoun ts from the whistleblowers But their mere presence in a Capitol hearing room is expected to set off a media circus And if the accusations are true it could have wideranging effects on the North Carolina companys operations in California Duke officials were working late into the night to prepare for the hearing and have scheduled a news conference later today They were doing all kinds of things that didnt make sense Johnson said in an interview But if you asked them why to explain they told you to shut up and do your job The testimony comes on the heels of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruling Thursday ordering Duke to refund million in overcharges for January This information lends credence to the concern that there was a deliberate strategy for outages for the sole purpose of impacting price Dunn said What they are saying is disturbing Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said the fact that the former workers lo st their jobs may be shaping their testimony The proof is in the pudding Production is up and weve had fewer forced outages since weve taken over said Williams But controlroom logs obtained by The Orange County Register show Dukes trading arm ordered its South Bay power plant in Chula Vista to reduce production minutes after Stage Three alerts were issued The logs are for January the same month that Duke was accused of overcharging in California The three former Duke workers each worked at the Chula Vista plant for more than two decades when it was owned by San Diego Gas Electric They lost their jobs when Duke assembled a new team to run the plant The three whistleblowers outlined their accusations in interviews with the Register The accusations include The company ordered workers to throw unopened boxes of bolts steam seals valves and other parts into Dumpsters The parts were needed to perform routine maintenance but were no longer available when repairs were required Duke officials acknowledge that new parts were discarded but say the high inventory tax made it more efficient to order parts as needed because they could be delivered within hours Edwards and Johnson say they were ordered to dismantle critical equipment necessary for the generating units to run at full capacity Because parts were thrown away they couldnt make repairs and generators ran at diminish ed capacity for days or weeks Energy experts say this allegation if true would allow Duke to withhold energy from the marketplace which could drive up the price Duke officials counter that production has increased at its power plants and forced outages have decreased since they took over But in late there was a spike in outages at the Chula Vista plant according to records kept by the states powergrid operator The plant reported hours of outages from October through December There were relatively few outages before that The mechanics say the inability to perform repairs forced them to use a small expensive generator that was rarely powered up before Duke took over the plant Experts say that could have been used to exploit federal rules allowing generators to justify prices based on the costliest units online Olkjer says he received orders from Dukes trading arm to reduce production Then when energy prices jumped he would get new instructions to power up again Duke officials did not respond to Olkjers claim Stanford professor Frank Wolak an expert in Californias energy market sa id that if their testimony can be proven the state could be refunded millions of dollars and future energy prices could be dramatically reduced What they are saying is amazing This is a classic plot Ive always wondered how they kept the generators out for so long said Wolak who heads an electricity market surveillance for the California agency that oversees the buying and selling of power They were very happy to have the m offline because it allowed them to make more money Wolak said the testimony seems to back up research conducted by the state Independent System Operator which runs most of the states power grid and oversees the buying and selling of electricity in California In a report to federal regulators ISO said that from May to November Duke withheld electricity from the states power grid percent of the tim e The report accused more than a dozen power plant companies of powering down generators to create scarcity in the marketplace that would in turn drive u p prices In a separate report the state power grid operator accused Duke of overcharging California again in January of this year resulting in the million refund order Duke officials say charging a megawatthour wa s justified during a short period of time Federal regulators disagreed and said the power merchant should have charged no more than per megawatthour Williams Dukes spokesman said that the company has been an ethical operator All but percent of the time we were operating Thats very good sa id Williams adding that when SDGE owned the plant forced outages took place percent of the time But Dunn said that if the testimony from the whistleblowers is true and Duke had the ability to manipulate prices federal regulators would be required under the Federal Power Act to move them out of the competitive marketplace This would mean they would be moved back into a costbased market structu re and would only be allowed to recover costs at a fair rate of return This would bring the prices down dramatically in California Dunn said What generators fear most is being returned to costbased rate regulation Allegations of market manipulation Nearly a dozen investigations are under way to determine if energy producers illegally manipulated Californias dysfunctional electricity market Here a re the main allegations Was power deliberately withheld to boost prices Several investigators including the Public Utilities Commission the California attorney general and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a re trying to determine if the largest generators and power marketers includi ng Duke Reliant Mirant and Dynegy shut down power plants at key times Federal Environmental Protection Agency records showed times in December when Tulsabased Williams throttled back at midday letting Williams boost profits at other plants it controlled including a Huntington Beach plant owned by AES Corp Were financial incentives offered to plant operators who shut down Federal regulators have settled a case for million with Williams Among the allegations Williams offered ffinancial incentives to AES if it would keep its plants offline Williams has denied any wrongdoing Did companies collude Traders and producers were able to share information on Web sites that helped them determine when to get the highest prices for electricity Attorney General Bill Lockyer is investigating othe r allegations of collusion Were workers ordered to fake outages Three former Duke employees will testify today that

too much for electricity The generators want billions from the utilities and t he state that they say didnt pay the bill for other power they bought And Californias ratepayers just want to keep the lights on I dont think theres billion Wagner said Thursday from his office at FERC headquarters I think there may be a billion or so He spent much of the day fielding calls from some of the several hundred people who could show up in his hearing room Monday Lets see Ive talked to Reliant to Dynergy once Mirant Im going to talk to Dynergy again this afternoon And Ive talked to the governors

know what hes getting into ahead of time He makes a habit of talking to everyone individually Mondays is the kind of deal Wagner likes best Rather than a formal trial where he wears the robe pounds the gavel and renders a decision after both sides make their cases settlement conferences give him a chance to wheel a nd deal First thing Ill make an opening statement of some kind give em a pep talk Wagner said And if we have any big wheels there Ill let them say a thing or two After the introductions hell start to work through the issues Hell take one guy aside he said then maybe two Then maybe a group And little by little he hopes to bring them together By all accounts this case could be more difficult than any he has handled This has got more dollars Wagner said Thursday Wagner asked Californias Independent System Operator and the pow er sellers for information that can help him sort out the complicated issues He wants the ISO to calculate what wholesale electricity prices wold have been had the price caps FERC ordered Monday been in effect in the fall of And he wants the power companies to tell him how much power they have to se ll short and long term And as if his task wasnt difficult enough FERC has asked Wagner to make this deal in days Its pretty tight he said but it can be done Stephen Angle a Washington lawyer who represents power producers and utilities ran FERCs trial section for years The California case is on e of the most difficult hes seen But hes not counting Wagner out I have learned that its unwise to assume he wont be successful Angle said The

Californias energy crisis Last December he got the parties together to try to break the logjam over the longterm contracting issue But just as he was getting a head of steam on that says Wood the Clinton administration yanked the deal away from Wagner and tried to broker it themselves I know hes too much of a gentleman to say it But that was a missed opportunity Now hell be reuniting some of the same parties that were together six mont hs ago Because of Wagners longevity on the bench almost every lawyer or energy executive who is likely to be in the hearing Monday will have had some dealings with him Hell be very clear He will not mince words said former FERC Chairman James Hoecker He will make his impatience with any dawdling very very obvious to everyone Davis seeks billion refund The governor tells a Senate panel that power operators bilked our state June By DENA BUNIS and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register WASHINGTON Gov Gray Davis told anyone here who would listen Wednesday th at overcharges from what he calls greedy power generators have now risen to billion billion more than earlier reported And he wants that money back The governor said if the meetings federal regulators have ordered next week to try and hammer out the differences between power companies utilities an d the state do not end with that kind of money in Californias pocket hell be back They must be required to give us back our money Davis told the Senate Government Affairs Committee during two hours of testimony and questioning It was the first time Californias chief executive has testified on the states crisis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The billion is the amount Californias Independent System Operator says generators overcharged utilities and the state from May to May of this year It had initially calculated that between May and February there were billion in overcharges Davis said Those figures are a far cry from the million that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say s were overcharges Thats because FERC only looked at three months of rates and only when the state was in an energy alert The governor faced tough pointed questioning from Republican members and glowing praise and sympathy for his states plight from Democratic colleagues Everything from refunds to longterm contracts will be on the table at next weeks settlement meeting FERC has given the parties until July to make a deal If they cant the administrative judge overseeing the talks will make a recommendation to FERC which can order the paybacks Sen Barbara Boxer introduced a bill Wednesday to require refunds if FERC doesnt act Not surprisingly generators dont see the refund issue the governors way Its just crazy said Tom Williams a spokesman at Duke Energy I dont know how theyre coming up with these numbers And theres skepticism about next weeks talks The negotiations are going to be like the SALT Treaty said Gary Ackerman president of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents power suppliers I question whether it can happen and work out Also at issue is money generators say they are owed by the utilities Davis said thats about billion But power companies say its more like billion to billion Whatever the figure Davis said we want to see their money in our pockets before we talk about working anything out on their end The settlement conference was part of FERCs order instituting aroundtheclock price caps for California and its Western neighbors Those price caps were made possible experts agree because California lawmakers from both sides of the aisle riled up the public enough over the issue that the Bush administration felt the heat The question is whether that can work with refunds Pressure could come from a number of places said Charles Cook a nonpartisan political analyst who has followed Californias crisis It cou ld come from Republican members from the state from party donors in Californi a who President George W Bush is going to have to go back to and then may be from his economic advisers who say that California cant be allowed to go belly up Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said new FERC Commissioner Patri ck Wood a confidant of Bush has been receptive to their refund pleas That w as the case Wednesday when Wood expected to be named FERC chairman sometime this year told members of the Senate panel that refunds may be an important tool in the regulatory toolbox If were to be a vigilant market cop we need to make sure that our bite matches our bark Wood and the other new commissioner Nora Mead Brownell will meet with Dav is in Sacramento on Monday RELATED STORY Energy notebook Energy notebook Blackouts are still a hot prospect officials warn June By the Associated Press BERKELEY Experts at the University of California Energy Institute say residents statewide should not be comforted by the fact that widespread blackouts have been avoided recently I would say this is not a great sign that were going to skate by later th is summer said Severen Borenstein a UC Berkeley economist who heads the institute It doesnt look like the system right now can handle a blazing hot day If its real hot in Northern and Southern California were going to have blackouts Greg Fishman a spokesman for the California Independent System Operator which controls the states electricity grid said ISO preferred to look on the bright side Does the fact that were meeting electricity demand today mean were out o f the woods No but is the fact that were meeting demand today good Sure i t is Fishman said Air conditioners are the single biggest factor in summer electricity demand If thermostats on air conditioners were turned to degrees

thing said Suzanne Strassburger of Escondidos Downto wn Business Association Douglas Heller a consumer advocate with the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights called the deal a cruel joke on the

transmissionlines business SACRAMENTO Through an alliance with a littleknown startup company General Electric Co is trying to enter Californias transmission lines business Although TransElect a yearold company based in Washington has no experience in the transmission business it has the financial support of GE s billion financial arm GE Capital TransElects latest offer comes as Gov Gray Davis seeks legislative approval for his plan to buy the transmission lines of both San Diego Gas Electric and Southern California Edison Any involvement by GE in the states transmission grid could be a conflict of interest said a lawmaker involved in the efforts to end Californias power crisis Youve got someone with generation and transmission systems how do they keep them separate and do they said Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek Thats a concern for me Would they have the ability to restrict competitors access to transmissions Bob Mitchell TransElects vice president said the company made its offer believing that the Legislature wont approve the deals to buy the two utilities lines GE joined forces with TransElect on March when GE Capital Services Structured Finances Group Inc

averted Wednesday as power reserves remained above percent Track the states blackout warnings on the Web at wwwcaisocomSystemStatushtml In rolling blackouts together is all relative June I have a confession to make Im an N And as an N I cant help feeli ng a little guilty I feel guilty that I wont be called upon to share the pain of all those As in Irvine and Laguna Woods or the Ms in Costa Mesa and Cypress While the Ms in Fountain Valley suffer and sweat through rolling blackouts Ill be sitting pretty Because Im an N And the dirty little secret about rolling power blackouts is how many of us are out there Allow me to explain As you may have heard Southern California Edison has been required to set up a public notification system for rolling blackouts If you hear on the news that the power guys are expecting rolling blackouts you can go to a Web si te wwwscecom or call a tollfree phone number to see if you r rotating outage group is on the list for going temporarily dark How do you know which group youre in On your Edison power bill next to your account number theres a code that starts with A or M A A M M and so on Thats your outage group number But wait Theres another category of outage group If your power bill has the code number N on it it means that youre exempt from rolling blackouts You see under Public Utilities Commission rules electric power customers who provide essential public health safety and security services such as fire and police stations hospitals jails and so on are automatically exempt from rolling blackouts even if they have emergency generators on site And because of the way electric power service is set up anybody who s on the same circuit with an essential service provider is also exempt from rolling blackouts For example my house shares a circuit with a fire station So Im an exemp t N as are the other power customers on the same circuit But heres the kicker According to an Edison spokesman percent of all Edison customers are Ns that is they share circuits with essential service providers and thus are currently exempt from rolling blackouts Let me repeat that Half of all Edison customers are exempt from rolling blackouts For San Diego Gas Electric customers its percent Mind you this isnt something Edison likes to publicize When I asked abou t it for a column three months ago Edison said it didnt know how many power customers are automatically exempt And when the company unveiled its blackout warning plan this week neither the Edison press release nor news reports mentioned the percent exemption figure True even exempt power customers can be affected by rolling blackouts at work at the store at a traffic light Still the next time you hear some power company or government official say Were all in this together dont believe it When it comes to rolling blackouts the truth is that only half of us are really all in this togethe r And even an N can see that isnt fair

Three former San Diego Gas Electric Co employees who worked at a Duke Energy plant said Thursday that the generator destroyed working parts withheld power supply or otherwise took actions that they believe drove up the price of electricity State officials said the whistleblowers comments at a state Senate hearin g today could provide the most damaging illustration yet that power generator s held down production to inflate prices on the spot market Gov Gray Davis has long alleged that power companies have overcharged the state and utilities Jimmy Olkjer a former assistant control room operator at Dukes South Bay plant in San Diego said in a phone interview that during the states power shortages Duke cut supply Although Duke a Charlotte NCbased company owned the plant and it contracted with SDGE to operate the unit he said Rather than creating more power they were creating less Olkjer said I think there was manipulation of the market The California Public Utilities Commission and several state legislative committees continue to investigate price manipulation allegations and Attorney General Bill Lockyer has said he will take witnesses to a grand ju ry next month The generators have denied they manipulated the market We stand behind our maintenance practices and have done a good job keeping the power flowing Duke spokesman Tom Williams told the CBS television network But former mechanic Glenn Johnson said he saw generation units taken down for economics Ed Edwards also a mechanic said he was ordered to destroy pallets of working parts We were asked myself and other employees to disperse of perfectly good parts that were used to make repairs of systems and components Edwards said State Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana chairman of the marketmanipulation committee said his staff has been looking for employees or others with intimate knowledge of power plant operation to come forward and he promise d that others will testify at future hearings Its the first time that weve had evidence from directly within power plants in California that the ramping up and ramping down of power generati on was a response to price and not to demand Dunn said He said he would reach no conclusions until Duke and other generators testi fy next month but he added that the former employees testimony raises suspicions at first blush The Bees Kevin Yamamura can be reached at or Consumers cut their own power in protest By Silvina Martnez Bee Staff Writer Published June When the temperature hit degrees at pm Thursday Larry Lynch turned off the air conditioner unplugged the refrigerator pulled out the TV cord s and shut down all other appliances in the house Lynch a yearold newsletter publisher in Sacramento responded to the Roll Your Own Blackout Thursday and joined thousands throughout the state to protest energy policies and promote conservation by stopping the use of energy from pm But the data coming off the grid at the California Independent System Operator didnt show the effort During the first hour of the voluntary shutoff the demand for energy by PGE customers in Northern California was almost the same as at the same ti me Wednesday ISO officials said Protesters didnt expect significant changes on the grid I feel it will at least send a message that we dont have to depend on it energy said Jackie Bell a consultant at the Capitol joining the conservation drive from her apartment on Fulton Avenue Its just a symbolic act said Peter Lopez of Sacramento who decided to use the evening to meditate Maybe Ill just go outside stare at the star s and try to spot a few constellations in the night It was the longest day of the year and one of the hottest But those determined to advocate conservation didnt mind the sacrifice People are getting focused on the fact that we have power at our end sai d Joan Blades a spokeswoman for MoveOn a grassroots organization in the Ba y Area and one of hundreds of online groups passing along the call for the voluntary blackout An electrical engineer in Oakland started the Roll Your Own Blackout idea when he posted a note in a political chat room in April Then an artist in Los Angeles forwarded the email to a number of friends and from there it quickly spanned the globe By Thursday afternoon more than people had signed up at the MoveOn Web site to join the protest Blades said Many threw blackout parties In San Francisco the nonprofit group Global Exchange gathered hundreds around a big bonfire at Ocean Beach At his home in east Sacramento Lynch did fine without electricity for thre e hours He ate tuna salad for dinner watered the lawn and when it got dark he opened the windows and let some air in We should show that people are willing to shut the power off if the prices go too high he said ISO has not declared a power emergency since May We have seen a consistent conservation on a daytoday basis and its making the difference between blackouts and no blackouts ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said McCorkle encouraged initiatives like Roll Your Own Blackout People are conserving she said And we can only support this whole effort The Bees Silvina Martnez can be reached at or Davis consultants had contract with Edison The disclosures turn up the hea t on the governor for hiring the exClinton aides By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau Published June Two consultants hired to advise Gov Gray Davis on energy policy officially disclosed their contract with Southern California Edison on Thursday but Davis aides insisted it is not a conflict because Edison and the Governor s Office have the same goal Communications consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani have drawn intense criticism since they were hired last month to shape the Democratic governor s public response to the state energy crisis The former Clinton administration communication aides nicknamed the Masters of Disaster for their spin on the Whitewater travel office and fundraising controversies at the Clinton White House have come und er fire for receiving a sixmonth amonth contract more than the governor or anyone on his staff makes Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who is running for governor nex t year has called for an investigation into potential conflicts State Controller Kathleen Connell a Democrat has said she will not issue paychecks to the pair pending her own investigation The criticism mounted after the duos economic interest disclosure forms we re released late Thursday showing that each has received at least und er contract from Edison in the past year But Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean defended their credibility saying theres no conflict of interest because Lehane and Fabiani both disclosed that they had worked for Edison before they signed their contracts with the state Besides she added Edison and the governor are working toward the same goa l Both want the Legislature to adopt a memorandum of understanding a propose d agreement that would prevent Edison from going bankrupt by financing a sta te purchase of the utilitys transmission lines Its not a conflict because theres been full disclosure McLean said Edison and the Governors Office have the same goal passing the MOU Wer e working together at this point with Edison But opengovernment groups and Republican lawmakers bristled at the notion that disclosure negates any potential conflict Derek Cressman of the California Public Interest Research Group pointed to a section of state law that prohibits public officials from influencing decisions if it would have a material financial effect on a business enti ty that provided them or more within the last year You have two individuals on the government payroll who had previously been on the Edison payroll and its not clear to whom their loyalties are he said Just because theyve revealed it doesnt mean theres not a conflict there and that theyre not serving two masters On Thursday Jones said he is awaiting the results of the Fair Political Practices Commission investigation and agrees with Connells decision this week to withhold payment from the consultants This further calls into question the ethics of how these individuals were hired and contracts were let Jones said Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte believes theres no question that Lehan e and Fabiani are violating conflictofinterest laws and suggested that the two should be paid out of Davis campaign funds which had reached million by Jan Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga added that he would not vote for a state budge t as long as Lehane and Fabiani remain on the state payroll The state of California does not need to be paying political wordsmiths a month he said I just wish Davis were as frugal with the taxpayers money as he is with his campaign money The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at or State deal may ease blackout threat Canada to supply energy as summer demand rises By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO California may be able to avoid some of the blackouts predict ed for this summer thanks to a littleknown powerswapping agreement with a Canadian utility The arrangement is expected to give California electricity in July and Augu st from the hydroelectric generators of BC Hydro in British Columbia despite a serious drought in the Northwest California has sold surplus power in recent months to the governmentowned utility which is expected to return power to the state as heat drives up t he demand for electricity State deal may ease blackout threat Continuing coverage Californias Power Crisis Despite the energy crunch the state often finds itself with surplus power that can be sold or swapped For instance advance power purchases that provide energy at a better price may deliver more power than needed at any given time particularly during offpeak hours BC Hydros reservoirs and hydroelectric generators are a little like an electricity storage battery By importing California power BC Hydro has be en able to conserve water that can be released this summer to produce power fo r California As a result of the agreement and other factors state power buyers say they are in a stronger position going into the hot summer months than they had expected So far this week the state has managed to get through a heat wav e without so much as a Stage power alert We are in much better shape at this point than I imagined we would have be en as little as a month ago said Ray Hart head of the power purchasing unit in the state Department of Water Resources The North American Electric Reliability Council which last month predicted hours of rolling blackouts for California this summer has noticed a change in recent weeks We dont seem to have the crisis we were all expecting said Ellen Vancko a council spokeswoman But whether that is a shortterm or a longterm eve nt we dont think anyone knows yet Much of the credit for avoiding blackouts is given to unexpectedly high conservation by Californians and an increased supply of power Many generators that had been shut down for maintenance or lack of payment are n ow back on line But the hydroelectric power agreement had gone unnoticed until now Hart mentioned it during a Senate Energy Committee hearing this week But h e declined to reveal the amount of power banked with BC Hydro saying it coul d hurt the states competitive position in the market If I start talking specifics said Hart then I have to give out what I am doing every single day and I have no market position In the past California routinely sent power to a number of utilities in th e Pacific Northwest during the winter when residents there needed heat Northwest utilities returned power to California in the summer when air conditioning drove up demand Little was expected from the reciprocal arrangement this year because California was short of power last winter as electricity prices soared and drought has sharply lowered reservoirs in the Northwest But the agreement with BC Hydro will provide at least some power this summer The state was forced to begin buying power in January after its two largest utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric were unable to borrow because of a billion debt The rates that the utilitie s could charge their customers were frozen under a failed deregulation plan a s the cost of power on the wholesale market skyrocketed Hart said it took time to convince BC Hydro which has demanded cash for so me electricity that it could safely do business with California despite big debts owed to generators for power they supplied to the utilities We have only been able to do it for the last couple of months said Hart It took a long time to get them to do it because of credit issues A spokesman for BC Hydro said the utility engages in power swaps but does n ot release the name of the other parties or the terms of the agreements Our first priority is taking care of our own said Warren Cousins of BC Hydro We are still looking for opportunities to help out other entities when we can Hart said the state has another arrangement with the federal Bonneville Pow er Authority but again refused to provide details He said the state has sold surplus power to several buyers including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Information about state power purchases had been closely guarded until recently Gov Gray Davis pressured by lawsuits and a court ruling releas ed edited versions last week of longterm power contracts worth billion The Davis administration said it agreed to release contract information because power prices have dropped easing competitive pressures Exworker Duke manipulated market By Bill Ainsworth UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO A former operator at Duke Energys Chula Vista plant said he was told frequently by company officials during the past year to alter the plants output in a way that may have boosted electricity prices The operator Jimmy Olkjer said he was even ordered to cut power generatio n during energy emergencies when the state faced rolling blackouts because o f a scarce supply of electricity He said he believes reducing the electricity generation helped the company charge higher prices It looks like thats what they were doing Olkjer said in an interview He and another former plant employee said that during the past year the company regularly operated its leastefficient turbine possibly to justify higher prices The allegations which they plan to repeat today at a state Senate hearing investigating power generators provide the first insider evidence that Duk e Energy may have manipulated output at its South Bay plant to drive up price s Duke based in North Carolina leases the South Bay plant from the San Dieg o Unified Port District A March report by the Independent System Operator which manages California s electricity grid alleged that by withholding power Duke and four other owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollars in overcharges to California consumers Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy North America said that varying th e output of the generating units at the Chula Vista plant had nothing to do with trying to achieve higher prices He said the changes in output helped balance the states grid by dancing i n the market providing flexibility for grid managers by allowing the plan t to add or reduce power quickly Williams added that the aging South Bay plant produced as many megawatts la st year as it did in Olkjer served as a plant operator for years mostly when the plant was owned by San Diego Gas Electric Co After Duke took over the plant worke rs were guaranteed their jobs for two years In April when that period ended Duke laid off Olkjer and other workers Now he is retired During the two years Duke has managed the plant Olkjer said operators frequently got calls from officials with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in Salt Lake City telling them to adjust their production schedule Some employees at the plant monitored the hourly price of electricity poste d by the Independent System Operator and recognized a correlation he said We noticed that a lot of times when the price was down our megawatts wou ld go down he said If the price was up often the megawatts would go up Olkjer said he was never told why he was being ordered to turn the plants output up and down When he asked he said company officials told him it w as none of his business Still he was puzzled particularly when he was told to throttle down the plant during electricity emergency alerts as he says he did Jan when the state declared a Stage alert with the possibility of rolling blackouts It doesnt make sense to cycle up and down when theres a Stage alert he said Duke spokesman Williams said the company may turn down units at the orders of the ISO during a Stage alert because the grid manager can find cheaper power somewhere else Lisa Szot spokeswoman at the ISO said she couldnt determine whether the ISO had ordered Duke to power down its Chula Vista plant Jan Olkjer said the frequent adjustments of power production which sometimes occurred every halfhour wear out the plants equipment Its harder on the machinery he said Its like driving down the street putting your foot on the gas and then slamming on the brake Before deregulation Olkjer said the four units at Chula Vista which have the capacity to produce megawatts had been operated steadily during mu ch of their history S David Freeman formerly general manager of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and now chief energy adviser to Gov Gray Davis said rapid cycling had become more common under deregulation and is hard on equipment We had almost megawatts of generating capacity down for repair last winter said Freeman referring to what industry experts agreed was an extraordinary level of plant outages over several months SDGE which built the Chula Vista plant in the s sold it to the Port District for million In the port leased the plant to Duke Energy for years in what critics are now calling a sweetheart deal The company pays minimal rent but has made large profits In the first quarter of this year Duke which owns three other plants in California sa id profits rose percent to million from energy sales and trading Duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for electricity It asked per megawatthour this year By comparison before the energy crisis began electricity sold for around per megawatthour an amount which powers about homes Federal regulators have ordered the company to refund million to the state for charging excessive prices unless the company can justify them In May the company offered to pay the state to settle any price gouging investigations but Gov Gray Davis declined Olkjer and Ed Edwards Jr who worked at the plant for years before bein g laid off in April said they couldnt understand why Duke ran the inefficient highcost turbine unit during the past year while other generators sat idle They said they believed it may have been an attempt to fetch a higher price for electricity because the company got extra fees when it ran Williams the Duke spokesman said the opposite was true He said Duke ran the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive It ran on jet fuel which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the other units Edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destroyed It ran so frequently and so hard it needed extensive repairs he said Edwards told CBS News last night that plant outages at Chula Vista were prolonged because one supervisor ordered him to dump spare parts The former power plant employees said they felt compelled to come forward because they saw the impact the power crisis was having on their community It kind of irritated me because you know theres people on a fixed income that cant afford a big utility bill said Olkjer Staff writer Craig D Rose contributed to this story Estimates of Power Profits Disputed Electricity A study of overcharges by suppliers may be flawed state officials say Davis quoted the figures to Congress By DOUG SMITH ROBERT J LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL Times Staff Writers Gov Gray Davis contention that California has been nicked for billio ns of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study that state officials concede may have significant flaws according to interviews and confidential government documents Those costsestimated by the state to be as high as billionwere central to Davis testimony this week before a US Senate committee where he again denounced power wholesalers and urged federal regulators to give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us The governors impassioned demand however was based on shaky calculations The formulas are being reworked said Charles Robinson vice president of Californias grid operator which prepared the study Robinson said he had no idea how much the amount allegedly overcharg ed by the generators might change For now he said the agency stands by the numbers But internal documents from the California Independent System Operator warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quantify the alleged excess profits could be well off the mark Whats more the documents caution against relying on the agencys stu dy as a basis for allegations of overchargingas Davis did during his testimo ny Wednesday That warning was particularly important because the documents provide for the first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy supplier prospered from the states power troubles between last summer and February The largest amounts were charged by four outofstate power companies according to the confidential CalISO report Okalhomabased Williams Cos led the group with million followed by Duke Energy with million Southern Company Energy Marketing now Mirant with million and Relian t Energy Services with million When told of the alleged profiteering attributed to them executives o f the companies insisted the numbers were grossly overstated because of CalISOs poor methodology Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his companys entire energy earnings for North America were less than the amount it was accused of reaping unfairly in California It doesnt add up It doesnt come close to adding up Williams said What CalISO has done is highly irresponsible math Paula HallCollins a Williams Cos spokeswoman said the firm would need to study the ISO report further But generally she said such reports fail to fully account for electricity production costs We maintain that we have not overcharged and that we have operated legally Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley also questioned the figures saying Theres a lot of misinformation out of there A Mirant spokesman said We haven t overcharged We havent manipulated We havent withheld Even some firms alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree we re outraged Joe Ronan vice president for government and regulatory relations at Calpine said the million attributed to his company doesnt bear any relation to reality Anybody can throw out any number he said Its like McCarthyism Where is the evidence A spokeswoman for Davis conceded that his refund figure was an estimat e but defended it as reasonable Its no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute an estimate of how much theyre gouging us senior advisor Nancy McFadden sai d Despite the cautions expressed in the CalISO documents officials Thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to the agencys figures as potential overcharges The way it should be characterized is the amount paid above a competitive benchmark said Robinson who is also CalISOs general counse l The first version of the nowdisputed CalISO study was made public in March It estimated that power sellers earned billion in excess profit s between May and last February The report later revised upward to billion became a crucial element of the Davis Administrations campaign against alleged electricity price gougers This week just before Davis appearance in Congress the study was updated again adding another billions in alleged excess profits throu gh May The orginal study which did not include actual pricing data was most ly intended to prod federal regulators into seeking information from generator s that the state had been denied Robinson said Thus far the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered refunds of only million Next week FERC is convening an unusual settlement conference aimed at addressing the outstanding claims by the state as well as those of sellers who claim they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars by California utilities One encouraging signal for state officials came this week when FERC reiterated an earlier order that Duke Energy pay millions in refunds The order stemmed from the companys sale of electricity at a megawatt hourfor thousands of hours FERCs order said Dukes pricing had resulted in million in billings A fair price for that power would have been per megawatt hou r the agency said Tom Williams a Duke spokesman said the firm is willing to accept the lower price He said he company has yet to collect a dime Times staff writers Elizabeth Shogren and Dan Morain contributed to th is story Edison Plans Bond Offer at Rate Debt Yield is about double what a creditworthy company would pay analyst s say But will investors bite By JERRY HIRSCH Times Staff Writer Edison International is offering investors what analysts are calling a n unprecedented interest rate for billion in notes to refinance debt Even so its far from certain that the Rosemeadbased power company will find enough buyers to complete the deal A failure by Edison to refinance million in bank debt that comes due June and an additional million in notes due in July could put t he company precariously close to bankruptcy and cast a shadow on Californias plan to sell billion in bonds to pay for power purchases said Dan Scotto a bond analyst at PNB Paribas in New York Even though it would at first appear to be a company setback it woul d really be a major setback for the state said Scotto who added that Edisons credit troubles could translate into higher prices for California s proposed bond offering Edison however said Thursday that the deal is moving forward We believe our deal is going well and we are comfortable with it said Jo Ann Goddard vice president for investor relations She declined to discuss other details of the offering Goldman Sachs Group Edisons investment bank expects to formally pri ce the offering Monday Edison officials would not comment on the proposed pri ce of the note offering but Wall Street sources said the power company was shopping the issue at the rate Edison floated the plan earlier this month as a way to tap the borrowi ng power of a profitable subsidiary to trim debt that comes due this year and to insulate itself from a possible bankruptcy of its ailing utility unit The utility Southern California Edison has lost billions of dollars on electricity sales over the last year The high interest rate on Edisons proposed sale of sevenyear notes i s about double what a creditworthy company would pay for a similar bond or note issue and would add a premium amounting to tens of millions of dollars in annual interest costs to the companys already strapped financial condition analysts said Its a full two percentage points higher than the average rate for other junk or speculative bonds And corporate bonds wit h similar ratings are going out at to Edison originally started marketing the issue at a full two percentage points higher than what analysts initially expected but then raised the rate to in recent days because it was finding few takers on Wall Street The word is that they couldnt get people interested and that they might not be able to get it done said Kurt Stabel a money manager at Street Asset Management in Newport Beach The higher rate however might be pulling investors out of the woodwo rk and has increased the chance that Edison will pull off the deal Scotto sai d This never promised to be a day at the beach Scotto said I think it is really a question of find the right price the price at which people fee l comfortable with the risk Both Stabel and Scotto said that Edisons note offering is unusually complicated and requires far more explaining or selling than typical corporate offerings Mission Energy Holding Co a company created by Edison for the sole purpose of issuing these bonds will offer the notes The assets of Edison Mission Energy a subsidiary that owns a network of power plants across the United States and in Asia Australia and New Zealand will secure the debt Mission Energy Holding plans to issue the proceeds to Edison in the fo rm of dividends giving the parent company funds to pay off a substantial portion of its debt The notes will have a credit rating of BBminus and come due in according to bond rating agency Standard Poors Thats slightly higher than the neardefault CC rating now carried by Edison If the offering failed Edison would face a series of difficult choice s that range from depleting its cash cushion to going back to its bankers and begging for continued forbearance Its SCE subsidiary already has defaulted on million in bonds and notes That triggered a default in bank lines of credit at Edison International and SCE which has since operated under extensions from its lenders Edison has about billion in cash including billion held by SCE according to regulatory documents This could all still unravel but I have been impressed with Edison s effort to inch along so far said Ellen Lapson an analyst at Fitch Inc a corporate credit rating service Who would have thought that they could ha ve lasted so many months after their first default in January and still not be in bankruptcy Positive developments for Edison including a deal to hold small generators at bay with partial payments from SCE and progress at crafting a rescue plan in both the state Legislature and the Public Utilities Commissi on have sparked a small rally in the companys stock Edison shares have risen this month They gained cents Thursday to close at on the New York Stock Exchange Energy Company Abandons Plans for Baldwin Hills Plant Power Homeowners and environmentalists rejoice at decision The site is proposed as a acre state park By JOE MOZINGO Times Staff Writer In a victory for environmentalists and nearby homeowners an energy company announced Thursday that it was abandoning its plan to build a power plant on the site of a proposed state park in the Baldwin Hills La Jolla Energy Development Inc in a letter to the state Energy Commission said it was withdrawing its application for fasttrack approval of the megawatt plant and will not pursue the Baldwin facility in the future We listened to the community La Jolla President Steve Wilburn said in an interview Thursday We need to find another place for this equipment The project was to be a joint venture between La Jolla and Stocker Resources an oil company that leases the land where the trailersized naturalgas plant would sit Stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether they will pursue the project At this point its just La Jolla pulling out Stocker spokesman Steve Rusch said But most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the fasttrack schedule the state has implemented to relieve the energy crisis The state commission was scheduled to decide whether to approve the project today in Sacramento but the hearing has been canceled The news sparked elation among environmentalists and nearby homeowners who had fought the proposal on grounds that it would pollute neighborhoods and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together acres of public open space in the hills Were getting ready to have the biggest party said Tony Nicholas president of the hills United Homeowners Assn This shows how a community can come together for a common goal and mobilize the people in a matter of days About of the residents in the hills are African American and many saw the issue as a matter of environmental justice In addition Stocker and La Jolla were seeking approval for the plant within days of filing their application under the governors emergency power orders By following this fasttracked procedure they would have bee n able to avoid the normal timeconsuming environmental review process That angered opponents even further and nearly people showed up at a public hearing Monday to fight the project But what officials said turned the tide against the projectat a time when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possiblewa s testimony from a South Coast Air Quality Management official who said his agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly Executive Director Barry Wallerstein said his agency would have to conduct hearings that would take up to days pushing construction well beyond a Sept deadline set by the governor for fasttrack projects He also said it was unlikely Stocker could get needed exemptions from federal clean air laws In a letter to the Energy Commission this week Wallerstein wrote It appears that the Baldwin Energy Facility could not begin operation until so me time in the first part of at the earliest By Wednesday night the energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statemen t recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a plant citing Wallersteins concerns Conservationists embraced the outcome as a sign that the movement to create a park was gaining steam The Baldwin Hills Conservancy was created last year with the idea of creating green space for the densely populated neighborhoods of south Los Angeles With support from the governor and loca l politicians the state recently bought a acre parcel in the area for an unprecedented million This is a great day for the Baldwin Hills and all the people who have worked so hard to bring this worldclass vision to reality said Esther Feldman president of Community Conservancy International and the main organizer to build the park Also applauding La Jollas decision were state Sen Kevin Murray DCulver City and Assemblyman Herb Wesson DCulver City who had come o ut strongly against the project They and others questioned whether the small amount of power provided by the facilitycoming online after the dog days of summerwould do much to relieve the energy crisis Im ecstatic Wesson said At this point the environment has won The plant would have sat on what is a working oil field about feet from the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area And according to park proponents it would lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy on what would be a halfmile bridge of land arching over La Cienega Boulevard Rusch the spokesman for Stocker said much of the information circulating about the trailersized plant is false The plan did not call for a stack with billowing smoke he said If the issue is air quality weve cleaned air quality up In the last decade Rusch said the companys existing oil pumps on the property have reduc ed nitrogen oxide emissions from tons to tons a year The power plantwith two foot stackswould ultimately add about tons a year He said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing it s own power to pump oil while also contributing an extra megawatts to the state grid during the energy crisis Residents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve the energy problem Said Mary Ann Green president of the Blair Hills Homeowners Assn We just hope that Stocker would be responsive to the outcry from the community Western states could feel pinch from California pricing KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer Friday June Associated Press URL cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchiven ation alEDTDTLtypeDnews PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP When power supplies stretch thin across the West this summer who will deci de whether Silicon Valley computers Washington apple orchards or Las Vegas casinos get first dibs on whats left Its a key question raised by the decision of federal energy regulators thi s week to cap electricity prices throughout the West using a formula based o n Californias power costs Economists energy industry executives and officials in all states are beginning to analyze the fit of this new piece in the energy puzzle Though most call the order a good step that could prevent price gouging others worry the pricing system could lead to electricity shortages for Californias neighbors or prompt utilities to stock up on power contracts to fend off shortages That could diminish any leverage power buyers might hav e as they compete for the remaining megawatts available each day Tying the highest possible power price to California could cause a problem come winter when power demand drops in the Golden State said Gary Ackerma n director of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents most sellers of energy States where consumers need electricity to heat furnaces through the winter would be unable to outbid each other above the price cap which is usually determined by a formula based on the highest bid for lastminute power duri ng the most recent energy supply emergency in California That may leave power wholesalers and not a free market to decide who gets the energy Certainly California has a tremendous pull on our prices and has for probably the last year said Claudia Rapkoch spokeswoman for Montana Powe r Co which supplies natural gas and electricity to twothirds of the Big Sk y state What it means for this winter were just going to have to wait and see California utilities had much more control over power supplies before deregulation in obligated them to sell off their power plants to encourage competition This brought lower prices for a time but gave contr ol over power supplies to wholesalers that arent obligated by state law to serve the serve the best interests of local customers Rather than appointing one power grid manager to decide how to divide power in the West Ackerman predicts utilities in nonderegulated states will simply sell their power within their borders That would hurt California which this week imported about percent of its electricity and its remaining supply from local plants owned by outofstate power companies Price cap or not utilities in the region will watch out for each other as best they can because they might need the favor returned said Charles Reinhold executive consultant for Electric Resources Strategies in Ariz Saddled with rising bills that threatened to exhaust the states budget California recently began to sign longterm contracts with generators Gov Gray Davis credits the change for helping to drastically reduce prices on t he spot market which earlier this month fell below per megawatt hour for the first time in a year The longterm contracts though werent cheap California will pay an average of per megawatt

Energy Inc to avoid refunding millions of dollars to California for charging exorbitant electricity prices in January and February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission first ordered the refunds on March and Duke responded by filing a challenge But the commission on Monday rejected the companys appeal and reiterated its earlier order claiming Du ke had abused its power in the California energy market when it sold power for per megawatt hour We will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding or behavior the commission said Duke acknowledged this month that it had charged per megawatt for about megawatt hours sold to the states major utilities in January a nd February netting it more than million in receivables The commission did not specify how much money Duke should refund but it directed the company to readjust its January billings for those hours to a price of From a FERC document it appears that about hours occurred in January which would result in a total refund for that month of million Duke is one of the companies that have been identified by both the Californ ia Independent System Operator the manager of the states electricity grid a nd the FERC as having exercised market power and overcharged Californians for electricity Meanwhile employees at the South Bay power plant in San Diego run by Duke are expected to testify in a state Senate committee

There was a reason Gov Gray Davis donned a dark blue jacket and endured beastly humid degree heat this week in an area behind the Capitol known as the House swamp The nation was watching And after months of political free fall his messa ge seemed to be taking hold California has been bilked out of billion while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was asleep at the switch Davis declared repeating testimony he had delivered hours earlier in the airconditioned confines of a Senate hearing room Wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as television cameras and two dozen reporters recorded the scene the California governor apparently couldnt resist taking another shot For nearly a year Ive been pounding on this commission to enforce the law The states energy crisis with its volatile spot markets outofstate generators and dearth of alternative energy providers is a dizzyingly complex policy puzzle The politics are much simpler Democrats present themselves as consumer crusaders defending helpless utility customers from greedy energy conglomerates and misguided regulators Republicans portray themselves as stewards of the free market and longterm solutions rejecting price caps and refunds as heavyhanded overreactions with Sovietstyle results The Democratic populism seems to be winning the battle Though the debate i s far from settled the consumeroriented approach to Californias energy woe s has raised their hopes of winning back the House of Representatives in and the White House in Republicans are scared out of their minds about this said one gleeful Democrat on Capitol Hill who suggested that the White Houses lackadaisica l response to Californias problems would rile consumers from coast to coast This could rival Pete Wilsons alienation of Latinos said the Democrat referring to the former Republican governors strident stand against illega l immigrants which many blame for the partys weak standing in California A sign of the GOPs concern surfaced this week with television ads finance d by anonymous sources but produced by Republican Party strategists that bla me the Democratic governor for Californias energy problems Democrats who long have worried that the crisis could cost Davis a second term now take credit for having pressured the White House and federal regulators to take a more active role The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which had previously resisted suc h efforts took steps toward controlling wholesale electricity prices Monday Later in the week two commissioners appointed by President Bush testified that they might be open to further price restrictions and support huge refunds to California And just yesterday Vice President Dick Cheney who has been among Californias most vocal critics told Senate Democrats behin d closed doors that he could support refunds to California if federal regulators agreed according to those in the meeting There is no doubt in my mind that action taken by federal regulators was the direct result of pressure for price relief led primarily by the California delegation Davis said The pressure did not come only from Democrats Republican lawmakers some o f whom fear the crisis could cost them seats in wrote FERC last week requesting commissioners to take further actions to help the state The Democrats public relations success follows an effort by the party to raise the profile of its consumer crusade Hardly a day has passed in the past several weeks without a group of Democrats holding a news conference t o attack the White House the Republican controlled House or FERC for inactio n But it may have just as much to do with a White House that has been far mor e focused on longterm energy production than the immediate concerns of Californians Even as it engaged in a legitimate policy dispute over how to solve the power mess the Bush administration appeared indifferent to the plight of residents experiencing skyrocketing energy bills and rolling blackouts Bush tried to correct that impression with a trip to the state last month But the damage appears to have extended beyond California A CBS NewsNew York Times poll released this week of adults from acro ss the country showed that only one in three voters approved of the job Bush w as doing on energy More than half the respondents said that protecting the environment was a higher priority than producing energy yet barely one in said that Bush shared that priority Some Republicans say that Bush was in a nowin position contending that anything he did would have been attacked by Californias opportunistic governor Politics is Davis main objective and I dont see the Bush administrati on being that way said Rep George Radanovich RFresno The question for some analysts is whether Democrats might have been too successful By pressuring the federal government to take a more active role Democrats may lose their ability to point the finger at a convenient scapegoat Davis has always needed rate caps much less than he needed a scapegoat No w that FERC has given him what he wants or close enough to it its a lot harder for him to lay blame back on Washington when the blackouts kick in said

The document could be vital to how legislators vote on the billion de al to buy Southern California Edisons power lines said Terry Francke genera l counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition which filed the lawsu it in Alameda County Superior Court The power line deal was brokered by the governor to help the cashstrapped utility Legislators must approve the power grid purchase by Aug or the utility can back out Davis also has a billion agreement to purchase San Diego G as and Electrics power grid which also would require the Legislatures approval Pacific Gas and Electric has not agreed to sell its transmission lines The power lines report was completed in April by California Electric and Magnetic Fields Program an agency set up by the state Department of Health Services to study the issue Francke said Both state agencies and their directors are named in the lawsuit Efforts to keep the report secret are suspect Francke said If its known theres some danger do you want the state owning that liability he asked The study began in after the state Public Utilities Commission committ ed million for research and education on the subject Francke said The state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and electric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies based on those findings he said The report was scheduled to be released to the public on May but at the last minute the Public Utilities Commission apparently instructed the staf f of the EMF Program to keep the reports secret the lawsuit said State health services spokeswoman Lea Brooks said that the report was only a draft and that her department was following orders from the PUC The PUC wanted to see the draft before it is released she said We prepared the report for them We are following their request Brooks refused comment on the lawsuit saying her office hadnt seen it PU C officials were not available for comment Studies on the effects of magnetic fields have resulted in no clear consens us on their effects Francke said Thats what makes the state study important for legislators to consider before voting on the governors deal to buy transmission lines he

of popularity on Wall Street While all eyes have been on Enrons enormous profits here and its enormous pull in Washington DC the reputed titan of the newly incarnated free wheeling power industry has lost half its market capitalization more tha n billion since its peak in August Forgive Californians for savoring a bit of schadenfreude over the Houston boys reversal of fortunes But what gives Isnt this the company that was fattening up on the backs of the states beleaguered utilities residents a nd state budget Isnt this the company with such close ties to the Bush administration that Kenneth Lay Enrons chairman was reported to have interviewed a candidate for a job on the commission that regulates his company Yup That Enron On Monday Enron shares hit a week low of after the Federal Ener gy Regulatory Commission decided to apply the same price controls to power marketers such as Enron that had applied to powergenerating companies for months Thats a far cry from August when the companys shares peaked at Theres a whole kaleidoscope of issues that Enron is being challenged with in the marketplace right now none of which on the surface is a major deal said Donato J Eassey an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities in Houston But when you combine them all I think whats happening here is you have a crescendo with this FERC announcement You have people saying OK the growth rate is now in question That growth rate was an eyepopping percent in revenues for the Unite d States on a twoyear average and nearly percent in the rest of the worl d Enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews but as the sto ck continued to drop Tuesday morning chief executive Jeff Skilling issued a statement to the markets in which he reiterated strong confidence in its earnings guidance The stock rebounded slightly throughout the week closin g at yesterday In a speech at the Commonwealth Club last night Skilling blamed regulatory interference with the free market for investor flight from his company Our stock prices have gotten hammered he said Theyre half what they were a year ago Tumbling stock prices werent the only bad news for Skilling last night A protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began speaking As Skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face a woman was arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges Enron isnt the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with Californias power crisis and are now suddenly headed south Shares of Reliant Energy Inc AES Inc and Williams Companies Inc which generate a nd sell electricity in California and El Paso Energy Corp which sells natur al gas here are all trading near week lows The main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in Washington abou t power price controls reregulation and now the possibility of big refunds being ordered for California Even Calpine Corp of San Jose which has developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played th e spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics dropped nearl y percent yesterday to But none of the companies has been hit as hard as Enron Such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any company It leaves it less money to invest in its own growth and because executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price a sharp decline makes it more difficult to retain talented leaders While Enrons power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine the firm h as been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other regio ns in recent months In the financial press the continuing knock on Enron is that its business lines are so new and complex and the company is so secretive about its operations that analysts and fund managers dont feel confident in their understanding of what it does A look at the firms recent troubles exemplifies its diversity For instance Enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state governme nt of Maharashtra in India over a megawatt power plant there The Dahbol Power Co which is percent controlled by Enron stopped construction on a second phase of the project on Sunday claiming it is owed million by t he Maharashtra State Electricity Board The state has accused Enron of chargin g too much and not generating enough and stopped buying power from the plant last month Closer to home Enron has struggled with its investments in fiberoptic bandwidth The company buys and sells unused highspeed bandwidth space treating it like a commodity as it does electricity coal or natural gas B ut the fiberoptic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear that for all the longdistance cable laid in the ground there have not bee n enough last mile connections set up for users to actually take advantage of it Earlier this year Enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with Blockbuster to offer what it called video on demand in which customers a t home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it transmitted via fiberoptic cables Then there was the FERC ruling For months the agency had resisted aggressive price controls in the West preferring to let the market run its course But as control of the US Senate was handed to Democrats this mont h and President Bush appointed a tough Texan regulator named Patrick Wood III to the commission the agency changed its tune It expanded price controls to all hours of the day spread the controls throughout the Western region and brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent So under current calculations that means Enron could sell power for no mor e than per megawatt in a shortage and about during normal hours f ar short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly charging during the past year In part the companys gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of the businesses Enron has decided to pursue And the hardcharging company h as a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets But sometime s that approach gets it in trouble as was the case last year when Enron had to take a million charge for its failed investment in Azurix a global water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply the same way it had done for electricity service as governments privatized their water systems The opportunities never materialized Add it all together and Enron has a tough time supporting a priceearnings ratio of nearly considerably above the liberal standard of health whic h is The company had less than billion in profits on more than billion in revenues last year Still a survey by Thomson FinancialFirst Call found that analysts expect Enron to deliver earnings of cents per share in the second quarter up from cents last year and per sha re on the year Most maintain a strong buy rating on the stock But investors with big positions in Enron have taken a hit Hardestput of them will be the Janus funds which as Enrons largest mutual fund investo r held nearly billion of its stock as of the end of April In a semiannual report to investors John Schreiber a portfolio manager said the stock price of the newage energy merchant was a victim of negative psychology resulting from the California energy crisis Janus declined to make fund managers available for interviews

Former employees say Duke Energy slowed production of electricity to create an artificial shortage boost profits BY DION NISSENBAUM Mercury News Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO One of the largest companies producing power in California ordered workers to throw out spare parts and shut down equipment in an effo rt to drive up the price of electricity former power plant workers said Thursday Speaking out on the eve of appearances at a state Senate hearing the three men offered the strongest evidence yet that at least one power producer Duke Energy sought to make more money by creating an artificial shortage that may have created huge electricity price spikes Their intent in my opinion was to boost the price up said Glenn Johnson a mechanic who worked for two decades at the Chula Vista power pla nt now run by Duke If Ive got the only box of penicillin in town and your e sick I can charge a million dollars a box he said If you want to liv e youre going to have to pay Officials at Duke angrily challenged the accusations calling them irresponsible charges by disgruntled workers who were let go in April Their allegations are just comical just highly erroneous said Tom Williams a spokesman for Duke which runs four plants in California that produce enough energy for nearly million homes The charges come as the state heads into negotiations next week with generators over the billion the state claims its consumers have been overcharged Duke based in Charlotte NC came under considerable criticism when it disclosed that it charged the state a record a megawatthour for power in January Federal officials have called the charg e unreasonable and ordered Duke to refund California the money The employees who first made their allegations public on CBS Evening News Thursday night will be the only witnesses today at an energy crisis hearing headed by lawmakers who suspect that power companies have been illegally gouging California State Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove chairman of a committee investigating price gouging said the allegations raise serious concerns While we stil l need to hear the other side of the story from Duke if theres any truth to the information I believe it would be devastating to the generators he said Perfectly good parts In interviews with the Mercury News Thursday night the three former plant workers said that they were directed to scale back energy production and throw out good spare parts that kept the plant from getting up to full powe r for weeks Ed Edwards who worked in the Southern California plant said that he was told to get rid of many boxes of good spare parts Edwards said he tossed more than pallets of parts into a dumpster I dont know why they were throwing away perfectly good parts he said It didnt make sense Johnson said the lack of onsite parts prevented workers from quickly fixin g problems that reduced the amount of power the plant could produce Sometime s he said it took weeks to get parts Johnsons suspicions of gouging were echoed by Jimmey Olkjer who spent years in the plant and worked as an assistant control operator Even at times when California regulators were warning residents the state might not be able to find enough energy to prevent imminent blackouts Olkj er said he was directed to scale back the amount of electricity the plant was producing In hindsight it looks to me like they were manipulating the power Olkjer said Duke called the allegations baseless and said the workers didnt understand the reasons for the actions Continued accusations repetitive investigations and inflammatory rhetoric concerning the companys operation s in the state are distracting attention from the true issue of solving Californias energy crisis Duke said in a statement Williams did not directly dispute the workers allegations But he said the y did not understand the reasons behind the decisions State directives Duke cut back on the amount of power it was producing in response to directives from state regulators at the Independent System Operator which runs the power grid Williams said They did not know that the ISO was instructing them to go up and down to meet supply and demand he said An ISO spokeswoman said that the grid manager sometimes asks generators to produce more or less power to adjust traffic on the transmission system or respond to the states electricity needs Some companies bid power into the reserve market which means these plants run only when the extra energy is tapped ISO officials say they are prohibited from discussing individual bids As for the spare parts Williams said they were eliminated as unnecessary after Duke bought the plants from San Diego Gas Electric Williams said Duke has one of the best performance records in the state wi th its power plants offline for unscheduled maintenance only about percen t of the time All three workers were given severance packages and let go in April But Edwards disputed any contention that they were trying to get back at Duke Im not a disgruntled employee he said Im just telling the truth o f what I saw the last two years I worked there No matter what the reasons were for the decisions Duke has made huge profi ts during the California energy crisis And those profits apparently created good cheer among Duke executives At one party Johnson said executives gleefully celebrated their good fortune Were making more money than we ever thought possible Johnson quoted t he plants manager as saying Mercury News staff writer John Woolfolk contributed to this report Contact Dion Nissenbaum at or Enron chief Gov Davis not to blame for energy crisis BY KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO AP California Gov Gray Davis isnt to blame for Californias power crisis and neither are electricity wholesalers a Texas energy executive told a crowd at the Commonwealth Club of California Jeffrey Skilling CEO and president of Houstonbased Enron Corp wiped awa y the remnants of a pie hurled by a protester Thursday and placed the blame squarely on Californias energy regulators The state Public Utilities Commission in the early s put together a broken market by preventing utilities to pass along the full cost of power and discouraging power contracts that would have lowered dependence on buyi ng lastminute power Skilling said Because of these rules the power consumers of the state of California we re thrown totally to the mercy of the spot market Skilling said PUC president Loretta Lynch defended the regulators actions last week saying utilities have been free to enter into longterm contracts Utilitie s countered that the PUC never made clear what contracts it would accept whi ch left open the possibility they would later be overruled I think consumers in California are angry and they should be Skilling said Prices in California shouldnt be as high as they are Skilling also Congratulated Davis for Californias unprecedented conservation Denied accusations that Enron chairman Kenneth Lay personally interviewed candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees interstate energy markets Told the audience to expect a report that would show California municipal utilities have profited the most selling power to the state Said price caps ordered by FERC earlier this week would likely damage the markets and would only exacerbate the problem Acknowledged that municipal utilities in the state have managed to provid e cheaper power to their customers and even profit from the power crisis by selling off extra power despite public control Enron has come under fire after accusations from Davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply Enron denies such claims and joins other power producers in arguing that t he state and utilities still owe them billions in unpaid bills Davis acknowledges that Pacific Gas Electric Co which has declared bankruptcy and Southern California Edison together still owe generators such as Enron Duke Energy Mirant and Reliant Energy about billion for past electricity sales Our success is linked to efficient markets not higher prices in Californ ia or anywhere else Skilling said Protesters gathered outside the building wearing pig masks and carrying handmade signs one of which read Greed is the only power crisis Its basically Enron and the other companies raising prices said Berna rd Greening a Santa Clara computer programmer who said hes unhappy with the record prices for electricity and natural gas Pete Snoek of Tiburon said he believed what Skilling had to say I believe the energy situation has been politicized so badly Snoek sai d saying he was one of several in the audience to shush protesters during the meeting I hear the same people out there as if its a sin to make any money in this country State officials counter that wholesalers charged as much as billion in illegal overcharges dating back to May Companies have said Californias claims are wildly exaggerated The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already estimated that wholesalers owe California million in overcharges for the first four months of the year Davis and others say thats a mere drop in the bucket Enron has also been tied to President Bushs handsoff approach to the ener gy crisis Company chairman Kenneth Lay is a friend and one of the largest campaign contributors to Bush and the GOP Several prominent members of the Bush administration hold stock in the company Enron is one of several major GOP donors accused of meeting secretly with Vice President Dick Cheney as he drafted the Bush administrations energy plan Enron is one of the worlds leading electricity natural gas and communications companies with

center and Jimmy Olkjer are to appear before a state Senate committee today Photo Dave Yoder The Register Three former Duke Energy workers say they were ordered to tamper with equipment at a San Diego County power plant causing mechanical problems that helped drive up electricity prices during the states energy crisis The workers say they will offer eyewitness testimony to a state Senate committee today the first public accounts from power plant employees of h ow energy production may have been manipulated Duke officials deny most of the allegations The whistleblowers mechanic s Ed Edwards and Glenn Johnson and control room operator Jimmy Olkjer lost their jobs four months ago State Sen Joe Dunn the Santa Ana Democrat who is chairing the investigati ve committee on pricefixing said his staff will attempt to verify the accoun ts from the whistleblowers But their mere presence in a Capitol hearing room is expected to set off a media circus And if the accusations are true it could have wideranging effects on the North Carolina companys operations in California Duke officials were working late into the night to prepare for the hearing and have scheduled a news conference later today They were doing all kinds of things that didnt make sense Johnson said in an interview But if you asked them why to explain they told you to shut up and do your job The testimony comes on the heels of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruling Thursday ordering Duke to refund million in overcharges for January This information lends credence to the concern that there was a deliberate strategy for outages for the sole purpose of impacting price Dunn said What they are saying is disturbing Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said the fact that the former workers lo st their jobs may be shaping their testimony The proof is in the pudding Production is up and weve had fewer forced outages since weve taken over said Williams But controlroom logs obtained by The Orange County Register show Dukes trading arm ordered its South Bay power plant in Chula Vista to reduce production minutes after Stage Three alerts were issued The logs are for January the same month that Duke was accused of overcharging in California The three former Duke workers each worked at the Chula Vista plant for more than two decades when it was owned by San Diego Gas Electric They lost their jobs when Duke assembled a new team to run the plant The three whistleblowers outlined their accusations in interviews with the Register The accusations include The company ordered workers to throw unopened boxes of bolts steam seals valves and other parts into Dumpsters The parts were needed to perform routine maintenance but were no longer available when repairs were required Duke officials acknowledge that new parts were discarded but say the high inventory tax made it more efficient to order parts as needed because they could be delivered within hours Edwards and Johnson say they were ordered to dismantle critical equipment necessary for the generating units to run at full capacity Because parts were thrown away they couldnt make repairs and generators ran at diminish ed capacity for days or weeks Energy experts say this allegation if true would allow Duke to withhold energy from the marketplace which could drive up the price Duke officials counter that production has increased at its power plants and forced outages have decreased since they took over But in late there was a spike in outages at the Chula Vista plant according to records kept by the states powergrid operator The plant reported hours of outages from October through December There were relatively few outages before that The mechanics say the inability to perform repairs forced them to use a small expensive generator that was rarely powered up before Duke took over the plant Experts say that could have been used to exploit federal rules allowing generators to justify prices based on the costliest units online Olkjer says he received orders from Dukes trading arm to reduce production Then when energy prices jumped he would get new instructions to power up again Duke officials did not respond to Olkjers claim Stanford professor Frank Wolak an expert in Californias energy market sa id that if their testimony can be proven the state could be refunded millions of dollars and future energy prices could be dramatically reduced What they are saying is amazing This is a classic plot Ive always wondered how they kept the generators out for so long said Wolak who heads an electricity market surveillance for the California agency that oversees the buying and selling of power They were very happy to have the m offline because it allowed them to make more money Wolak said the testimony seems to back up research conducted by the state Independent System Operator which runs most of the states power grid and oversees the buying and selling of electricity in California In a report to federal regulators ISO said that from May to November Duke withheld electricity from the states power grid percent of the tim e The report accused more than a dozen power plant companies of powering down generators to create scarcity in the marketplace that would in turn drive u p prices In a separate report the state power grid operator accused Duke of overcharging California again in January of this year resulting in the million refund order Duke officials say charging a megawatthour wa s justified during a short period of time Federal regulators disagreed and said the power merchant should have charged no more than per megawatthour Williams Dukes spokesman said that the company has been an ethical operator All but percent of the time we were operating Thats very good sa id Williams adding that when SDGE owned the plant forced outages took place percent of the time But Dunn said that if the testimony from the whistleblowers is true and Duke had the ability to manipulate prices federal regulators would be required under the Federal Power Act to move them out of the competitive marketplace This would mean they would be moved back into a costbased market structu re and would only be

Mondays megaconference arent dealing straight with each other watch out Hes kind of like President Reagan a bigpicture guy says Patrick Wood the newest federal energy commissioner whos known Wagner for years He can tell a story that always fits the situation But cross him and h e can slice you up like a VegOMatic The yearold Tennessee lawyer has been the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions chief judge for years His years of government service includes being a lawyer with the military and Justice Department And beginning Monday hell have Californias electricity crisis in his hands All the players from the state to utilities to power generators will be in one room trying to settle who owes whom money and how much The state wants billion in refunds from generators they say charged too much for electricity The generators want billions from the utilities and t he state that they say didnt pay the bill for other power they bought And Californias ratepayers just want to keep the lights on I dont think theres billion Wagner said Thursday from his office at FERC headquarters I think there may be a billion or so He spent much of the day fielding calls from some of the several hundred people who could show up in his hearing room Monday Lets see Ive talked to Reliant to Dynergy once Mirant Im going to talk to Dynergy again this afternoon And Ive talked to the governors office and Ive talked to some FERC folks to someone from Oregon and some municipalities in California Oh and Ive talked to the fellow who is goin g to represent the city of Los Angeles Wagner likes to know what hes getting into ahead of time He makes a habit of talking to everyone individually Mondays is the kind of deal Wagner likes best Rather than a formal trial where he wears the robe pounds the gavel and renders a decision after both sides make their cases settlement conferences give him a chance to wheel a nd deal First thing Ill make an opening statement of some kind give em a pep talk Wagner said And if we have any big wheels there Ill let them say a thing or two After the introductions hell start to work through the issues Hell take one guy aside he said then maybe two Then maybe a group And little by little he hopes to bring them together By all accounts this case could be more difficult than any he has handled This has got more dollars Wagner said Thursday Wagner asked Californias Independent System Operator and the pow er sellers for information that can help him sort out the complicated issues He wants the ISO to calculate what wholesale electricity prices wold have been had the price caps FERC ordered Monday been in effect in the fall of And he wants the power companies to tell him how much power they have to se ll short and long term And as if his task wasnt difficult enough FERC has asked Wagner to make this deal in days Its pretty tight he said but it can be done Stephen Angle a Washington lawyer who represents power producers and utilities ran FERCs trial section for years The California case is on e of the most difficult hes seen But hes not counting Wagner out I have learned that its unwise to assume he wont be successful Angle said The odds that Wagner will get a deal Fiftyfifty This is not the only highprofile case thats taking up the chiefs time these days Hes presiding over a FERC inquiry into whether El Paso Energy Corp a large natural gas pipeline owner is overcharging California Wagner has a history of taking impossible cases Angle says he recently worked with the judge on a dispute in the Midwest That was a case where few people thought would be successful Angle said It had been on FERCs docket for years Wagner got the people talking and emerged with a settlement And Monday wont be Wagners first effort at solving Californias energy crisis Last December he got the parties together to try to break the logjam over the longterm contracting issue But just as he was getting a head of steam on that says Wood the Clinton administration yanked the deal away from Wagner and tried to broker it themselves I know hes too much of a gentleman to say it But that was a missed opportunity Now hell be reuniting some of the same parties that were together six mont hs ago Because of Wagners longevity on the bench almost every lawyer or energy executive who is likely to be in the hearing Monday will have had some dealings with him Hell be very clear He will not mince words said former FERC Chairman James Hoecker He will make his impatience with any dawdling very very obvious to everyone Davis seeks billion refund The governor tells a Senate panel that power operators bilked our state June By DENA BUNIS and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register WASHINGTON Gov Gray Davis told anyone here who would listen Wednesday th at overcharges from what he calls greedy power generators have now risen to billion billion more than earlier reported And he wants that money back The governor said if the meetings federal regulators have ordered next week to try and hammer out the differences between power companies utilities an d the state do not end with that kind of money in Californias pocket hell be back They must be required to give us back our money Davis told the Senate Government Affairs Committee during two hours of testimony and questioning It was the first time Californias chief executive has testified on the states crisis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The billion is the amount Californias Independent System Operator says generators overcharged utilities and the state from May to May of this year It had initially calculated that between May and February there were billion in overcharges Davis said Those figures are a far cry from the million that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say s were overcharges Thats because FERC only looked at three months of rates and only when the state was in an energy alert The governor faced tough pointed questioning from Republican members and glowing praise and sympathy for his states plight from Democratic colleagues Everything from refunds to longterm contracts will be on the table at next weeks settlement meeting FERC has given the parties until July to make a deal If they cant the administrative judge overseeing the talks will make a recommendation to FERC which can order the paybacks Sen Barbara Boxer introduced a bill Wednesday to require refunds if FERC doesnt act Not surprisingly generators dont see the refund issue the governors way Its just crazy said Tom Williams a spokesman at Duke Energy I dont know how theyre coming up with these numbers And theres skepticism about next weeks talks The negotiations are going to be like the SALT Treaty said Gary Ackerman president of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents power suppliers I question whether it can happen and work out Also at issue is money generators say they are owed by the utilities Davis said thats about billion But power companies say its more like billion to billion Whatever the figure Davis said we want to see their money in our pockets before we talk about working anything out on their end The settlement conference was part of FERCs order instituting aroundtheclock price caps for California and its Western neighbors Those price caps were made possible experts agree because California lawmakers from both sides of the aisle riled up the public enough over the issue that the Bush administration felt the heat The question is whether that can work with refunds Pressure could come from a number of places said Charles Cook a nonpartisan political analyst who has followed Californias crisis It cou ld come from Republican members from the state from party donors in Californi a who President George W Bush is going to have to go back to and then may be from his economic advisers who say that California cant be allowed to go belly up Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said new FERC Commissioner Patri ck Wood a confidant of Bush has been receptive to their refund pleas That w as the case Wednesday when Wood expected to be named FERC chairman sometime this year told members of the Senate panel that refunds may be an important tool in the regulatory toolbox If were to be a vigilant market cop we need to make sure that our bite

a conflict of interest said a lawmaker involved in the efforts to end Californias power crisis Youve got someone with generation and transmission systems how do they keep them separate and do they said Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek Thats a concern for me Would they have the ability to restrict competitors access to transmissions Bob Mitchell TransElects vice president said the company

averted Wednesday as power reserves remained above percent Track the states blackout warnings on the Web at wwwcaisocomSystemStatushtml In rolling blackouts together is all relative June I have a confession to make Im an N And as an N I cant help feeli ng a little guilty I feel guilty that I wont be called upon to share the pain of all those As in Irvine and Laguna Woods or the Ms in Costa Mesa and Cypress While the Ms in Fountain Valley suffer and sweat through rolling blackouts Ill be sitting pretty Because Im an N And the dirty little secret about rolling power blackouts is how many of us are out there Allow me to explain As you may have heard Southern California Edison has been required to set up a public notification system for rolling blackouts If you hear on the news that the power guys are expecting rolling blackouts you can go to a Web si te wwwscecom or call a tollfree phone number to see if you r rotating outage group is on the list for going temporarily dark How do you know which group youre in On your Edison power bill next to your account number theres a code that starts with A or M A A M M and so on Thats your outage group number But wait Theres another category of outage group If your power bill has the code number N on it it means that youre exempt from rolling blackouts You see under Public Utilities Commission rules electric power customers who provide essential public health safety and security services such as fire and police stations hospitals jails and so on are automatically exempt from rolling blackouts even if they have emergency generators on site And because of the way electric power service is set up anybody who s on the same circuit with an essential service provider is also exempt from rolling blackouts For example my house shares a circuit with a fire station So Im an exemp t N as are the other power customers on the same circuit But heres the kicker According to an Edison spokesman percent of all Edison customers are Ns that is they share circuits with essential service providers and thus are currently exempt from rolling blackouts Let me repeat that Half of all Edison customers are exempt from rolling blackouts For San Diego Gas Electric customers its percent Mind you this isnt something Edison likes to publicize When I asked abou t it for a column three months ago Edison said it didnt know how many power customers are automatically exempt And when the company unveiled its blackout warning plan this week neither the Edison press release nor news reports mentioned the percent exemption figure True even exempt power customers can be affected by rolling blackouts at work at the store at a traffic light Still the next time you hear some power company or government official say Were all in this together dont believe it When it comes to rolling blackouts the truth is that only half of us are really all in this togethe r And even an N can see that isnt fair

three hours next week on the day of the summer solstice Flocks of anonymous emails have been swooping across the Internet for week s promoting the handrolled voluntary blackout aimed at fostering conservation It is a phenomenon that points out just how deeply energy issues have worme d into the national consciousness as well as how much the Internet has becom e the worlds water cooler and its bulletin board The messages urge people everywhere to turn out their lights and unplug wha t they can from to pm Thursday creating a dip in energy use that woul d roll across time zones part protest and part party Talk to your kids Watch the stars come out Cuddle Pretend the TVs broken Think what can happen when tens of thousands join this peaceful protest against pricegouging and environmental irresponsibility exhorts a Web page devoted to the idea Marilyn Nyborg of Grass Valley says shes thinking about flipping a circuit breaker to cut off all power to her house Thursday night but at the very least her lights and television will be off Its beautiful outside now Its nice to sit on the porch As it gets dark er I dont mind using a flashlight to read and spend some time with my partner and our new kitties she said Nyborg a hightech recruiter who calls herself a quiet activist sai d shell be taking part to demonstrate that people can come together to conserve I take great offense at President Bushs comment that its our right as Americans to waste fuel I dont think it is Were also stewards of the planet she said David Aragon a Berkeley engineer who says he coined the phrase Roll Your Own Blackout online for a similar protest said the idea had its roots in politics but is nonpartisan He said he just learned this week that Los Angeles artist Monica Rex was th e one who expanded his notion scheduled it for the first day of summer and sent it out into the world Rex said she emailed a few paragraphs to about friends in midApril and posted them on a handful of Web sites to make people aware that they have t he power over how energy is used She thought so little of it at the time that she didnt keep a copy I didnt know it would get anywhere actually she said But it took off By midMay multiple copies were landing in email boxes of nearly everyone with environmental or energy interests An organic farming public relations firm publicized it further saying millions of people had been alerted Newspapers from Seattle to Denver began writing about the anonymous upswelling Web pages sprang up dedicated to it Everyone I know has seen it This has swept the globe said Jeff Softley a West Hollywood bartender and longtime environmentalist who has tried for mo re than a decade to promote the idea of an Energy Fast on Earth Day Softley who knows a little about stirring up community action was so stru ck by how quickly the message moved that he speculated a big environmental gro up was probably behind it trying to appear grassroots I just think it caught peoples imagination said Rex I am just amazed at how things move around the Internet She theorizes that her name was stripped off early in the forwarding process making it appear anonymous wh en she had no particular interest in either hiding from the idea or in promoti ng it It really doesnt take much to bring a single idea to millions of people said David Goff a University of Southern Mississippi professor who coedit ed the book Understanding the Web When you get it in the hands of likeminded people it doesnt take long f or that multiplier effect to operate and it will go very far very fast he said Email and Webdriven protests have triggered fuel boycotts in Great Brita in and Internet boycotts in France Goff said and were in the early stages of this The whimsical blackout message circulated in several versions calls o n people turn off what they can then light a candle to the sun god kiss an d tell make love tell ghost stories do something instead of watching television have fun in the dark Many versions say the voluntary blackout a simple protest and a symboli c act is being held to protest Bushs disdain for conservation energy efficiency and alternative fuels Some variants direct people to books on alternative energy and energy efficiency Some say the candle should burn for the sun goddess Some add a gentle caution to unplug only what can be safely dispensed with Michael Straus of Point Reyes said he plans to take part by having a candlelight dinner with his parents Straus whose Beyond Organic PR firm helped tout the idea said he put the message out over a public interest an d academic news wire after it kept landing in his mailbox The message has zinged from state to state and reportedly reached Europe an d Asia It has hit email lists devoted to everything from feminism to usedbook sellers A Texas newspaper credited it to a river protection grou p called American Rivers something the flattered but bemused organization denied Millions of people would have to be involved for their efforts to show up o n the computers of the California Independent System Operator in Folsom whic h constantly monitors electricity use to match demand with supply If million households turned off a single watt light bulb at once megawatts would drop off the states electric grid probably not noticeab le amid or so megawatts of early evening demand said Jim Detmers an I SO vice president But to megawatts of reduced demand might be detectable under the right conditions if sudden changes in wind or temperatures or cloud cover dont obscure the effect he

Carrie Peyton can be reached at or New pacts could ease blackouts Edison crafts fiveyear deals to help relieve the fiscal burden on its alternative energy suppliers By Jim Sanders Bee Capitol Bureau Published June In a move that could help ease blackouts this summer Southern Califo rnia Edison has negotiated fiveyear deals designed to relieve the financial burden on its alternative energy suppliers Gov Gray Davis hailed the pacts which state officials helped negoti ate as an important step toward stabilizing the energy market and ending litigatio n over about billion owed by Edison The move also could help taxpayers cutting up to million off th e states energy tab this year by reducing the amount of power needed from th e expensive spot market officials said The agreements apply specifically to Edisons suppliers however and do not resolve similar disputes involving Pacific Gas and Electric Co The pacts also add a new twist to an ongoing dispute over Davis bid to save Edison from bankruptcy by buying its transmission lines for billion a nd providing other financial incentives Davis warned at a press conference Wednesday that rates promised in t he pacts are tied to legislative approval of the rescue plan I believe given the changed circumstances that legislators will ta ke a different look at the plan he said Im not saying its a certainty b ut Im saying theres now renewed interest Senate President John Burton ridiculed the governors assertion and m ade it clear he wont be pressured There are an awful lot of questions here and I think it ill behoove s the governor who has not always moved with alacrity to say that the Legislatu re is dragging its hands on this issue Burton said Legislators currently are crafting one or more alternatives to the go vernors rescue plan which they say has little support in the Assembly or Senate Southern California Edison a massive private utility declined comme nt Wednesday on the QF qualified facilities agreements or the governor s rescue plan California taxpayers have spent billions of dollars since January buy ing power on behalf of Edison and another financially strapped private utility PGE One major problem for Edison has been the billion debt owed to f irms that generate alternative energy from wind geothermal solar biomass and gasfired cogeneration facilities As debts rose each week some QFs were forced to quit producing elect ricity thus exacerbating the energy crisis and forcing California to buy more powe r on the spot market Statewide most of the alternative energy providers though still fin ancially strapped have resumed production The new Edison pacts would add to megawatts of new electricit y by enticing suppliers to exceed existing contracts They would provide a mechanism for repaying Edisons debts to the alt ernative energy firms They also promise separate rates for electricity from renewab le sources and gasfired facilities Key parts of the deal include Rates for electricity produced by gasfired plants would vary based o n the cost of natural gas at the CaliforniaArizona border Edison would pay cents per kilowatthour plus a capacity charge for energy produced by wind solar and other renewable energy sources The firm would pay an estimated to cents per kilowatthour depen ding on natural gas costs for electricity produced by gasfired plants The pacts give Edison and the owners of gasfired cogeneration facili ties the ability to renegotiate if market conditions change dramatically The initial reaction from a number of firms has been favorable

Hebert ASSOCIATED PRESS June WASHINGTON Under growing political pressure federal regulators are preparing new but still limited price restrictions for electricity in California and other Western states according to government officials Congressional and private industry sources said the Federal Energy Re gulatory Commission is almost certain at a meeting next week to expand a price mitigation directive to cover all transactions in California and expand it to other states including the Pacific Northwest The limited price caps announced in April now apply only to Califor nia and only to periods when a supply emergency is in effect because power reserves have fallen below percent California Gov Gray Davis has called them inadequate and full of loopholes for power generators to skirt controls Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif told a Senate hearing it now appear s that the April order will be broadened She said it was another step forward b ut far short of the costbased price caps she and other congressional Democrat s have sought Several other sources speaking on condition of anonymity also said they expected the FERC to broaden the April order The commission chairman Curtis Hebert said price mitigation issues will be discussed at its Monday meeting The fivemember commission of three Republicans and two Democrats has come under attack from Democrats in Congress and from Davis They contend the agency has been far too timid in curtailing price gouging in the wholesale Western power markets The commission regulates wholesale electricity markets and interstate natural gas pipelines Under a law it is required to ensure prices are just a nd reasonable Hebert a Republican named as chairman by President Bush in January defended the agency at an energy forum Wednesday Our price mitigation plan is working said Hebert citing recent de clines in electricity and natural gas prices in California and elsewhere in the West Acknowledging the criticism he said of the FERC Were not the most popular people in town right now This week electricity prices on the spot market in California fell t o below a megawatthour for the first time this year Natural gas prices also eased Earlier year price have frequently surpassed a megawatt hour t en times what they were in precrisis A megawatt is enough electricity to serve about homes California officials have said it is too early to tell how the FERCs April order has affected prices The reason for the price drops is unclear Feinstein said She noted that Californias attorney general this week announced plans for a grand jury to consider criminal charges against some power generators and marketers Also Wednesday several economists told a Senate hearing that tempora ry price controls if structured properly should not impede electricity investments and supplies as Republican lawmakers and the administration repeatedly have argued It is incorrect that regulation necessarily interferes with supplies Cornell economist Alfred Kahn a prominent deregulation advocate told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee It was the Senates first hearing on Californias energy crisis since Democrats recently took power Kahn said that if price caps were temporary exempted new power plant s and provided sufficient profits there will be no shortage of people intereste d and willing to build new power plants The greatest danger is continued chaos said Paul Joskow an econom ist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology He too urged some price contro ls based on costs of production Sen Fred Thompson RTenn said the economists were painting a ro sy picture He read letters from several Wall Street analysts who insisted th at price controls would be a recipe for disaster and make investors reluctan t to enter the

break the price spiral that had driven electricity prices to record heights Critics said other factors played a larger role in what they warned is a temporary price drop and said Davis foolishly locked in longterm rates at the markets peak The price the spot market on electricity is coming down because weve locked in longterm contracts Davis said This is Economics We were paying a lot more in

have to buy less than half the power it needs on the daily market making the generators compete for a smaller share of t he market and forcing prices down he said Davis said that will stabilize a wildly fluctuating market for the long ter m although the cost may exceed market costs in years to come The contracts along with new plants more conservation criminal and regulatory investigations into price gouging and possible price caps have combined to cut costs Davis said Saying there will be a day of accounting for price gougers Davis also sa id a pincer effort from Sacramento and Washington forced energy producers to lower prices Davis appeared Wednesday as a San Diego superior court judge ordered the state to release the contract details by noon Friday Several news organizations and Republican Assemblyman Tony Strickland RThousand Oaks sued Davis saying the contracts used state money and shou ld be open to the public For months Davis had refused to do so saying that would hurt the states negotiating position Earlier this week however he asked San Diego Superi or Court Judge Linda B Quinn to lift the confidentiality clauses in the contracts because the secrecy was no longer that important The contracts worth almost billion could keep longterm rates relatively high for years if the recent decline in prices remains in place Contract records obtained by the Los Angeles Times showed the state is committed to buying power at prices up to a megawatthour during peak demand periods and more than for power at times when demand is low By comparison the state recently bought peak power for less than an hour and less than an hour at night when demand is less Wholesale prices have dropped recently but they could rise this summer whe n temperatures and air conditioning use climb Energy analysts agreed with Davis that a convergence of factors led to lowe r prices not just the longterm contracts Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute called the prices in the states contracts disturbingly high compared to those available a few years ago but the state didnt have much choice In essence Borenstein said the contracts mean California now pays its hig h power bill on an installment plan in which generators agree to string out their profits over years instead of recouping them now But Peter Navarro an economist at the University of California Irvine sa id the Davis administration negotiated from a position of severe weakness Th ey generators had us over a barrel and they stuck it to us Davis Navarro said adopted a longterm strategy to fight a shortterm crisis The administration will look particularly foolish if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission acts next week to rein in higher power prices after months of refusing to intervene Navarro said This is a huge mistake thats been made by the state and whats being show n here is the depth of it said Assemblyman David Cogdill RModesto who supported Stricklands suit In effect we locked in an energy crisis for the next years said Harv ey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights He called fo r Attorney General Bill Lockyer to toss out any contracts he determines overcharge the state Davis energy adviser S David Freeman former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said the contracts altered the marketplace a nd freed the state from its nearly total reliance on the volatile spot market The war aint over Freeman said but we have landed on enemy territory and we are rolling them back Draft of blackout plan offers forecasts instead of warnings By Jennifer Coleman ASSOCIATED PRESS June SACRAMENTO In May Gov Gray Davis announced a plan to give California ns detailed warnings of rolling blackouts to help businesses and residents pla n for outages But a draft of the plan obtained by The Associated Press has changed the proposed onehour blackout warning to a probability forecast which one utility official called a vague warning thats wrong more often than its right The onehour notice is expected to be wrong twothirds of the time because the Independent System Operator will continue to look for power to keep the lights on said several people who participated in meetings to plan the blackout notifications Under Davis plan the ISO manager of the states power grid will also issue a hour rolling blackout forecast and the hour location notification Peter Navarro an economist with University of California Irvine who works on energy issues called the onehour blackout notice a very blunt instrument Its going to be like the typical California forecast sunny hot and dry with a chance of rolling blackouts Navarro said How do you prepare for that The Governors Office of Emergency Services coordinated the plan to impleme nt Davis order by consulting private and municipal utilities the ISO and the Public Utilities Commission The plan will be presented to Davis by Friday Even after the issuing the minute blackout notice the state will keep looking for lastminute power said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle Th e public knows the ISO doesnt have a crystal ball but it can provide information to help them make critical decisions A utility official who participated in the calls and who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the onehour blackout probability forecast doesnt come anywhere close to whats been promised to the public Instead of a real onehour notice of an outage that people can rely on and make plans for theyre just going to get another vague warning thats goin g to be wrong far more often than its right the executive said The utilities will make the biggest differences in handling blackouts said Steve Conroy a spokesman for Southern California Edison which participate d in one of the conference calls There is more advance notice from the utilities to our customers Conroy said Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Co have joined Pacific Gas and Electric Co in assigning customers a block number so they will know what neighborhood are next to be hit by a blackout The newest element thats required is to make geographic information available to the public It was already available to public safety offices said John Nelson spokesman for PGE Blackout forecasts Conroy said are very much like a weather forecast an d subject to change McCorkle said forecasts will also encourage power conservation and further lessen the chance of blackouts Eric Lamoureux an emergency services spokesman said the plan isnt intend ed to predict a blackout but give a sense of when theyre likely Utility customers dont need a guarantee just a warning that blackouts cou ld occur said Michael Shames executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network The objective here is to allow customers to prepare for the eventuality of blackouts he said The people will not rebel if the lights stay on What we do need is more than minutes notice Jennifer Ng the owner of Moonlight Cleaners in Elk Grove said shed welco me two days notice for blackout It took her more than a week to catch up on work that a couple hours of blackouts halted at the dry cleaners she said It affects businesses more than people think Ng said If I had more warning I would be able to stay late the night before or bring in more people To really give a true blackout warning Shames said the ISO must draw the line and stop shopping for electricity to keep the lights on Plus Shames added repeated false alarms could lose their effectiveness Thats why they shouldnt be issued cavalierly Shames and Navarro have called for a price ceiling for lastminute power bu ys and a willingness to suffer blackouts in prices dont come down The Legislature is now considering a bill to allow state power buyers to stop shopping for power California governor to release details of states power purchases By Alexa Haussler ASSOCIATED PRESS June SACRAMENTO Gov Gray Davis is close to releasing details of longte rm contracts between the state and power generators a move that would end a lengthy battle over whether the agreements should remain confidential Davis for months had refused to release information on the contracts but h is aides said Tuesday the disclosure was expected this week The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that confidential government recor ds show state officials agreed to contracts at prices higher than those now being paid in the daily spot market The contracts which total nearly billion could burden consumers with relatively high utility rates if the recent trend toward lower electricity and natural gas prices continues Records obtained by the Times show the state is committed to buying power a t prices up to a megawatthour during peak demand periods and more than for power at times when demand is low In comparison the state recentl y purchased peak power for less than an hour and less than an hour a t night when demand dropped The recent purchases reflect a drop in wholesale prices which could rise again this summer when temperatures climb and air conditioning use surges The theme here is the governor embarked on a longterm strategy for a shortterm crisis Peter Navarro an economist at University of California Irvine told the Times They pretty much got this exactly wrong State officials defended the longterm contracts crediting the agreements with altering the marketplace The contracts also have freed the state from its nearly total reliance on the volatile spot market This was all a well thoughtthrough plan of action said Davis energy adviser S David Freeman former head of the Los Angeles Department of Wate r and Power The war aint over But we have landed on enemy territory and w e are rolling them back Republican lawmakers and several news organizations including The Associat ed Press sued Davis in March saying his refusal to release the contracts details violated the California Public Records Act Still Davis refused saying that revealing the details would put the state at a competitive disadvantage in other contract talks Oklahomabased Williams Energy one of the generators with a state contract opposes the release of the contract details Information contained in those is proprietary information that allows us t o be competitive and to bid competitively said spokeswoman Paula HallCollins Raymond Hart Department of Water Resources deputy director wrote power generators Monday saying the department would ask a judge Wednesday to thro w out a confidentiality provision in the contracts Meanwhile the Times also reported Wednesday that executives and board directors from power companies gained millions of dollars through stock sal es last year State officials accuse them of profiteering from the energy crisis but som e executives netted upwards of million in option transactions in according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Stock prices for energy companies enjoyed robust growth last year Report Energy executives selling stock for millions ASSOCIATED PRESS June LOS ANGELES Executives and board directors from power companies that s tate officials accuse of profiteering from the energy crisis have gained million s of dollars through stock sales according to a newspaper report The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that these executives exercised options and sold stock for double triple and even times the level of prior years The newspaper based its findings on trading data supplied by First CallThomson Financial and federal regulatory findings Kenneth L Lay chairman of Enron netted million in option transactio ns in according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission The amount was triple his level and nearly times what he made in Lay also has made stock sales since November that have been worth nearly million Lay and other power company executives have shown a knack for timing their stock sales near the top of the market Many of the companies shares have fallen since the bulk of the stock sales the Times reported Critics claim corporate profits for the power companies have been driven up by the energy crisis in California and the West The crisis created a bull market for publicly traded power companies making the shares held by the executives particularly lucrative State officials were outraged but not surprised by the transactions It is part of a pattern of smart trading by these guys said state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey who chairs the Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee The mentality is to get everything that you can and then ride out the bust I think they are figuring that by this time next year the party will be ov er and they will be left sitting in a room with plastic cups halffilled with stale beer Bowen added The stock sales seemed logical to Loretta Lynch president of the Californi a Public Utilities Commission It stands to reason that if the companies are making exorbitant profits then the individuals who run the companies are also making exorbitant profits she said The power executives who sold stock dealt shares of the following companies Virginiabased AES Corp Duke Energy Corp of North Carolina the Houstonbased energy firms of Enron Corp and El Paso Corp and San Josebased Calpine Corp Jeffrey K Skilling CEO of Enron filed regulatory documents in May announcing his intention to sell shares of Enron stock for million Skilling in netted more than million in similar transactions Harvey Padewer president of Duke Energys Energy Services division sold Duke stock for million in February netting million State and federal agencies are investigating several large energy companies to determine if they conspired to boost prices either by limiting the construction of power plants or by manipulating the supply of natural gas needed to run power plants No one is claiming the stock trades were illegal but critics have linked t he transactions to the profits gained in California The generators have no shame said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov Gray Davis It speaks to how there has been a massive transfer of wealth from California and the West to Texas and the Southeast Lay and Enron officials declined to comment on stock trading by executives and a spokesman for AES also declined to comment on the matter A spokesman for Duke Energy said many of the sellers at Duke continue to ho ld large amounts of the companys stock and sold the their stock to capitalize on a healthy market Many of these people have a lot of stock and this is an opportuni ty to diversify their personal portfolios at an opportune time when Dukes sto ck is up said Terry Francisco a spokesman for Duke Energy News briefs on Californias power crisis ASSOCIATED PRESS June HUNTINGTON BEACH An energy company says a restriction prohibiting it f rom selling power generated at its California plants outofstate violates interstate commerce laws AES Corp filed a petition Monday with the California Energy Commission claiming the restriction should be withdrawn because it hinders the company s efforts to negotiate a contract with the state Department of Water Resource s which brokers power deals for the state AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said Tuesday that the two sides are close to an agreement and filing the petition was a backup if negotiations fail The Arlington Vabased company recently won approval from the states Energy Commission to restart two idle generators in Huntington Beach but were told it could only sell the megawatts produced at the Orange Count y plant to California utilities The yearold units which will reopen in August will generate percen t of the megawatts

June Talks to allow state ownership of the poles and wires that push electricity across San Diego County have dragged on in numbing detail for months But with the deal between Gov Gray Davis and Sempra Energy extremely close local politicians and a consumer advocate fear its price will inclu de hundreds of millions of dollars that had been headed for ratepayers pocket s San Diego city and county officials took the unusual step yesterday of criticizing regulators and the parent company of SDGE for excluding them from secret negotiations State must bare secret energy deals FERC appears set to expand its price curbs Davis announces deal to boost summer power supply Continuing coverage Californias Power Crisis Mayor Dick Murphy meanwhile dispatched a letter to the president of the California Public Utilities Commission pleading to be invited to the table I need your assurance that the city will be permitted to actively participate in the formation of any proposed settlement the San Diego may or wrote The ratepayers of San Diego city and county deserve no less At stake more than million paid to SDGE by its million customers over recent months Utility company executives claim the cash should go to shareholders while local elected officials consumer advocates and even state regulators say t he money belongs to customers The disputed windfall accumulated over several months as SDGE used longterm contracts to buy power at one price then sell the electricity to consumers at a much higher rate Customers were billed the larger of the two costs a practice SDGE parent Sempra Energy said was appropriate even though SDGE has insisted for month s that under deregulation it merely distributes power Shareholders deserve to make money on contracts that they took the risk for said company spokesman Ed Van Herik who was unable to specify how mu ch electricity is bought and sold under the agreements SDGE may still be benefiting from the longterm deals it reached with Louisville Gas and Electricand Pacificorp The agreements ran between and the end of this year according to San Diego City Attorney Casey Gwinn Because of the litigation he was allowed to review the contracts but is not permitted to disclose their value There is a fundamental fairness principle that is at issue here Gwinn said Earlier this year state regulators ruled that the value of the contracts should help pay down a socalled balancing account some million SDG E says it spent on power but hasnt been allowed to collect from customers Utility company lawyers appealed that ruling and the case remains locked in litigation But in an apparent policy reversal the PUC last week joined Sempra in aski ng the appeals court to delay considering the claim while the governors offic e deals for the network of SDGE power poles and transmission lines Gwinns office was served notice of that filing Tuesday The value of the longterm contracts has become a critical issue in those executivelevel discussions which San Diego area politicians say is unfair Its a slap in the face county Supervisor Dianne Jacob said They charg ed us more and now theyre making a big profit Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers Action Network said a closeddoor deal between Davis and Sempra could undermine the PUC ruling that the SDGE contracts are ratepayer assets The PUC will never hear it the city of San Diego and UCAN will never get a chance to argue it in court he said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor is carefully weighing the plight of San Diego consumers as he pushes ahead with negotiations to buy t he SDGE electric grid Were extremely close to an agreement with the utility and first and foremost in the governors mind are the interests of San Diego ratepayers he said The deal is going to be a balanced business transaction Acquiring the poles and wires that move power across the state is a key pie ce of the governors plan to resolve the electricity crisis in California Dav is struck a deal with Southern California Edison but Pacific Gas and Electric declared bankruptcy in April so those assets are in dispute Even though transmission lines make money for the three investorowned utilities critics worry that buying the electric grid may not be wise because the system is old and in need of more than billion in upgrades PUC attorney Gary Cohen said he sympathizes with the San Diego County elect ed officials who first brought the complaint over the SDGE contracts to his office But ending the power struggle in California is more important If theres a deal those contracts are just one part of it Cohen said I understand their frustration The contracts are up on appeal and they won But in fairness everybody needs to wait and see what the whole resolution will be Discussions include not only talk of a price for SDGE transmission lines likely around billion according to Shames but also whether the utili ty adequately hedged its power purchases against rising costs and the reasonableness of other buying practices Theres a bunch of issues on the table Cohen said Its difficult and conceivably impossible to settle cases where you have a whole bunch of parties if everybody is insisting theyre part of the negotiations State Sen Dede Alpert whose September legislation established the balancing account now in dispute said she doesnt care who receives publ ic accolades for steering the value of the SDGE contracts to ratepayers I certainly expect this needs to be something that benefits the people of San Diego the Coronado Democrat said But whether the credit goes to the city of San Diego the PUC or the governor I dont think matters Vallejo City Council votes to switch work hours to save power ASSOCIATED PRESS June VALLEJO In an effort to save an estimated in electricity costs City Council members unanimously voted to switch city hall workers to a fourday workweek The vote came Tuesday as a result of the citys

claiming momentum toward solving the electricity crisis announced an agreement yesterday to keep unpaid small generators on line this summer Davis said a pincers movement from Washington DC and Sacramento is telling energy pricegougers that the days of figuratively raping and pillaging California are over and there will be an accounting Attorney General Bill Lockyer announced that a criminal grand jury will beg in meeting in Sacramento early next month to investigate whether the states electricity and natural gas markets were manipulated and whether illegal profits were made Davis also said he was optimistic about getting legislative approval of som e variation of his longstalled plan to keep Southern California Edison out o f bankruptcy Im not saying its a certainty Davis said But I am saying there is no w a renewed interest in ratifying something like the memorandum of understanding that we have worked out with Edison Davis said the Legislature can change the proposal but the amendments must be acceptable to him and to Edison The Senate is planning to begin hearing s on the Edison plan in a few weeks The governor said pressure on electricity suppliers is coming from investigations longterm contracts that have lowered spot market prices an d increased energy conservation by Californians Davis said pressure in Washington is coming from congressional hearings and the possibility that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will order regional price limits or refunds for overcharges in California The governor also said three new power plants could begin operating in the next days an apparent reference to Calpines megawatt plant near Yu ba City and its megawatt plant at Pittsburg and a megawatt Mission EnergyTexaco plant in Kern County The small nonutility generators that operate as qualifying facilities under a federal program are capable of providing about a quarter of the pow er needed by the state In March blackouts during two days were said to have resulted in part fr om small generators who were not operating because they had not been paid Dav is announced an agreement yesterday between Edison and its QF contractors The Davis administration thinks the agreement could produce an additional to megawatts of power a megawatt is enough for to homes thi s summer because some generators had previously contracted to sell less power than they are capable of producing Richard Katz a former assemblyman from Van Nuys asked by Davis to negotiat e the agreement said the QF contractors will receive an average of about cents per kilowatthour during the fiveyear contracts Katz said generators who use renewable energy sources such as solar win d geothermal and biomass will be paid an average of about cents per kilowatthour He said that cogenerators who use natural gas and sell the excess heat to businesses will receive an average of cents to cents per kilowatthour The generators will receive percent of the money they are owed when the contracts are signed and the full debt eventually will be paid with interest Katz said the new rates for the small contractors are tied to legislative approval of the Edison rescue plan But Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton DSan Francisco disagreed saying action by the Public Utilities Commission yesterday implemented the agreement between Edison and the small contractors FERC appears set to expand its price curbs By Joe Cantlupe COPLEY NEWS SERVICE June WASHINGTON Facing mounting political pressure the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seems poised next week to greatly expand existing energy price restrictions that now kick in only during emergencies Hints of the move surfaced yesterday as a Senate committee started investigating FERCs response to the California power crisis The current order limits prices only when the states power reserves dip below percent the level at which a Stage alert is called Critics including Gov Gray Davis say that order is full of loopholes because any price can be charged when no emergency has been declared which is most of the time Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif told the Governmental Affairs Committee yesterday that it now appears that on Monday FERC may extend this order t o the entire Western energy market and may ensure that the order stays in pla ce at all times This sounds good on the face of it and it may well be added Feinstein However this situation is ripe for manipulation as I believe they have been doing she said of power generators in the state She said that FERC is essentially considering a flexible price cap that like the existing order sets the price on the cost of producing electricit y at the mostcostly leastefficient power plant FERC officials declined to discuss the agencys possible action next week or Feinsteins remarks FERCs previous price mitigation order went into effect May and some federal regulators say it caused wholesale electricity prices to plummet in California Megawatts that once cost an average of more than and sometimes several thousand dollars recently dropped to below during peak usage A megawatt powers about homes But some observers say that many factors are responsible for the sudden pri ce drop including cooler weather conservation and state longterm electricit y contracts At a meeting of the California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco yesterday Chairwoman Loretta Lynch said she is very encouraged that FERC is reconsidering its earlier decision but said the result would be absolutely inadequate because FERC would cap prices at a relatively high rate according to The Associated Press Yesterdays Washington hearing by the Governmental Affairs Committee was th e Democraticcontrolled Senates first foray into Californias emotionally charged power crisis and seemed a harbinger of intensified partisan wrangli ng to come Feinstein and Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif used the hearing to make pleas for immediate action on price caps and to complain about FERC Today we see no semblance of really meaningful regulation Feinstein sai d Committee Chairman Joseph Lieberman agreed The fact of the matter is that the California market is not even functional said Lieberman DConn I think its fair to say if the feder al government doesnt step in and provide temporary price relief the natural trend toward deregulation will come to a halt California officials have sought price caps to rein in what they term outrageous electricity costs charged by outofstate companies But the Bush administration has vehemently opposed caps saying they would discourage investment in new power plants In recent weeks however some key congressional Republicans have softened their position saying they would not oppose limited controls FERC itself heavily criticized by Davis and others as a donothing agenc y appears to be showing a new face with two new members appointed by Bush promising more aggressive monitoring of the power industry Feinstein and Rep Henry Waxman DLos Angeles have sponsored bills that would enact tougher price caps The legislation is expected to be debated later this month Sen Fred Thompson RTenn the ranking Republican on the committee oppos ed Boxer and Feinsteins calls for price caps and said that California officia ls were partly to blame for the states problems for acting too late State must bare secret energy deals Judge orders release of pacts with suppliers By Karen Kucher and Craig D Rose UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITERS June The states secret energy deals wont be secret much longer Even as some details about Californias longterm power contracts began to emerge a Superior Court judge yesterday ordered the almostfull release of the states agreements with power suppliers by noon tomorrow to attorneys representing news organizations and a dozen state lawmakers Judge Linda B Quinn also set a hearing for June to decide whether to order the state to release information about its costly spotmarket electricity purchases something the state only wants to do six months afte r the transactions are completed The news organizations and legislators filed suit under the Public Records Act seeking the contracts that bind the state to more than billion in power purchases over the next decade Revelations that California has contracted to pay as much as per megawatthour to Constellation Energy Group Inc quickly brought complaints that the state had overpaid for electricity The price of the commodity is now plunging The Los Angeles Times and at least one other newspaper which obtained som e of the longterm state contracts reported that power costs ranged to as lo w as and down to about when the state supplies fuel to generating plants By comparison spot prices yesterday for power were from to per megawatthour far below levels earlier this year when prices averaged more than for several months and reached a high of nearly Until last June prices rarely exceeded per megawatthour Deregulation advocates said prices would decline as the market was opened up Gov Gray Davis strategy in dealing with budgetbusting costs over the pas t year has been to sign longterm deals to avoid buying in daily markets Yesterday he said comparing contracted electricity costs to spot prices is unfair The price of spot market electricity is coming down because we have locked in longterm contracts Davis said We knew this going in The purpose of getting longterm contracts is to wean ourselves away from a spot market The governor referred to the oftencited criticism that Californias soarin g power prices were caused partly by an excessive dependence on buying power in daily markets as opposed to under longer contracts Severin Borenstein an expert in electrical deregulation from the Universit y of California Energy Institute agreed that comparing current spot prices with contract prices was unfair Speaking at a news conference yesterday hosted by the governors press secretary Borenstein said the deals should be analyzed in the context of conditions that existed as they were negotiated Spot prices during the first three months of this year for example averag ed about per megawatt hour But a prominent critic of deregulation said that neither buying strategy presented an acceptable option for consumers They gouge you with spot prices or they gouge with term contracts said Harvey Rosenfield president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica which is expected to lead a ballot initiative next year over deregulation We have to get out of this deregulation disaster Parts censored For months Davis refused to make public details about the contracts sayin g that revealing information about the deals would put the state at a disadvantage in contract negotiations The state became a major electricity buyer after the nearbankrupt utility companies were unable to make purchases on their own This week however Davis agreed to release the contracts with certain portions censored The governors change of heart came as the newspaper reports emerged and critics alleged that the state was overpaying A spokesman for Enron Corp said yesterday that the state had many opportunities to secure power at lower prices than it appears to have paid under the contracts Enron however declined to sell any power to the stat e under contract Outside of court yesterday Deputy Attorney General Tim Muscat said that th e state has secured enough contracts in the past month to feel comfortable releasing longterm contract details The state has signed contracts or agreements in principle that cover muc h of the states unmet electricity needs he said We have finally reached critical mass and now we think we can disclose the contracts and still protect the publics interest in getting the best deal and going forward with negotiating agreements Muscat said But he added that the state wants to keep private some technical contract information that could harm the states contract partners Media opposed You are going to be looking at a contract that has to percent of the content in it Muscat told reporters gathered outside Quinns San Diego courtroom The only thing that could be removed are some technical issues Alonzo Wickers an attorney representing the coalition of media organizations said he will oppose allowing the state to omit portions of t he contracts and will seek full information about spot market buys Wicker said that having complete access to the documents is essential to t he publics full understanding of the contracts Wickers is representing the Copley Press which publishes The San Diego UnionTribune the Los Angeles Times the San Jose Mercury News the San Francisco Chronicle Dow Jones the McClatchy newspapers The Orange County Register Bloomberg and The Associated Press Muscat had unsuccessfully sought days to provide the documents to plaintiffs He said the states business partners needed to have the opportunity to raise objections to releasing the information The contracts contain confidentiality clauses Among those seeking a delay in the judges ruling yesterday was an attorney representing Morgan Stanley a marketer in power transactions who said he had just learned of the litigation this week Once the contracts are publicly disclosed the eggs cannot be unscrambled said attorney Eric Landau who said his clients competitive position could be hurt by the release of information Staff writer Ed Mendel contributed to this report NEWS ANALYSIS Senate Democrats to Use Power to Illuminate Bush Energy Plan By RONALD BROWNSTEIN Times Political Writer WASHINGTONIt was a sign of things to come when Sen Joseph I Lieberman DConn bounded into the chairmans seat Wednesday to convene a hearing on electricity price controls in the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee With their sudden ascension into the Senate majority Democrats have regained control of one of Congress most effective weapons the power to summon witnesses to investigative hearings backed by the authority to subpoena documents And that could signal a major shift in the debate on a broad range of issuesenergy policy foremost among them Though the Democrats lack a coordinated strategy several committees plan hearings through the summer and fall that will shine a sustained spotlight on Bush administration energy policy decisions and the role of energy companies in rising gasoline and electricity prices Through these hearings the Democrats hope to reshape the climate of public opinion aroun d the energy debate pressure both federal regulatory agencies and private companies to change their behaviorand score some political points by painting President Bushs policies as a boon to the energy industry What this allows us to do is continue some of the unpleasant conversations that Bush is trying to avoid and that Bush could avoid in the more controlled atmosphere when Republicans held the Senate said one Democratic strategist That prospect presents obvious problems for Bush who already is battling the perception in opinion polls that he favors producers over consumers in the energy debate But these inquiries also carry dangers for Democrats who spent six years charging that congressional Republicans misused their investigative authority through repeated hearings into allege d ethical misdeeds by the Clinton administration The public doesnt want to see a party thats out for blood If they go down that path the public will turn off just like it turned off on the Republicans said John Podesta President Clintons White House chief of staff But what these investigations and oversight hearings can do is real ly help tell a story about whose side this White House is on and what th e impact is on real peoples lives Senate Republicans wasted no time denouncing the hearings as a waste o f time Let me tell you what the name of the game is now Its pure politics said Sen Frank H Murkowski RAlaska who chaired the Energy and Natural Resources panel until the Democratic takeover Asked about Wednesdays proceedings he replied Is that going to produce any more energy Conscious of both the opportunities and risks Democrats are moving cautiously to exercise their new clout Lieberman has not issued any subpoenas in his investigation into Californias power crisis and his firs t hearing Wednesday was a sedate affair that broke no new ground Still the authority to investigate has always been one of Congress most potent tools particularly when Capitol Hill and the White House are held by different parties Over the last century congressional hearings have largely divided int o three categories One tradition centers on allegations of ethical wrongdoin g in the executive branchsuch as the probes that unearthed the Teapot Dome oil scandal during Warren G Hardings presidency vetted the Watergate burglary that led to President Nixons downfall or examined the Whitewater land deal and campaign fundraising during Clintons presidency Hearings also have been used to look for misbehavior in the private sector usually as an attempt to lay the groundwork for reform legislation such as the Depressionera hearings on the stock market crash that led to t he creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission And finally legislators have used the hearing forum as a competitor to the presidents bully pulpitas a means to draw attention to ideas the Whi te House opposes Probably the most successful example of that occurred in the s when nationally televised hearings by Sen William Fulbright DArk on Vietnam crystallized opposition to the war During Clintons presidency Republicans emphasized ethics investigations So far in the energy debate Democrats are focusing on the second and third categories Hearings of the sort Lieberman is conducting arent designed to disru pt like the hearings during the Clinton administration they are designed to force new issues in the debate said Johns Hopkins University political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg who has written extensively on the process A s long as the energy debate was conducted only inside the Republican Party i t was a debate between proponents of free markets and proponents of freer markets At Wednesdays hearing Lieberman summoned half a dozen economists to make the case for the price caps on electricity rates that California Gov Gray Davis supports and Bush adamantly opposes Next Wednesday Lieberman will convene a second hearing that will give Davis a national forum to make his case for price controlsthen summon officials from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to explain why they have rebuffed that request Sources say Lieberman is considering a third hearing that would summon electricity producers whom Davis has accused of gouging California As Lieberman proceeds Sen Jeff Bingaman DNM the Energy Committees new chairman is scheduling hearings next week on electricity prices and the Environmental Protection Agencys decision to continue requiring the use of ethanol as a fuel additive in California Sen Carl Levin DMich is advancing on a slower but potentially broader track as he examines rising gas prices The subcommittee he heads intends to ask major oil companies to voluntarily produce various documents on the issue a request aides expect will be followed up with a subpoena during the summer The aides say Levin is not likely to require oil company executives to publicly testify until late fall Sen Larry E Craig RIdaho predicted Democrats will have a difficul t time attacking Republicans on energy Theyre going to try to make politic s out of a crisis he said But for eight years under Clinton there has been this silent echo of nothing in the area of production Under the ir watch little to nothing has been done and many forms of energy have been discouraged Even inside Democratic ranks opinion varies on what the hearings migh t accomplish Davis aides believe the forums could create momentum for pricecap legislation sponsored by Sens Dianne Feinstein DCalif and Gordon Smith ROre But that bill faces difficult odds in the Senate the more practical benefit of the hearings one source close to Lieberman said may be to increase pressure on FERC to act That may already be happening Senior FERC officials told The Times on Tuesday that in response to the growing political heat the agency is considering a significant expansion of the price limits it has already ordered Likewise Levin believes that the prospect of subpoenas and compelled public testimony later this year will have a moderating quality on gasoli ne price and supply decisions that oil executives make this summer as one aid e put it More broadly Democrats believe any evidence that either oil or electricity producing companies have manipulated price increases will make it tougher for Bush to sell an energy agenda that stresses increased productio n And during the hearings Democrats see an opportunity to solidify their contention that the administration has given the energy industry too loud a voice in setting policy One of the things these hearings can do is begin to pull back the curtain on who is in the room Podesta said Who is giving the advice Who is calling the shots Yet Democrats also appear acutely conscious of the danger

sets up a showdown with the state By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOPrivate energy companies could own rights to a key piece o f Californias electrical transmission grid thereby gaining influence over t he flow of electricity and its price under a plan launched Wednesday by the federal government At the direction of President Bush a federal power agency Wednesday invited outside parties to help pay for the expansion of Path an mile stretch of highvoltage wires in the Central Valley that constrains the flow of power Pacific Gas Electric owns the original wires which can move about megawatts of power but the financial backers of an expansion would w in the rights to move an additional megawatts on the new lines Any company or utility hoping to move electricity through that choke point would have to pay the owners of the transmission rights a fee and abi de by their rules The federal solicitation for investment sets up a showdown with California which is urging Pacific Gas Electric to expand its existing lines at Path Gov Gray Davis also is pursuing outright purchase of the transmission grids owned by PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric What you have is two processes on two different tracks said Jim Pop e president of a group of municipal utilities eager to expand Path He said the hope of his organization called the Transmission Agency o f Northern California is that we dont go down different tracks and end up in a train wreck at Path The federal government has power of eminent domain like PGE but wou ld not have to go through a state Public Utilities Commission review process t o expand Path Path will become increasingly important to the state as the dozens of longterm contracts recently signed with power producers take effect Many of those contracts are for power generated in Southern California which must be squeezed up Path to meet demand in the Silicon Valley and San Francisco Ray Hart deputy director of the state Department of Water Resources which signed the power contracts called the federal effort to attract partners on a Path expansion project disconcerting I think the governors plan to acquire the transmission grid is goo d for the people of California said Hart I think it protects them from marketers that would have a tendency to want to lock it up and jack the rat es up Federal law mandates that transmission grid owners offer fair fees and open access But owners of transmission rights can sell that ability to mov e electricity in a secondary market and experts say that in the complicated rules that govern transmission rights there is room for manipulation Transmission constraints can influence price by barring some buyers and sellers from reaching one another If youre going to pay for of the line then youre going to want of the line for your own use said Armando Perez director of grid planning for the California Independent System Operator which manages much of Californias electron highway system It makes less transmission available for others The Path power lines near Los Banos have been eyed for expansion fo r at least a decade As Californias demand for electricity swung upward in t he last five years and the state opened its electric industry to competition the congestion at Path worsened The choke point was a culprit grid operators say in the midJanuary blackouts in Northern California As part of his national energy plan announced last month Bush directe d the US Department of Energy to investigate outside interest in financing a fix for Path US Energy Secretary

The effect elsewhere may prove minimal By GARY POLAKOVIC Times Environmental Writer Gov Gray Davis decision this week to relax emission controls at powe r plants will help keep the juice flowing but will also retard progress against smog The changes are bound to cause mischief for some California areas on t he cusp of achieving healthful air after more than years of effort Even a little extra pollution could be enough to thwart attainment of the national healthbased ozone standards in the Bay Area San Diego and Ventura County officials say Moreover in case the governors strategy doesnt work he has left op en the option of tapping the dirtiest power source availablelegions of backu p diesel generators Those engines would provide a few hundred more megawatts but at a terrible price for air quality because they lack controls and can spew about times more pollutants than the very dirty peakers that Davis exempted from emissions controls Monday Were trying to make the best of a bad thing but in the short term we are getting rolled Air quality is going to suffer more this year and ther e will be some impacts said Dick Baldwin executive officer for the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Across most of Southern California however the energy crisis is not likely to lead to dirtier air this year air quality officials say The reason is that Californias power plants some of the cleanest in the nation contribute just of the smogforming emissions during summer and half as much the rest of the year The lions share of the Southlands air pollution comes from cars and trucks Twothirds of the power plants in the region will be equipped with devices to render them cleaner by summer according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District which regulates air pollution in Los Angeles Orange and parts of Riverside and S an Bernardino counties Those improvements should reduce overall power plant emissions about a third this year although pollution from individual generators may be highe r according to the state Air Resources Board For the most part California air quality officials say the challenges they will face because of the energy crisis are temporary and surmountable but they acknowledge that they are under intense pressure from politicians energy companies and manufacturers to relax regulations California has mor e smog than any other state and the worlds most stringent and comprehensive program to tame it although progress toward a healthy environment is still slow On the other hand officials are attempting to balance the need for a clean environment with the need to keep the economy humming The power crisis too can be hazardous to people when blackouts knock out traffic signals or cause heavy equipment to malfunction in the workplace An executive order that Davis issued Monday lifts emissions limits on heavily polluting power plants allowing municipalities and energy companie s to produce as much power and smog as necessary The decision was reached after utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power noted that operating restrictions on socalle d peaker plants were leaving hundreds of megawatts of capacity unused Peakers are typically run by gasfired turbines similar to jet engines Th ey produce limited power but lots of pollution which is why their use was strictly controlled in the first place Under the governors plan power producers will pay per ton of extra smog produced by the turbines The money will go into a fund to pay f or cleaning up dirty trucks buses boats and farm equipment to offset the pollution from the power plants Government estimates show that the plan could provide up to megawatts of additional electricity but an additional tons of pollutants this summer Meanwhile emissions from cars trucks buses and consumer products continue to decline Air quality is dramatically better today in the Southland than it was a decade ago Credit rigorous controls on everything from lighter fluid to paint oil refineries to autos bakeries to landfills The trend of improving air quality should accelerate as power companie s pay the millions of dollars in fees and penalties to help fund smogcutting programs The funds will be used to switch vehicles farm equipment and boa ts to clean fuels many of which can be converted this year to help offset pow er plant emissions said Catherine Witherspoon policy advisor for the state a ir board On the whole theres not going to be a lot more smog We expect declining emissions from power plants Witherspoon said Across Southern California power plant emissions are up this year whi le smog levels remain largely unchanged Boilers and turbines have released mo re than tons of pollutants so fartwice as much as they had by this tim e last year Yet just days of unhealthful ozone levels have been recorded anywhere in the region so far this year The peak ozone reading has been parts per million a level comparable to last years said Joe Cassmassi senior meteorologist for the AQMD Smog levels are strongly influenced by weather and in the approaching summer ozone season Cassmassi said conditions this year should be no wors e than last year In fact he forecasts that by August tropical storms from t he Gulf of California will bring unsettled air which tends to reduce smog He said that by years end the region can expect a gradual return to El NiFo conditions which portends an early end to smog season The way the weather is lining up it will be a typical year in a longterm trend and the trend is toward improving air quality he said The increased emissions from power plants however might be just enou gh to add one or two smoggy days to some communities with little margin for error San Diego the Bay Area and Ventura are close to meeting the federal onehour ozone standardthe benchmark for healthful air and the culminatio n of a multibilliondollar cleanup effort spanning decades Those communities are racing against Clean Air Act deadlines that if not met could trigger federal sanctions and restrictions on highway funds If we can make it through November without having two more violations this year we would be in attainment said Dick Smith of the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District That means the air quality is not being exceeded and it would allow certain onerous and burdensome regulatio ns to go away The margin is even closer in Ventura County which was once one of the smoggiest places in the nation Now the county is almost in compliance with air quality standards but just one day of unhealthy ozone would push it ov er the line Baldwin said A megawatt Reliant Energy Co peaker plant in Oxnard may be the deciding factor it might produce up to tons daily of smogforming nitrogen dioxide this summer a increase in those emission s in the county Baldwin said Air quality officials opposed the governors decision but acquiesced with an understanding that an alternative plan to press into service backup diesel generators would be delayed In the short term there may be some negative impacts on air quality but if it avoids use of diesel backup generators its a small price to pay said Barbara Lee president of the California Air Pollution Control Officer s Assn PUC Acts to Aid Alternative Energy Suppliers Regulators permit utilities to modify contracts with small power providers to maximize production By TIM REITERMAN and DAN MORAIN Times Staff Writers SAN FRANCISCOMoving to end disputes that have threatened to increase blackouts state regulators Wednesday took steps to stabilize prices paid t o hundreds of alternativeenergy producers while encouraging them to increas e the amount of power they provide to California utilities this summer and beyond The Public Utilities Commission gave permission for the utilities to change their contracts to make them more attractive to the generators whic h supply more than a quarter of the states electricity PUC President Loretta Lynch said that such contracts would provide lon g term stability and reasonable prices for generators that rely on expensive natural gas and for producers of renewable energy such as solar and wind power It means the maximum amount of power will be available this summer she said The disputes between the energy producers and the utilities that owe them hundreds of millions of dollars have erupted in state courts US Bankruptcy Court the PUC and the state Capitol Although the vast majority of the generators are delivering power many have said they are in financia l difficulty and want out of their contracts with the utilities The commission specifically encouraged the utilities to adopt fiveyea r contracts at fixed prices proposed by the Independent Energy Producers and incentive payments to induce generators to produce more power than their contracts currently require The PUC also unanimously ratified settlements reached Tuesday between Southern California Edison and dozens of small power producers but the agreements are tied to Gov Gray Davis controversial deal to rescue the Rosemeadbased utility from nearbankruptcy It is a substantial move forward Davis said Jerry Bloom of the California Cogeneration Council also praised the PUCs action as a step forward for the states small generators But he cautioned that of the companies providing power to Pacific Gas Electr ic and San Diego Gas Electric still do not have contracts that provide a fai r return That leaves half of them operating at a loss and the possibility of severe blackouts still hovers over the state Bloom said Before the Southern California Edison agreements can be consummated Davis said the state Legislature must approve the complex deal he struck with the utility in April to allow it to pay off its debts and regain financial stability The deal calls for the state to buy Edisons transmission lines for nearly billion and issue up to billion in ratepayersecured bonds to allow the utility to pay off debts from electricity purchases Davis Edison rescue plan has stalled with virtually no support in either house and the governor urged that lawmakers begin hearings on it Otherwise he warned the Southern California utility could go bankrupt Senate leader John Burton DSan Francisco said many lawmakers from both parties are convinced that Davis is trying to place the Legislature in a position to take political heat if the Edison deal goes sour and the utilit y follows PGE into filing for bankruptcy protection In a filing with the PUC Edison said its agreements with the generato rs will provide significant benefits to the utility and its ratepayers the alternativeenergy producers and the state by providing for stable and reasonable pricing over the next five years at a time when both prici ng and supply are highly uncertain The agreementsreached Tuesday after months of negotiations that were facilitated by the governors officeaddress the issues of repaying debts to generators while establishing prices for future sales Edison stopped paying those generators in November and resumed in late March only under orders from the PUC PGE which also resumed payments in March had been paying cents of each dollar owed its alternative produce rs By the time the PUC ordered continuing payments to the alternative energy producers which Edison owes as much as billion the small companies were running out of cash and some had stopped operating helping to cause two days of statewide rolling blackouts in March Under terms worked out with key representatives of the alternativeenergy producers Edison would pay of what it owes the generators for electricity produced between last Nov and March In addition Edison would pay annual interest on the debt A second payment would be made when Edison is restored to creditworthiness through approval of the rescue deal by the PUC and the state Legislature or by some other solution Edison said Full payment woul d be made to the generators five days after Edison receives funds to pay off its own debts Edison also agreed to pay producers of renewable energy a fixed rate of a megawatthour for five years The PUC meanwhile failed to meet a deadline of last Friday for actin g on aspects of Davis deal with Edison I have urged them to move more quickly the governor said Reiterman reported from San

TONY PERRY Times Staff Writer SAN DIEGODespite statements from Gov Gray Davis that full disclosur e of the states longterm power contracts was imminent attorneys for the state balked Wednesday at disclosing the contracts until key details are removed The attorneys also opposed making public any shortterm spot market contracts for at least six months warning that to divulge those contracts now would undercut the states negotiating stance and ensure summer blackou ts Attorneys for several news organizations and Republican state legislators accused the governors attorneys of stalling and making the iss ue needlessly complex On Tuesday Davis dropped his earlier opposition to making longterm contracts public and indicated that the contracts might be made public as early as Wednesday But Deputy Atty Gen Tim Muscat representing Davis asked Superior Court Judge Linda Quinn for two weeks to prepare redacted versions of the longterm contracts that total nearly billion Opposing attorneys who had sued to make the contracts public complained that the facts that Davis wants to keep secret are key to understanding the contracts and to determining whether the governor has obligated taxpayers to pay inflated prices Theyve conceded the public interest in disclosure and no matter ho w thin they slice the baloney that concession is really deafening said Sacramento attorney Charles Bell representing legislators who assert th at keeping the contracts secret violates the California Public Records Act Quinn ruled that the longterm contracts must be made public by noon Friday although she will allow the governor to keep certain portions secret at least until June while she considers legal arguments from both sides She expressed annoyance at the slow pace of negotiations between the t wo sides and the apparent slowness of the attorney generals efforts to alert private companies that their contracts with the state might be made public This is an amazing situation Quinn said Eric Landau Orange County attorney for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co the Wall Street brokerage firm that serves as an energy marketer said he had only recently learned that the contracts might become public All w e are asking for is the ability to review the proceedings he said Muscat said the governor wants to avoid details including indexes that would link the price of electricity to natural gas prices delivery points and transaction costs Disclosure of those terms he said would provide information to competitors of the companies that have signed agreements with the state and allow for market manipulation The Times reported Wednesday that the state has committed to buying power at prices up to a megawatthour during peak demand periods and more than for power at times when

officials consider it a promising development in their intense lobbying campaign to keep refineries running This is a very good step said Scott Folwarkow spokesman for the Valero refinery in Benicia which has no backup generators to use in blackouts W e do play an essential role and the refinery needs to be protected The industry has repeatedly issued warnings that gasoline prices would soar if refineries were hit by rolling power blackouts Power interruptions of just an hour can send refineries out of commission for days shrinking gas supplies and leading to higher prices Earlier this month San Franciscobased Chevron Corp warned that it would reduce gasoline production at its two California refineries unless it was exempted from power outages Gov Gray Davis has also urged the PUC to designate petroleum refineries as essentialuse customers who are exempt from blackouts because their services are needed for public health and safety A Davis spokesman declined comment on the draft

Washington Bureau Thursday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Washington Federal regulators are poised to impose roundtheclock price restrictions on wholesale electricity sold to California a move short of what Democrats have urged but far stronger than what the Bush administratio n has for months indicated it was willing to do The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected Monday to extend its April order which limits prices generators can charge during power emergencies to apply at all times and across the entire Western region sources inside the agency confirmed yesterday FERC also is expected to increase market monitoring expand refunds for overcharges by generators during power emergencies and order generators to sell into the Western grid during power emergencies among other things FERC Commissioner William Massey a Democratic appointee who strongly dissented from the April order because he believed it was too narrow would not comment on the expected action other than to say he had been urging greater intervention relentlessly for some time Although power prices are plunging for the first time since the crisis bega n Massey said it was too soon to declare victory We dont know whats going to happen in the next hour or tomorrow or the next month Massey said We are certain this is a market short of power plants Supply and demand are not in reasonable equilibrium and when that is true prices can soar at the drop of a hat and the wealth transfer can b e exorbitant Massey said that until supply and demand came into reasonable balance in California which he expects to occur in months to two years as new powe r plants come on line there has got to be hoursaday sevendaysaweek price mitigation in effect to protect consumers period The expected FERC action coincides with rising political pressure on the agency from Democrats and increasing numbers of Republicans to intervene mo re forcefully in Californias power market despite fierce resistance to price controls from the Bush administration REINFORCEMENTS That pressure ratcheted up sharply when Democrats assumed control of the Senate and began scheduling legislation to order FERC to impose price caps The agencys move also coincides with the arrival of two new Bush appointee s Patrick Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell who are widely viewed as more receptive to intervention than the current chairman Curt Hebert a Republican appointed by former President Bill Clinton and named chairman by President Bush The agencys April order which took effect May puts a ceiling on price s pegged to the least efficient power plant It has been applied during two power emergencies so far Experts are divided on how much if any effect t he order has contributed to the recent sharp drop in prices Many factors fro m cool weather to increased conservation to the return of several nuclear generators that were down for maintenance are also at work Rep Doug Ose a Sacramento Republican who first pushed FERC to expand its April order said yesterday he believed the expected new action would provi de a pretty good middle ground between Democrats call for a specific maximu m price or cap the generators can charge and the Bush administrations opposition to price controls Rep Darryl Issa an Oceanside Republican added that the agencys action w as part of a pattern of escalating engagement by the administration and a more activist FERC AS LONG AS IT WORKS Sen Dianne Feinstein said the action expected Monday was likely to fall short of what she wanted although she called it another step forward While FERC is likely to avoid using the words price caps to describe its plan it called its original order price mitigation Feinstein said I dont care what you call it as long as it works Feinstein testifying yesterday at a Government Affairs Committee hearing o n energy said she believed the new order would still permit price manipulati on because the caps are set at the price charged by the least efficient therefore highest cost and most polluting generators Feinsteins bill to force FERC to impose price caps until is scheduled for committee action this month She wants firm price caps based on each generators costs much like the regulatory regime in place before Californias electricity restructuring Some economists argue however that the type of price controls FERC is expected to use more closely correspond to the price that a functioning market would produce Price caps have become the nexus of the entire Washington debate over Californias electricity crisis The Bush administration contends that pric e controls would make blackouts worse by discouraging electricity sales and investment while Democrats led by Feinstein and California Gov Gray Davi s contend that generators are deliberately withholding power to jack up price s OBJECTIONS TO CONTROLS WITHER Republicans on Capitol Hill many of whom

shortterm energy contracts should be released over Davis opposition Since the state started buying power for customers of Californias reeling utilities in January Davis has refused to make the contracts public sayin g disclosure would reveal the states negotiating strategies give power sellers an advantage and drive prices up In court documents the governor s lawyers said the information should remain secret until January when the states current power purchasing authority expires News organizations including The Chronicle and eight Republican legislato rs sued for disclosure saying the documents were public records that would le t Californians evaluate the spending of billions of tax dollars On Tuesday Davis reversed course and said he was willing to make public immediately the details of billion in longterm contracts with suppliers if the judge released the state from confidentiality agreements i n the contracts The governor said that market conditions had improved and th at enough contracts had been signed that disclosure would not seriously damage the states bargaining position He gave reporters a few more details yesterday acknowledging that the stat e was locked into some longterm contracts at prices above those now availabl e on the spot market We were paying a lot more in January and February than we are now on the spot market because we have dramatically shrunk the spot market providing reliable power for California at affordable rates Davis said In court yesterday however Deputy Attorney General Timothy Muscat sought to delay contract disclosure two weeks to give the energy sellers who are n ot parties to the lawsuit time to comment But the judge said the states failure to keep contracting companies abreas t of the suit did not justify delaying disclosure Quinn ordered the longter m contracts released Friday after the state deletes details that would reveal suppliers trade secrets and other proprietary information Muscat said the state would edit out several categories of information he described as technical including energy delivery points and data on suppliers efficiency in converting natural gas to electricity News media lawyer Alonzo Wickers IV protested any deletions Keeping those socalled technical issues secret thwarts the publics understanding of the contracts he said Quinn said she would consider objections to the deletions at the June hearing Muscat the states lawyer contended secrecy was essential for deal making in the volatile shortterm market We are heading into a hot long summer he said If we have to reveal ou r

gallon at pump Davis says Jane Kay Chronicle Environment Writer Wednesday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews The Environmental Protection Agency turned down Calfifornias request for a waiver of a cleanair law yesterday forcing the state to begin using ethan ol in gasoline as it phases out another additive that has polluted groundwater State officials have argued that ethanol which reduces smogproducing chemicals is not needed to meet the states air pollution requirements Gov Gray Davis reacted angrily to the EPAs decision saying it would rais e gas prices significantly and expose the state to shortages Their refusal will probably cost Californians cents a gallon at the pump Davis said yesterday while visiting a community health center in San Francisco It will do nothing to clean up the air and it is the triumph o f politics over good science The consumers of California once again get the shaft The Bush administration once again sides with special interests Im not going to ta ke it The EPAs denial is the latest sign of friction between the White House and Davis who have been battling over electricity prices The California Energy Commission estimates that consumers will pay million more a year for gasoline if refineries have to convert to ethanol That translates to an increase of to cents for each gallon of gas If ethanol supplies are inadequate or if refineries encounter problems consumers could see gas shortages and price spikes as high as cent a gallon according to the commission But EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said that the state had failed to sh ow that a waiver of a federal Clean Air Act provision would not reduce air quality The law requires regions of the country with the worst air to use oxygen additives in gas to reduce smog California requested the waiver because it is phasing out the additive MTBE or methyl tertiary butyl ether which has polluted groundwater throughout t he state Ethanol is the only other additive approved under the federal Clean Air Act DIFFICULTIES ADMITTED Whitman acknowledged that California faced a dilemma in keeping MTBE out of its drinking water while satisfying the federal law However she said oxygen adding substances such as MTBE and ethanol in gasoline do reduce smogforming chemicals and should be used in urban areas with the worst air quality MTBE DILEMMA The administration is concerned about the risks of MTBE in drinking water in California and other states Whitman said Clean air and clean water are equally important We do not want to pursue one at the expense of the other Since the widespread use of MTBE in it has become a major problem in California and other states tainting groundwater and threatening the drinking water supplies of some areas Winston Hickox secretary of the California EPA said yesterday that the planned ban might be delayed if the state Energy Commission decided there were unsurmountable problems with converting to ethanol But he didnt believe California would back off on its efforts to rid gas of MTBE Sen Dianne Feinstein yesterday accused President Bush of turning a blind eye to California and Sen Barbara Boxer said the decision was another example of Bushs insensitivity to Californians Feinstein has introduced a bill that would give governors the authority to waive the additive requirement if their gas met other standards OIL INDUSTRY DISMAYED Oil industry officials in California who have argued that refiners could make an additivefree gas that qualified with federal and state requirement s to reduce smog also said they were disappointed with the decision Over the last four years weve made more than billion gallons of cleanerburning gas that had no added oxygen no MTBE no ethanol said Fred Gorell spokesman for Chevron Corp The gas meets all the requirement s But we cant sell it in Southern California and Sacramento because of the federal requirement BOON TO FARMERS If MTBE is banned in and theres an oxygen additive requirement ther e would be no other choice than to use ethanol Gorell said Ethanol is made primarily from corn and the EPA decision is a boon to Midwestern corn growers and lawmakers from states such as Illinois Iowa Minnesota and South Dakota who had lobbied the Bush administration heavily to deny the waiver The decision would create a substantial market for ethanol According to the Renewable Fuels Association an ethanol industry group California would need about million gallons a year to use as an additiv e in gas In the industry expects to produce billion gallons and i s gearing up to make million gallons more with the addition of plants BIG INITIAL COSTS Adding ethanol to Californias gas supply would require a major investment in infrastructure Gorell said Some of the costs would go to modify refinerie s as well as terminals where the ethanol blending would be done Costs of transporting ethanol from Midwestern states would not be the bigge st problem Gorell said Ethanol can be brought by ships and barges just as most of the MTBE is brought now Ethanol also can be brought by railcars which are prohibited from carrying MTBE But refiners can work with ethanol he said Even if the waiver were grante d there would a new market for ethanol in Los Angeles to combat carbon monoxi de in the winter anyway Environmental groups welcomed the EPAs decision yesterday Bluewater Netwo rk of San Francisco said a coalition of groups supported maintaining the additive requirement to protect the air and the use of renewable ethanol in gas The requirement could also be a boon to the states agricultural industry The state has only two plants that make about million gallons of ethanol a year from cheese whey and the sugar and starch from outdated soda pop Six new California plants are planned for next year The boost in ethanol would help farmers who are suffering from global competition and other problems

several media organizations including The Chronicle have filed suit against Davis demanding that the contracts be made public We now believe that the balance tips in favor of disclosure rather than continuing to withhold the contracts said Davis senior adviser Nancy McFadden In San Francisco yesterday Davis said he always intended to release the information six months after the contracts were signed Obviously the market conditions are a little more favorable now he said On balance we think its the appropriate time to release the information Davis request will be heard at a court hearing today in San Diego on the suits filed by the media and GOP lawmakers against Davis But it is unclear whether the judge will go along with the administrations request or how the Davis administration will be able to proceed if it is denied Paula HallCollins a spokeswoman for Williams Co said the energy company will monitor the court hearing We maintain that the contracts contain proprietary

concerned about losing its lawsuits She said she expected the court to release the state from the confidentiali ty agreement The governors office then would release the documents as early as this week she said Lawmakers also have been demanding the release of the information so that they can proceed on a plan to keep Southern California Edison out of bankruptcy If the judge refuses to release the state from the confidentiality clause the administration will negotiate with the generators individually to allow the contracts to be made public McFadden said But Terry Francke general counsel with the California First Amendment Coalition said he would be surprised if a judge allowed the request I dont believe the court would simply absolve a party from a contractual agreement at a proceeding where the other party is not present he said Francke also questioned whether the state had the right to sign contracts containing a confidentiality clause There is a very serious question as to whether the state of California can legally in effect promise to ignore the Public Records Act he said Roger Myers an attorney for The Chronicle said there is good case law in the state supporting the

elicit fierce debate in Congress BY JIM PUZZANGHERA Mercury News Washington Bureau WASHINGTON California moved to political center stage Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans clashed in Congress over how to solve the states electricity problems Wielding the new power gained since the Senate shifted from Republican control last week Sen Joseph Lieberman DConn held the first of two hearings into the response of federal regulators to Californias energy crisis The Democrats are focusing their pressure on members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission who are poised Monday to consider a major expansion of limited electricity price controls enacted in April The heat is on and its going to produce some light at the end of the tunnel predicted Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif Feinstein has sponsored legislation to force the commission to set temporar y price caps The bill is scheduled to be considered by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on June after wallowing for months while Republicans controlled the Senate Republicans assailed the Democrats for failing to address the problem of increasing the supply of energy in favor of shortterm fixes such as price caps Let me tell you what the name of the game is now Its pure politics said Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska the leading Republican on the energy committee And the Democratic plan is to try to cement in the minds of voters that President Bush favors corporate interests at the expen se of consumers But in a nod to the growing pressure for some federal action Murkowski an ardent opponent of price caps said he would support a day ceiling on electricity prices in California set at a megawatthour throughout t he West The idea would be to prevent the sharp spikes in prices during emergency periods that have led to power suppliers selling electricity to California at shortterm prices of as much as a megawatthour Governors of Western states could opt out of the plan and the limits could be extended as much as more days in onemonth increments Such highprice limits are also known as circuit breakers and have been put in place in Texas Pennsylvania and in New England in the past It coul d emerge as a Republican alternative to Feinsteins bill which would set harder price caps for months based on each suppliers cost to produce t he energy plus a builtin profit level But Feinstein and California Gov Gray Davis would not support the ceiling This proposal says Go ahead gouge us all the time except for a few hours during periods of extreme peak demand said Davis media representative Steve Maviglio Its toothless and provides no real temporary relief There was no consensus on price caps from a group of six leading energy experts convened by Lieberman before his Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday Four invited by Lieberman including Severin Borenstein director of the Energy Institute at the University of CaliforniaBerkeley supported price caps Two experts invited by the Republicans Lawrence Makovich senior director at Cambridge Energy Research Associated and William Hogan of Harvard Universitys Kennedy Scho ol of Government did not But Alfred Kahn a retired Cornell University economics professor who helpe d deregulate US airlines in the s said temporary price relief is necessary and failure to help California could lead other states to halt their electricity deregulation plans And rather than discouraging investme nt in new power plants electricity regulation through the years encouraged su ch high spending on infrastructure that Kahn referred to it as goldplating of circuits With electric power we have not had the problem of shortages under regulation he said All the experts agreed that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission needs more resources and should become more vigilant in the way it monitors electricity They have some very good people at FERC but they dont have enough Hogan said Paul Joskow the director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said the commission must become more like the Securities and Exchange Commission in actively monitoring possible electricity markets All five commissioners along with Davis will testify at a hearing Wednesd ay by Liebermans committee regarding whether FERC has fulfilled its obligatio ns to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates in California Curt Hbert the FERC chair Wednesday defended the commission and said its California price mitigation plan put in place in April has helped lower prices in California in recent days There is no doubt the plan is working to bring down prices and making generation capacity available Hbert said He would not say whether the commission would expand its plan aroundtheclock and to other Western states as a commission source told the Mercury News is being considered FERC has been urged to do that by some key Republicans in Congress On the same day Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham went before a House subcommittee to push for action on the administrations national energy pla n which calls for increasing domestic supplies through more oil and naturalg as drilling and greater use of coal and nuclear power Every step we take toward wiser use of energy and more diverse supplies a t home will make us that much less dependent on overseas suppliers and less vulnerable to supply shocks imposed on us from abroad Vice President Dic k Cheney who headed the task force that drafted the plan said in a speech before the United States Energy Associations Efficiency Forum Wednesday Wednesday congressional Republicans charging that Democrats had tried to derail the plan threatened to use parliamentary stalling tactics unless Democrats set a date in the near future to consider Bushs proposals PUC commissioner issues draft decision to exempt refineries from blackouts SAN FRANCISCO AP A state power regulator has issued a draft decision that would exempt oil refineries from rolling blackouts and keep California s gasoline prices from potentially skyrocketing The California Public Utilities Commission will consider commissioner Carl Woods proposal on June Administrative Law Judge Burton Mattson issued a companion ruling Wednesday requesting a coalition of energy producers PUC commissioners and electric utilities to provide more information about foss il fuel production to help the PUC decide whether to grant more exemptions Gov Gray Davis has asked the PUC to come up with a plan to minimize disruption of fossil fuel production this summer A rolling blackout is capable of causing refineries to lose up to a week of production which cou ld create gasoline shortages and drive up prices at the pump While the economic impacts caused by disruption of fossil fuel production are potentially devastating the commission must balance these economic impacts against the potential impacts on public health and safety asserted by applicants in our other exemption process Wood said in a written statement Four oil refiners Valero Energy Tosco Exxon Mobil and Equilon Enterprises are petitioning the PUC for blackout exemptions at facilities that produce about onefourth of the states refining capacity of milli on barrels per day Meanwhile Californias biggest refiner Chevron Corp has taken its exemption case directly to Davis The San Franciscobased company which controls about percent of the states refining capacity told Davis the company will curtail production unless regulators or state lawmakers protec t its two California refineries from blackouts Davis sent a letter last week to the PUC supporting the oil industrys request for a blackout exemption said his spokesman Steve Maviglio FERC may expand cap Senators say regulators are set to extend price controls throughout the Wes t June By DENA BUNIS The Orange County Register WASHINGTON Federal energy regulators are poised Monday to extend limited price controls on the electricity market to hours a day seven days a we ek throughout the Western states Californias senators said Tuesday If the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does what Democratic Sens Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein have heard it plans to do it would represent a further softening by FERC in the face of mounting political pressure FERC had adamantly opposed limits on a free electricity market until April when it approved its first limited controls Experts believe such a move could moderate wholesale prices but to what extent and what the effect could be on ratepayers is uncertain It would be a step in the right direction Boxer said Tuesday after she Feinstein and California House members from both parties met with Vice President Dick Cheney It still doesnt give us the kind of help with pric e gouging that we need Cheney who reiterated the administrations opposition to firm price caps told members who pressed him for a Californiaspecific solution to watch wh at FERC does at its meeting next Monday Two new FERC commissioners recently appointed by President George W Bush could be voting Monday Energy watchers say their presence could turn FERC into a more activist agency In April FERC ordered a pricecontrol plan based on a complicated formula of what it costs generators to produce a kilowatt of electricity But critics particularly FERC Commissioner Richard Massey called it meaningless becaus e it only applied during shortages and did not extend beyond California Political heat triggers FERCs switch The panel seems more responsive to the voice of public officials June By DENA BUNIS and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register WASHINGTON The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may be an independent body But its members sure can feel a political sledgehammer coming at them For months the proopen markets majority on the commission has resisted pleadings by California officials to put price caps on wholesale electricit y prices They broke down somewhat in April and put limited controls on the market on ly during electricity emergencies and only in California Since then the political heat has become intense And its come to a head this week as The new Democraticcontrolled US Senate begins hearings today on the electricity crisis in California The two new FERC commissioners Nora Mead Brownell and Patrick Wood have been sworn in and will begin attending meetings Brownell who was sworn on as the fifth commissioner on Tuesday said she and Wood were planning a tri p to California soon after next weeks second Senate hearing at which they will testify Key Republicans House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Rep Billy Tauzin RLa and energy subcommittee chairman Rep Joe Barton RTexas sent a letter to FERC urging it to expand its limited controls this summer to cover all the western states all the time I think there is a growing political consensus in Congress in California most everywhere that an effective price mitigation plan in this California market has to cover all hours Richard Massey a FERC commissioner who ha s been critical of what he calls half a loaf measures his colleagues have taken thus far said Tuesday Massey would not confirm that the commission plans on Monday to expand pric e controls to hours a day and to other Western states But even if it does its unclear how far such an action will go toward solving Californias problem and whether it could open up new problems Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which manages most of the states electric grid said the plan would have some effect on prices in California But it may not go far enough she said We welcome any decision to move forward with roundtheclock mitigation which is something weve called fo r from the beginning Energy experts and some lawmakers worry that the method the FERC plan uses which sets costbased wholesale rates based on the leastefficient power plants operating in California could lead to market manipulation The minute prices are linked to the cost of operating the least efficient plant an incentive for plants to be inefficient is created said Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif I am concerned that this order will continue to provide energy generators the opportunity to manipulate prices as I believ e they have been doing Democrats in California and on Capitol Hill have been calling for firm pric e caps Thats the only way they say that the generators can be prevented from gouging the states ratepayers But Gov Gray Davis is ready to be convinced this latest possibility will work The devils in the details of course Davis said in a statement Mark m e down as a doubting Thomas The FERC has been on a sitdown strike but if they are finally for price relief hallelujah Wholesale power prices have dropped dramatically in the state in the past t wo weeks But Feinstein said so far its unclear what has caused the decline the earlier FERC action the possibility that generators are worried about investigations into alleged price manipulation or the increased pressure fr om Congress There is some evidence that the April FERC action had an effect Two weeks ago during a Stage alert Californias Independent System Operator imposed FERCs pricing plan and bought power at a megawatt about onethird the price offered earlier that day said Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network a consumer advocacy group in San Francisco But Hoge said even it FERC expands controls on Monday California has alrea dy paid too high a price The state has already spent more than billion too much on electricity in the past year said Hoge Register staff writer John Howard contributed to this report Davis to air details about power buys He had refused to

megawatthours of electricity Davis administration officials said The contracts fine print was not immediately disclosed The average price was about per megawatthour In recent months the cost of wholesale electricity in California has fluctuated widely from less than per megawatthour to Early last year before Californias energy crisis exploded power cost to per megawatt Republican lawmakers and several news organizations including The Orange County Register sued Davis in March saying his refusal to release the contracts details violates the California Public Records Act Davis still

Monday saying the department will ask a judge today to void a confidentiality provision in the contracts Oklahomabased Williams Energy one of the generators with a state contract opposes the release of the contract details a spokeswoman said Energy notebook Edison makes deal to pay generators of renewable power June ROSEMEAD Southern California Edison has reached an agreement with small pow er generators that could ease the bankruptcy threat the utility is facing and ensure Californians a critical source of power through the summer The California Public Utilities Commission is expected Wednesday to approve the plan that would require Edison to make partial back payments to renewab le energy generators many of which have sued the utility and curtailed power production The plan would raise the rates being paid to generators that use natural ga s and offer a stable rate for five years to generators using wind solar geothermal or other renewable sources The agreement also requires Edison to pay at least percent of what it ow es generators The deal removes the threat of legal action against the utility if full payment for power bought since January is made within six months after the PUC order becomes final I think its a good balanced deal for both sides and the only issue will be making sure the PUC will adopt the deal said Jerry Bloom a spokesman for the California Cogeneration Council which represents many small natur al gasfired power generators Burton calls for batteries to keep traffic signals lit SACRAMENTO State Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco introduced a bill Monday that would provide battery backups for traffic signals at critical intersections throughout the state in hopes of preventi ng potentially deadly accidents during rolling blackouts The bill would require the California Energy Commission with the Californi a Highway Patrol to identify critical intersections based on traffic accidents and the presence of children Although the state has signalized intersections only the estimated intersections equipped with lightemitting diodes a more energyefficient kind of light would be eligible Battery backups cost to each The money for the program would come from funds provided to the California Energy Commission for conservation efforts said Dave Sebeck a Burton spokesman It is unclear whether cities counties and other agencies that have already installed backups would be reimbursed by the state To become law the bill must be approved by the energy and appropriation committees in the Senate and Assembly pass both houses by a twothirds majority and be signed by Gov Gray Davis Sebeck said Officials at the energy commission and the CHP declined to comment Tuesday because they have not reviewed the legislation In Orange County only of intersections in a Register survey released this week will be equipped with battery backups as of July Bill to allow state seizure of power plants advances SACRAMENTO A State Assembly committee approved legislation Tuesday that wou ld allow the state to seize power plants that regulators determined had charge d unreasonable prices for electricity The Assembly Judiciary Committee voted to approve a bill by Assistant Majority Leader Juan Vargas to allow the state to seize and run power plant s for to months and then pay their owners for the use of the plants The state Public Utilities Commission would first have to determine if the plants sold electricity at unjust and unreasonable prices The measure which supporters concede stands little chance of becoming law at this point is designed as a warning to power generators selling electricit y in the California market Its a tremendous effort to send a message to the generators said Wendy Harmon a spokeswoman for Vargas a Democrat from Chula Vista The bill still must pass at least one Assembly committee as well as pass a floor vote and be approved by the state Senate and then signed by the governor Gov Gray Davis has said he wants to leave the option open of supporting legislation allowing the state to seize power plants Power generators say that the possibility the state may seize power plants has slowed the building of new plants in the state prolonging the supply shortage that has contributed to soaring wholesale prices Mirant said this month it was postponing construction of an alreadyapprove d plant in Contra Costa because of concern about whether the state would seiz e power plants A spokesman for Davis said at the time he would be surprised if the company didnt proceed

gasoline The unanimous court said the suit did not provide enough evidence to suppor t allegations that nine major oil companies in California conspired to limit supply and fix prices In ruling that the case cannot go to trial Justice Stanley Mosk said that the suit presented evidence that the petroleum companies may have possessed the motive opportunity and means to unlawfully conspire But that is all That is not enough Mosk wrote for the court The suit alleged that the states largest refiners decided to share confidential information and hold back on supplies of reformulated gasoline after the state required refiners to make gasoline that would not create as much pollution as previous formulas The case was granted class action status in The following year a San Diego County judge tossed out the case siding with the oil companies who said evidence was insufficient to persuade a jury Then that judge David Danielsen reversed his own decision The companies appealed and in January an appeals court concurred with the judges initial decision The oil companies sued were Atlantic Richfield Co Chevron Corp Mobile O il Co Products Co Shell Oil Co Texaco Refining and Marketing Inc Tosco Corp and Ultramar Inc The case is Aguilar v Atlantic Richfield Co S Associated Press GOP vulnerability in California prompts Bush shift on power prices By Finlay Lewis COPLEY NEWS SERVICE June WASHINGTON A lengthening list of politically endangered California Republicans appears to have spurred the Bush administration into a retreat on the states volatile electricity pricing issue White House desire to keep Republican control of the US House in next years elections will be an unspoken but clear concern when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meets Monday to reconsider its pricing policy according to a wide range of analysts who have studied the situation The expected turnaround on the part of FERC and the White House is due at least partly to complaints from embattled California House Republicans that Democrats have gained the political high ground as voters come to believe that outofstate energy companies are engaged in price gouging and profiteering Republicans have come to realize that the entire pricing structure here is a potential political killer said Tony Quinn a Sacramento political analyst with past ties to the GOP After months of condemning price controls the administration gave the gree n light to FERC to devise a plan to restrain wholesale electricity prices in California and nearby states by pegging them to the costs of the least efficient producer in a given market This approach has already been invoked in California in energysupply emergencies The plan before FERC would leave it in place during the summer months in California and much of the rest of the West regardless of energy availability While far more generous to the industry than the pricecap formula being advanced by congressional Democrats and California Gov Gray Davis the pricing mechanism likely to be embraced by FERC represents a substantial retreat by the agency and the White House Until now both have insisted on giving free play to market forces except in emergencies The more savvy Republican leaders here have figured out that you cant go down in flames for an ideological position when your constituents are being hurt said political scientist Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of Claremont Graduate University With the GOP enjoying only an vote margin over the Democrats in the Hous e Republican strategists in recent days have focused on assessments showing that a number of Republicanheld seats in California could switch hands due in large part to soaring electricity prices The list includes Reps Doug Ose of Sacramento author of the pricing plan now under consideration by FERC and Rep Steve Horn of Long Beach a widel y respected moderate According to some analysts others in jeopardy are Reps Elton Gallegly of Simi Valley Richard Pombo of Tracy and Gary Miller of Diamond Bar Quinn also argued that Rep David Dreier of San Dimas chairman of the powerful Rules Committee and a rising GOP star in the House could face energyrelated problems and that Rep Mary Bono of searingly hot Palm Sprin gs could find herself losing some ground in her otherwise safe GOP constituenc y The California energy crisis has all the earmarks of a classic attack issue said John R Pitney a political scientist at ClaremontMcKenna College You have a Republican administration headed by two people with connections to the oil industry and you have a very visible problem and a solution that is easy and plausible Democratic price controls Alarmed by these developments House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas this week launched a damagecontrol effort by assigning a team of Republicans to help counter Democratic attacks on the White House The teams assignment includes daily floor speeches defending Bushs energy policies The energy crisis is only the latest development in a trend that has increased the sense of Republican congressional vulnerability in California Even before this springs blackouts and stratospheric energy bills longte rm demographic shifts were tilting the state in a Democratic direction Congressional redistricting also is expected to exact a toll on the Republican delegation Compounding the partys troubles was the perception that Bush having lost California handily to Democrat Al Gore last fall had written off the state in terms of his expected reelection campaign in Then came the loss of Republican control of the US Senate a development that reminded GOP strategists of their tenuous position in the US House The administration soon discovered that California is still populated by a large number of Republican congressmen who didnt appreciate the White Houses stance on the problem said Steve Smith head of a think tank at Washington University in St Louis that studies problems of politics and economics Meanwhile Democrats here appear to be betting that the pending FERC plan will solve neither Californias energy pains nor the GOPs political problems House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt told reporters on Thursday that the measure would amount to only a kind of tweaking of FERCs existing emergency pricing order for California an approach that he said has pr oven ineffective overly complicated and loaded with loopholes Gephardt added It still allows huge price gouging by the electric compani es with regard to wholesale prices in California House panel rejects Democratic plan for energy price caps By Alan Fram ASSOCIATED PRESS June WASHINGTON House Republicans rejected a Democratic effort Thursday to impose federal price caps on electricity prices in the Western United State s amid an intensifying partisan divide over energy By a near partyline vote the House Appropriations Committee rejecte d a proposal by Rep Nancy Pelosi DCalif that would have required the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to

suicide and murder in Guyana Pelosis amendment was among several energy proposals by Democrats that the GOPcontrolled committee shot down as it approved a billion measure providing extra money this fiscal year mostly for the Pentagon In other largely partyline votes the panel defeated Democratic amendments that would have doubled the bills money for energy assistance for the poor to million added million for hydroelectricity improvements and provided million to support loans to improve the capacity of transmission grids Its pure demagoguery House Majority Whip Tom DeLay RTexas said in a brief interview regarding the Democratic amendments If Democrats had an energy policy theyd have had one in the last eight years They have no credibility on this issue whatsoever They are responsible for the energy crunch more than anybody I know Spotlighting the high political stakes House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt DMo took the unusual step of issuing a written statement about the committees energy votes He said President Bush and Republicans are committed to helping the Big Energy special interests and accused them of obstruction Republicans from California and other Western states voted with few exceptions against the Democratic energy proposals underlining the degree to which the response to the regions energy crisis has become a partisan issu e Many in the GOP support Bushs

opposes the idea Rep JC Watts of Oklahoma chairman of the House Republican Conference said Thursday at a natural gas industry luncheon Price caps do not addres s the core issues of high energy prices and volatility They will lead to rationing and blackouts During the debate over the price cap amendment DeLay placed blame for the power crisis on California officials This was the result of overgovernment regulation responding to environmental extremism and as a result limiting electricity supplies he said But Democrats accused the GOP of opposing action that could help suffering

Appropriations Committee wwwhousegovappropriations House members wwwhousegovhouseMemberWWWhtml Federal Energy Regulation Commission wwwfercgov Plan would allow private energy companies to own grid rights ASSOCIATED PRESS June SACRAMENTO The federal government has endorsed a plan that calls for private energy companies to purchase the rights of a key piece of Californias transmission grid The plan would allow those private companies to control the flow of electricity and charge transmission fees to any agency or utility wanting t o move power on the lines The US Department of Energy on Wednesday invited private energy companies to help pay for the expansion of the transmission grid known as Path an mile stretch of hightension wires in the Central Valley The wires can move about megawatts of power between Southern California and Silicon Valley and San Francisco Pacific Gas Electric owns the original lines and has been urged by state officials to expand the grids capacity The wires may become increasingly important this summer when rolling blackouts are expected Longterm contracts recently signed by the state an d power wholesalers are for electricity produced in Southern California but transported to Northern California through Path Gov Gray Davis has sought to outright purchase transmission grids owned by PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric Several power generators said Wednesday they didnt know whether they would pursue rights to the Path grid Expanding the grid will cost between and million and take two years to complete Companies have until July to express their interest to the federal government One company based in Washington DC has shown interest in Southern California Edisons grid TransElect executive vice president Robert L Mitchell said he plans to send a letter next week to Edison chief John Brys on offering to buy the grid for billion PUC to determine role in handling SoCal Edison deal By Justin Pritchard ASSOCIATED PRESS June SAN FRANCISCO Californias top power regulators are expected to decide Thursday what role they should play in handling a deal where Southern California Edison would sell its power lines to the state in an effort to avoid bankruptcy The fivemember California Public Utilities Commission faces a lengthy agenda but nothing will be more spotlighted than a series of proposals tha t would begin to clear the way for approval of a deal Gov Gray Davis struck with Edison on April But before the PUC will push through the deal its members must vote on whether they have legal authority over it said PUC President Loretta Lynch Davis on Wednesday warned that time is growing short for legislative action I believe the patience of Edisons creditors is wearing very thin he said Im beginning to see the same signs as with PGE before that utility declared bankruptcy Senate leader John Burton DSan Francisco said the Legislature and the public need to know exactly what is in the deal and would hold hearings on the it as soon as next week Davis and Edison signed a Memorandum of Understanding on April The commission plans to address several items in that MOU at the meeting Thursday including a decision on delaying a review of how much Edison charges customers for power until On Wednesday the PUC voted to approve a version of a deal that Edison struck with smaller generators called qualifying facilities It should le t these plants keep churning out power as they look to collect more than billion that PGE and Edison owe them Lynch said Small generators account for about onethird of the states daily power supply But many powered down because Edison and nowbankrupt PGE didnt p ay for months of power they used earlier this year The commissionapproved plan offers stable rates for five years to generato rs using wind solar geothermal or other renewable sources It also raises th e rates the utilities must pay to gasfired generators Small generators have said they will suspend their lawsuits against Edison for days if they receive back payments Under the deal Edison will pay at least percent of what it owes to qualifying facilities If they pay back what they owe us the lawsuits would be dismissed and the claims would be settled said Jerry Bloom a spokesman for the California Cogeneration Council which represents many small natural gasfired power generators Wednesdays vote should also help Californias power managers in their dail y search for enough power to avert more rolling blackouts during the summer Lynch said She said that while the small generators could have received a higher rate for their power by breaking their contracts and selling electricity on the open market the deal guarantees the states utilities will buy the power It gives them stability Lynch said Having the qualifying facilities on line this summer is so crucial In March the PUC ordered PGE and Edison to pay qualifying facilities for power delivered starting in April Since that cash began to flow many smal l generators have kickstarted their operations adding much needed power to the grid Davis called the PUC approval a substantial move forward But the qualifying facilities agreement the PUC approved Wednesday might fa ll apart if the Legislature doesnt approve a Davis larger rescue plan to buy Edisons transmission lines Lynch said she hopes to resolve most outstanding matters on the Edison agreement at a PUC meeting scheduled for June She called the day tim e frame Davis gave to resolve the issue arbitrary and said the PUC is pushi ng ahead at an amazingly quick pace Lynch said however that while Edison officials have pressured regulators to approve the deal they have not fully cooperated during PUC hearings She said that while Edison has not cooperated with PUC requests for information during hearings on the deal the utility has pressured the PUC to rubber stamp its agreement with Davis Edison officials objected to Lynchs assertion that the utility was less th an forthcoming saying any insinuation that it has not fully cooperated with a ll of the PUCs requests and investigations is wrong and offensive On the Net wwwcpuccagov Customers feel pain of energy surcharges By Frank Green UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June Roland Hogue is getting nickelanddimed to death by the energy crisis It seems that everywhere the retired General Dynamics worker shops these da ys be it the diner cleaners or florist hes forced to cough up a surcharge to help the business defray its soaring electricity costs Such incremental charges are separate of course from his home utility bil l which has more than doubled in the last year Its getting ridiculous said Hogue who was waiting yesterday afternoon in front of the Pacific Theatres at Grossmont Center to buy a ticket priced with an extra cent surcharge advertised on a nearby sign Im on a fixe d income I need every penny I can save California residents have for months endured rolling blackouts and spiking electricity rates Now theyre increasingly paying extra energy fees at the corner shop And many arent taking the drubbing in stride You can see the increased checks at Dominos where customers calling for pizza delivery are warned in a recorded message that a cent energy surcharge will be tacked onto their bill Or at parks like the San Diego Zo o extra per ticket and hotels such as the Hyatt Regency in La Jolla a perroom surcharge and the Sheraton Harbor Island We didnt have a choice because our gas and electric bill has gone from a month to a month Bruce Ross the manager at Boulevard Cleaners Laundry said about the cent utility surcharge the business recently added to each customer invoice We could have folded our costs in to the overall bill but we wanted our customers to know where the money was going The fee has been costly to Boulevard Several customers miffed by the charg e have picked up their clothes and stormed out for good Ross said A few companies have been forced to rescind their energy surcharge after negative reactions from customers Taco Bell for instance this week reluctantly withdrew the cent energy surcharge it imposed at some of its Southern California outlets on Friday after it was inundated with consumer complaints Taco Bell which did not specify how many stores issued the surcharges sai d it had added them to offset power cost increases Some people are getting nasty one local Dominos clerk said about the companys surcharge They cuss at you and hang up the phone San Diegobased Jack in the Box is among companies that have opted to raise prices instead of imposing surcharges Primarily because of higher energy costs the firm hiked the prices of its Jumbo Jacks and tacos by percent in the first quarter and is about to institute another round of price increases that will be lower than before spokeswoman Karen Bachmann said Increase temporary Analysts say many businesses are choosing the surcharge over raising prices because consumers understand that energy costs are soaring The surcharge also implies that the fee will be temporary Raising prices in this very competitive environment has been tough to do f or the last five years said George Whalin president of Retail Management Consultants in San Marcos By adding a surcharge retailers can package it and soften the blow Meanwhile consumers in other parts of the country likewise are beginning t o feel the pinch of energy surcharges especially at hotel chains Hotel officials say the surcharges are a temporary response to the higher costs of natural gas and electricity Hilton Hotels Corp Wyndham International Bass Hotels Resorts Inc Starwood Hotels Resorts Worldwide Inc and Marriott International have tacked on the surcharges to guests hotel bills in among other places Boston Chicago Dallas and Miami The highest fees have been in New York City where Marriott International recently was charging per room per night in all of its Manhattan hotels Charles Porter general manager of the Sheraton Steamboat Resort in Steambo at Springs Colo has so far resisted implementing a surcharge despite a percent jump in natural gas prices Porter said many large groups book their rooms months and even years in advance and changing the contract could lead to cancellations Were reacting to competitive conditions that change on a daily basis Porter said Costs jumped Porter said his gas and electric bills for January February and March totaled compared with during the same period last year Figures for April and May are not available because the hotel is closed tho se months You just dont budget for that Porter said Not only do hotels buy electricity from natural gaspowered generating plants they also use the fuel for heating cooking and laundering tons of linens every day Most chains have taken conservation measures including installing lowwattage light bulbs adjusting thermostats and cutting down on exterior lighting Some suggest to guests who are staying multiple nights that they not have their towels and bed linens changed each day Right now the costs are so astronomical that we have to take other steps a s well and add the surcharge said

this report Frank Greens email address is His phone number is Chula Vista to get larger peakuse power plant By Amy Oakes UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June The California Energy Commission yesterday approved plans for a megawatt peakuse power plant to be built in Chula Vista despite the citys objections Ramco Inc will begin construction of the natural gasfired combustion turbine generator by June at the companys site at Main St said Dale Mesple a Ramco consultant The location already houses a megawatt peakuse plant The new facility must be operational by Sept according to Gov Gray Davis emergency procedure for siting plants This is the th license granted for plants that will only be used during peak periods when power supplies are low according to the governors Web site Chula Vista having already approved plans for the companys first peakuse plant in September opposed the additional facility citing increases in noise and air pollution The commission in response directed Ramco to comply with the special landuse conditions placed on the megawatt plant The larger plant must conform to all applicable local state and federal landuse requirements including general plan policies zoning regulations and local development standards The commission also required Ramco to extend a planned sound wal l completely around the facility Mesple said it will not be a problem to extend the wall which was going to be built on the southern side of the acre site and to follow the federal state and local regulations applied to the first plant Im meeting all of the same requirements and qualifications as I would hav e if I had applied through the city Mesple said Councilwoman Patty Davis said it is good that Ramco will have to follow previous regulations such as a decibel noise level threshhold but she still feels the additional plant should not be built here Really I feel like weve done our fair share Davis said referring to th e approval of the first peakuse plant and the South Bay Power Plant But with the governors orders we dont really have any choice The governor in February gave the commission authority to fasttrack peaku se plants that could be operating by Sept Under his plan proposals would be exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act review process Mesple has said the company had not planned to expand its Chula Vista facility until the governors order that reduced a normally to month process to days Ramco submitted a complete application with the commission May The commission held a public hearing and site tour eight days later The city held its

warmwater request By Terry Rodgers UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June Duke Energy which operates the South Bay Power Plant yesterday withdrew i ts request to increase the temperature of its seawater discharge into San Die go Bay The firms action averted a confrontation with environmentalists and government scientists who warned that the hotter water could ultimately ha rm endangered birds and marine life including green sea turtles Appearing before the San Diego Regional Water Quality Board meeting at Chul a Vista City Hall Duke Energy executives said they were dropping their reque st because of a condition proposed by the boards staff The staff was willing to allow a higher temperature as long as Duke Energy would agree to pay to fix any environmental problems arising from the warmwater discharge That condition would require Duke Energy to write a potential blank check by making it responsible for unknown mitigation costs said company spokesm an Thomas C Williams No business could be expected to put itself through th at kind of uncertainty The South Bay plant which generates enough power for homes is allowed to discharge coolant water that is degrees warmer over a hou r average than the natural temperature of the bay The company had asked to increase the limit to degrees Duke executives said their request was made solely to comply with an executive order by Gov Gray Davis urging power companies to generate as mu ch electricity as possible to minimize the likelihood of rolling blackouts thi s summer Raising the temperature limits of the plants coolant water would have enabled it to produce more power during offpeak hours The plant already operates at maximum levels during peak hours when energy is most in demand and that wont change the company

Electricity was cheap and companies routinely won rate hikes to cover their costs burying theft in catchall categories such as line losses according to Lee Cordner a former Pacific Gas Electric

political pressure mounts By RICARDO ALONSOZALDIVAR Times Staff Writer WASHINGTONThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is clearly heedin g external politics as it prepares for a larger role in Californias power crisis but the biggest catalyst for change may be within its walls On the outside a new Democratcontrolled Senate and powerful Republicans in the House have been clamoring for more assertive interventio n But inside two pragmatists recently appointed by President Bush to FERCs fivemember governing board have already compromised the laissezfai re course that Chairman Curtis L Hebert Jr had set for the small insular agency FERCs new power crisis policy to be unveiled at a special board meeting Monday is expected to move closer to the fixed price caps sought b y California leaders FERCs version would allow electricity prices in the We st to move up and down significantly but with upper limits However the plan was still a subject of intense internal debate Thursday at FERC Even after its expected approval by the FERC board it mu st survive additional rounds of political and technical vetting by other key players in the power crisis As California has already learned tinkering with power markets is no easy task and todays solutions can swiftly turn into tomorrows unintende d consequences For Hebert a proud Mississippian and avid freemarket advocate growing impatience with FERC on Capitol Hill is not the only problem He risks losing a working majority on his own commission if the two new member s ally themselves with dissenter William L Massey in favor of stronger intervention That would isolate and embarrass Hebert who is already in a difficult spot because of persistent rumors that Bush will replace him as chairman with newly appointed Commissioner Patrick H Wood III What we see here is someone who is a strong noninterventionist Republican who has found himself in a position where he has to abandon that to some extent said James J Hoecker immediate past FERC chairman in the Clinton administration Chairman Hebert doesnt have to be a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing FERC which functions like a national public utility commission is charged by law with assuring just and reasonable rates for wholesale electricity Last year the commission made a formal finding that prices in California were neither But the modest price mitigation measures it adopted were widely criticized as mere nibbling around the edges Not so says Hebert I dont think there is any doubt that the commissions plan is working and is bringing down prices he told reporter s this week He condemned what he called the ideology of price caps The two new FERC members Wood and Nora M Brownell have not offered ringing endorsements of FERCs actions to date During Senate confirmation hearings last month they indicated they favored closer tighter scrutiny o f industry Wood past chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission and a confidant of the president signaled in interviews that a return to regulation would be preferable to dysfunctional markets that deprive consumers of the benefits of competition No tool is off the table even if its a bad tool Wood told the PBS program Frontline The two newcomers sounded more like Massey the commissions lone inhouse critic than like Hebert the market purist In April when the commission first adopted price limits Massey pointed out flaws that FERC n ow seems poised to address For one he said the limits only applied during power emergencies T he evidence is persuasive that the problem of unfair prices exists hours a day seven days a week Massey said I have no confidence that prices wil l be just and reasonable during all hours Masseys view was voiced by many others as Wood prepared to assume his new job on the panel Wood told The Times in an interview that he heard complaints from Republicans as well as Democrats Prominent among the Republicans demanding more aggressive action by FE RC is Rep Doug Ose of Sacramento author of a bill calling for roundthecloc k price limits throughout the West Massey was no longer a voice in the wilderness In fact how he votes and what he says Monday will be closely watched on Capitol Hill and in California particularly by Democrats looking for an early signal of the plans credibility His viewpoint is considered very highly said Howard Gantman a spokesman for Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif As Masseys stock rose Heberts portfolio was in growing jeopardy The Democratic changeover in the Senate improved the prospects of pric e cap legislation introduced by Feinstein and Sen Gordon Smith ROre Fix ed price caps are anathema to Bush as well as Hebert but may prove politically unstoppable if California electricity costs spiral out of control this summ er The debate has changed from doing nothing to mitigation to doing something punitive said one FERC official who requested anonymity Running out of maneuvering roomand perhaps time as chairmanHebert decided to make a bold move On Monday he announced that he would convene a special commission meeting for next Monday to strengthen FERCs price mitigation plan for California and the West Price mitigation appears to be a way to avoid using the words price cap or costbased rate which some members of the Bush administration fi nd objectionable Feinstein said Frankly I dont care what they call it as long as they get the job done FERC sources said the options being discussed include roundtheclock price limits throughout the West requiring all generators in the region to sell available power during emergencies establishing a framework for large power users to sell back electricity at peak times and tightening rules on energy traders On Tuesday leading House Republicans sent a letter to Hebert endorsin g Oses pricelimit approach giving Hebert some cover on the political right Even if a political compromise can be worked out within FERC more difficulties are bound to arise Thorny technical problems must be addresse d For example Generators have complained that FERCs current price limits force them to sell some power below cost currently no framework exists fo r setting price limits throughout the Western region and FERC has no authori ty over large public generators such as the Bonneville Power Administration Former FERC Chairman Hoecker said Heberts gradual metamorphosis resembles that of California Gov Gray Davis who at first swore he would n ot accept rate increases for consumers Its kind of creeping reform Hoecker said FERC didnt do the most aggressive thing firstjust like the governor of California Everybody is sidling into it incrementally a little bit at a time State Objects to Power Pricing Formula Energy Air quality officials say generators can boost profits by increasin g pollution By GARY POLAKOVIC and MIGUEL BUSTILLO Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTOCalifornia air quality officials charged on Thursday that a federal order to contain electricity prices is vulnerable to manipulation a nd creates powerful incentives for energy companies to increase pollution to boost profits The order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which took effe ct May places a limit on how much generators can charge when the states electricity reserves are depleted The price is based in part on the maximu m cost incurred by any of them to generate a megawatt of electricity State cleanair officials object to that pricing formula In addition to fuel and labor costs power companies can include prices paid for air pollution credits as well as the penalties and fees assessed for producing excessive emissions from power plants running to keep the lights on Air quality officials are concerned that may entice companies to manipulate the price of the credits in order to inflate their overall base costs thereby raising the profit bar for everyone The issue is crucial because FERC is scheduled Monday to consider expanding the price limits to all time periods Nobody else that we can figure out would benefit from this but power generators said Barbara Baird legal counsel for the South Coast Air Quali ty Management District The power companies would all be able to recover that cost regardless of whether they actually incurred that cost Ironically power plants no longer are required to buy and sell credit s to exceed the standards after Gov Gray Davis granted them special relief earlier this year Nonetheless power companies among others continue to actively trade the credits on the open market That practice air quality officials say is driving up the costs of the credits and making it harder for other industries to buy them Because of increased electricity generation the price of pollution credits traded in the Los Angeles region has risen astronomically in the pa st year Credits that traded for about cents per pound of pollution a few years ago now fetch roughly per pound Mike Scheible deputy executive officer for the state Air Resources Board says the federal order also creates incentives for generators to use highpolluting equipment which is more expensive to operate in order to boost the amount they can charge for electricity when rate limits affect pricing Its unfair to make California ratepayers pay more for electricity to mitigate their emissions It doesnt pass the straightface test for being fair Scheible said Since California power prices began to escalate last year third parti es have bought pollution credits and then sold them back to the power companie s at a steep profit air quality managers told state senators at a hearing Thursday Carol Coy deputy executive officer at the AQMD said one company Phoenixbased Pinnacle West reported a air emissions credit purchase on March then sold the same credits March for million Company spokesman Alan Bunnell said the transaction was perfectly lega l and not dissimilar from other trades that routinely occur in the emissions trading market But state Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana chairman of the Senate select committee inquiring into the matter said wholesalers often blame the cost of the credits in part for the high price of electricity He said he is concerned that there has been a laundering of NOx nitrogen oxide credits thats driving up the cost of both the credits and electricity Nitrogen oxide is a smogforming gas caused by fuel combustion It actually would be beneficial for energy companies to have those smog credit costs go higher said state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey Air quality officials aired their objections on Thursday before Dunns committee which is investigating whether companies manipulated California power prices for greater profits after the state deregulated electricity in In recent weeks it has begun to subpoena documents from various ener gy companies and utilities The federal order regulating prices has been widely criticized in California as full of loopholes that will allow power producers to continue making exorbitant profits During official power emergencies spurred by shortages of electricity it requires generators to charge prices based on a complex formula that includes pollution mitigation costs and the price of natural gas Air quality officials have also filed objections with FERC The federa l regulator has been reluctant to interfere in the energy crisis and has continued to defend the free market as a solution to the states power problems but it is under increasing pressure to act The state Senate committee known as the Select Committee to Investiga te Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market was also expected to hea r testimony Thursday from Southern California Edison However in a turn of events that surprised and

Writer Thursday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Demands by the states oil refineries for protection from rolling blackouts should be met a member of the state Public Utilities Commission said yesterday in releasing a draft decision to grant the exemption While the recommendation from PUC Commissioner Carl Wood still faces a full hearing by the fivemember PUC later this month oil industry officials consider it a promising development in their intense lobbying campaign to keep refineries running This is a very good step said Scott Folwarkow spokesman for the Valero refinery in Benicia which has no backup generators to use in blackouts W e do play an essential role and the refinery needs to be protected The industry has repeatedly issued warnings that gasoline prices would soar if refineries were hit by rolling power blackouts Power interruptions of just an hour can send refineries out of commission for days shrinking gas supplies and leading to higher prices Earlier this month San Franciscobased Chevron Corp warned that it would reduce gasoline production at its two California refineries unless it was exempted from power outages Gov Gray Davis has also urged the PUC to designate petroleum refineries as essentialuse customers who are exempt from blackouts because their services are needed for public health and safety A Davis spokesman declined comment on the draft decision last night Skillednursing facilities and water agencies have joined oil refineries in intense lobbying for the essentialuse designation But the PUC has a limited number of exemptions it can offer to businesses By the agencys own standard at least percent of the electrical load mu st be exposed to blackouts Today half of the load is already exempt leaving just a percent margin to divide between facilities Yesterday a PUC administrative law judge issued a companion ruling asking energy producers the California Energy Commission and electric utilities t o provide additional information on fossil fuel production The PUC will consider that information along with public comment when it votes on Woods draft decision June While the economic impacts caused by disruption of fossil fuel production are potentially devastating Wood said the commission must balance these economic impacts against the potential impacts on public health and

roundtheclock Carolyn Lochhead Chronicle Washington Bureau Thursday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Washington Federal regulators are poised to impose roundtheclock price restrictions on wholesale electricity sold to California a move short of what Democrats have urged but far stronger than what the Bush administratio n has for months indicated it was willing to do The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected Monday to extend its April order which limits prices generators can charge during power emergencies to apply at all times and across the entire Western region sources inside the agency confirmed yesterday FERC also is expected to increase market monitoring expand refunds for overcharges by generators during power emergencies and order generators to sell into the Western grid during power emergencies among other things FERC Commissioner William Massey a Democratic appointee who strongly dissented from the April order because he believed it was too narrow would not comment on the expected action other than to say he had been urging greater intervention relentlessly for some time Although power prices are plunging for the first time since the crisis bega n Massey said it was too soon to declare victory We dont know whats going to happen in the next hour or tomorrow or the next month Massey said We are certain this is a market short of power plants Supply and demand are not in reasonable equilibrium and when that is true prices can soar at the drop of a hat and the wealth transfer can b e exorbitant Massey said that until supply and demand came into reasonable balance in California which he expects to occur in months to two years as new powe r plants come on line there has got to be hoursaday sevendaysaweek price mitigation in effect to protect consumers period The expected FERC action coincides with rising political pressure on the agency from Democrats and increasing numbers of Republicans to intervene mo re forcefully in Californias power market despite fierce resistance to price controls from the Bush administration REINFORCEMENTS That pressure ratcheted up sharply when Democrats assumed control of the Senate and began scheduling legislation to order FERC to impose price caps The agencys move also coincides with the arrival of two new Bush appointee s Patrick Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell who are widely viewed as more receptive to intervention than the current chairman Curt Hebert a Republican appointed by former President Bill Clinton and named chairman by President Bush The agencys April order which took effect May puts a ceiling on price s pegged to the least efficient power plant It has been applied during two power emergencies so far Experts are divided on how much if any effect t he order has contributed to the recent sharp drop in prices Many factors fro m cool weather to increased conservation to the return of several nuclear generators that were down for maintenance are also at work Rep Doug Ose a Sacramento Republican who first pushed FERC to expand its April order said yesterday he believed the expected new action would provi de a pretty good middle ground between Democrats call for a specific maximu m price or cap the generators can charge and the Bush administrations opposition to price controls Rep Darryl Issa an Oceanside Republican added that the agencys action w as part of a pattern of escalating engagement by the administration and a more activist FERC AS LONG AS IT WORKS Sen Dianne Feinstein said the action expected Monday was likely to fall short of what she wanted although she called it another step forward While FERC is likely to avoid using the words price caps to describe its plan it called its original order price mitigation Feinstein said I dont care what you call it as long as it works Feinstein testifying yesterday at a Government Affairs Committee hearing o n energy said she believed the new order would still permit price manipulati on because the caps are set at the price charged by the least efficient therefore highest cost and most polluting generators Feinsteins bill to force FERC to impose price caps until is scheduled for committee action this month She wants firm price caps based on each generators costs much like the regulatory regime in place before Californias electricity restructuring Some economists argue however that the type of price controls FERC is expected to use more closely correspond to the price that a functioning market would produce Price caps have become the nexus of the entire Washington debate over Californias electricity crisis The Bush administration contends that pric e controls would make blackouts worse by discouraging electricity sales and investment while Democrats led by Feinstein and California Gov Gray Davi s contend that generators are deliberately withholding power to jack up price s OBJECTIONS TO CONTROLS WITHER Republicans on Capitol Hill many of whom face reelection next year have shown less resistance to price controls and that resistance melted even mo re yesterday after a letter from several House Republicans urged FERC to intervene more forcefully Still most of the Republicans now urging greater federal regulation of electricity markets hail from California Republicans from outside the stat e yesterday blasted Davis for mishandling the crisis and blaming the Bush administration for not helping The efforts to place the blame on the current administration or hire a month consultants to spin the issue do not help said Sen Fre d Thompson RTenn referring to two highpriced political aides Davis has hired Some suggest temporary price controls through Thompson said While that may get us through the next election temporary price controls have rarely stayed temporary Sen Larry Craig an Idaho Republican argued there were a host of reasons for Californias blackouts from a drought in the Northwest to a shortage o f power plant construction across the West Leave it to politicians running scared and looking for scapegoats to obfuscate this otherwise obvious reality Craig said Put simply and bluntly this reality does not suit the political needs of Gov Davis and his compatriots Energy at a glance Energyrelated developments yesterday PUC TELLS EDISON TO PAY OF BILL OWED TO SMALL FIRMS Small companies that need cash to continue generating power will be paid percent of their back bills by Southern California Edison under an order passed yesterday by the state Public Utilities Commission The measure is one of the remedies designed to ensure that small power plants stick with their contracts to sell electricity to Californias three cashstrapped utilities Pacific Gas and Electric Co has already been ordered by a bankruptcy judge to pay percent of its back debt to its sma ll generators San Diego Gas and Electric Co had no outstanding bills The commission also opened the door to higher rates for small suppliers tha t can prove their operating costs are not being covered by a state payment formula Others can opt for a new fixedrate contract All can earn higher rates if they boost their power output DAVIS SAYS PRICES FALLING ON SPOT MARKET Gov Gray Davis released new figures yesterday showing that the state has been able to secure lower prices on the spot

cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews A day after Gov Gray Davis agreed to release previously withheld details o f the states longterm energy contracts his attorney asked for a twoweek delay But a judge ordered the state to disclose edited versions of the contracts tomorrow San Diego Superior Court Judge Linda Quinn scheduled another hearing for Ju ne to decide whether more details of the longterm deals should be disclose d and whether shortterm energy contracts should be released over Davis opposition Since the state started buying power for customers of Californias reeling utilities in January Davis has refused to make the contracts public sayin g disclosure would reveal the states negotiating strategies give power sellers an advantage and drive prices up In court documents the governor s lawyers said the information should remain secret until January when the states current power purchasing authority expires News organizations including The Chronicle and eight Republican legislato rs sued for disclosure saying the documents were public records that would le t Californians evaluate the spending of billions of tax dollars On Tuesday Davis reversed course and said he was willing to make public immediately the details of billion in longterm contracts with suppliers if the judge released the state from confidentiality agreements i n the contracts The governor said that market conditions had improved and th at enough contracts had been signed that disclosure would not seriously damage the states bargaining position He gave reporters a few more details yesterday acknowledging that the stat e was locked into some longterm contracts at prices above those now availabl e on the spot market We were paying a lot more in January and February than we are now on the spot market because we have dramatically shrunk the spot market providing reliable power for California at affordable rates Davis said In court yesterday however Deputy Attorney General Timothy Muscat sought to delay contract disclosure two weeks to give the energy sellers who are n ot parties to the lawsuit time to comment But the judge said the states failure to keep contracting companies abreas t of the suit did not justify delaying disclosure Quinn ordered the longter m contracts released Friday after the state deletes details that would reveal suppliers trade secrets and other proprietary information Muscat said the state would edit out several categories of information he described as technical including energy delivery points and data on suppliers efficiency in converting natural gas to electricity News media lawyer Alonzo Wickers IV protested any deletions Keeping those socalled technical issues secret thwarts the publics understanding of the contracts he said Quinn said she would consider objections to the deletions at the June hearing Muscat the states lawyer contended secrecy was essential for deal making in the volatile shortterm

demanded Wednesday that power generators refu nd California nearly billion in electricity charges It is unconscionable for the generators to profit from their egregious overcharges Davis told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee Davis testimony highlighted a change in political tactics in the states power crisis after a Monday order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissi on expanding wholesale price relief for California and other Western states And the governor got some support from two FERC members who said Wednesday that they are prepared to order Californias energy suppliers to make heavy refunds because of overcharging But the two commissioners Pat Wood III and William Massey agreed with their FERC colleagues that California officials and energy companies should be given a chance to settle the multibilliondollar refund dispute in the next three weeks before the commission acts the Washington Post reported During his testimony Davis gave tepid praise to FERC which he said final ly took a positive step in imposing the limits But he continued to press the independent agency to recover what he said were overcharges The FERC has been on a sitdown strike because we havent received a dime Davis said The commissions action on price controls has been wellreceived diminishi ng appeals among West Coast Democratic governors and lawmakers and a handful o f Republicans for congressionally mandated caps But the commissions order didnt quiet demands that generators be required to pay back overcharges and Davis led the charge Wednesday to exploit that issue Davis said the California Independent System Operator the Folsombased agency that manages the states power grid found the state was billed billion more than the competitive market would have warranted for power deliveries for the months ending June Davis insisted that FERC move promptly to order the energy companies to gi ve back the money and that Congress should help pressure the agency to do so I do believe that FERC should get a clear signal on refunds from this committee Davis told the Democratcontrolled panel during a hearing into whether FERC has responded properly to the crisis The energy commission has ordered reviews of about million in potentia l overcharges in the past several months But that amount is dwarfed by the billion that Davis is now seeking in refunds While the commission is continuing to review possible overcharges it has y et to order a single dollar in refunds The power generators deny they have overcharged California saying market conditions and the utilities shaky credit ratings warranted high prices Wood and Massey who talked to the Post after their testimony Wednesday before the committee said they are ready to require generators and markete rs to refund revenue that exceeded the price ceilings imposed by FERC on Monda y We should have given the California parties guidance on refunds Massey told the Post A good place to start was to take Mondays order and appl y it starting October and see what you get in refunds Depending on the time period and whether private generators and municipal utilities would be required to pay the refunds could exceed billion so me energy attorneys calculated Wednesday In its Monday order the commission said it wanted all the parties to sit down with an administrative law judge to see if they could work out a refun ds settlement The settlement conference begins Monday Commission Chairman Curt Hebert told the Senate panel at Wednesdays hearin g that if no deal is reached after three weeks the commission would seek advice from the judge on how it might order a resolution The commission stands ready to act expeditiously Hebert pledged While Davis took the offensive at Wednesdays hearing Republicans didnt give him a free ride The Republican National Committee passed out hand fan s touted as Gray Davis solution for summer blackouts The fans were paid for by a small Sacramento Republican consulting firm MB Associates The questioning by the committees chairman Sen Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and other Democrats was friendly But Republicans tried to pai nt Davis as the culprit in a crisis he could have solved a year ago How did you let things get totally out of hand asked Sen Fred Thompson of Tennessee the committees senior Republican Davis said his administration began the push to build new generating plants to meet the impending power shortage four months after he took office in I make no apologies for the aggressive actions weve taken the governor said Republican lawmakers warned that demanding refunds could actually add to Californias power woes if energy investors become spooked about sanctions and take their business elsewhere resulting in a decreased electricity supply Under pointed questioning from Thompson Davis shot back The people I represent are mad They want us to fight back Davis said Obviously we want the state to be an attractive place for investment But we dont want companies walking all over our citizens Separately the top Republican on the Senates Energy and Natural Resources Committee said it was unrealistic and perhaps unfair for Davis to expect FERC to immediately order refunds Theyre going to have to go back to court and prove these charges that indeed there was manipulation in the marketing of power And thats going to be very difficult to do said Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska Even if a refund deal is reached its uncertain how much of an effect it might have Of the billion identified by the ISO roughly twothirds o f that was incurred by California utilities that still owe generators billion s of dollars for past power deliveries Hebert also noted that ratepayers in other Western states would have to be included in refund considerations Meanwhile Sens Dianne Feinstein DCalif and Gordon Smith ROre said Wednesday that because of FERCs action they were pulling back their bill at least for now to require that wholesale prices in the West be set at th e cost of production plant by plant plus a margin of profit However House Democrats said that while they were happy the commission had taken action they still want a vote on a tougher pricecap proposal offere d by Democratic Reps Jay Inslee of Washington and Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco The Bees David Whitney can be reached at or The New York Times contributed to this report Energy Digest State moves to tax plants Published June In a move aimed at squeezing more tax revenue from large instate power generators the state Board of Equalization on Wednesday edged closer to stripping local governments of their authority to tax power plants State Controller Kathleen Connell a member of the board proposed that the state take over the assessments The amount local governments may assess power plants is limited by Proposition but the state is able to place higher values on the properties Supporters of the move say the state could collect million to million more than local governments But the boards staff while acknowledging that the state could extract mor e from power plants than local governments during the current energy crisis said it is unclear what would happen to the price of power and value of pow er plants in the future Local governments worried that the new assessment system could shortchange their revenues opposed the move But the board which voted unanimously to give the plan tentative approval said the Legislature intends to distribut e the power plant money as though it were taxed locally Plants producing fewer than megawatts and cogeneration facilities would be exempted from the rule change The bill closely resembles AB by Assemblywoman Carole Migden DSan Francisco which has been approved by th e Assembly and awaits Senate action Bee Capitol Bureau Davis demands nearly billion for electricity overcharges By H Josef Hebert ASSOCIATED PRESS June WASHINGTON California Gov Gray Davis demanded that power generators r efund nearly billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal regulators have looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the Federal Ener gy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in California and other Western states was a step forward But its actions do nothing about the overcharges over the past year he said The governor a Democrat has been criticized by Republicans who charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of hand Customers might have to pay debt advocate says Continuing coverage Californias Power Crisis Davis defended his actions saying the state has stepped up approval for ne w power plants and strengthened conservation programs He also said the state has little control over price gouging by outofstate power generators The governor once said he could solve Californias problems in minutes But it appears that California has continued to try and hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities putting California taxpayers in jeopardy said Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities not under FERC jurisdiction Sen Joe Lieberman DConn chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee said the FERC which regulates wholesale electricity sales has been slow t o respond and surprisingly reluctant to assure that electricity prices are just and reasonable as required by the Federal Power Act The agencys response to the Western power problem raises serious question s about whether FERC has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy markets not only in the West but across the rest of the country The federal agency whose commissioners were to testify later in the day imposed limited marketbased price caps on Monday in California and oth er Western states from Washington to Arizona The agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues Months ago the FERC singled out million in alleged overcharges by pow er generators The power companies have since challenged the agencys findings and the matter remains in dispute To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California complained Davis He said that between May and the beginning of this month power generators are believed to have overcharged California billion They must be required to give us back our money said Davis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The state spent billion for electricity in and billion in and is projected to pay nearly billion this year said Davis Power generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market h e said Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the problem He said newly approved power plants will provide additional megawatts of electricity by including megawatts by the end of this summer Everything that can be done to bring reliable affordable energy to California is being done except wholesale price relief he said This administration has minimized this crisis for more months said Sen Patty Murray DWash alluding to President Bushs repeated refusal to urg e the FERC to mitigate electricity prices Bush has strongly opposed price controls although he indicated support for FERCs limited price mitigation effort this week Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that businesses can get lowincome loans and require that FERC press its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not only in California but in the Pacific Northwest where electricity prices have also skyrockete d Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price caps based o n the cost of generation at individual power plants Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and reasonable pri ce is laughable said Sen Fred Thompson of Tennessee the committees rankin g Republican Hard price caps dont work when supply is the problem The y make a bad situation worse he said After FERC issued its limited price control order this week Senate Democra ts on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to require more stringent costbased price caps on Western electricity sales Democrats in the House however said they would continue to pursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action Davis spars with GOP senators over electricity rates By Finlay Lewis and Joe Cantlupe COPLEY NEWS SERVICE June WASHINGTON California Gov Gray Davis sparred with Senate Republicans Wednesday as he blamed federal regulators for averting their gaze from an alleged billion scheme to bilk the states electricity consumers Testifying in front of the Senates Government Affairs Committee Davis demanded that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC order power companies to refund the overcharges But the governor also found himself obliged to ward off GOP claims that Davis own policies triggered the state s energy crisis The partisan giveandtake reflected the mounting political stakes involved in Californias plight With both parties preparing for next years congressional elections the subtext of Davis testimony appeared to involv e a recognition that the states energy problems could affect the outcome of several California races How did you let things get so totally out of hand asked Sen Fred Thomps on of Tennessee the committees ranking Republican as he greeted Davis who made a longawaited appearance here after weeks of transcontinental sniping over assigning responsibility for the states energy woes Thompsons question could have been lifted from the script of a millio n GOP advertising campaign launched earlier this week in California that attempts to put the governor on the spot for the energy crisis Davis rebuttal involved a long recitation of his moves to bring more power on line in the state and to encourage greater conservation Weve been working on this for a very long time and to suggest otherwise would be inaccurate he told Thompson Saying that he is determined to hold FERCs feet to the fire on the refun d issue Davis complained to the committee It is unconscionable that the commission looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion Recent public opinion polls show that Davis has lost substantial ground wit h California voters since the electricity crisis hit but Wednesdays round o f activities here found him on the offensive Obviously this is the equivalent of a political nuclear weapon for him observed Norm Ornstein a congressional affairs expert at the American Enterprise Institute Several hours after Davis completed his testimony the five FERC commissioners appeared before the committee but they largely ignored the governors accusations On Monday FERC issued an order restricting energy prices in California and much of the West for the next months and setting up a procedure for reviewing refund claims The commission is not ducking these issues said FERC Chairman Curtis L Hebert However there remains a substantial gap between Davis calculation of electricity overcharges in California and the million in refunds assessed so far by FERC The struggle over refunds will enter a new phase on Monday when the review procedure outlined by FERC will begin before FERCs chief administrative la w judge Curtis L Wagner Jr Pairing off against the power companies will be senior officials of the Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid Davis told reporters that it was the ISO that produced the billion estimate of Californias electricity overcharge To date not a single penny has been returned to Californians Davis told the committee It is unconscionable that the generators be allowed to keep these egregious overcharges California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is reviewing possible price gougin g and Davis said later he would anticipate some strong action coming out of his office before the end of the summer Davis expects to meet on Monday in Sacramento with Bushs two new FERC GOP appointees Pat Wood III and Nora Brownell about natural gas discrepancie s in California California was paying two to three times more in natural gas and the president agreed with me this is something that could be fixed Davis told a press conference after meeting with the California congressional delegation Reps Duncan Hunter REl Cajon and Darrell Issa RVista were among the Republicans who met with Davis It was a good meeting with the governor Hunter said adding that FERC h as taken steps to lock down prices and the results speak for themselves I think we are all working together and its a good sense of common ground That was not the mood in the committee hearing however Sparring with Davis Thompson argued that there had been ample advance warnings of the crisis including a report foreseeing an imminent ener gy shortage and the fact that the state was undergoing a rapid period of economic growth spurred by the energyintensive hightech industry Did you see those developments Thompson asked Did they cause you concern Davis sought to shift the focus back to his predecessor Gov Pete Wilson and the State Legislature that designed an energy deregulation plan now widely recognized as having been seriously flawed However he said those problems did not become apparent until last year Thompson also criticized Davis recent rhetoric castigating the power companies for price gouging and suggested that the tactic could backfire by dissuading the energy sector from making needed investments in the states power infrastructure The people I represent are mad replied Davis They want us to fight bac k and thats what Im doing He said he is determined that the state cease serving as a cash cow to a l ot of energy companies Poway not proceeding on power plant proposal Council worried about financial burden By Brian E Clark UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June POWAY Citing financial risks the City Council has pulled the plug on a proposed million power plant in the South Poway Business Park Though there was no formal vote Mayor Mickey Cafagna told City Manager Jim Bowersox who was lukewarm at best to the proposed plant that his staf f should not spend any more time or money on the project Socalled peaker plants are small lessefficient plants that can produce up to megawatts of electricity Usually they run only several hours a da y when demand is greatest At the council meeting Tuesday night Cafagna said he saw little reason to invest in the plant especially since there are no guarantees that Poway could claim any of the power it produced Instead he said the city should monitor a plan put forth by Rep Duncan Hunter REl Cajon that would coordinate the use of diesel generators owne d by large businesses to help avoid the blackouts that are expected to plague the state this summer If the council had chosen to proceed with the peakerplant proposal an idea it first explored in March it would have had to pay San Diego Gas Electric Co up to to go through the application process An additional would have been authorized for a consultant Those two figures made City Council members blanch Im not willing to commit any of the publics money

Jacob She was looking fo r a way to offer relief to seniors and the disabled who are particularly vulnerable to heat exhaustion and dehydration Jacob said she was concerned that many seniors might not use their air conditioners this summer because of high electric bills Or they would have to suffer through a power outage during a rolling blackout She said she wants to avoid a disaster like the one in Chicago in Mor e than residents most of them elderly died when the power went out duri ng a heat wave The buildings identified as cool zones include senior centers libraries enclosed shopping malls and even courthouses Some of the cool zones such as senior centers or libraries may have planned programs but other buildings will simply provide a place to get out of the heat If people want to read on their own or knit or chat at least there will b e places for them to cool off said Denise Nelesen spokeswoman for the coun ty Office of Aging and Independence Services which is coordinating the

remains a substantial gap between Davis calculation of electricity overcharges in California and the million in refunds assessed so far by FERC which have been contested by power generators The struggle over refunds enters a new phase Monday when the review procedu re outlined by FERC will begin before the commissions chief administrative la w judge Curtis Wagner Jr Facing off against the power companies will be senior officials of the Independent System Operator which runs the California power grid Davis told reporters that it was the ISO that produced the billion estimate of Californias electricity overcharge To date not a single penny has been returned to Californians Davis told the committee It is unconscionable that the generators be allowed to keep these egregious overcharges Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif yesterday introduced legislation to provide f or refunds The power companies although acknowledging huge profits have denied allegations of price gouging or market manipulation There has been no evidence to suggest that suppliers bilked anyone Mark Stultz a vice president of the Electric Power Supply Association told the Associated Press California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is reviewing possible price gougin g and Davis said after the hearing he anticipated some strong action from Lockyer in the next few months Davis said he plans to meet on Monday in Sacramento with Bushs two new FER C appointees Pat Wood III and Nora Brownell about natural gas discrepancie s in California Davis said California has been paying up to three times more for natural gas than elsewhere in the country The president agreed with me this is something that could be fixed Davis told a reporters after meeting with the California congressional delegation Reps Duncan Hunter of El Cajon and Darrell Issa of Vista were among the Republicans who met with Davis It was a good meeting with the governor Hunter said adding that FERC h as taken steps to lock down prices and the results speak for themselves I think we are all working together and its a good sense of common ground That was not the mood in the committee hearing however Sparring with Davis Thompson argued that there had been ample advance warnings of the crisis He noted a report forecasting an imminent ener gy shortage and the fact that the state was undergoing a rapid period of economic growth spurred by the energyintensive hightech industry Did you see those developments Thompson asked Did they cause you concern Davis sought to shift the focus back to his predecessor Republican Gov Pe te Wilson and the state Legislature which approved an energy deregulation pl an now widely recognized as seriously flawed However he said those problems did not become apparent until last year Thompson also criticized Davis recent rhetoric castigating the power companies for pricegouging and suggested that the tactic could backfire by dissuading the energy sector from making needed investments in the states power infrastructure The people I represent are mad replied Davis They want us to fight bac k and thats what Im doing He said he is determined that the state cease serving as a cash cow to a l

Electric Co is trying to enter Californias transmission lines business Although TransElect a twoyearold company based in Washington has no experience in the transmission business it has the financial support of GE s billion financial arm GE Capital TransElects latest offer comes as Gov Gray Davis seeks legislative approval for his plan to buy the transmission lines of both San Diego Gas Electric and Southern California Edison Any involvement by GE in the states transmission grid could be a conflict of interest said a key lawmaker involved in the efforts to end Californias yearlong power crisis Youve got someone with generation and transmission systems how do they keep them separate and do they said Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek Thats a concern for me Would they have the ability to restrict competitors access to transmissions TransElect first made overtures to buy the transmission lines in February offering more than billion for those owned by SDGE Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Although Davis has reached a deal with Edison to buy their lines for billion and a billion pact with SDGE TransElect has said it will offe r Edison billion and SDGE million Bob Mitchell TransElects vice president said the company made its offer believing that the Legislature wont approve the deals to buy the two utilities lines GE joined forces with TransElect March when GE Capital Services Structured Finances Group Inc announced it had bought a minority stake in the company Neither company would reveal the size of the investment But a GE statement said its investment enables GE Capital Global Energy to coinvest with TransElect as it acquires transmission assets throughout th e US Now however both GE and TransElect are trying to downplay their relationship Ken Koprowski a GE spokesman said the company made a small financial investment and were not involved in the management of the company He add ed that the company invests in many other energy projects including power plants Theres no connection with what were doing in California and GE Mitchel l said What Koprowski and Mitchell call a lowprofile arrangement has generated lobbying activity Several lawmakers said they had met with Mitchell about TransElects offer GE Capital hired lobbyist Phillip Schott a week after investing in TransElect Schott referred calls to GEs lobbyist KahlPownall Advocates one of Californias biggest political lobbying firms Fred Pownall KahlPownalls head referred all questions on the bill to GE Capital headquarters In California many hurdles remain for TransElect First the Legislature would have to kill the deals with SDGE and Edison Then the companies woul d have to turn to TransElect to buy their lines So far utility leaders are skeptical Edison CEO John Bryson rejected the TransElect offer Tuesday calling it a phony bid by an unknown company We dont know this company I suppose nobody does Bryson said at a town hall meeting in Los Angeles The reason the transmission lines are in the deal is that we consider it our responsibility to try to stay serving our customers as a healthy utility Other than the governors offer the transmission system isnt for sale Bryson said TransElect remains interested in investing in California but has postpone d sending a letter offering billion for Edisons lines Mitchell said I think its potentially an attractive deal when we can create the right climate for it Mitchell said From the perspective of the people of California its one less financial obligation they have to take on The Memorandum of Understanding between Edison and the governor needs legislative approval by August and many lawmakers have balked at the plan Keeley said he isnt convinced that selling the assets to a private company is the best longterm solution for the state Im not prepared at this stage to believe that we should sell something as significant as the transmission system to an entity that is not regulated b y the state and where our ability to have anything to say about the transmission system is in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions venue he said Should the Davis plan fail Mitchell says his offer would remain It appears to me and many other people that the Legislature is not going t o allow the people of California to pay an excessively high price he said The billion offer is a very strong price Mitchell said he doesnt blame the utilities for rejecting his initial offers since the governor has promised more But he stressed that the company has a future in the industry and plans to go public eventually Formed in TransElect is trying to be the countrys first national transmission company As utilities deregulate they are allowed to sell assets including the transmission lines The American Transmission Company a private transmission company based in Wisconsin has a similar mission as TransElect but not the level of financial backing said ATC spokeswoman Maripat Blankenheim Theyre out

Staff Writer WASHINGTONCalifornia Gov Gray Davis seeking to shift the focus of the energy debate urged Congress on Wednesday to turn up the political hea t on federal regulators to help California recover billion in estimated overcharges by power generators Davis told a Senate panel that the order issued Monday by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to limit Western electricity prices was a ste p in the right direction But more aggressive action is needed he said to give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us Gov Gray Davis wipes his brow outside the Capitol after discussing his remarks to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee AFP Davis remarks to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee suggest th at the political warfare between Sacramento and Washington did not end with FERCs decision to police wholesale electricity prices more aggressively By demanding federal intervention to recover money already paid to pow er generators Davis continued to insist that the Bush administration and federal regulators must share responsibility for solving the states energy problems Yes they have provided some relief Davis said of FERCs price mitigation mandate But thats only half the job The other half of the jo b is give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us On his first trip to Capitol Hill since Democrats took control of the Senate Davis appeared before a Governmental Affairs Committee that display ed more sympathy toward his administration than it did when Republicans ruled it One committee member fellow Democrat Robert Torricelli of New Jersey bluntly warned FERC We are watching how the people of California are treated and we are watching very very closely Davis noted that federal regulators have already determined that wholesale power rates charged to California were unjust and unreasonable Even so he said not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California Governor Calls Rates Egregious Its unconscionable if generators are allowed to keep these egregious overcharges Davis said imploring the committee to hold FERCs feet to t he fire Californias electricity grid operator has calculated that the state paid about billion more than a competitive market would warrant for electricity from May to May So far FERC has only identified abo ut million in possible overcharges which were confined to January and February To some extent FERC has already agreed to play a bigger role in seeki ng refunds although not necessarily the full billion that Davis is seeking Next week representatives of the state electric utilities and power generating companies are scheduled to begin talks in Washington on possible refunds California Gov Gray Davis testifies before a Senate committee He implored its members to hold FERCs feet to the fire AFP The settlement conference which begins Monday is scheduled to run fo r consecutive days including weekends which is unusual for a regulatory proceeding Presiding over the conference will be Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis L Wagner Jr who admonished participants Wednesday to make sure th at they send representatives who have authority to approve any agreements reached during the negotiations Wagner can extend the conference if necessary The purpose of the conference is to settle past accounts and structure new arrangements for Californias energy future Wagner said in a scheduling order To reach those goals the parties must agree on how much of the electricity load will be shifted away from the volatile spot market for immediate delivery into stable longterm contracts refunds and creditworthiness matters the order said Edison General Counsel Stephen E Pickett said the utility is pleased that regulators set up the meeting with power generators to discuss refunds to the utilities dating back to Oct Certainly it is a positive step toward resolving many of these issues Pickett said in a conference call Tuesday with creditors San Diego Gas Electric expressed similar muted optimism SDGE has been a supporter of customer refunds and were encouraged that the FERC is working toward a settlement SDGE spokesman Art Larson said But Reliant Energy spokeswoman Pat Hammond expressed skepticism about the billion overcharge figure cited by Davis That number sounds like t he price of all the power theyve bought in the last year in California and w e obviously dont feel that is owed by Reliant and other power producers Donato Eassey a Houstonbased energy analyst for Merrill Lynch said he expects the FERCmediated conference to produce a compromise in which all partiesgenerators utilities and consumersget a haircut But that outcome he suggested might beat the alternatives Youve got to put this problem behind you he said because if you dont youll have a problem of biblical proportions FERC Members Also Before Senate Panel Adding to the pressure for refunds Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif introduced a bill Wednesday that would require FERC to order rebates if federal regulators determine that prices charged were unjust and unreasonable The five members of FERCs governing board also appeared Wednesday before the Senate panel but were scheduled later in the day to avoid a publ ic confrontation with Davis The governor met privately Wednesday with two new board members including Patrick H Wood III a Bush ally from Texas who according to Davis has indicated a more aggressive approach to refunds might be in order Still there was no shortage of partisanship at the committee hearing Republican aides passed out handheld fans bearing the inscription Gray Davis solution for summer blackouts Davis handed out a slick page book detailing steps his administration has taken to ease the powe r crunch The Bush administration issued a Department of Energy study asserti ng that California would face twice as many rolling blackouts if hard price ca ps were imposed on wholesale electricity Davis did not escape a scolding from Republican senators for his criticism of the Bush administrations refusal to impose firm price control s Sen Fred Thompson RTenn pointedly asked Davis how he let things get totally out of hand and excoriated the governor for assigning blame fo r the states problems to the Bush administration federal regulators former Gov Pete Wilson and various corporate pirates He also faulted Davis for not acting sooner to pass on higher wholesale costs to consumers If I passed on a increase to the citizens of California there would be an outrage the likes of which you have never seen Davis responde d Republican senators also challenged Davis on how he hopes to stimulate more power plant construction in California if state officials continue to attack generating companies They noted that the state attorney general eve n suggested that the chairman of one power company deserved to be locked in a cell with an amorous inmate named Spike This is a rough business Davis responded The people I represent a re mad He also told his Republican critics If you were in my shoes and faci ng the extraordinary price increases you would feel as I do Our first obligation is to fight back Davis urged the committee to keep pressure on FERC to rein in natural gas prices which until recently have been as much as eight times higher th an the national average FERC Chairman Curtis L Hebert Jr assured the committee that his agen cy is aggressively pursuing remedies to Californias energy price spikes and supply shortages We have been engaged he said citing more than orde rs issued by the agency to address the power crisis Commissioner William L Massey a Democrat who has urged stronger federal intervention in the electricity markets said he regrets the commission did not act sooner Businesses have closed down putting thousands out of work and hurtin g the Western economy and all because of a broken electricity market he said By acting months ago we could have prevented much of the economi c carnage Despite the tensions Davis elicited some sympathy from even his Republican critics I wouldnt wish your problems on my worst enemy Thompson told Davis Times staff writers Nancy Rivera Brooks in Los Angeles and Thomas S Mulligan in New York contributed to this story House Approves Utility Aid for Needy Congress Bill would add million to program that helps families pay their bills Strict price caps are blocked By JANET HOOK Times Staff Writer WASHINGTONIn its first direct legislative response to the nations burgeoning energy crisis the House on Wednesday approved legislation that would provide an additional million to help lowincome families pay their power bills The bill amounts to a midyear increase of for the billion energy assistance programtwice as much as President Bush had proposed adding to help the poor cope with increases in utility bills Before final action on the bill House Republican leaders blocked Democratic efforts to force votes on a broader response to the energy crisi s in the West strict energy price caps that reach beyond the restraints imposed Monday by federal regulators Republicans argued that price caps would not solve Californias energy problem while Democrats accused the GOP of being cavalier about the crisis faced by consumers This says to the people of the West Your emergency doesnt count to us said Rep Nancy Pelosi DSan Francisco But such assertions were countered by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay RTexas who said Members should reject the siren song of price caps an d remember this Government price controls will mean more blackouts The issue erupted during debate on a billion midyear appropriatio n bill to cover unanticipated costs and emergency expenditures including billion for the Defense Department and million to help the Internal Revenue Service pay the cost of sending out rebate checks authorized by the recently enacted tax cut law The measure passed to In an earlier vote Bush barely escaped an embarrassing slap when Democrats moved to cut the proposed IRS increase by millionthe cost o f a letter the agency is sending to tell taxpayer of their impending tax reba te Democrats complained that the letter which prominently mentions Bush reads like a piece of campaign literature Republicans said it was needed t o save people from calling the IRS about their checks The amendment failed to The bill now goes to the Senate where Democrats are considering an ev en bigger increase in energy aid for the poor Overall the House bill would provide the billion requested by Bush But it would change some spending priorities For instance Bushs Office of Management and Budget objects strongly to provisions that would rescind million in money appropriated for the Federal Emergency Management Agencyjust as the disaster relief agency is facing big outlays to cope with damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison That provision to rescind the money came under attack from Democrats a nd Republicans posing the debates most serious challenge to the bill But an effort to send the bill back to the Appropriations Committee and restore th e money was defeated on a party line vote of to The energy aid for the poor is provided through the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program which helps the poor and elderly pay heating and airconditioning bills In California a family of four must earn less than to be eligible and the average benefit is a year Although Republicans and Democrats have been divided over broad questions of energy policy there has been a bipartisan consensus on more help for needy consumers So despite pressure to hold down the cost of the supplemental spending bill House Republicans doubled Bushs request for billion in additional energy aid GOP leaders blocked on procedural technicalities Democratic amendments to increase the funding even more Republican leaders also fought efforts by Democrats to turn debate on the spending bill into Congress first broadgauged discussion on the nations energy crisis Democrats wanted to offer major energy amendments including one to impose strict costbased price caps on wholesale electrici ty in Californiastricter price restraints than the policy announced Monday b y the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Proponents of the stricter caps echoing complaints by California Gov Gray Davis and others said FERCs order did not go far enough to guarantee relief for consumers against blackouts shortages and price gouging Republicans argued that price caps would be counterproductive and that Californias problems will be solved only by increasing the energy supply Democrats lost a procedural vote that blocked their amendments from coming to a voteIt was an important victory for Republican leaders wh o had feared mounting support for price caps even within their own party However momentum flagged this week after the FERC decision The House bill also includes million for a Defense Department plan to make military bases in California selfsufficient and get them off the states power grid during shortages million for planning and environmental studies for a proposed upgrade in an electrical transmission

MITCHELL LANDSBERG Times Staff Writer As unwelcome as the killer bees as hyped as Pearl Harbor the big bad summer of officially arrived today anddid someone forget to turn out the lights After months of dread the Blackout Summer began on a curiously bright note Despite several days of summerlike weather there was barely a whisp er about blackouts The state that couldnt plug in a night light in January without tripping electrical shortage alarms managed to enter the summer wit h electricity to spare For the moment power supplies look healthy Wholesale electricity prices are a sliver of what they were just a month ago Demand for power is down apparently the result of a successful conservation campaign And California officials appear to have won their monthslong battle with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which imposed price and supply contro ls on the Western electricity market beginning at midnight last night All in all an auspicious beginning for what many have warned would be a dreadful summer So why arent California energy officials blowing up balloons for the big endofcrisis party We are not out of the woods said Richard Sklar the states energy supply czar We are not out of the woods on price and we are not out of t he woods on availability His view is echoed by most of those who closely watch the states electrical market So far Californias supplydemand balance is coming closer to bestcase predictions than to the worst But it is a delicate balance On Wednesday with temperatures hovering around summer norms operator s of the statewide power grid managed to maintainif just barelythe of operating reserves they strive for When reserves dip below that the state begins ascending the ladder of staged emergency declarations that eventuall y lead to blackouts Total electricity use in the state peaked about pm at megawattsa high for the year but well below the states alltime record of megawatts which was set on July State officials credit conservation with shaving off about megawatts an amount that easily means the difference between blackouts or no blackouts on most days There is no doubt in my mind that conservation has led directly to the situation that were in now said Mike Sloss who tracks conservati on for the California Energy Commission Richard Roher who crunches conservation numbers for the commission said consumers appear to be continuing to cut their electricity use by abou t There also has been good news on the supply side of the equation Afte r months in which power plant breakdowns and shutdowns were costing the state as much as megawatts of electricity at a time most plants are now online and outages were down to megawatts Wednesday Most small alternative energy suppliers finally reached agreement thi s week in their epic contract battle with Southern California Edison putting that vital segment of the states energy production back in business And i n the next two weeks the states first two new major power plants in a decad e are scheduled to open adding more than megawatts to the power streamenough to serve about typical homes State officials are also hoping that the FERC ruling which limits prices in the state Western region and requires generators to sell available power to California will ease the situation further Everyone is very interested to see how tomorrow unfolds pricewise a nd supplywise Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for Californias grid operator said Wednesday For all the positive signs no one is predicting that the state will weather the summer without blackouts No one knows how many power plants wi ll break down Nor does anyone know the extent to which Californians best intentions to conserve will melt away in a sustained heat wave While the past few days have been hot they havent been searing It w as in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday in Riverside in Sacramento in Palm Springstoasty but far from the hottest weather any of those places can expect this summer Nor was it unusually hot in surrounding states whose ability to sell power to California depends in part on their own energy needs Electricity use generally rises with the thermometer because air conditioners use more power than most other appliances If it gets hot in California and its also hot in the Northwest and its hot in Phoenix we could run into some significant problems said Jan SmutneyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Assn a trade group for power plant owners in California The state has benefited recently from imports of electricity from the Northwest where snow runoff is cascading through electrical turbines But those imports are expected to dry up later in the summer as stream flowswhi ch have been kept high to assist salmon runsare scaled back to levels that reflect the regions winter drought So the summer of could still be interesting And it may begin wit h a blackout after all For weeks now an email campaign has spread through the Internet calling on people to voluntarily cut off most or all of their power between pm and pm tonight The protest called the Roll Your Own Blackout is the idea of a Southern California artist who worked in tandem with a software engineer fr om Berkeley Their intention is to protest the energy policies recently announced by President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney When you hear Mr Cheney who drafted the energy plan deriding conservation as merely a personal virtue it is as though he believes virtu e has no place in government policy and that would be a very dangerous thing said Dave Aragon the software engineer The California crisis gave birth to their campaign but Aragon said he is hoping that the protest goes beyond the states borders Worldwide would be fine he said Board Votes to Let State Tax Power Plants Proposal Levies on property currently are made by counties The revenue would increase say proponents of change By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOState tax collectors endorsed a proposal Wednesday that could force power plant owners to pay tens of millions of dollars more in taxes next year The fivemember Board of Equalization voted unanimously to assert jurisdiction over the property taxes paid by companies with power plants th at produce more than megawatts Under the boards proposalwhich faces public hearings before it takes effectthe state would seize from counties the authority to tax these plants State control could potentially enrich government coffers because the state would tax the plants based on their fair market value while counties tax power plant owners based on the original value of the plants plus a annual inflation rate Consumer advocates argue that the value of private power plants has skyrocketed in the past year as the price of wholesale electricity soared in the malfunctioning market created under Californias deregulation plan Under deregulation utilities sold power plants to private companie s many of them based out of state for a total of billion They are making exorbitant profits said Lenny Goldberg executive director of the California Tax Reform Assn a nonprofit group largely fund ed by unions He called the power plants vastly underassessed Board of Equalization Chairwoman and state Controller Kathleen Connell said the move is necessary not only because it might bring in more tax revenue but because California itself could soon build power plants or own power lines under plans pushed by Gov Gray Davis We may not be getting the best value through the current system sai d Connell especially if the state proceeds with plans to own plants in California It makes sense to act now to bring all generating facilities under th e same assessment system she said For many decades the Board of Equalization levied property taxes on power plants because they were owned by utilities and regulated by the stat e But in after the launch of deregulation the tax board voted to allow counties to assess property taxes on power plants under a formula set by Proposition the ballot measure that limits property taxes for homeowners and businesses The boards vote Wednesday launches a process of public hearings that could lead to a reversal of that decision Officials from several cities that are home to power plants urged the Board of Equalization to take no action Under the current system cities with power plants get a greater share of property tax revenue which is generally split among local governments and schools Long Beach got about a year in property tax revenue when the state was assessing taxes said city Controller Barbara Hennessy but now gets nearly million a year Shari L Freidenrich treasurer for Huntington Beach said a reversal of the boards tax method could cost the cityhome to a major power plant million a year in property taxes A bill pending in the Legislature by Assemblywoman Carole Migden DSa n Francisco would protect those cities by guaranteeing that they get the sam e proportion of property tax revenue even if the state reasserts control over power plant assessments Goldberg of the California Tax Reform Assn argued that allowing the state to tax plant owners based on market value would bring in more revenue for the entire state As an example he estimated that a big power plant on Monterey Bay own ed by Charlotte NCbased Duke Energy North America would have paid Monterey County at least an additional million in property taxes last year under the proposed method of assessment The plant valued by the county at million is probably worth about billion given market conditions Goldbe rg said The power industry argues that when California lifted state regulation of power plants in those plants became businesses no different from a department store or bakery in terms of property tax status We would expect to be treated like any other business in California h as been treated since Prop went into place said Duke spokesman Tom Williams Davis spinmeisters

NDTLtypeDnews Gov Gray Davis decision to hire the Masters of Disaster two former ClintonGore spin doctors has led to a lawsuit by an antitax group and a refusal by the state controller to pay the two political strategists Since the energy crisis began Davis has hired several nationally known experts to advise him But the recent contract for Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani has opened a political wound in part because the two men are considered fiercely partisan and politically ruthless State Controller Kathleen Connell a Democrat who continually fights with Davis said yesterday that she will refuse to pay Lehane and Fabiani with state funds Their contract is worth for six months Connell said its hard for her to imagine that Lehane and Fabiani are worki ng on state policy as required by law and not politics From my viewpoint youre asking Californians to survive with fewer lights on and youre asking them to assume the burden of billion in longterm debt for power Connell said Its just another slap in the face to ask them to pay for people to explain the situation away The National TaxLimitation Committee a Sacramento group that mostly monitors legislation filed a lawsuit last week alleging that Fabiani and Lehane are violating the Political Reform Act because they also have done work for Southern California Edison as consultants Its considered a conflict of interest for public officials to work on issu es that affect companies that pay them more than either through paycheck s or stock Davis is actively negotiating with Edison on a bailout plan to ke ep the utility from bankruptcy ADDING INSULT TO INJURY Lewis Uhler with the TaxLimitation Committee said We are kind of addin g insult to injury to then have the governor who feels the pressure of this crisis to spend this kind of dough for damage control Secretary of State Bill Jones last week asked the Fair Political Practices Commission to investigate Lehane and Fabiani and their relationship with Edison Jones said the unseemly conflicts of interest by Davis advisers during the energy crisis are increasing the peoples cynicism A spokeswoman for the FPPC said the agency was reviewing Jones complaint Both Lehane and Fabiani have promised to file their required financial disclosure reports this week Now private citizens and communications consultants Lehane and Fabiani worked inside the Clinton White House and for Vice President Al Gore during his failed campaign They earned the nickname Masters of Disaster fo r consistently handling public relations matters during Clintons various scandals Davis spokesman Hilary McLean said Lehane and Fabiani were hired to explain what the state is doing to help solve the crisis on a short and longterm basis She said financial experts are consulting with the governor on the Edison deal They worked in the White House and worked on policy issues McLean said and believe me what they are working on right now is the public policy aspect of the California energy crisis Davis is not the first elected official to hire former political strategist s with public money President Bush put his political strategist Karl Rove in a senior White House position Rove recently revealed that he held stock in an energy trading company that stands to benefit from Bushs energy policy CLEARLY A CONFLICT But state Senate Minority Leader Jim Brulte said the contract for Lehane an d Fabiani is clearly a conflict of interest in regards to Edison and far different from the other consultants Davis has hired Brulte promised he would not vote for a state budget that includes the Lehane and Fabiani contract The governor has hired millions of dollars worth of consultants who are experts on bonds and experts on energy In each of these cases we have giv en him the benefit of the doubt Brulte said There is no doubt here The appropriate people to pay for this is the Gray Davis campaign committee The increased political pressure on Davis comes as several Republicans are entering the race for governor At one time Davis was considered all but invincible in but the energy crisis has badly damaged his standing among voters according to recent polls The governor is also using his own political pressure orchestrated by chie f adviser Garry South Fabiani and Lehane among others to boost his image a nd change federal policy Since Davis has no control

NDTLtypeDnews In a move that consumer advocates hope will raise taxes for energy companie s the state Board of Equalization yesterday proposed taking back authority to set property taxes for large private power plants The board voted to to take steps to reverse a decision it made in to give county assessors the job of evaluating the taxable value of power plan ts sold as part of deregulation Counties are barred from increasing assessments more than percent a year under Proposition The state tax board is free to set higher assessments A coalition of tax reform and environmental groups lauded the change propos ed by State Controller Kathleen Connell saying assessment rules that apply to the counties allow energy firms making huge profits to save millions in property taxes The power companies vowed to challenge the boards plan Board member Johan Klehs said the board is not bound by its decision because the power industry did not live up to its claim that deregulation would bring California lower rates for electricity Klehs said the thinking then was that county assessment would yield a value that was more fair because competition would reduce profits for generators If you didnt keep your end of the bargain I dont see why we should keep ours Klehs said But whether power suppliers would pay more under board authority is open to question No matter who does the evaluation the record profits reaped by energy firms over the past year and a half cannot be considered when their next assessment is made January By then rates for electricity will like ly be lower as more supplies come on line state contracts kick in and federa l price caps continue Connell herself said she did not advocate the change to maximize tax revenues but to ensure the most consistent and most accurate method of setting property tax values for the estimated power plants that will be online in California within a few years This discussion is not about raising taxes or denying the protection of Proposition said Connell She said she proposed the change because the state is gearing up to buy its own power plants and transmission lines and should therefore take a stronger role in setting tax policy for generators Connell challenged estimates of potential multimillion dollar increases in tax revenues advanced by Lenny Goldberg executive director of the Californ ia Tax Reform Association Goldberg said Monterey County should have received at least million mor e in taxes on the Moss Landing plant acquired by Duke Energy which he claime d had made as much as million in profits over the past year Goldberg sa id the other or so plants divested by the utilities were similarly undervalued They are making exorbitant profits Goldberg said They are vastly underassessed But cities that are now benefiting from local assessment of power plants within their borders say the change could have a drastic impact on their finances Under the boards decisions cities where plants are located draw a heftier share of the taxes than they did when the plants belonged to the stateassessed utilities Those cities may keep their enhanced share of the revenues under a bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Carole Migden that would also shift authority fo r power plant assessment to the state board The bill AB passed the assembly and is headed for hearings in the state Senate But city officials said they were still uneasy over the transfer of assessment power to the board saying it could lead to unpredictable fluctuating revenues and possible concessions to big industry Long Beach City Controller Barbara Hennessy cited a past settlement agreeme nt with the utilities that she said dropped evaluations for the power plants they formerly owned My concern is that something like that would happen in

top federal energy regulator told a Senate panel yesterday that he would consider denying power generators the right t o charge market prices for electricity If carried out the suggestion by Patrick Wood one of Bushs two new appointees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would mark a stunni ng aboutface for an agency that until Woods arrival had resisted heavy intervention in Californias electricity market Such a move would hand a huge victory to Gov Gray Davis who earlier in th e day told the Government Affairs Committee that FERC should order power generators to pay California billion in refunds for alleged overcharges Davis arrived in Washington for what had initially been billed as star testimony urging FERC to impose price caps After federal regulators approv ed a form of price controls on Monday Davis swiftly pivoted to demand that FE RC order generators to pay refunds It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state out of billion Davis told panel chairman Joe Lieberma n who had offered Davis the forum before his investigatory committee as soon as Democrats took control of the Senate a few weeks ago Lieberman promised Davis that he would pressure regulators to order the refunds And Sen Barbara Boxer a California Democrat introduced the Electricity Gouging Relief Act of that would force FERC to do so But it now appears that FERC may be much more amenable to Davis complaints than it was little more than two weeks ago before Wood was sworn in In his first action at the agency Wood the former head of the Texas Publi c Utilities Commission was a chief catalyst behind a to vote by FERC Monday to impose a sweeping price ceiling on electricity throughout Western states Wood also said that while refunds might be useful to chasten electricity sellers Congress might consider giving FERC the power to impose punitive triple damages for generator overcharges and impose other administrative penalties in addition to refunds TREBLE DAMAGES Ordering refunds is one issue Wood said But an administrative penalty is perhaps a useful tool in our tool chest and I think perhaps even treble damages much as

manipulation by Californias power grid managers The state has demanded that federal regulators revoke the rights of six generators to sell electricity at market rates The California Independent System Operator said the companies prices should be set by determining the ir generating costs plus a reasonable return Bushs other new appointee Nora Mead Brownell a former Pennsylvania utili ty regulator also suggested a much more forceful federal role You dont just open the market declare victory and walk away Brownell said Competition in a newly deregulated market she added doesnt just happen overnight Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said Davis has had extensive conversations with Wood that lead him to believe Wood would be amenable to refunds Davis thinks theres a real meeting of minds there Maviglio said Davis met privately with Wood and Brownell yesterday and Wood is scheduled to meet with Davis again in Sacramento on Monday When Woods name was first floated as a Bush appointee it was widely assum ed he would follow in the footsteps of fiercely freemarket FERC chairman Curt Hebert a Republican appointee of President Clinton whom Bush elevated to head the agency But in his first few public comments since taking office Wood has consistently charted a much more regulatory course Bush is considered like ly to tap Wood as FERC chairman perhaps this fall Echoing a longstanding Davis complaint that FERC has been asleep at the wheel Wood and Brownell said that once properly deregulated electricity markets are in place federal regulators should actively monitor and enforc e market rules SETTLEMENT TALKS As part of its Monday pricecontrol action FERC also ordered settlement talks between the state of California and its electricity suppliers that wi ll start in Washington on Monday at FERC headquarters and last for days FE RC judge Curtis Wagner will preside The refund total Davis gave senators is nearly times more than the million in overcharges that FERC has alleged so far Maviglio said any refunds of alleged overcharges that occurred after the state began buying power January would go to the state Refunds of overcharges before that date would to go the states utilities one of whic h Pacific Gas and Electric Co is in bankruptcy Wood warned that the price controls imposed by FERC this week will not prevent blackouts this summer because electricity remains in short supply We didnt promise that it would be a panacea Wood said I think quite frankly we want to make sure that we mitigate not only the price but mitiga te the expectations that things are going to be rosy this summer on the West Coast They are not There will be blackouts but I think what we wanted to take a step on was to make sure that those blackouts the insult of those wouldnt be accompanied by the injury of a very high and unjust bill for th e power GOP SCOLDS DAVIS While Davis was greeted warmly by Democrats on the committee Republicans took him to task for mismanaging the states electricity crisis and trying to lay the blame on Bush For Gov Davis the cause of the states crisis is simply that a bunch o f Texas cowboys got in the corral and decided to take advantage of California said ranking panel Republican Fred Thompson of Tennessee All of the policies that were clearly part of the problem were locked into place and kept there until they created a disaster How was it that you seemed to let this get totally out of hand he asked Davis But Davis stuck to his insistence on refunds Give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us he said Email Carolyn Lochhead at San Francisco Chronicle PageA Nonprofits helped with utility bills Grants pay for ways to conserve energy Bill Workman Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NSDTLtypeDnews Nonprofit agencies that serve Santa Clara Countys needy are about to get relief from skyrocketing energy costs that could keep them from doing their jobs A unique grant program to help them cut their utility bills was announced yesterday along with the findings of a foundation survey of nonprofits that reported gas and electric costs have gone up an average percent at a time when the slowing economy has increased demand for their services To help the nonprofits keep energy bills down so they can meet rising need Community Foundation Silicon Valley has begun handing out grants to local agencies to buy energyefficient equipment and conduct energy audits to determine other ways to reduce expenses The privately funded energy grant program was said to be the first of its kind in Northern California since the onset of the current energy crisis For more agencies something as simple as purchasing a new refrigerator or installing ceiling fans can lead to hundreds of dollars in savings said Peter Hero president of Community Foundation Silicon Valley Our goal is to help keep energy costs down so that our local nonprofits can avoid cutti ng services to the community The survey released yesterday showed that most agencies have already initiated such energysaving measures as turning off lights cutting down a ir conditioning and turning off computers and appliances but are still forced to dip into reserves to pay utility bills The agencies said Hero face stiff challenges in taking conservation to t he next step A performing arts group for example cant just simply turn off the spotlight in the middle of a show The announcement of the grants part of a energy crisis response fund created with donations from several private foundations was made in San Jose at St Elizabeths Day Care Center whose gas and electricity bill s have tripled in some months according to Executive Director Robert Freiri The churchrun day care center which serves more than children was on e of three agencies that received the first of the foundations energy savin g grants yesterday It will use the money to pay for an extensive energy audi t of the yearold facility Other grant recipients were San Juan Bautista Child Development Center in east San Jose which plans to buy an energysaving commercial stove for its central kitchen and Concern for the Poor which runs the San Jose Family Shelter A shelter official said the money will be used to purchase energy efficient refrigerators and other energysaving appliances Meanwhile Hero said his foundation was seeking matching funds from other donors and that he expects the energy grant program to double or triple i n size within the next few weeks A surprising finding in the survey he said was that while the stock marke t plunge may have contributed to an average percent drop in donations to t he charitable groups during the first quarter of this year philanthropic givi ng in Silicon Valley was still percent higher this year than in when the economy was booming I may be an optimist but it seems philanthropy is so much more on the rad ar screen of Silicon Valley even among the dotcomers whose stocks and jobs have taken a beating said Hero Hero was joined at the news conference by Greg Larson president and CEO of United Way Silicon Valley who told how his own agency is being rescued fro m mounting energy bills by an anonymous Silicon Valley contractor The contractor he said has donated as part of in planned upgrading of heating and air conditioning systems as well as electrical retrofitting of United Ways Silicon Valley Nonprofit Center in San Jose T he center provides office and meeting space for more than nonprofits Without such energyefficient improvements said Larson United Way would have to cut about a year from its critical services budget to meet the recent percent increase in utility bills Email Bill Workman at San Francisco Chronicle PageA Federal caps chill prices analysts say Market steadies state leaders pushing for stricter controls Davis demands refunds from energy companies BY JOHN WOOLFOLK Mercury News The gold rush in Californias electricity market when generators could name any price for their power may be over New federal limits taking effect today have chilled Western power markets keeping prices cool even as a heat wave drives up demand in California Its still too early to say how effective those regional rules will be and California leaders are urging tougher controls But market analysts no long er expect a return to the huge markups seen earlier this year I think the party has gotten a lot quieter said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute The federal controls for the first time limit market prices throughout the West under a complex formula based on the operating costs of the plant that is the most expensive to run The prices will change based on which plants are selling power during shortages That limit is currently per megawatthour although companies can add percent for California sales t o reflect credit uncertainty Thats a far cry from daily prices that averaged to and at times neared per megawatthour earlier this year Prices have been falling since late May as power plants returned to operati on from scheduled maintenance cool weather dampened demand and hydroelectric imports exceeded expectations The states longterm power contracts also contributed to the decline But as rising temperatures threatened blackouts this week daily prices for Northern California held at a modest per megawatthour according to Bloomberg News Service less than a third of the cost during similar shortages in May Power contract prices for electricity delivered later this summer and next year reflect lower profit expectations They know theres going to be a ceiling on prices and thats bearish news said Mike Wilczek senior reporter for Platts Power Markets a division of McGrawHill Theyve sold the market down Theyre not sure what the cap will be at any given time But they do know it wont be able t o spike to the extremes it did before Energy industry officials have been studying the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions Monday order and say its too soon to declare the profit party over Prices can always go higher and always go lower said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum If theres somethi ng to be worried about its the unknown Once its known our fears will calm down and well be able to start working with it Expectations were much higher just two months ago Predictions of routine rolling blackouts prompted energy traders to bid up summer electricity pric es to per megawatthour Although the summer has just begun the states power picture now looks less ominous Experts agree energy companies will still make a tidy sum in California an d industry officials say generators arent shelving plans for new plants These sorts of caps are not going to put any kind of squeeze on them Borenstein said They just arent going to see quite as large profits as they have been An analyst who works closely with power marketers said they no longer expec t easy money Theyre having a hell of a time now justifying the prices they charged earlier this year said the analyst who asked not to be identified Wh at they are saying is its going to be more difficult to make more money in th e market Past federal regulatory orders in December and April have been followed by higher prices leading many California officials to press for even stricter moves such as refunding past profits But this weeks order suggests the agency which includes two new appointee s of President Bush is more serious about keeping the market in check The order includes a demand that Duke Energy which owns four California power plants refund with interest profits from charging the state per megawatthour earlier this year The company said it never collected its million bill which included an percent markup for the states uncertain credit But in an order more strongly worded than any to date federal regulators made clear they disapproved of the companys claim We will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding behavior regulators wrote in the order Duke Energys bidding at multiples of its marginal costs in an attempt to recover pastdue amounts c an in no way be found to be just and reasonable State leaders who have accused federal regulators of falling down

they have to play by the rules Staff writer Jim Puzzanghera contributed to this report Price controls could take years to assess Factors such as weather conservation and longterm contracts all contribut e to prices experts say June By DENA BUNIS The Orange County Register WASHINGTON Federal regulators could turn out to be heroes or goats dependi ng on whether Mondays pricecontrol ruling helps California turn the corner o n its electricity crisis And it could be years before anyone can legitimately make that call Meanwhile spin abounds and Californians who ultimately pay the energy bil ls will have to sit tight and hope Several factors combine to make it difficult experts say to predict how much good the soft price cap ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will do I can think of an awful lot of different reasons that would affect energy prices said Robert Michaels a professor of economics at California State University Fullerton and a consultant to power producers The weather lower naturalgas prices new power coming online conservatio n and longterm contracts all contribute to lower prices And those things figure into the price the state and if they get back into the market utilities will pay for electricity Experts pored over the order when it was released saying the fine print is crucial to how the market will be affected Its a positive development but its just half the battle said Gov Gra y Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio The other half is getting the refunds ba ck to California he added referring to allegations of generator overcharges The fight is not over Davis will testify this morning before the Senate Committee on Government Affairs along with the FERC commissioners Not everyone was happy with FERCs turnaround Julie Simon vice president of policy at the Electric Power Supply Association the national trade association for power said the order is incredibly intrusive It worries me that this could have a detrimental impact on California getting the investment that it needs and the type of market structure so people can get the benefits of competition Whatever happens with prices nothing in the order will do anything to ease the chances of blackouts says a former California Public Utilities Commission chairman Blackouts are in the short term and have nothing to do with the price of electricity said Mitch Wilk a utility consultant who ran the PUC from to Despite the uncertainties there was enough confidence that the FERC action would at least stabilize a chaotic market that even Sen Dianne Feinstein a fierce critic of the agency thanked the commissioners who appeared before the Senate energy committee Tuesday And she and Sen Gordon Smith ROre pulled back their bill that would have established costbased price caps in the West Lets watch and wait and see how this order works Feinstein said As the pressure mounted politically for price controls two things happened Republicans including President George W Bush began talking about caps that werent really caps And energy analysis and economists usually oppose d to such regulation began to soften I would fear price caps which dont have any market connection said Stev en Fetter a utility bond rater with Fitch Inc in New York Fetter testified before the Senate energy panel Tuesday This plan he said maintains a connection to the supplyanddemand patterns That is definitely a positive Fetter said the order once implemented in all states in the West shou ld ramp down some of the volatility I came all ready for a brawl over price caps he said And instead got a love fest regarding regulations FERC Chairman Curt Hebert whose turnaround on this issue has been attribut ed to political pressure and the presence of two new GOP commissioners committ ed to helping California continued to insist Tuesday that the price controls are not caps He said May and Junes low prices are proof that the more limited price controls put on in April are working The approach has been working and I believe it will work better Hebert told the senators Spot prices in California and the rest of the West are lower than at any time in the last year Lower prices eventually filter down to consumers Stable prices mean large rate increases can probably be avoided But longterm Wilk said electricity rates are going to go up no matter what happens The days of cheap electricity and no power plants are long over And regardless of whether caps serve to keep prices at least in check the order has changed the playing field Wilk said Its a new ballgame he said The order he added sends a signal to generators that to the extent they were trying to play around either legally or illegally with prices thinking they have sympathetic ears in

energy policy officially disclosed their contract with Southern California Edison on Thursday but Davis aides insisted it is not a conflict because Edison and the Governor s Office have the same goal Communications consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani have drawn intense criticism since they were hired last month to shape the Democratic governor s public response to the state energy crisis The former Clinton administration communication aides nicknamed the Masters of Disaster for their spin on the Whitewater travel office and fundraising controversies at the Clinton White House have come und er fire for receiving a sixmonth amonth contract more than the governor or anyone on his staff makes Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who is running for governor nex t year has called for an investigation into potential conflicts State Controller Kathleen Connell a Democrat has said she will not issue paychecks to the pair pending her own investigation The criticism mounted after the duos economic interest disclosure forms we re released late Thursday showing that each has received at least und er contract from Edison in the past year But Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean defended their credibility saying theres no conflict of interest because Lehane and Fabiani both disclosed that they had worked for Edison before they signed their contracts with the state Besides she added Edison and the governor are working toward the same goa l Both want the Legislature to adopt a memorandum of understanding a propose d agreement that would prevent Edison from going bankrupt by financing a sta te purchase of the utilitys transmission lines Its not a conflict because theres been full disclosure McLean said Edison and the Governors Office have the same goal passing the MOU Wer e working together at this point with Edison But opengovernment groups and Republican lawmakers bristled at the notion that disclosure negates any potential conflict Derek Cressman of the California Public Interest Research Group pointed to a section of state law that prohibits public officials from influencing decisions if it would have a material financial effect on a business enti ty that provided them or more within the last year You have two individuals on the government payroll who had previously been on the Edison payroll and its not clear to whom their loyalties are he said Just because theyve revealed it doesnt mean theres not a conflict there and that theyre not serving two masters On Thursday Jones said he is awaiting the results of the Fair Political Practices Commission investigation and agrees with Connells decision this week to withhold payment from the consultants This further calls into question the ethics of how these individuals were hired and contracts were

reached at or State deal may ease blackout threat Canada to supply energy as summer demand rises By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO California may be able to avoid some of the blackouts predict ed for this summer thanks to a littleknown powerswapping agreement with a Canadian utility The arrangement is expected to give California electricity in July and Augu st from the hydroelectric generators of BC Hydro in British Columbia despite a serious drought in the Northwest California has sold surplus power in recent months to the governmentowned utility which is expected to return power to the state as heat drives up t he demand for electricity State deal may ease blackout threat Continuing coverage Californias Power Crisis Despite the energy crunch the state often finds itself with surplus power that can be sold or swapped For instance advance power purchases that provide energy at a better price may deliver more power than needed at any given time particularly during offpeak hours BC Hydros reservoirs and hydroelectric generators are a little like an electricity storage battery By importing California power BC Hydro has be en able to conserve water that can be released this summer to produce power fo r California As a result of the agreement and other factors state power buyers say they are in a stronger position going into the hot summer months than they had expected So far this week the state has managed to get through a heat wav e without so much as a Stage power alert We are in much better shape at this point than I imagined we would have be en as little as a month ago said Ray Hart head of the power purchasing unit in the state Department of Water Resources The North American Electric Reliability Council which last month predicted hours of rolling blackouts for California this summer has noticed a change in recent weeks We dont seem to have the crisis we were all expecting said Ellen Vancko a council spokeswoman But whether that is a shortterm or a longterm eve nt we dont think anyone knows yet Much of the credit for avoiding blackouts is given to unexpectedly high conservation by Californians and an increased supply of power Many generators that had been shut down for maintenance or lack of payment are n ow back on line But the hydroelectric power agreement had gone unnoticed until now Hart mentioned it during a Senate Energy Committee hearing this week But h e declined to reveal the amount of power banked with BC Hydro saying it coul d hurt the states competitive position in the market If I start talking specifics said Hart then I have to give out what I am doing every single day and I have no market position In the past California routinely sent power to a number of utilities in th e Pacific Northwest during the winter when residents there needed heat Northwest utilities returned power to California in the summer when air conditioning drove up demand Little was expected from the reciprocal arrangement this year because California was short of power last winter as electricity prices soared and drought has sharply lowered reservoirs in the Northwest But the agreement with BC Hydro will provide at least some power this summer The state was forced to begin buying power in January after its two largest utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric were unable to borrow because of a billion debt The rates that the utilitie s could charge their customers were frozen under a failed deregulation plan a s the cost of power on the wholesale market skyrocketed Hart said it took time to convince BC Hydro which has demanded cash for so me electricity that it could safely do business with California despite big debts owed to generators for power they supplied to the utilities We have only been able to do it for the last couple of months said Hart It took a long time to get them to do it because of credit issues A spokesman for BC Hydro said the utility engages in power swaps but does n ot release the name of the other parties or the terms of the agreements Our first priority is taking care of our own said Warren Cousins of BC Hydro We are still looking for opportunities to help out other entities when we can Hart said the state has another arrangement with the federal Bonneville Pow er Authority but again refused to provide details He said the state has sold surplus power to several buyers including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Information about state power purchases had been closely guarded until recently Gov Gray Davis pressured by lawsuits and a court ruling releas ed edited versions last week of longterm power contracts worth billion The Davis administration said it agreed to release contract information because power prices have dropped easing competitive pressures Exworker Duke manipulated market By Bill Ainsworth UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO A former operator at Duke Energys Chula Vista plant said he was told frequently by company officials during the past year to alter the plants output in a way that may have boosted electricity prices The operator Jimmy Olkjer said he was even ordered to cut power generatio n during energy emergencies when the state faced rolling blackouts because o f a scarce supply of electricity He said he believes reducing the electricity generation helped the company charge higher prices It looks like thats what they were doing Olkjer said in an interview He and another former plant employee said that during the past year the company regularly operated its leastefficient turbine possibly to justify higher prices The allegations which they plan to repeat today at a state Senate hearing investigating power generators provide the first insider evidence that Duk e Energy may have manipulated output at its South Bay plant to drive up price s Duke based in North Carolina leases the South Bay plant from the San Dieg o Unified Port District A March report by the Independent System Operator which manages California s electricity grid alleged that by withholding power Duke and four other owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollars in overcharges to California consumers Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy North America said that varying th e output of the generating units at the Chula Vista plant had nothing to do with trying to achieve higher prices He said the changes in output helped balance the states grid by dancing i n the market providing flexibility for grid managers by allowing the plan t to add or reduce power quickly Williams added that the aging South Bay plant produced as many megawatts la st year as it did in Olkjer served as a plant operator for years mostly when the plant was owned by San Diego Gas Electric Co After Duke took over the plant worke rs were guaranteed their jobs for two years In April when that period ended Duke laid off Olkjer and other workers Now he is retired During the two years Duke has managed the plant Olkjer said operators frequently got calls from officials with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in Salt Lake City telling them to adjust their production schedule Some employees at the plant monitored the hourly price of electricity poste d by the Independent System Operator and recognized a correlation he said We noticed that a lot of times when the price was down our megawatts wou ld go down he said If the price was up often the megawatts would go up Olkjer said he was never told why he was being ordered to turn the plants output up and down When he asked he said company officials told him it w as none of his business Still he was puzzled particularly when he was told to throttle down the plant during electricity emergency alerts as he says he did Jan when the state declared a Stage alert with the possibility of rolling blackouts It doesnt make sense to cycle up and down when theres a Stage alert he said Duke spokesman Williams said the company may turn down units at the orders of the ISO during a Stage alert because the grid manager can find cheaper power somewhere else Lisa Szot spokeswoman at the ISO said she couldnt determine whether the ISO had ordered Duke to power down its Chula Vista plant Jan Olkjer said the frequent adjustments of power production which sometimes occurred every halfhour wear out the plants equipment Its harder on the machinery he said Its like driving down the street putting your foot on the gas and then slamming on the brake Before deregulation Olkjer said the four units at Chula Vista which have the capacity to produce megawatts had been operated steadily during mu ch of their history S David Freeman formerly general manager of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and now chief energy adviser to Gov Gray Davis said rapid cycling had become more common under deregulation and is hard on equipment We had almost megawatts of generating capacity down for repair last winter said Freeman referring to what industry experts agreed was an extraordinary level of plant outages over several months SDGE which built the Chula Vista plant in the s sold it to the Port District for million In the port leased the plant to Duke Energy for years in what critics are now calling a sweetheart deal The company pays minimal rent but has made large profits In the first quarter of this year Duke which owns three other plants in California sa id profits rose percent to million from energy sales and trading Duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for electricity It asked per megawatthour this year By comparison before the energy crisis began electricity sold for around per megawatthour an amount which powers about homes Federal regulators have ordered the company to refund million to the state for charging excessive prices unless the company can justify them In May the company offered to pay the state to settle any price gouging investigations but Gov Gray Davis declined Olkjer and Ed Edwards Jr who worked at the plant for years before bein g laid off in April said they couldnt understand why Duke ran the inefficient highcost turbine unit during the past year while other generators sat idle They said they believed it may have been an attempt to fetch a higher price for electricity because the company got extra fees when it ran Williams the Duke spokesman said the opposite was true He said Duke ran the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive It ran on jet fuel which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the other units Edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destroyed It ran so frequently and so hard it needed extensive repairs he said Edwards told CBS News last night that plant outages at Chula Vista were prolonged because one supervisor ordered him to dump spare parts The former power plant employees said they felt compelled to come forward because they saw the impact the power crisis was having on their community It kind of irritated me because you know theres people on a fixed income that cant afford a big utility bill said Olkjer Staff writer Craig D Rose contributed to this story Estimates of Power Profits Disputed Electricity A study of overcharges by suppliers may be flawed state officials say Davis quoted the figures to Congress By DOUG SMITH ROBERT J LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL Times Staff Writers Gov Gray Davis contention that California has been nicked for billio ns of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study that state officials concede may have significant flaws according to interviews and confidential government documents Those costsestimated by the state to be as high as billionwere central to Davis testimony this week before a US Senate committee where he again denounced power wholesalers and urged federal regulators to give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us The governors impassioned demand however was based on shaky calculations The formulas are being reworked said Charles Robinson vice president of Californias grid operator which prepared the study Robinson said he had no idea how much the amount allegedly overcharg ed by the generators might change For now he said the agency stands by the numbers But internal documents from the California Independent System Operator warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quantify the alleged excess profits could be well off the mark Whats more the documents caution against relying on the agencys stu dy as a basis for allegations of overchargingas Davis did during his testimo ny Wednesday That warning was particularly important because the documents provide for the first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy supplier prospered from the states power troubles between last summer and February The largest amounts were charged by four outofstate power companies according to the confidential CalISO report Okalhomabased Williams Cos led the group with million followed by Duke Energy with million Southern Company Energy Marketing now Mirant with million and Relian t Energy Services with million When told of the alleged profiteering attributed to them executives o f the companies insisted the numbers were grossly overstated because of CalISOs poor methodology Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his companys entire energy earnings for North America were less than the amount it was accused of reaping unfairly in California It doesnt add up It doesnt come close to adding up Williams said What CalISO has done is highly irresponsible math Paula HallCollins a Williams Cos spokeswoman said the firm would need to study the ISO report further But generally she said such reports fail to fully account for electricity production costs We maintain that we have not overcharged and that we have operated legally Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley also questioned the figures saying Theres a lot of misinformation out of there A Mirant spokesman said We haven t overcharged We havent manipulated We havent withheld Even some firms alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree we re outraged Joe Ronan vice president for government and regulatory relations at Calpine said the million attributed to his company doesnt bear any relation to reality Anybody can throw out any number he said Its like McCarthyism Where is the evidence A spokeswoman for Davis conceded that his refund figure was an estimat e but defended it as reasonable Its no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute an estimate of how much theyre gouging us senior advisor Nancy McFadden sai d Despite the cautions expressed in the CalISO documents officials Thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to the agencys figures as potential overcharges The way it should be characterized is the amount paid above a competitive benchmark said Robinson who is also CalISOs general counse l The first version of the nowdisputed CalISO study was made public in March It estimated that power sellers earned billion in excess profit s between May and last February The report later revised upward to billion became a crucial element of the Davis Administrations campaign against alleged electricity price gougers This week just before Davis appearance in Congress the study was updated again adding another billions in alleged excess profits throu gh May The orginal study which did not include actual pricing data was most ly intended to prod federal regulators into seeking information from generator s that the state had been denied Robinson said Thus far the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered refunds of only million Next week FERC is convening an unusual settlement conference aimed at addressing the outstanding claims by the state as well as those of sellers who claim they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars by California utilities One encouraging signal for state officials came this week when FERC reiterated an earlier order that Duke Energy pay millions in refunds The order stemmed from the companys sale of electricity at a megawatt hourfor thousands of hours FERCs order said Dukes pricing had resulted in million in billings A fair price for that power would have been per megawatt hou r the agency said Tom Williams a

Plans Bond Offer at Rate Debt Yield is about double what a creditworthy company would pay analyst s say But will investors bite By JERRY HIRSCH Times Staff Writer Edison International is offering investors what analysts are calling a n unprecedented interest rate for billion in notes to refinance debt Even so its far from certain that the Rosemeadbased power company will find enough buyers to complete the deal A failure by Edison to refinance million in bank debt that comes due June and an additional million in notes due in July could put t he company precariously close to bankruptcy and cast a shadow on Californias plan to sell billion in bonds to pay for power purchases said Dan Scotto a bond analyst at PNB Paribas in New York Even though it would at first appear to be a company setback it woul d really be a major setback for the state said Scotto who added that Edisons credit troubles could translate into higher prices for California s proposed bond offering Edison however said Thursday that the deal is moving forward We believe our deal is going well and we are comfortable with it said Jo Ann Goddard vice president for investor relations She declined to discuss other details of the offering Goldman Sachs Group Edisons investment bank expects to formally pri ce the offering Monday Edison officials would not comment on the proposed pri ce of the note offering but Wall Street sources said the power company was shopping the issue at the rate Edison floated the plan earlier this month as a way to tap the borrowi ng power of a profitable subsidiary to trim debt that comes due this year and to insulate itself from a possible bankruptcy of its ailing utility unit The utility Southern California Edison has lost billions of dollars on electricity sales over the last year The high interest rate on Edisons proposed sale of sevenyear notes i s about double what a creditworthy company would pay for a similar bond or note issue and would add a premium amounting to tens of millions of dollars in annual interest costs to the companys already strapped financial condition analysts said Its a full two percentage points higher than the average rate for other junk or speculative bonds And corporate bonds wit h similar ratings are going out at to Edison originally started marketing the issue at a full two percentage points higher than what analysts initially expected but then raised the rate to in recent days because it was finding few takers on Wall Street The word is that they couldnt get people interested and that they might not be able to get it done said Kurt Stabel a money manager at Street Asset Management in Newport Beach The higher rate however might be pulling investors out of the woodwo rk and has increased the chance that Edison will pull off the deal Scotto sai d This never promised to be a day at the beach Scotto said I think it is really a question of find the right price the price at which people fee l comfortable with the risk Both Stabel and Scotto said that Edisons note offering is unusually complicated and requires far more explaining or selling than typical corporate offerings Mission Energy Holding Co a company created by Edison for the sole purpose of issuing these bonds will offer the notes The assets of Edison Mission Energy a subsidiary that owns a network of power plants across the United States and in Asia Australia and New Zealand will secure the debt Mission Energy Holding plans to issue the proceeds to Edison in the fo rm of dividends giving the parent company funds to pay off a substantial portion of its debt The notes will have a credit rating of BBminus and come due in according to bond rating agency Standard Poors Thats slightly higher than the neardefault CC rating now carried by Edison If the offering failed Edison would face a series of difficult choice s that range from depleting its cash cushion to going back to its bankers and begging for continued forbearance Its SCE subsidiary already has defaulted on million in bonds and notes That triggered a default in bank lines of credit at Edison International and SCE which has since operated under extensions from its lenders Edison has about billion in cash including billion held by SCE according to regulatory documents This could all still unravel but I have been impressed with Edison s effort to inch along so far said Ellen Lapson an analyst at Fitch Inc a corporate credit rating service Who would have thought that they could ha ve lasted so many months after their first default in January and still not be in bankruptcy

Plans for Baldwin Hills Plant Power Homeowners and environmentalists rejoice at decision The site is proposed as a acre state park By JOE MOZINGO Times Staff Writer In a victory for environmentalists and nearby homeowners an energy company announced Thursday that it was abandoning its plan to build a power plant on the site of a proposed state park in the Baldwin Hills La Jolla Energy Development Inc in a letter to the state Energy Commission said it was withdrawing its application for fasttrack approval of the megawatt plant and will not pursue the Baldwin facility in the future We listened to the community La Jolla President Steve Wilburn said in an interview Thursday We need to find another place for this equipment The project was to be a joint venture between La Jolla and Stocker Resources an oil company that leases the land where the trailersized naturalgas plant would sit Stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether they will pursue the project At this point its just La Jolla pulling out Stocker spokesman Steve Rusch said But most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the fasttrack schedule the state has implemented to relieve the energy crisis The state commission was scheduled to decide whether to approve the project today in Sacramento but the hearing has been canceled The news sparked elation among environmentalists and nearby homeowners who had fought the proposal on grounds that it would pollute neighborhoods and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together acres of public open space in the hills Were getting ready to have the biggest party said Tony Nicholas president of the hills United Homeowners Assn This shows how a community can come together for a common goal and mobilize the people in a matter of days About of the residents in the hills are African American and many saw the issue as a matter of environmental justice In addition Stocker and La Jolla were seeking approval for the plant within days of filing their application under the governors emergency power orders By following this fasttracked procedure they would have bee n able to avoid the normal timeconsuming environmental review process That angered opponents even further and nearly people showed up at a public hearing Monday to fight the project But what officials said turned the tide against the projectat a time when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possiblewa s testimony from a South Coast Air Quality Management official who said his agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly Executive Director Barry Wallerstein said his agency would have to conduct hearings that would take up to days pushing construction well beyond a Sept deadline set by the governor for fasttrack projects He also said it was unlikely Stocker could get needed exemptions from federal clean air laws In a letter to the Energy Commission this week Wallerstein wrote It appears that the Baldwin Energy Facility could not begin operation until so me time in the first part of at the earliest By Wednesday night the energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statemen t recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a plant citing Wallersteins concerns Conservationists embraced the outcome as a sign that the movement to create a park was gaining steam The Baldwin Hills Conservancy was created last year with the idea of creating green space for the densely populated neighborhoods of south Los Angeles With support from the governor and loca l politicians the state recently bought a acre parcel in the area for an unprecedented million This is a great day for the Baldwin Hills and all the people who have worked so hard to bring this worldclass vision to reality said Esther Feldman president of Community Conservancy International and the main organizer to build the park Also applauding La Jollas decision were state Sen Kevin Murray DCulver City and Assemblyman Herb Wesson DCulver City who had come o ut strongly against the project They and others questioned whether the small amount of power provided by the facilitycoming online after the dog days of summerwould do much to relieve the energy crisis Im ecstatic Wesson said At this point the environment has won The plant would have sat on what is a working oil field about feet from the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area And according to park proponents it would lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy on what would be a halfmile bridge of land arching over La Cienega Boulevard Rusch the spokesman for Stocker said much of the information circulating about the trailersized plant is false The plan did not call for a stack with billowing smoke he said If the issue is air quality weve cleaned air quality up In the last decade Rusch said the companys existing oil pumps on the property have reduc ed nitrogen oxide emissions from tons to tons a year The power plantwith two foot stackswould ultimately add about tons a year He said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing it s own power to pump oil while also contributing an extra

Homeowners Assn We just hope that Stocker would be responsive to the outcry from the community Western states could feel pinch from California pricing KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer Friday June Associated Press URL cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchiven ation alEDTDTLtypeDnews PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP When power supplies stretch thin across the West this summer who will deci de whether Silicon Valley computers Washington apple orchards or Las Vegas casinos get first dibs on whats left Its a key question raised by the decision of federal energy regulators thi s week to cap electricity prices throughout the West using a formula based o n Californias power costs Economists energy industry executives and officials in all states are beginning to analyze the fit of this new piece in the energy puzzle Though most call the order a good step that could prevent price gouging others worry the pricing system could lead to electricity shortages for Californias neighbors or prompt utilities to stock up on power contracts to fend off shortages That could diminish any leverage power buyers might hav e as they compete for the remaining megawatts available each day Tying the highest possible power price to California could cause a problem come winter when power demand drops in the Golden State said Gary Ackerma n director of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents most sellers of energy States where consumers need electricity to heat furnaces through the winter would be unable to outbid each other above the price cap which is usually determined by a formula based on the highest bid for lastminute power duri ng the most recent energy supply emergency in California That may leave power wholesalers and not a free market to decide who gets the energy Certainly California has a tremendous pull on our prices and has for probably the last year said Claudia Rapkoch spokeswoman for Montana Powe r Co which supplies natural gas and electricity to twothirds of the Big Sk y state What it means for this winter were just going to have to wait and see California utilities had much more control over power supplies before deregulation in obligated them to sell off their power plants to encourage competition This brought lower prices for a time but gave contr ol over power supplies to wholesalers that arent obligated by state law to serve the serve the best interests of local customers Rather than appointing one power grid manager to decide how to divide power in the West Ackerman predicts utilities in nonderegulated states will simply sell their power within their borders That would hurt California which this week imported about percent of its electricity and its remaining supply from local plants owned by outofstate power companies Price cap or not utilities in the region will watch out for each other as best they can because they might need the favor returned said Charles Reinhold executive consultant for Electric Resources Strategies in Ariz Saddled with rising bills that threatened to exhaust the states budget California recently began to sign longterm contracts with generators Gov Gray Davis credits the change for helping to drastically reduce

March and Duke responded by filing a challenge But the commission on Monday rejected the companys appeal and reiterated its earlier order claiming Du ke had abused its power in the California energy market when it sold power for per megawatt hour We will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding or behavior the commission said Duke acknowledged this month that it had charged

refund but it directed the company to readjust its January billings for those hours to a price of From a FERC document it appears that about hours occurred in January which would result in a total refund for that month of million Duke is one of the companies that have been identified by both the Californ ia Independent System Operator the manager of the states electricity grid a nd the FERC as

There was a reason Gov Gray Davis donned a dark blue jacket and endured beastly humid degree heat this week in an area behind the Capitol known as the House swamp The nation was watching And after months of political free fall his messa ge seemed to be taking hold California has been bilked out of billion while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was asleep at the switch Davis declared repeating testimony he had delivered hours earlier in the airconditioned confines of a Senate hearing room Wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as television cameras and two dozen reporters recorded the scene the California governor apparently couldnt resist taking another shot For nearly a year Ive been pounding on this commission to enforce the law The states energy crisis with its volatile spot markets outofstate generators and dearth of alternative energy providers is a dizzyingly complex policy puzzle The politics are much simpler Democrats present themselves as consumer crusaders defending helpless utility customers from greedy energy conglomerates and misguided regulators Republicans portray themselves as stewards of the free market and longterm solutions rejecting price caps and refunds as heavyhanded overreactions with Sovietstyle results The Democratic populism seems to be winning the battle Though the debate i s far from settled the consumeroriented approach to Californias energy woe s has raised their hopes of winning back the House of Representatives in and the White House in Republicans are scared out of their minds about this said one gleeful Democrat on Capitol Hill who suggested that the White Houses lackadaisica l response to Californias problems would rile consumers from coast to coast This could rival Pete Wilsons alienation of Latinos said the Democrat referring to the former Republican governors strident stand against illega l immigrants which many blame for the partys weak standing in California A sign of the GOPs concern surfaced this week with television ads finance d by anonymous sources but produced by Republican Party strategists that bla me the Democratic governor for Californias energy problems Democrats who long have worried that the crisis could cost Davis a second term now take credit for having pressured the White House and federal regulators to take a more active role The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which had previously resisted suc h efforts took steps toward controlling wholesale electricity prices Monday Later in the week two commissioners appointed by President Bush testified that they might be open to further price restrictions and support huge refunds to California And just yesterday Vice President Dick Cheney who has been among Californias most vocal critics told Senate Democrats behin d closed doors that he could support refunds to California if federal regulators agreed according to those in the meeting There is no doubt in my mind that action taken by federal regulators was the direct result of pressure for price relief led primarily by the California delegation Davis said The pressure did not come only from Democrats Republican lawmakers some o f whom fear the crisis could cost them seats in wrote FERC last week requesting commissioners to take further actions to help the state The Democrats public relations success follows an effort by the party to raise the profile of its consumer crusade Hardly a day has passed in the past several weeks without a group of Democrats holding a news conference t o attack the White House the Republican controlled House or FERC for inactio n But it may have just as much to do with a White House that has been far mor e focused on longterm energy production than the immediate concerns of Californians Even as it engaged in a legitimate policy dispute over how to solve the power mess the Bush administration appeared indifferent to the plight of residents experiencing skyrocketing energy bills and rolling blackouts Bush tried to correct that impression with a trip to the state last month But the damage appears to have extended beyond California A CBS NewsNew York Times poll released this week of adults from acro ss the country showed that only one in three voters approved of the job Bush w as doing on energy More than half the respondents said that protecting the environment was a higher priority than producing energy yet barely one in said that Bush shared that priority Some Republicans say that Bush was in a nowin position contending that anything he did would have been attacked by Californias opportunistic governor Politics is Davis main objective and I dont see the Bush administrati on being that way said Rep George Radanovich RFresno The question for some analysts is whether Democrats might have been too successful By pressuring the federal government to take a more active role Democrats may lose their ability to point the finger at a convenient scapegoat Davis has always needed rate caps much less than he needed a scapegoat No w that FERC has given him what he wants or close enough to it its a lot harder for him to lay blame back on Washington when the blackouts kick in said

The document could be vital to how legislators vote on the billion de al to buy Southern California Edisons power lines said Terry Francke genera l counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition which filed the lawsu it in Alameda County Superior Court The power line deal was brokered by the governor to help the cashstrapped utility Legislators must approve the power grid purchase by Aug or

study the issue Francke said Both state agencies and their directors are named in the lawsuit Efforts to keep the report secret are suspect Francke said If its known theres some danger do you want the state owning that liability he asked The study began in after the state Public Utilities Commission committ ed million for research and education on the subject Francke said The state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and electric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies based on those findings he said The report was scheduled to be released to the public on May but at the last minute the Public Utilities Commission apparently instructed the staf f of the EMF Program to keep the reports secret the lawsuit said State health services spokeswoman

companys shares peaked at Theres a whole kaleidoscope of issues that Enron is being challenged with in the marketplace right now none of which on the surface is a major deal said Donato J Eassey an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities in Houston But when you combine them all I think whats happening here is you have a crescendo with this FERC announcement You have people saying OK the growth rate is now in question That growth rate was an eyepopping percent in revenues for the Unite d States on a twoyear average and nearly percent in the rest of the worl d Enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews but as the sto ck continued to drop Tuesday morning chief executive Jeff Skilling issued a statement to the markets in which he reiterated strong confidence in its earnings guidance The stock rebounded slightly throughout the week closin g at yesterday In a speech at the Commonwealth Club last night Skilling blamed regulatory interference with the free market for investor flight from his company Our stock prices have gotten hammered he said Theyre half what they were a year ago Tumbling stock prices werent the only bad news for Skilling last night A protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began speaking As Skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face a woman was arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges Enron isnt the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with Californias power crisis and are now suddenly headed south Shares of Reliant Energy Inc AES Inc and Williams Companies Inc which generate a nd sell electricity in California and El Paso Energy Corp which sells natur al gas here are all trading near week lows The main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in Washington abou t power price controls reregulation and now the possibility of big refunds being ordered for California Even Calpine Corp of San Jose which has developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played th e spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics dropped nearl y percent yesterday to But none of the companies has been hit as hard as Enron Such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any company It leaves it less money to invest in its own growth and because executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price a sharp decline makes it more difficult to retain talented leaders While Enrons power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine the firm h as been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other regio ns in recent months In the financial press the continuing knock on Enron is that its business lines are so new and complex and the company is so secretive about its operations that analysts and fund managers dont feel confident in their understanding of what it does A look at the firms recent troubles exemplifies its diversity For instance Enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state governme nt of Maharashtra in India over a megawatt power plant there The Dahbol Power Co which is percent controlled by Enron stopped construction on a second phase of the project on Sunday claiming it is owed million by t he Maharashtra State Electricity Board The state has accused Enron of chargin g too much and not generating enough and stopped buying power from the plant last month Closer to home Enron has struggled with its investments in fiberoptic bandwidth The company buys and sells unused highspeed bandwidth space treating it like a commodity as it does electricity coal or natural gas B ut the fiberoptic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear that for all the longdistance cable laid in the ground there have not bee n enough last mile connections set up for users to actually take advantage of it Earlier this year Enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with Blockbuster to offer what it called video on demand in which customers a t home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it transmitted via fiberoptic cables Then there was the FERC ruling For months the agency had resisted aggressive price controls in the West preferring to let the market run its course But as control of the US Senate was handed to Democrats this mont h and President Bush appointed a tough Texan regulator named Patrick Wood III to the commission the agency changed its tune It expanded price controls to all hours of the day spread the controls throughout the Western region and brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent So under current calculations that means Enron could sell power for no mor e than per megawatt in a shortage and about during normal hours f ar short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly charging during the past year In part the companys gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of the businesses Enron has decided to pursue And the hardcharging company h as a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets But sometime s that approach gets it in trouble as was the case last year when Enron had to take a million charge for its failed investment in Azurix a global water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply the same way it had done for electricity service as governments privatized their water systems The opportunities never materialized Add it all together and Enron has a tough time supporting a priceearnings ratio of nearly considerably above the liberal standard of health whic h is The company had less than billion in profits on more than billion in revenues last year Still a survey by Thomson FinancialFirst Call found that analysts expect Enron to deliver earnings of cents per share in the second quarter up from cents last year and per sha re on the year Most maintain a strong buy rating on the stock But investors with big positions in Enron have taken a hit Hardestput of them will be the Janus funds which as Enrons largest mutual fund investo r held nearly billion of its stock as of the end of April In a semiannual report to investors John Schreiber a portfolio manager said the stock price of the newage energy merchant was a victim of negative psychology resulting from the California energy crisis Janus declined to make fund managers available for interviews There are tremendous rewards for being first into new markets said Raymo nd Niles an energy analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in New York When your e an aggressive firstmover from time to time youre going to make mistakes But I dont think any of the mistakes Enron has made hit the core of the company Email Christian Berthelsen at San Francisco Chronicle PageB Power firm accused of pricefixing Former employees say Duke Energy slowed production of electricity to create an artificial shortage boost profits BY DION NISSENBAUM Mercury News Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO One of the largest companies producing power in California ordered workers to throw out spare parts and shut down equipment in an effo rt to drive up the price of electricity former power plant workers said Thursday Speaking out on the eve of appearances at a state Senate hearing the three men offered the strongest evidence yet that at least one power producer Duke Energy sought to make more money by creating an artificial shortage that may have created huge electricity price spikes Their intent in my opinion was to boost the price up said Glenn Johnson a mechanic who worked for two decades at the Chula Vista power pla nt now run by Duke If Ive got the only box of penicillin in town and your e sick I can charge a million dollars a box he said If you want to liv e youre going to have to pay Officials at Duke angrily challenged the accusations calling them irresponsible charges by disgruntled workers who were let go in April Their allegations are just comical just highly erroneous said Tom Williams a spokesman for Duke which runs four plants in California that produce enough energy for nearly million homes The charges come as the state heads into negotiations next week with generators over the billion the state claims its consumers have been overcharged Duke based in Charlotte NC came under considerable criticism when it disclosed that it charged the state a record a megawatthour for power in January Federal officials have called the charg e unreasonable and ordered Duke to refund California the money The employees who first made their allegations public on CBS Evening News Thursday night will be the only witnesses today at an energy crisis hearing headed by lawmakers who suspect that power companies have been illegally gouging California State Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove chairman of a committee investigating price gouging said the allegations raise serious concerns While we stil l need to hear the other side of the story from Duke if theres any truth to the information I believe it would be devastating to the generators he said Perfectly good parts In interviews with the Mercury News Thursday night the three former plant workers said that they were directed to scale back energy production and throw out good spare parts that kept the plant from getting up to full powe r for weeks Ed Edwards who worked in the Southern California plant said that he was told to get rid of many boxes of good spare parts Edwards said he tossed more than pallets of parts into a dumpster I dont know why they were throwing away perfectly good parts he said It didnt make sense Johnson said the lack of onsite parts prevented workers from quickly fixin g problems that reduced the amount of power the plant could produce Sometime s he said it took weeks to get parts Johnsons suspicions of gouging were echoed by Jimmey Olkjer who spent years in the plant and worked as an assistant control operator Even at times when California regulators were warning residents the state might not be able to find enough energy to prevent imminent blackouts Olkj er said he was directed to scale back the amount of electricity the plant was producing In hindsight it looks to me like they were manipulating the power Olkjer said Duke called the allegations baseless and said the workers didnt understand the reasons for the actions Continued accusations repetitive investigations and inflammatory rhetoric concerning the companys operation s in the state are distracting attention from the true issue of solving Californias energy crisis Duke said in a statement Williams did not directly dispute the workers allegations But he said the y did not understand the reasons behind the decisions State directives Duke cut back on the amount of power it was producing in response to directives from state regulators at the Independent System Operator which runs the power grid Williams said They did not know that the ISO was instructing them to go up and down to meet supply and demand he said An ISO spokeswoman said that the grid manager sometimes asks generators to produce more or less power to adjust traffic on the transmission system or respond to the states electricity needs Some companies bid power into the reserve market which means these plants run only when the extra energy is tapped ISO officials say they are prohibited from discussing individual bids As for the spare parts Williams said they were eliminated as unnecessary after Duke bought the plants from San Diego Gas Electric Williams said Duke has one of the best performance records in the state wi th its power plants offline for unscheduled maintenance only about percen t of the time All three workers were given severance packages and let go in April But Edwards disputed any contention that they were trying to get back at Duke Im not a disgruntled employee he said Im just telling the truth o f what I saw the last two years I worked there No matter what the reasons were for the decisions Duke has made huge profi ts during the California energy crisis And those profits apparently created good cheer among Duke executives At one party Johnson said executives gleefully celebrated their good fortune Were making more money than we ever thought possible Johnson quoted t he plants manager as saying Mercury News staff writer John Woolfolk contributed to this report Contact Dion Nissenbaum at or Enron chief Gov Davis not to blame for energy crisis BY KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO AP California Gov Gray Davis isnt to blame for Californias power crisis and neither are electricity wholesalers a Texas energy executive told a crowd at the Commonwealth Club of California Jeffrey Skilling CEO and president of Houstonbased Enron Corp wiped awa y the remnants of a pie hurled by a protester Thursday and placed the blame squarely on Californias energy regulators The state Public Utilities Commission in the early s put together a broken market by preventing utilities to pass along the full cost of power and discouraging power contracts that would have lowered dependence on buyi ng lastminute power Skilling said Because of these rules the power consumers of the state of California we re thrown totally to the mercy of the spot market Skilling said PUC president Loretta Lynch defended the regulators actions last week saying utilities have been free to enter into longterm contracts Utilitie s countered that the PUC never made clear what contracts it would accept whi ch left open the possibility they would later be overruled I think consumers in California are angry and they should be Skilling said Prices in California shouldnt be as high as they are Skilling also Congratulated Davis for Californias unprecedented conservation Denied accusations that Enron chairman Kenneth Lay personally interviewed candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees interstate energy markets Told the audience to expect a report that would show California municipal utilities have profited the most selling power to the state Said price caps ordered by FERC earlier this week would likely damage the markets and would only exacerbate the problem Acknowledged that municipal utilities in the state have managed to provid e cheaper power to their customers and even profit from the power crisis by selling off extra power despite public control Enron has come under fire after accusations from Davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply Enron denies such claims and joins other power producers in arguing that t he state and utilities still owe them billions in unpaid bills Davis acknowledges that Pacific Gas Electric Co which has declared bankruptcy and Southern California Edison together still owe generators such as Enron Duke Energy Mirant and Reliant Energy about billion for past electricity sales Our success is linked to efficient markets not higher prices in Californ ia or anywhere else Skilling said Protesters gathered outside the building wearing pig masks and carrying handmade signs one of which read Greed is the only power crisis Its basically Enron and the other companies raising prices said Berna rd Greening a Santa Clara computer programmer who said hes unhappy with the record prices for electricity and natural gas Pete Snoek of Tiburon said he believed what Skilling had to say I believe the energy situation has been politicized so badly Snoek sai d saying he was one of several in the audience to shush protesters during the meeting I hear the same people out there as if its a sin to make any money in this country State officials counter that wholesalers charged as much as billion in illegal overcharges dating back to May Companies have said Californias claims are wildly exaggerated The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already estimated that wholesalers owe California million in overcharges for the first four months of the year Davis and others say thats a mere drop in the bucket Enron has also been tied to President Bushs handsoff approach to the ener gy crisis Company chairman Kenneth Lay is a friend and one of the largest campaign contributors to Bush and the GOP Several prominent members of the Bush administration hold stock in the company Enron is one of several major GOP donors accused of meeting secretly with Vice President Dick Cheney as he drafted the Bush administrations energy plan Enron is one of the worlds leading electricity natural gas and communications companies with billion in revenues in It owns miles of pipeline has employees and is active in countrie s During the first quarter of this year Enrons revenues increased perce nt to billion Three say company purposely cut power ExDuke workers say repairs were curbed in order to manipulate output June By KIMBERLY KINDY The Orange County Register FORMER DUKE ENERGY employees Ed Edwards left Glenn Johnson center and Jimmy Olkjer are to appear before a state Senate committee today Photo Dave Yoder The Register Three former Duke Energy workers say they were ordered to tamper with equipment at a San Diego County power plant causing mechanical problems that helped drive up electricity prices during the states energy crisis The workers say they will offer eyewitness testimony to a state Senate committee today the first public accounts from power plant employees of h ow energy production may have been manipulated Duke officials deny most of the allegations The whistleblowers mechanic s Ed Edwards and Glenn Johnson and control room operator Jimmy Olkjer lost their jobs four months ago State Sen Joe Dunn the Santa Ana Democrat who is chairing the investigati ve committee on pricefixing said his staff will attempt to verify the accoun ts from the whistleblowers But their mere presence in a Capitol hearing room is expected to set off a media circus And if the accusations are true it could have wideranging effects on the North Carolina companys operations in California Duke officials were working late into the night to prepare for the hearing and have scheduled a news conference later today They were doing all kinds of things that didnt make sense Johnson said in an interview But if you asked them why to explain they told you to shut up and do your job The testimony comes on the heels of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruling Thursday ordering Duke to refund million in overcharges for January This information lends credence to the concern that there was a deliberate strategy for outages for the sole purpose of impacting price Dunn said What they are saying is disturbing Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said the fact that the former workers lo st their jobs may be shaping their testimony The proof is in the pudding Production is up and weve had fewer forced outages since weve taken over said Williams But controlroom logs obtained by The Orange County Register show Dukes trading arm ordered its South Bay power plant in Chula Vista to reduce production minutes after Stage Three alerts were issued The logs are for January the same month that Duke was accused of overcharging in California The three former Duke workers each worked at the Chula Vista plant for more than two decades when it was owned by San Diego Gas Electric They lost their jobs when Duke assembled a new team to run the plant The three whistleblowers outlined their accusations in interviews with the Register The accusations include The company ordered workers to throw unopened boxes of bolts steam seals valves and other parts into Dumpsters The parts were needed to perform routine maintenance but were no longer available when repairs were required Duke officials acknowledge that new parts were discarded but say the high inventory tax made it more efficient to order parts as needed because they could be delivered within hours Edwards and Johnson say they were ordered to dismantle critical equipment necessary for the generating units to run at full capacity Because parts were thrown away they couldnt make repairs and generators ran at diminish ed capacity for days or weeks Energy experts say this allegation if true would allow Duke to withhold energy from the marketplace which could drive up the price Duke officials counter that production has increased at its power plants and forced outages have decreased since they took over But in late there was a spike in outages at the Chula Vista plant according to records kept by the states powergrid operator The plant reported hours of outages from October through December There were relatively few outages before that The mechanics say the inability to perform repairs forced them to use a small expensive generator that was rarely powered up before Duke took over the plant Experts say that could have been used to exploit federal rules allowing generators to justify prices based on the costliest units online Olkjer says he received orders from Dukes trading arm to reduce production Then when energy prices jumped he would get new instructions to power up again Duke officials did not respond to Olkjers claim Stanford professor Frank Wolak an expert in Californias energy market sa id that if their testimony can be proven the state could be refunded millions of dollars and future energy prices could be dramatically reduced What they are saying is amazing This is a classic plot Ive always wondered how they kept the generators out for so long said Wolak who heads an electricity market surveillance for the California agency that oversees the buying and selling of power They were very happy to have the m offline because it allowed them to make more money Wolak said the testimony seems to back up research conducted by the state Independent System Operator which runs most of the states power grid and oversees the buying and selling of electricity in California In a report to federal regulators ISO said that from May to November Duke withheld electricity from the states power grid percent of the tim e The report accused more than a dozen power plant companies of powering down generators to create scarcity in the marketplace that would in turn drive u p prices In a separate report the state power grid operator accused Duke of overcharging California again in January of this year resulting in the million refund order Duke officials say charging a megawatthour wa s justified during a short period of time Federal regulators disagreed and said the power merchant should have charged no more than per megawatthour Williams Dukes spokesman said that the company has been an ethical operator All but percent of the time we were operating Thats very good sa id Williams adding that when SDGE owned the plant forced outages took place percent of the time But Dunn said that if the testimony from the whistleblowers is true and Duke had the ability to manipulate prices federal regulators would be required under the Federal Power Act to move them out of the competitive marketplace This would mean they would be moved back into a costbased market structu re and would only be allowed to recover costs at a fair rate of return This would bring the prices down dramatically in California Dunn said What generators fear most is being returned to costbased rate regulation Allegations of market manipulation Nearly a dozen investigations are under way to determine if energy producers illegally manipulated Californias dysfunctional electricity market Here a re the main allegations Was power deliberately withheld to boost prices Several investigators including the Public Utilities Commission the California attorney general and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a re trying to determine if the largest generators and power marketers includi ng Duke Reliant Mirant and Dynegy shut down power plants at key times Federal Environmental Protection Agency records showed times in December when Tulsabased Williams throttled back at midday letting Williams boost profits at other plants it controlled including a Huntington Beach plant owned by AES Corp Were financial incentives offered to plant operators who shut down Federal regulators have settled a case for million with Williams Among the allegations Williams offered ffinancial incentives to AES if it would keep its plants offline Williams has denied any wrongdoing Did companies collude Traders and producers were able to share information on Web sites that helped them determine when to get the highest prices for electricity Attorney General Bill Lockyer is investigating othe r allegations of collusion Were workers ordered to fake outages Three former Duke employees will testify today that

too much for electricity The generators want billions from the utilities and t he state that they say didnt pay the bill for other power they bought And Californias ratepayers just want to keep the lights on I dont think theres billion Wagner said Thursday from his office at FERC headquarters I think there may be a billion or so He spent much of the day fielding calls from some of the several hundred people who could show up in his hearing room Monday Lets see Ive talked to Reliant to Dynergy once Mirant Im going to talk to Dynergy again this afternoon And Ive talked to the governors office and Ive talked to some FERC folks to someone from Oregon and some municipalities in California Oh and Ive talked to the fellow who is goin g to represent the city of Los Angeles Wagner likes to know what hes getting into ahead of time He makes a habit of talking to everyone individually Mondays is the kind of deal Wagner likes best Rather than a formal trial where he wears the robe pounds the gavel and renders a decision after both sides make their cases settlement conferences give him a chance to wheel a nd deal First thing Ill make an opening statement of some kind give em a pep talk Wagner said And if we have any big wheels there Ill let them say a thing or two After the introductions hell start to work through the issues Hell take one guy aside he said then maybe two Then maybe a group And little by little he hopes to bring them together By all accounts this case could be more difficult than any he has handled This has got more dollars Wagner said Thursday Wagner asked Californias Independent System Operator and the pow er sellers for information that can help him sort out the complicated issues He wants the ISO to calculate what wholesale electricity prices wold have been had the price caps FERC ordered Monday been in effect in the fall of And he wants the power companies to tell him how much power they have to se ll short and long term And as if his task wasnt difficult enough FERC has asked Wagner to make this deal in days Its pretty tight he said but it can be done Stephen Angle a Washington lawyer who represents power producers and utilities ran FERCs trial section for years The California case is on e of the most difficult hes seen But hes not counting Wagner out I have learned that its unwise to assume he wont be successful Angle said The odds that Wagner will get a deal Fiftyfifty This is not the only highprofile case thats taking up the chiefs time these days Hes presiding over a FERC inquiry into whether El Paso Energy Corp a large natural gas pipeline owner is overcharging California Wagner has a history of taking impossible cases Angle says he recently worked with the judge on a dispute in the Midwest That was a case where few people thought would be successful Angle said It had been on FERCs docket for years Wagner got the people talking and emerged with a settlement And Monday wont be Wagners first effort at solving Californias energy crisis Last December he got the parties together to try to break the logjam over the longterm contracting issue But just as he was getting a head of steam on that says Wood the Clinton administration yanked the deal away from Wagner and tried to broker it themselves I know hes too much of a gentleman to say it But that was a missed opportunity Now hell be reuniting some of the same parties that were together six mont hs ago Because of Wagners longevity on the bench almost every lawyer or energy executive who is likely to be in the hearing Monday will have had some

refund The governor tells a Senate panel that power operators bilked our state June By DENA BUNIS and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register WASHINGTON Gov Gray Davis told anyone here who would listen Wednesday th at overcharges from what he calls greedy power generators have now risen to billion billion more than earlier reported And he wants that money back The governor said if the meetings federal regulators have ordered next week to try and hammer out the differences between power companies utilities an d the state do not end with that kind of money in Californias pocket hell be back They must be required to give us back our money Davis told the Senate Government Affairs Committee during two hours of testimony and questioning It was the first time Californias chief executive has testified on the states crisis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The billion is the amount Californias Independent System Operator says generators overcharged utilities and the state from May to May of this year It had initially calculated that between May and February there were billion in overcharges Davis said Those figures are a far cry from the million that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say s were overcharges Thats because FERC only looked at three months of rates and only when the state was in an energy alert The governor faced tough pointed questioning from Republican members and glowing praise and sympathy for his states plight from Democratic colleagues Everything from refunds to longterm contracts will be on the table at next weeks settlement meeting FERC has given the parties until July to make a deal If they cant the administrative judge overseeing the talks will make a recommendation to FERC which can order the paybacks Sen Barbara Boxer introduced a bill Wednesday to require refunds if FERC doesnt act Not surprisingly generators dont see the refund issue the governors way Its just crazy said Tom Williams a spokesman at Duke Energy I dont know how theyre coming up with these numbers And theres skepticism about next weeks talks The negotiations are going to be like the SALT Treaty said Gary Ackerman president of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents power suppliers I question whether it can happen and work out Also at issue is money generators say they are owed by the utilities Davis said thats about billion But power companies say its more like billion to billion Whatever the figure Davis said we want to see their money in our pockets before we talk about working anything out on their end The settlement conference was part of FERCs order instituting aroundtheclock price caps for California and its Western neighbors Those price caps were made possible experts agree because California lawmakers from both sides of the aisle riled up the public enough over the issue that the Bush administration felt the heat The question is whether that can work with refunds Pressure could come from a number of places said Charles Cook a nonpartisan political analyst who has followed Californias crisis It cou ld come from Republican members from the state from party donors in Californi a who President George W Bush is going to have to go back to and then may be from his economic advisers who say that California cant be allowed to go belly up Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said new FERC Commissioner Patri ck Wood a confidant of Bush has been receptive to their refund pleas That w as the case Wednesday when Wood expected to be named

averted Wednesday as power reserves remained above percent Track the states blackout warnings on the Web at wwwcaisocomSystemStatushtml In rolling blackouts together is all relative June I have a confession to make Im an N And as an N I cant help feeli ng a little guilty I feel guilty that I wont be called upon to share the pain of all those As in Irvine and Laguna Woods or the Ms in Costa Mesa and Cypress While the Ms in Fountain Valley suffer and sweat through rolling blackouts Ill be sitting pretty Because Im an N And the dirty little secret about rolling power blackouts is how many of us are out there Allow me to explain As you may have heard Southern California Edison has been required to set up a public notification system for rolling blackouts If you hear on the news that the power guys are expecting rolling blackouts you can go to a Web si te wwwscecom or call a tollfree phone number to see if you r rotating outage group is on the list for going temporarily dark How do you know which group youre in On your Edison power bill next to your account number theres a code that starts with A or M A A M M and so on Thats your outage group number But wait Theres another category of outage group If your power bill has the code number N on it it means that youre exempt from rolling blackouts You see under Public Utilities Commission rules electric power customers who provide essential public health safety and security services such as fire and police stations hospitals jails and so on are automatically exempt from rolling blackouts even if they have emergency generators on site And because of the way electric power service is set up anybody who s on the same circuit with an essential service provider is also exempt from rolling blackouts For example my house shares a circuit with a fire station So Im an exemp t N as are the other power customers on the same circuit But heres the kicker According to an Edison spokesman percent of all Edison customers are Ns that is they share circuits with essential service providers and thus are currently exempt from rolling blackouts Let me repeat that Half of all Edison customers are exempt from rolling blackouts For San Diego Gas Electric customers its percent Mind you this isnt something Edison likes to publicize When I asked abou t it for a column three months ago Edison said it didnt know how many power customers are automatically exempt And when the company unveiled its blackout warning plan this week neither the Edison press release nor news reports mentioned the percent exemption figure True even exempt power customers can be affected by rolling blackouts at work at the store at a traffic light Still the next time you hear some power company or government official say Were all in this together dont believe it When it comes to rolling blackouts the truth is that only half of us are really all in this togethe r And even an N can see that isnt fair

settlement talks began two weeks earlier Wagner said he thought Gov Gray Davis demand for billion in refunds was too high and that a settlement probably would be in the range of billion to billion The disclosure that Wagner had contemplated a much higher figure midway through the negotiations suggests the state had more support than the judge let on Monday when he said after the talks foundered that he thought a deal should involve hundreds of millions maybe a billion dollars While the state wants billion billion of that was for overcharges during the five months preceding last October and are beyond FERCs scope o f review Even as a starting point then the billion mentioned by Wagner represented percent of the money the state was demanding for alleged pri ce gouging between October and May The judges billion figure divided between cash payments and savings from longterm power contracts was confirmed by three sources who asked to be identified only as close to the negotiations because participants had been required to sign confidentiality statements The sources gave virtually identical accounts of a July meeting with Wagn er in which the judge also dismissed as inadequate a million settlement offer made by power generators and marketers By Monday the settlement offer had risen to million But the state refused to back off its billion demand and there never was any seriou s backandforth negotiations during the day period the regulatory commission had given Wagner to craft a deal As a consequence of the failed talks Wagner said Monday that within a week he will send the fivemember commission his recommendations on how it might approach an order refunding power overcharges Among Wagners suggestions is that the commission convene a hearing before a different administrative judge to take testimony from generators marketers and the state on how to arrive at a fair settlement The options sketchily outlined by Wagner on Monday included limiting the ti me when refunds are allowed something that could reduce state claims by abo ut onethird and changing the way power plant costs are calculated to a formula more favored by generators It is not clear whether Wagner who moved from one negotiating team to another during his twoweek quest for a deal ever raised the billion settlement figure to the power marketers and generators Joel Newton who represented Dynegy Power Duke Energy Reliant Energy WilliamsAES and Mirant in the talks said Tuesday he was bound by the confidentiality pledge to keep silent on the internal negotiations Wagner also is refusing all media calls According to the account of the negotiations confirmed by sources Tuesday Wagner was angry at the snails pace of progress after the first week of th e talks On Friday June Wagner called everyone into his hearing room and scolde d them He condemned the California team saying they all ought to wear clow n suits because they were in the pocket of Davis and refused to show any independence He then turned to the generators and said that after a week of talks nothi ng had been heard from them He told them he wanted them to produce real numbers and hard numbers over the weekend and that if they didnt he wou ld and youre not going to like it Wagners admonition apparently moved no one toward a deal On Monday in th e meeting with the California delegation one source quoted Wagner as saying the settlement number he received from the generators and marketers is so low I cant even present it to you Im not happy with the figures theyre not adequate others quoted the judge as saying At that point the sources said Wagner said he was thinking of a settlemen t of billion in cash billion in longterm contract savings and other money from outofstate investorowned utilities and even the federal Bonneville Power Administration which markets power from dams in the Northwest But as the clock wound down on the negotiations nothing much happened unti l Friday and Saturday when the California team met with the five largest pow er generators It was at those meetings that the generators offered million in refund s to settle their disputes with the state But the money would have gone to reduce the tab for what they were owed by the state and California utilitie s and it was loaded with conditions including the state dropping all of its investigations and lawsuits Wagner declared the talks over Monday saying he was unable to bring the parties together The Bees David Whitney can be reached at or Davis repeats threat to sue FERC to get full refund By

than the billion he and other state officials have demanded The Democratic governor also lobbed threats at state legislators suggestin g that he may call a special session to prevent them from embarking upon a monthlong summer break next week Instead of vacationing Davis said lawmakers must work to approve an agreement between the state and Southern California Edison that would save the utility from bankruptcy Though the governor has indicated previously that the state may take the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to court his announcement Tuesday mad e it clear he intends to follow through Settlement talks with power generators to determine how much if any the companies overcharged California for electricity concluded Monday with no resolution Now the decision rests with the FERCs governing board and Davis said the state wont back away from the billion figure it demanded during talks You order what you think is fair Davis said during a news conference wit h the states top negotiators Well take what you order and well see you in court Davis acknowledged that a legal battle could drag out for months or years He added that he believes the disagreement or even a protracted court battle will not affect a tentative agreement between the state and Ediso n Under terms of the deal money to pay off the utilitys debt would come fro m a state purchase of its transmission lines and from a portion of consumers electricity rates According to the agreement the Legislature must approve the deal by Aug and Davis said he intends to hold lawmakers to that date Davis said the deadline is important because creditor committees will scrutinize the Legislatures every move to determine whether to force Ediso n into bankruptcy court rather than await a political deal Legislators are scheduled to leave for summer recess July and return Aug Davis threatened to use his executive powers to force lawmakers to remain i n Sacramento and work on the Edison agreement if necessary The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at or Dan Walters Davis plays in a virtual world while the energy reality contin ues Published July California still has a very real and very severe energy crisis to wit The state is still running up massive debts as it pays more for power than it can recover from ratepayers and is having trouble borrowing billions of dollars to cover the debt There is a strong possibility perhaps a probability that when summers he at truly descends there will be severe power blackouts as air conditioners demand more juice than California can generate or buy One major utility Pacific Gas and Electric has filed for bankruptcy protection and a second Southern California Edison is on the brink of joining it There is however a virtual energy crisis consisting of political spin media leaks and madefortelevision buzz words and it is rapidly becomin g dominant while the real situation fades into the background This weeks comic opera proceedings before a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge in Washington had little to do with reality and everything to do with the virtual version Gov Gray Davis and other officials demanded billion in refunds from t he generators and brokers who have been selling California power for the past year alleging that California is in Davis words being gouged and rippe d off But the number itself was more or less plucked out of thin air an arithmetic exercise by the state power grids traffic controller not intend ed for a refund proceeding And while Judge Curtis Wagner saw it as unrealisti c Davis and other state officials insisted on its validity There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars Wagner said as a final negotiating session collapsed But thats a far cry from the billion that Davis insists is due If you think California is going to settle for billion in refunds we will see you in court Davis said Tuesday Why is Davis being so belligerent Because its good politics Ever since h e began berating outofstate generators and accusing them of ripping off California Davis approval ratings have been climbing If he settled for substantially less the power generators probably would agree to a couple of billion dollars to rid themselves of the matter Davis would be embarrassed Politically hes served by continuing to portray himself as fighting for California and against the outofstate generators That its more political construct than reality is indicated by another eve nt this week Davis release of state power purchase data from early in the ye ar numbers that were made public only because a judge told him he had to do it Davis and his minions have been accusing Texasbased generators and power brokers of particularly egregious price gouging clearly playing on Californians instinctive mistrust of anything Texan and implying that Texa n George W Bush is a coconspirator But the power purchase records which were released only to journalists willing to pay a stiff fee indicate th at less than percent of Californias power purchase dollars were going to Texas and the private sellers in general charged the state less than such publicly owned utilities as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power The clearly adverse position being taken by FERC and the purchase data that undercut his jingoistic sloganeering are not however deterring Davis from continuing to operate at least for public consumption in the melodramatic virtual world One cannot however ignore reality forever The likelihood of a progenerator decision from FERC means that there will be no easy out for Davis or for his pending deal to prevent Southern California Edison from slipping into bankruptcy court The Legislature has refused to act on the Edison rescue plan while it awaited an indication of whether the utilitys debts would be slimmed down by FERC This weeks farcical events make it more likely that the Edison deal will stall out permanently in the Legislature and its creditors will force the utility into bankruptcy court later this summer Thats part of that nasty old reality that cannot simply be wished away

crisis is genui ne is nonetheless acting as if it is Experts are revising down scary predictions of rolling blackout after rolling blackout as Californians have opted to conserve rather than consume During June Californians cut back on electricity use by roughly megawatts when it mattered the most on hot afternoons Those decisions shaved about percent from the expected demand Thats equivalent to the output of nine or mediumsize power plants Last June grid operators ha d to call six shortage alerts This June which was hotter they called none For a state thats been derided as selfish and wasteful thats nothing sho rt of amazing Some of what Californians are doing now to conserve isnt likely to become habit in the long run Businesses may want to turn back on all the banks of lights Homeowners may decide that degrees is the right temperature when power is short but too warm when Californias supply emergency is over Yet theres a huge potential payoff into the future if some of these change s become permanent Its encouraging that the most effective forms of conservation switching to more energyefficient appliances or manufacturing techniques have yet to be implemented on a large scale Subsidies for these programs have yet to translate into changes in business es and in homes that will lower demand even further For a while this spring some attempted to diminish the role of conservatio n Conservation is a personal virtue said Vice President Dick Cheney But Californians know its become both a personal and public necessity The public may have thought the electricity shortage was an illusion but everyone knew that the higher electricity bills that began arriving in June were real And so was the risk that the lights would go out on hot days Yes the state needs more supply to catch up with the growth in demand Yet long after the crisis is over there will be plenty of potential on the efficiency side of the equation as well to protect the quality of life and

WRITER July SACRAMENTO Gov Gray Davis had a tough message for federal regulators yesterday after the failure of settlement talks in Californias bid to get an billion refund from electricity suppliers See you in court The governor said California will seek a full billion refund for electricity overcharges even if federal regulators award the maximum refun d of billion allowed under their guidelines Our message is just order what you are going to order Davis said of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission We believe you should order billion But you order what you think is fair We will take what you order then we will see you in court Davis joined by his negotiating team made the remarks at a news conferenc e a day after two weeks of closeddoor talks with suppliers in Washington failed to reach an agreement An administrative law judge made a recommendation to the regulatory commission that Davis top negotiator Michael Kahn chairman of the California Independent System Operator expects to result in a refund of mo re than billion Davis said that a revealing decision will be made by the commission which he hopes has embarked on a new path with the appointment by President Bush o f two new members Pat Wood of Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania Are they on the side of consumers as the federal power act envisions them being Davis asked or are they just there to do the industrys bidding as they have so often in the past Kahn said rules adopted by FERC cut off the refund period at last October trimming billion from the billion overcharge claimed by California dating to May He said FERC has no jurisdiction over municipal utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power that sold power to the state The municipal districts overcharged the state by about million according to Kahn As a result he said the maximum refund that FERC could order for Californ ia is about billion We made it clear to everyone that if we did not settle for billion w e would seek redress in court for the remainder of the money above billion Kahn said Calpine of San Jose and several other generators have expressed interest in the states offer to negotiate oneonone with the state while the federal regulators consider their decision Kahn said Calpine says deal with state close on alleged overcharges By Don Thompson ASSOCIATED PRESS July SACRAMENTO Calpine Corp said Tuesday it is near agreement with Califo rnia officials over money the state says the company overcharged for electricity That would make it the first company to settle a part of the billion t he state wants in negotiations before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission However San Josebased Calpine has offered far less than the million the state claims it is owed We obviously disagree with that number because we disagree with some of t he assumptions used for the estimate said Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander We dont think its anywhere near that We think its a low number He wouldnt specify the companys counteroffer but noted new FERC figures showing the company did million in business with the state in the first five months of this year The California Independent System Operator estimated the company owed more in overcharges than it had in total sales for the period from May to May a financial impossibility Highlander said The ISO essentially multiplied what Calpine was able to produce by the amou nt it charged for electricity Highlander said without taking into account ho w much electricity the company actually sold ISO spokesman Michael Bustamante defended the projections by the states gr id operator estimates he said were validated during two weeks of FERC negotiations that ended Monday The ISO took the methodology adopted by the federal regulator in a June order capping electricity rates then worked backward to May to reach its estimate Bustamante said Generators and state negotiators were unable to reach a settlement during t he two weeks of talks overseen by FERC chief administrative law judge Curtis L Wagner leaving Wagner to make his own recommendation to the commission Wagner said Monday the state may be owed perhaps billion in overcharges but said that could be offset by money the generators are owed for the powe r they sold into the state California officials believe generators owe about billion in refunds usi ng the June order that Wagner adopted as his benchmark even given Wagners determination that the commission can only consider overcharges after Oct At one point during negotiations Wagner told California officials he thoug ht an appropriate settlement should top billion according to one negotiator who spoke on condition he not be named Wagner suggested generators could pay billion in cash and billion in longterm electricity contracts at cheaper rates the source said That was very different from the million in refunds Wagner privately said generators were offering For instance the source said while Reliant Energy on Monday offered million in refunds California believes Reliants share of overcharges is closer to billion Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers applauded the possibility that some generators will settle with the state without waiting for a FERC decision and likely protracted court battle We need to solve this problem and move on SmutnyJones said Associated

FRANCISCO A federal judge Tuesday reaffirmed his decision to bar a ratepayers committee from Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy case and denounced the committees attorney for suggesting that the action could prevent PGE customers from receiving refunds for excessive energy charges Judge Dennis Montali ruled against a US trustee and the ratepayers committee in deciding that ratepayers as a group had no claims and were not creditors when PGE filed for bankruptcy on April But Montali criticized misguided remarks by a committee attorney on July and news media accounts that followed the hearing The judge said the repor ts left the misconception that by disallowing a ratepayers committee he would reject all claims of ratepayers and they could lose out on future refunds The judge and PGE officials emphasized that there are no matters involving PGE customer refunds before the state Public Utilities Commission State officials are seeking about billion in refunds however from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for alleged overcharges to Californian s by energy companies since last year The distribution of any ratepayer refunds would be decided by the PUC and customers would be paid whether or not they filed Bankruptcy Court claims b y a Sept deadline the judge and PGE attorneys said The judge took the highly unusual step of directing PGE and US Trustee Linda Ekstrom Stanley to consider remedies to allay any confusion among PGEs million customers He suggested publishing clarifications in newspapers that carried the erroneous information in PGE customer bills and on Web sites Stanley had formed a ratepayers committee of business government and consumer representatives saying they will be affected by PGEs Chapter reorganization But Montali decided that ratepayers do not qualify as creditors under bankruptcy law and are not entitled to official status that allows them to participate in the bankruptcy and receive funding from PGE Stanley said she

southwestern Riverside County connecting its power grid with Southern California Edison s The cost of the project is estimated at million and must be approved b y the states Public Utilities Commission But state officials listed alternative routes in papers released at a publi c hearing Tuesday Some of the other ideas include putting the transmission line around the edges of an Indian reservation or running a route through t he Cleveland National Forest Once a final selection is made the information will be given to PUC commissioners who will either approve or deny the project Many residents who live in the path of the proposed transmission line dont want the project An attorney representing several groups that oppose SDGE s plans said there was no mention of alternative routes

Mihaly Associated Press White House bends under energy conservation pressure Posted at am PDT Wednesday July BY H JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON AP Under pressure to include more conservation measures tha t reduce energy use congressional Republicans are moving toward a compromise to increase fuel efficiency requirements for sport utility vehicles as part of an energy package Key House GOP lawmakers said Tuesday they expect some increase in fuel economy requirements especially for SUVs in energy legislation working it s way through the House Democrats who have a majority in the Senate also favor requiring improved motor vehicle fuel efficiency At the same time the Bush administration signaled its willingness Tuesday to begin a rulechanging process that would allow the first increase in yea rs in the federal corporate automobile fuel economy or CAFE standard Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta asked Congress to lift immediately a sixyear prohibition that bans the department from consideration of fuel economy increases Lawmakers already agreed this year not to extend the ban beyond September but Mineta said he wants to start examining possible changes right away CAFE standards which mandate fuel economy requirements for vehicle fleets have not been increased since their introduction in That years law spurred by energy shortages in the early s required passengers cars to meet a fleet average of at least miles per gallon Light trucks a category that includes SUVs vans and pickups have to meet a mpg fleet average With the widespread popularity of SUVs and vans in recent years many environmentalists have argued that the lower truck standard has compromised the intent of the law SUVs and vans comprise more than percent of the passenger vehicles on the road today As three committees began crafting energy legislation lawmakers were searching for a bipartisan compromise to increase fuel economy requirements for motor vehicles Some increase in the CAFE requirement was virtually assured several GOP lawmakers said although disagreements remain on how much of an increase whether it should apply to automobiles as well as SUVs vans and small trucks and the timetable for phasing in new requirements Energy legislation that the House Energy and Commerce Committee was taking up later Wednesday contains no fuel economy provision But Rep Billy Tauzin RLa the committee chairman said discussions were under way to work out a compromise on a fuel economy proposal He said he expects an amendment on CAFE to be added to the bill either during deliberations in his committee or on the House floor Rep Joe Barton RTexas chairman of the subcommittee drafting the energy package saw a good chance the truck standards will be raised and said the automobile standard might be increased as well Other GOP sources who talke d about the private discussions on condition of not being identified by name said a likely outcome is that the truck standard will be increased three or four mpg and the auto standard left alone Momentum for some CAFE increase has been growing in recent weeks as GOP lawmakers came under increasing pressure to come up with additional conservation proposals to those proposed in the White Houses energy policy It largely focuses on production with few specific measures to dramaticall y curb energy demand Democrats have pressed for tougher automobile fuel economy standards Automakers have fought attempts to increase the standards They say such government edicts limit consumer choice and force manufacturers to build smaller cars that customers dont want Supporters of increased fuel econom y argue that new technologies are available to increase fuel efficiency witho ut decreasing vehicle size President Bushs energy blueprint would consider CAFE increases but not before a National Academy of Sciences report is issued probably this month on impact of the standard on energy savings safety and auto industry competition Davis ups the voltage Published Wednesday July in the San Jose Mercury News Vow to sue for refunds may be a bluff but he should keep pushing FERC THE strategic choice facing Gov Gray Davis in the struggle over electricit y price refunds has come down to three questions When do you negotiate when do you demand and when do you bluff Negotiations are over Davis declared Tuesday He demanded that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order refunds now The case is nearly a year old he said They have to decide which side theyre on Probably no one but Davis knew to what extent he was bluffing when he also said If you think California is going to settle for billion in refund s we will see you in court A FERC administrative judge said Monday that the amount due the state may b e around billion or perhaps nothing at all when counterclaims against t he state are subtracted Energy experts are divided about whether the state would win a suit to overturn a decision by a federal commission The federal courts have some limited jurisdiction according to University of California Energy Institut e director Severin Borenstein but that a court would reverse a commission in a case like this is extremely unlikely Frank Wolak a Stanford economist had the opposite view when asked whethe r the state has a good chance of winning I think so It happens all the time At a Sacramento press conference Davis continued to insist that there have been overcharges of billion But other state officials conceded that only billion of that is actually on the table in the FERC proceedings Davis said hell take what he can get there and sue for the rest The state argues that because FERC has determined that wholesale prices hav e not met the Federal Power Acts requirement to be just and reasonable refunds are in order But the commission has not defined what portion exceeded just and reasonable Throughout his press conference Davis used the prospect of litigation like a goad to spur the federal regulators into action But if you listened carefully he also indicated hell give them more time to consider the case Considering the iffy odds of winning in court we suggest he keep goading t he federal commissioners while giving them all the time they need Wednesday July Lights go out on Davis power show Three new developments show that some economic reality finally is being applied to Californias electricity crisis First The nations chief energy judge said Monday that California is owed maybe billion in refunds from power generators a fraction of the billion demanded by Gov Gray Davis reported the Register yesterday Even that billion amount might be balanced by the amount the state still owes the power producers To suggest workable and marketoriented solutions to the California electricity crisis Judge Curtis Wagners recommendation will be taken up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which is being petitioned for the money by the state of California Because the judges words will bolster FERCs apparent desire not to grant the refunds the state probably will go to court where the matter could be stuck for years In the long term this may indicate that competitive electricity has a future even in California but not thanks to the state Robert Michaels a professor of economics at Cal State Fullerton told us Hes referring to t he states botched deregulation effort which has been made worse by Go v Gray Davis and other officials since the crisis began a year ago FERC since the s favors competition within the parameters of politica l reality Mr Michaels added Now were at square one The industry doesn t owe billion to California As this process continues he said another positive aspect will be that a lot of facts will get aired Well see what has been happening in the markets in which power is bought and sold Second light already is shining on one area This crisis was not Made in Texas by cronies of President Bush as Gov Davis and other Democrats hav e been contending In May the governor attacked the president for ignoring the greed of thes e Texas energy companies such as Reliant and Dynergy In fact according to information on state power contracts the governor finally released Monday Texas companies were way down on the list of producers In roughly the first five months of the year the state shelled out billion to Atlantabased Mirant the most any company was paid for electricity followed by billion to Powerex the marketing arm of BC Hyd ro in British Columbia in Canada It also paid million to the Los Angel es Department of Water and Power reported the San Jose Mercury News Only about percent of our states power during this period came from companies with headquarters in Texas Third and finally a new study by the Cato Institute shows what should be done next lAbolish retail rate caps allowing prices to be set by the market This would be a better system than the present one where the state buys th e electricity and passes much of the cost along through the state budget pai d by taxpayers and bonds paid for by longterm electricity price increases Higher immediate prices would encourage conservation and production leadin g in time to lower prices lMove to realtime pricing so people shift activities such as washing to offpeak hours lAbolish the Independent System Operator which moves

rescue Edison By Kevin Yamamura Be Capitol Bureau Published July State Assembly leaders Tuesday began another attempt to strike a deal spari ng Southern California Edison from bankruptcy even as company officials predicted lawmakers would not meet their midAugust deadline Gov Gray Davis and the legislators have tried for months to craft an agreement that would restore Edison to financial health and thereby relieve California of having to purchase energy for the states secondlargest utility An initial agreement worked out by Edison and the Democratic governor set an Aug deadline for legislative approval While most lawmakers have left Sacramento for the beginning of a monthlong summer recess Assembly leaders have set an ambitious schedule this week th at could lead to a vote as soon as Friday said Paul Hefner a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg DSherman Oaks That scenario would require calling back Assembly members from throughou t the state and beyond Leaders would have to negotiate a consensus deal befo re Friday Even if the Assembly passes a plan the Senate would also have to return to send it to the governor a move Senate President Pro Tem John Burton earlier said he did not support And in a conference call Tuesday with creditors an Edison official said he does not expect a final deal by the original deadline I think we have to concede the ability to get everything completed by Augu st said Ted Craver chief financial officer of Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison We do expect to continue to work hard on a negotiated solution Edison has an estimated billion in debts to generators banks and alternative energy producers Because any three creditors that are owed each could ask a bankruptcy judge to force the issue some lawmaker s want to broker a deal that would ward off the threat Davis has threatened to call another special legislative session to have lawmakers return to pass an Edison deal by Aug He thinks the date is very real and that they should work toward making th at deadline said Steven Maviglio a Davis spokesman Also it sends a very strong signal to Wall Street that we intend to get this done on time So far creditors have been patient with Edison but that wont last indefinitely said Donald Sheetz president of Street Asset Management who is advising a committee of unsecured creditors Its likely within the next month that something could happen if we dont resolve it as quickly as possible he said But creditors seem willing to hold off because of the diligence of the Legislature to work the thing out Sheetz added The Senate and the Assembly discussed three proposals last week that could not muster enough support to reach the governors desk A group of legislators and Davis officials is trying this week to merge the three plan s two from the Assembly and one from the Senate into one that could gai n support The original deal between the governor and Edison focused on California purchasing the utilitys power lines for billion in exchange for a series of obligations by the company The Senate scrapped that plan last we ek in favor of its own The Senates proposal SB xx by Sen Byron Sher DPalo Alto is now the anchor for a legislative deal It would have the state issue billion i n bonds to pay off Edisons debts to alternative generators and banks The states large businesses would repay the money through a portion of their monthly rates The principal Assembly plan AB xx backed by Hertzberg and written by Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek would have the state purchase Edisons transmission grid for billion Another Assembly proposal woul d charge customers a monthly fee to pay off Edisons debt Components of the two Assembly bills are likely to be included in either th e Senate plan or other connected legislation to be released today Bob Foster Edison senior vice president said he believes the two Assembly proposals have a reasonable chance of restoring the utilitys credit and relieving the state from buying energy But the Senate plan he said would leave Edison with billion in debts that it could not absorb The Bees Kevin Yamamura can be reached at or mailto Bee Staff Writers Emily Bazar and Carrie Peyton contributed to this report PGE questions states cost analysis By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published July Pacific Gas and Electric Co on Tuesday called for public hearings on how t he state has calculated electricity costs for years to come It said state cost projections released to reporters Sunday evening and filed with regulators on Monday appear to be too incomplete to support the sweeping conclusions the state made In particular PGE said in a press release the missing data discrepanci es and conflicting claims make it impossible to determine how much money the state Department of Water Resources wants to collect from PGE customers Although PGE just passes along state power charges it is concerned about the collection formula because that could affect how much money might eventually be available for both PGEs ongoing operations and its past debts PGE filed for bankruptcy protection in April and has repeatedly clashed wi th regulators over how much money it should be allowed to charge in rates State determinations about power costs affect the property legal rights a nd duties of PGE and so the utility has a right to a hearing on the issue PGE said Tuesday in a letter faxed and mailed to DWR director Thomas Hannigan State officials acknowledged Tuesday that they had mistakenly released some inaccurate numbers that conflicted with their final report to the state Public Utilities Commission But they insisted that the result is the same No rate increase will be needed to repay the billions of dollars the state is spending to buy power on behalf of three cashstrapped utilities including PGE It was just an unfortunate error and somebody is trying to exploit that in to something that its not said Joseph Fichera a Wall Street financier advising Gov Gray Davis After studying the numbers for two days however PGE felt that theres very little evidence to support all the conclusions that they offered utility spokesman John Nelson said In particular PGE is concerned that the state appears to be increasing th e amount of money it wants PGE to pay in from cents to cents p er kilowatthour It also wants the state to explain how it can declare its own costs are ju st and reasonable at the same time that state agencies have been telling federal regulators they want refunds because wholesale power costs were unfair The Bees Carrie Peyton can be reached at or mailto Blackouts dont justify takeout Connell says By Ed Fletcher Bee Capitol Bureau Published July While operating in crisis mode Department of Water Resources staff worke d hour days slept in conference rooms and were fed pizza and sushi by the state as the department tried to keep Californias lights on Saying the department charged enough to feed a small army state Controll er Kathleen Connell now is asking those employees to pay the state back about for department food purchases in January We are not going to be paying these bills Connell told reporters Tuesday The state does not buy businesshour meals for staff while they are in town Connell said Additionally the use of a governmentissued credit card to make the purchases was improper she said If the department does not requi re the employees to pay for the takeout meals she said the department will have to absorb the cost The Department of Water Resources began scrambling to buy power Jan aft er Gov Gray Davis declared a state of emergency the same day Northern California was hit with rolling power blackouts As a result of the departments new responsibility staff members buying power were asked to work nearly around the clock said Oscar Hidalgo a department spokesman Buying food for staff during crisis situations is nothing out of the norm Hidalgo said Under emergencies such as these we believe we were in a position to do this Our staff did nothing other than it would do during a flood Hidalgo said Californias recent success in keeping the lights on has led people to forg et the level of crisis the state was in Hidalgo said It seems at every turn people are making Monday morning quarterback calls he said Connell and her aides said buying power is not the same as firefighters getting food while battling a blaze They said using the CalCard for buying food is specifically prohibited Its not an open line of credit she said The Bees Ed Fletcher can be reached at or mailto Utilities sell excess power at a loss By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published July Nobody expected a year like this First there were blackouts in January when theres supposed to be a surplu s of power Now utilities are dumping excess electricity in July a month when theyre used to barely squeaking by So whats going on California is using less power than expected because of a surge in conservation and unseasonably cool weather So those who stocked up including the state Department of Water Resource s and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District are now selling megawatts for less than they paid The state sold megawatt hours of surplus power in the first half of July for an average of about a megawatt hour after lining up supplies for an average of per megawatt hour a loss of about million ove r days Those who want California out of the powerbuying business call this proof that electricity is better left to private businesses which will buy more wisely because theyre trying to maximize profits History has proven that there is nothing less efficient than a governmentrun monopoly said Assemblyman John Campbell who prodded the state to release the statistics on its powersale losses Campbell RIrvine said Tuesday that his office will be requesting more da ta from the Water Resources Department possibly as early as today to bring more scrutiny to preJuly losses and to any ongoing sales The broader issue here is in the past when an Edison or a PGE does this their shareholders bear the loss he said Thats not generally the case say those who have monitored utility issues for years Investorowned utilities such as Pacific Gas and Electric Co ha ve long been allowed to pass reasonable costs along to ratepayers although regulators have disallowed costs that were found to be serious blunders There is nothing in the surplus sales that looks like a blunder at this point said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network a consumer group that often has gone to regulators to challenge utility spending Everyone on occasion sells power at a loss Enron sells power at a loss he said The question is what is their track record over an extended period Unless utilities want to buy all their power in the costly spot market the y will always have too much electricity on some days and too little on others said Jim Tracy SMUDs planning director Thats because they will buy power in advance in blocks to lock in lower prices than they expect at the last minute When we buy a contract its for every day of the week Tracy said If its degrees we need it If its degrees we dont need it Its very common for utilities to be percent to percent off on their forecasts over a years time and in any single month its not uncommon to be percent to percent off target largely because of fluctuations in weather Tracy said The variations can get even more dramatic over shorter periods You could have a real cool June and a hot July and they offset themselves in the big picture he said But this year has been much less predictable than usual for SMUD and other utilities he added because the public has responded so well to pleas for conservation SMUD began unloading power at a loss in spring when it first became obviou s its customers were cutting back on use sometimes by as much as percent and it went through another round of sales in July as temperatures stayed well below normal Its hurting us Tracy said Its nice and cool so our customers dont want it and were selling it for less than what we planned He said he couldnt provide any detailed figures because SMUD staffers generally dont prepare reports on individual sales instead they just giv e the utilitys elected board a monthly report on overall finances While SMUD has taken a hit so far Tracy said he still expects to come in on target for power purchases this fiscal year The state Department of Water Resources also minimized its losses from powe r sales saying it had purchased about percent more power than it needed between July and July a variation well within industry norms for a twoweek period This is really normal said Pete Garris chief of operations for the state s powerbuying arm The July temperatures and the conservation have made forecasting a little bit harder he acknowledged but he said he still hopes to end the year within percent of the projections supplied to his office by the states three big utilities The Bees Carrie Peyton can be reached at or mailto Dan Walters Blackout threat dims but state still faces tough energy decisions Published July Unusually cool summer weather and conservation efforts have lowered power consumption in California and forestalled at least for the moment the threat of blackouts but political and financial aspects of the energy cris is remain very unsettled When the Legislature recessed for a monthlong vacation it left behind the highly controversial issue of whether the state should rescue Southern California Edison from the threat of bankruptcy The larger Pacific Gas and Electric Co has already sought bankruptcy protection and Edison officials have said that without state intervention Edison would likely follow The Legislatures inability to agree on an Edison plan after weeks of publi c and private debate and negotiations and the likelihood that nothing will happen until late August at the earliest add more complexity to an already uncertain financial picture Had the Legislature simply rejected Gov Gray Davis bailout deal with Edison at least the utility its creditors the state Public Utilities Commission and other players in the financial game would have known something But by leaving it unsettled not only what kind of plan but whether there will be any plan at all the Legislature left a very key piece of the puzzle unfilled The state Department of Water Resources which has been buying power for California ever since the utilities lost their ability to borrow money in January declared this week that it can refinance the states billionpl us in power purchase debts plus pay for future power buys within the existin g utility rate structure which includes a hefty rate boost enacted last spring But those assurances are dependent on keeping wholesale power rates which have declined dramatically in recent weeks low and that in turn depends on the unregulated prices of natural gas The Department of Water Resources also says theres enough headroom in th e rate to begin chipping away at the utilities billionplus in power purchase debt but thats pure conjecture at this point Had the Legislatur e Davis and Edison agreed on a bailout scheme the dimensions of Edisons deb t would have been known The Legislature is insisting that Edisons parent company and its debtors absorb some debt rather than place it all on ratepayers but how big a haircut if any will be decreed is also uncertain The uncertainty extends to the Public Utilities Commission which must deci de soon how the revenue stream is to be divided among various claimants wheth er rates need another boost whether Edisons parent company should share liability for its debts and whether the Department of Water Resources will be allowed to pass along its costs to ratepayers without PUC agreement If this all sounds very confusing its because it is Even the experts don t know whether all of these elements can fit together in some workable fashio n uncertainty that was reflected in the sharp questions Tuesday to the firms chief financial officer Ted Craver by holders of Edison debt Craver described the legislative bailout plan as still a work in progress and expressed optimism that a working group of legislators and Davis administration officials could agree on a compromise scheme Craver under persistent questioning indicated that Edison would be willin g to allow an Aug deadline for enacting its deal with Davis to slide a n important element since the Legislature wont return to Sacramento until Aug But he said that even if theres agreement on a deal Edison still doesnt know whether it will mesh with the pending Department of Water Resources and PUC actions that will affect rates So while power blackouts are not imminent the tightly interwoven issues of bailing out Edison the Department of Water Resources power purchases the pending state bond issue and PUC policy remain up in the air And there ar e absolutely no guarantees that those involved can make it all work They are after all the folks who created this mess in the first place by restructuring utilities through expedient politics and reacting slowly when matters began to deteriorate last year The Bees Dan Walters can be reached at or om mailto Water crisis alert sought El Dorado Hills could run out by the end of summer officials to tell state By Peter Hecht Bee Staff Writer Published July Warning that the community of El Dorado Hills could run out of water by the end of summer El Dorado County water officials said Tuesday they will ask state and federal officials to declare a water crisis and allow them to pum p more water from Folsom Lake Amid heated exchanges at a Monday night community meeting board members of the El Dorado Irrigation District were unable to agree on a plan that would have required strict water conservation measures for the fastgrowing community bordering Sacramento County So on Tuesday district officials went to work on a strategy to obtain more water from Folsom Lake construct a new pipeline to bring water down from t he upper Sierra or negotiate to purchase water from other agencies We will not allow the system to run empty EID General Manager Bill Wilki ns said He said the district was writing to the state Water Resources Control Board asking the agency to throw its political weight behind the district s bid for more Folsom Lake water The EID argues it is entitled to take more than its current allotment from Folsom Lake by exercising its water rights for a hydroelectric dam and wate r delivery system called Project in eastern El Dorado County The system heavily damaged by storms in is able to pull out only about twothirds of the water it normally would take from the American River The remainder merely flows down into Folsom Lake But citing a shrunken lake level due to low snowmelt this year the US Bureau of Reclamation cut the amount that all regional water districts coul d pull from Folsom Lake by percent Federal officials say the EID is entitled no special treatment Tom Aiken the bureaus Central California manager said the EIDs request to pull to acrefeet of water from Folsom Lake above its allotment for the year could draw too much cold water from deeper depths of the lake The bureau must release a certain amount of cold water into the American River to protect steelhead and salmon populations downstream he said Aiken also said the EID had plenty of time to plan for its water needs because the bureau issued warnings starting in February that lake levels would be low But the EID says it is in trouble because Folsom Lake is the primary water source for El Dorado Hills While the EID has had problems with Project the agency also has been unable to ship water to El Dorado Hills from some reservoirs in eastern El Dorado County as a result of restrictions imposed by the state Department of Health Services That agency ordered the EID to construct enclosed water tanks to prevent pollutants from entering treated water basins Until the work is done two primary water storage basins cant be used to supply water to western El Dorado County EID officials say El Dorado Hills a booming community of more than residents needs acrefeet of water from Folsom Lake to meet the need s of current residents and an ongoing surge in residential construction EID officials say theyll only receive about acrefeet from Folsom Lake a s a result of the cutbacks ordered by the Bureau of Reclamation At Monday nights special meeting EID board member Al Vargas and other officials warned that the community would run out of water by September if urgent action is not taken Were in a crisis situation and we need to do something Vargas said He urged the EID to immediately declare a Stage water emergency for El Dorado Hills Such a declaration would allow the EID to conduct hearings on whether to issue citations for failure to conserve water suspend water met er sales and impose higher droughtyear water rates On June the EID imposed a Stage water warning that sought a perce nt to percent reduction in water use for all customers in the EIDs more th an squaremile service area in El Dorado County Mandatory measures includ ed prohibitions against using potable or drinking water to wash driveways an d parking lots or to fill ponds With only three of five EID board members present Monday night Vargas and fellow board member Howard Kastan voted to order the more severe Stage water emergency restrictions for El Dorado Hills The plan failed to win the required three votes to pass when board member Dirk Gillmeister decline d to go along Gillmeister said he wanted to delay action until an Aug meeting when two other board members would be present Vargas saying there was no time to waste voted against continuing the ite m The board has consistently tried to sweep this under the rug as if there i s no problem here Ultimately the board directed the EID staff to pursue three possible options begin negotiations to buy water from other agencies seek more wat er from Folsom Lake or build a pipeline to carry more water from eastern El Dorado County But Wilkins said the pipeline project which would take up to days to complete would would free up only to acrefeet for El Dorado Hills much less than needed While the EID wants more water from Folsom Lake its failure to adopt stricter conservation measures may not help politically We felt if they would implement mandatory water conservation measures immediately they could probably squeeze through and meet their needs for the year Aiken said The Bees Peter Hecht can be reached at or mailto PGE Edison disagree on rate increase State says just more than half of revenue needed rest for utilities By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER July SACRAMENTO Pacific Gas Electric yesterday sharply questioned whether t he Davis administration can avoid an additional rate increase but a Southern California Edison official said the existing rates may cover all the costs The opposite reactions to an administration proposal for splitting rate revenue between the state and the utilities reflects differing views of how Gov Gray Davis has handled the electricity crisis PGE broke off negotiations with Davis in early April and filed for bankruptcy Edison has been working with Davis on a legislative rescue plan to avoid bankruptcy and the Assembly may be asked to return Friday to vote on the proposal The latest disagreement is over the administrations announcement Sunday th at the state will need only a little more than half of the revenue from a reco rd rate increase leaving the rest for the struggling utilities The increase began appearing in the bills of PGE and Edison customers last month The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve a similar rat e increase for San Diego Gas Electric next month The Davis administration said it will need cents of a cents per kilowatthour rate increase for PGE and Edison customers to pay off a billion power bond that will be issued in the fall Davis consultants after weeks of speculation said no additional rate increases will be needed to cover the bond pay for longterm power contrac ts and provide a revenue stream for additional bonds to pay off utility debts But PGE and Edison reached different conclusions after looking at the information that the administration provided to the PUC The commission wil l decide how to split the rate revenue next month Edisons chief financial officer Ted Craver told bondholders during a conference call yesterday that all of the costs appear to fit into the existing rates if the administrations model and numbers are accepted But we must remember that we started deregulation with forecasts that made it look like everything fit too Craver said We are facing highly volatile gas prices PGE said the information provided by the administration seems to add up to an additional rate increase next year and called for a public hearing PGE said the administration filing only contains data for the next months Such an omission makes it impossible to analyze the administrations claims to the media that a rate decrease could be likely in PGE sai d in a statement The governors press secretary Steve Maviglio said yesterday evening that the administration is preparing a pointbypoint refutation of the issues raised in PGEs statement The Senate approved an Edison rescue plan last week before leaving for a monthlong summer recess Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg DVan Nuys adjourned the Assembly on call The speakers press secretary said a working group is meeting with

ASSOCIATED PRESS July RIVERSIDE The Board of Supervisors wants a proposed powerline route t hat would run through the southwest part of the county to stay clear of cities The board will ask the state Public Utilities Commission to direct San Dieg o Gas and Electric which has submitted the powerline plans to look for alternate routes including areas east of Temecula The utility wants to run a volt power line through southwestern Riverside County connecting its power grid with Southern California Edison s The plan which is estimated at million must be approved by PUC members SDGE officials said they are willing to meet with county administrators to discuss alternative routes Residents opposing the project said the utility should upgrade its existing lines DIAMOND BAR Air quality officials on Tuesday rejected a proposal by an energy company to start building a power plant near a state prison because there arent strict smog prevention measures in place The South Coast Air Quality Management District told Delta Power Co of New Jersey to come back Aug with a revised plan That will leave a little more than a month before the plant is supposed to be operational under the governors emergency fasttrack program for new power plants Delta wants to build a power plant near the California Institution for Men in Chino which would supply about homes with electricity The natural gas facility would cost about million The governors emergency plan eases pollution restrictions and shortens the review process but the plant still must receive approval by the AQMD The agency agreed to give Delta a permit back in May But after environmentalists protested board members expressed concerns about excess nitrogen dioxide that would be emitted by the plant Were under an obligation to act quickly but were under no obligation to suspend our rules AQMD official Peter Mieras said Tuesday SAN LUIS OBISPO Pacific Gas and Electric Co has been cutting down tre es near its nuclear power plant to reduce the possibility of a fire that could knock out power lines during peak demand However utility officials said Tuesday that it wont cut as many trees as it had originally planned PGE officials said they would cut about percent of the trees and not the to percent once planned We found that we were able to get the canopy separation we need by removin g fewer trees said Jeff Lewis PGE spokesman PGE began cutting down the trees last week beneath highvoltage lines connected to the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant Work wont be completed for another two weeks US plans upgrading of energy bottleneck Firms bid on Path grid job Abraham says By Gordon Smith COPLEY NEWS SERVICE July LOS ANGELES Raising the political stakes in a battle over how to solve t he states power crisis and who will get credit for it Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said yesterday that the federal government plans to have private companies upgrade central Californias Path a bottleneck in the states electrical transmission grid Abraham speaking at a news conference here said federal officials have received bids from unspecified companies interested in building a third transmission line along an mile corridor between Los Banos in Merced County and Gates near Coalinga in Fresno County The line and related improvements would enable an additional megawatts enough power for million households to flow from generating plants in Southern California to the northern part of the state he said There have been moments during the recent blackouts when the southern part of the state had an excess of power and we couldnt get the electricity from the south to the north Abraham said Fifteen hundred megawatts would have made a major difference The bids from private contractors mean the line which will cost an estimat ed million can now be built in a way that doesnt require either the taxpayers or ratepayers of California or the United States of America to ha ve to take responsibility for it Abraham said However that claim was contradicted by Michael Hacskaylo an administrator for the Western Area Power Administration who appeared with Abraham Hacskaylo said ratepayers ultimately would bear the cost of building the li ne through higher electricity rates One way or another there will probably be a transmission rate charge to mo ve power over this new line and it would show up in the overall cost o f power It would not I think show up as a separate charge on electricity bills he said Yesterdays announcement by Abraham caught state officials by surprise Ste ve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said the governor did not know o f the announcement in advance and was unaware of details of the federal proposal to upgrade Path The governor is skeptical of any effort by private companies to increase their stranglehold over the power system in California Maviglio said John Tremayne a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric which owns the existing Path transmission lines said the company has been working with the California Public Utilities Commission for months on a separate proposa l to upgrade Path on its own More recently PGE also has cooperated with federal officials seeking to take command of the project Tremayne said and the company is willing to d o a limited amount of the expansion work in conjunction with other partners We are continuing to work on both project alternatives he said Carl Wood a PUC commissioner called the Department of Energys proposal not helpful theyre giving us help in areas where we dont need it Meanwhile Gregg Fishman a spokesman for the California Independent System Operator which manages most of the states power grid said Path needs to be upgraded but noted that his agency is neutral on whether it should be accomplished under the direction of federal or state officials Members of President George Bushs Cabinet have made a concerted effort in recent weeks to stump for the administrations recently announced energy policy and yesterdays announcement was in that vein Abraham said that solving the longstanding problem of the Path bottlene ck was one of the recommendations in the presidents energy plan The kinds of costs being borne by the people and the economies in the communities affected by blackouts will be considerably greater if we don t act soon he added Reliant Energy Sues California By Associated Press HOUSTON Reliant Energy Cos has sued California to recover money the company says it is owed under power contracts it signed with the state Reliant said it is owed million for unpaid power bills in California but the lawsuit involves only a portion of that amount A Reliant spokesman did not immediately have a dollar figure available and the company did not specify in the lawsuit how much it is seeking The lawsuit filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court applies to contrac ts that Reliant made through the California Power Exchange Corp the nowdefunct exchange that was the states middleman for the buying and selling of power Among the contracts Reliant entered into were those for future purchases t he Houston Chronicle reported Wednesday Reliant said in its lawsuit that because of defaults by purchasers Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co the Power Exchange started liquidating contracts to distribute money to companies such as Reliant But the state seized the contracts before the liquidation was complete and transferred the rights to the California Department of Water Resources the suit said Reliant said that constitutes taking the Power Exchanges property rights without just compensation under the California constitution The Houstonbased company says it should be paid for the reasonable value o f the contracts and hasnt been compensated for damages it suffered when the state took the contracts Steven Maviglio press secretary for California Gov Gray Davis called the lawsuit just another example of Reliant having no shame when it comes to greed Maviglio told the newspaper that the state has said it will pay a fair and just value for the contracts The states compensation and claims board is expected to come up with the amount but Maviglio said that may take

Chronicle Sacramento Bureau mailto om Wednesday July San Francisco Chronicle chronicleinfocopyright URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive MNDTL Sacramento Californias sale of surplus electricity at a loss during the first few weeks of July is a natural consequence of the states entry into the power buying business several energy analysts said yesterday While critics blasted the administration for what they called inept handlin g of power purchases some energy experts and representatives of Gov Gray Davis said the numbers actually reflect a turnaround in the states energy market State officials disclosed this week that mild weather and strong conservati on efforts left California with more power than it needed on some days During the first three weeks of July the state sold megawatt hours at a loss estimated to be about million The sale represents about percent of all electricity purchased during the same period We have achieved one goal which is to bring some normalcy to the entire process said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the Department of Water Resources the agency purchasing the states power The same things that happen normally to a utility are happening to us Hidalgo said California is now the biggest power buyer in the nation We have an impact on the markets every day he said They know when we dont need power and the prices go down They see the market conditions and adjust to our needs Susan Oto of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District said her district sometimes finds itself as does the state in the position of having to sel l off surplus power Its not unusual when you look at an annual basis to be off or percent either way she said If you look at one day or one month the fluctuation s are going to look much larger Since Jan the state has bought billion of power for Californias troubled utilities It has also entered into a series of longterm contract s that will continue to provide power for the next to years Some energy experts said the loss is not alarming given the unusual July weather This wouldnt be an issue if it was a hot July and the prices were high said Mark Bernstein a senior policy analyst with Rand Bernstein said more moderate prices have the energy market on a more even trend although he expects natural gas prices rising again as more power plants come on line The key is for the state not to buy too much power at high prices that it will be constantly selling at a loss said Michael Florio of The Utility Reform Network At this point the losses look like pretty small potatoes he said The questions are What is the magnitude and have they seriously overbought into the future Hidalgo who did not dispute the estimated million loss figure said th e Department of Water Resources tries to strike a balance in its contracts T he goal has been to have a mix of contracts that include peak power long ter m and shortterm supply State power buyers intend to have about percent of estimated demand which is determined by the utilities lined up in advance leaving a smal l amount exposed to the volatile spot market According to documents released at the end of May the state has about percent of the estimated demand for the third quarter of the year locked up in longterm contracts There are going to be days when there is a surplus and days when we are short Hidalgo said This is a product that is bought based on a weather forecast If we had planned on July being cool and it wasnt we would have been in big trouble In a letter to Assemblyman John Campbell RIrvine the director of the DWR said that since July the state had sold megawatt hours at a rate of each while it paid just over a megawatt hour for about million megawatts over the same period Email Lynda Gledhill at mailto San

natio nalEDTDTL PDT WASHINGTON AP With Californias energy crisis in a relative lull federal energy regulato rs are taking one last look at the states power issues before they begin a lo ng summer break The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meets Wednesday for the last time until after Labor Day Among the agenda items are the recommendations of FERCs chief administrative law judge who failed to broker a settlement between California and power wholesalers on allegations of overcharges Judge Curtis L Wagner Jr called for a triallike hearing within days t o resolve the dispute California claims generators overcharged by billion wholesalers offered to refund slightly more than million After presiding over days of closeddoor talks at the commissioners request Wagner said California failed to make its case for billion b ut that very large refunds are due is clear He said refunds could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than billion California officials have said they hope FERC will reject Wagners recommendation for several reasons for one thing California wants overcharges dating back to May Wagner suggested going back only to October FERC ordered the talks in the hope that brief but intense negotiations cou ld produce a settlement particularly with the threat of regulatory action hanging over the participants Michael Kahn is chairman of the California Independent System Operator whi ch manages most of the states electricity grid and Californias lead negotiator in the talks He said commissioners have more than enough eviden ce to support ordering refunds on Wednesday I hope they dont order more days of hearings and all that Kahn said FERC has in front of it an enormous record Commissioners also may discuss the independence of the ISO board of directors Wagner referred to the boards independence as a joke accordi ng to participants in the failed negotiations And energy suppliers have complained that the board appointed by Gov Gray Davis is too closely allied with the state Department of Water Resources which buys power for t he state Davis succeeded in replacing the old board of directors which included energy industry representatives Davis said they ignored consumer interests FERC imposed aroundtheclock controls on wholesale power prices in June Previously prices were capped only during power emergencies But a

electricity contracts are so sketchy and inconsistent that it is impossible to tell how much customers will have to pay and whether current rates wi ll cover PGEs costs The more they appear to keep

URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive MNDTL Washington A nasty power struggle is looming between Gov Gray Davis and federal energy regulators over who should control Californias energy marke t The possible outcome The five Davis appointees on the board of the California Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid will be dumped in favor of a new board composed of socalled disinterested parties mostly energy experts from industry and academia Davis press spokesman Steve Maviglio said this week that the state has been told informally that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions move could come as early as today When it does the state will fight The governor says he will declare nuclear war if they take the ISO away fr om the state Maviglio said Regulatory commission officials are poised to discuss the change at the urging of private electricity producers who complain that the current CalI SO board fails to meet federal requirements and is weighted against them But consumer advocates wonder why the commission would make changes in the states energy program just when it seems that California might be digging its way out of its crisis through a combination of conservation and power plant construction The timing of the possible regulatory commission order is a question mark however California congressional sources say members of the regulatory commission staff have told them the move probably wont come soon The furor started earlier this month when regulatory commission Chairman Cu rt Hebert was quoted as saying that he wants to issue an order to replace the current CalISO board as soon as August But the commission could delay such an order in an attempt to first deal wi th other pressing topics These include ordering a day evidentiary hearing into Californias demand for billion in alleged overcharges by power generators Or it could be that Hebert cannot muster a majority of the fivemember federal regulatory board to support him WHERE STATE COMES FROM The states position is that federal authorities who have clashed repeated ly with Davis during the states energy crisis do not have the legal power to take away a statecreated authority said Maviglio The idea of stripping away state control of the ISO is being pushed by the Electric Power Supply Association a group of power marketers and seller s The group petitioned the commission to reorganize the board in April Industry representatives argue that the fivemember board is too politicall y tied to the Democratic governor and the Legislature and to the state throu gh the Department of Water Resources which is Californias No power buyer The power producers have been up in arms since January when the state replaced a member ISO board balanced between power producers and consume rs with the smaller fivemember board handpicked by the governor Davis argued that the old board was unwieldy and clogged with people direct ly beholden to the power industry The new board would be more responsive to t he states needs state officials argued Thats the problem power producers said CONTROL AT STAKE It gives too much control to the buyer which is the state said Lynne Church president of the industry association Church said she has member marketers and power sellers who would like to se ll directly to customers especially Californias big industrial power buyers But because the state is about to float a multibilliondollar bond measure for electricity purchases it will require that all power sales go through the state and not through such private buyers Theyre just going to be able to keep competitors out of the grid Chur ch said She said an impartial ISO board would help ensure an open marketplace Mark Stultz a vice president of the power suppliers association said his group hopes that a possible regulatory commission order to regear the ISO would be the first step toward creating one or two regional power buying authorities for the entire Western US grid Wed be happy with a larger regional transmission organization one with greater independence Stultz said But Marc Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America said that shaking up the ISO is a bad idea It would appear California has made a lot of progress in dealing with the problem he said Why do they want to fuss with these people MOTIVES SUSPECT Cooper said he distrusted the power companies motives for dismantling the current ISO These guys are not interested in the public interest only in the private interest he said Email the writers at mailto and mailto San

schools budget Gov Gray Davis is set to sign into the law this week Silicon Valley educators are preparing to chop programs halt hiring and freeze salary increases as they brace for anothe r year of soaring utility bills District leaders say the million included in the budget to help school s cover their higher power costs is not nearly enough to patch the holes created in their finances by electricity bills that have doubled in some cases in two years We are planning for the worst said Jim Ritchie superintendent of Moreland School District in West San Jose Ritchie said the elementary district may not be able to hire as many teachers as it might need next yea r after dipping into reserves to pay an anticipated utility bill Its like taking it out of the cookie jar Ritchie said Taking it ou t for utilities means you cant take it out if you need a new teacher Education was by far the biggest winner in the state budget battle that end ed Monday The final legislation which Davis has said he would sign by weeks end increases K spending by percent to billion in the fiscal year that began July That brings state spending to about per student In addition to a percent costofliving adjustment that schools may use as they please the budget includes million for schools that score in the bottom half on state tests Several competing bills still winding throu gh the Legislature would determine exactly how schools should spend that money The budget also includes million more to expand afterschool programs a s well as million in additional school aid to correct historic funding inequities among districts The million to offset energy costs will provide approximately per student to every district that reduces its energy consumption percent t he California Association of School Business Officials estimates Many local educators said they were relieved that school aid was not slashe d during a budget year when everything seemed to be on the table But they added that this years increase of percent feels less generous considering that the education budget grew percent last year when the state was flush The doubledigit raises districts negotiated with teachers unions last yea r seem unlikely to be repeated given the growing energy costs District leaders said they approved those large teacher raises to draw more candidat es to the area and to retain teachers fleeing the high costs of Silicon Valley Cupertino schools Superintendent William Bragg said the ballooning cost of power is cutting into the money that might be set aside for new salary

yet another rate increase they say and schools reserves could be drained by even higher energy bills for years But teachers union leaders balked at districts contentions that they are low on funds calling it a bargaining ploy to avoid raises next year Theyre going to have to do some belttightening but its not nearly as extreme as theyre making it out to be said Bob Nichols Santa Clara County representative of the California Teachers Association Nichols said energy costs in California represent a relatively small amount about percent of a districts budget according to a survey conduct ed

Orange County Register The state Assembly adjourned Monday for a monthlong recess without approvin g a rescue plan for Southern California Edison which believes it can stave o ff bankruptcy even if lawmakers fail to come up with a solution by an Aug deadline Gov Gray Davis the main proponent of a rescue for the states No utility may still call lawmakers back for a special session to deal with t

bill Friday The Senate adjourn ed earlier In our view its just a matter of time said Brian Bennet vice presiden t of external affairs for Edison International the utilitys parent company Whats really encouraging is that all the naysayers said this would never happen In less than four months we have lawmakers on the record saying a legislative solution is preferable to bankruptcy Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DVan Nuys will form a group of six to eig ht lawmakers to write legislation for an Edison bailout during the summer recess The original bailout deal between Edison and Davis called for

utility to creditworthiness so it can buy power The company and utility analysts say the Senate plan sponsored by Richard Polanco DLos Angeles would not restore the utility to full financial health because it would leave Edison with billion in debt that would hav e to be negotiated with creditors That bill SB would allow Edison to float billion in bonds to cover its back debt which would be paid off by businesses that use more than kilowatts of power during peak periods Under the plan the state would hav e the option of buying Edisons transmission lines for billion It also would give the state Public Utilities Commission the goahead to investigat e the transfer over a fouryear period of billion by the utility to Edis on International Edison says its parent company used the money to buy back stock to pay dividends and to fund projects at another subsidiary Mission Energy If Edison is forced into bankruptcy which could happen if three creditors band together to do so California could be stuck buying electricity for th e million ratepayers served by the utility for the several years that bankruptcy proceedings would likely last However the states Department of Water Resources

published late Tuesday PHOENIX Dow Jones The Arizona Corporation Commission took a major step Tuesday toward terminating the organization charged with overseeing electri c utility competition in the state Although one of the three commissioners favored abolishing the Arizona Independent Scheduling Administrator immediately the regulatory panel decided instead to begin a day process during which time parties will fi le comments and commission staff will prepare a report including recommendations for commission action Lets kill the AISA now advocated Commissioner Jim Irvin noting that there currently is no competition for electric service in Arizona to administrate What scheduling did AISA do yesterday What scheduling did AISA do today The answer is none said Irvin There is no competition There is no need for an AISA What are we doing other than throwing money away Were asking the utilities to throw ratepayers money away In the past commission staff engineer Jerry Smith has described the continued existence of the AISA as critical to competition evolving in Arizona for electric service because it would ensure equal access to the electric grid The question of the continued need for the AISA now that Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC has approved the operating protocols it drafted and participating utilities are abiding by them was raised by Commissioner Marc Spitzer who noted in a July letter to the other board members that competition had not evolved in Arizona as expected when the AI SA was established With the crisis in California the winds have shifted for now and a competitive landscape is taking longer than anticipated to evolve Spitzer wrote He concluded that it would be wasteful to continue spending money on the AISA when its only remaining mission is to ensure fair competition where no competition exists In that letter Spitzer also described a proposed regional successor agency the Desert Southwest Transmission and Reliability Operator or Desert STAR as on the threshold of existence However even as Spitzer was writing that letter the FERC announced that i t now wants four big electric transmission organizations formed to manage the flow of electricity in the Northeast Southeast Midwest and West These megaregional transmission organizations or RTOs would replace the smalle r RTOs such as Desert STAR proposed to operate the electric grid in Arizona New Mexico Colorado eastern Wyoming and west Texas I was operating under the assumption of an imminent filing by Desert STAR with FERC that has been thrown into chaos said Spitzer who nevertheless made the motion to begin the process of considering when and how to termina te the AISA I dont think docketing this reflects a retreat from competition Spitzer said

Debruycker a Dutton cattleman have a contract with Montana Power Co for the electricity The contract at less that cents a kilowatt will be reviewed by the state Public Service Commission review in Helena Thursday Vinson and Debruycker formed Rocky Mountain Power Inc which will build th e coal gasification plant plus an ethanol and cement block plant The other two plants will provide byproduct

the site on Monda y Vinson said he has applied for an air quality permit from the Department of Environmental Quality Industrial water rights that come with the property have been acquired and a

unlikely that the Legislature will agree o n a financial rescue plan for Southern California Edison by an Aug deadline officials at the troubled utility said Tuesday that they were content to let negotiations continue in essence granting an informal extension to the agreement between the company and Gov Gray Davis Speaking to creditors in a conference call the executives also conceded th at a financial turnaround for Southern California Edison looks possible within current electricity rates based on their assessment of Department of Water Resources energy price forecasts The utilitys preliminary review of the states projections released Sunda y indicated that there is enough revenue to be derived from current rates to cover a billion bond offering to pay for DWRs power purchases this year and to cover an Edison bond offering to pay its billion in energy debts It does appear that things fit under existing rates said Theodore Craver Jr chief financial officer of Edison International the utilitys corpora te parent Craver added that the utility has not completed its review But Pacific Gas Electric Co the Northern California utility that is in bankruptcy proceedings was much less assured about DWRs calculations and called for a public evidentiary hearing on the agencys rate requirements a nd the cost it is incurring to purchase power Given the tremendous importance of this issuethat is the determination of how much our customers will be required to pay for electricity purchases by DWR now and in the futurethis lack of information should be a cause of great concern for all parties the utility said in a statement The utility a unit of PGE Corp released a detailed critical response to the water departments description of its revenue needs saying the numbers dont add up and are inconsistent For example the utility sai d it appears that the water department will collect several cents more per kilowatthour from utility customers in than in But Davis administration officials called that a false comparison saying that overall collections in will be greater to compensate for the fact that the water department collected money from utility customers for only half of Perhaps if PGE had been more willing to cooperate they wouldnt be so confused said Steve Maviglio spokesman for Davis Weve asked them repeatedly for numbers and information and theyve been contentious as usua l The California Public Utilities Commission which sets utility rates on Tuesday also asked the water agency to provide more information on its rate requirements The PUC scheduled a workshop for Friday in San Francisco at which DWR representatives will explain how they reached their revenue conclusions Edison said it would still would need some combination of legislative and regulatory approval to use a slice of the revenue from current rates to pay off its back debts Though both houses of the Legislature recessed this month without agreeing on a rescue plan for Edison Craver said negotiations among representatives of Gov Davis the utility and lawmakers continue He said Edison remains committed to negotiating a solution outside Bankrupt cy Court Last week the state Senate passed a bill that would allow Edison to float billion in bonds to pay off debt accumulated by buying electricity for more than it could charge customers The bill limits the ways the company c an spend cash raised in the offering and is about billion less than Edison was seeking The Assembly adjourned without passing similar legislation but has worked on two rescue plans more generous to Edison None of the measures includes the proposed billion purchase of Edison s transmission grid that was envisioned in the utilitys original rescue agreement with Davis This is still a work in progress notwithstanding the legislative recess Craver said Edison once seemed likely to join Pacific Gas Electric in US Bankruptcy Court but a reversal in energy prices has given the Rosemeadbased company breathing room Falling natural gas prices have slashed the cost of Edisons power purchase s and generation in half since February Also the utilitys cash flow improv ed after it started collecting a record centakilowatthour rate increase i n June Gas prices being down and the weather being relatively moderate and people conserving has settled the situation a bit said analyst

file for protection and would end up in bankruptcy only if forced there by unhap py creditors Though the utilitys initial review of the DWR projections are positive Craver said he still has some

by coalfired plants and more plants being announced seemingly every week good times would appear to be returning to the nations coalfields But from east to west across the land theres a glitch in the good times a situation that while not affecting power plant operators just yet could have a significant impact in the notsodistant future The problem is labor and not the traditional union vs management battles the coal industry has endured since the first piece of the black mineral wa s pulled from the ground No this time the issue is lack of manpower which management says stretche s across the job spectrum but labor says is a contrived situation designed t o keep laidoff union workers out of work High quotes on contracts Companies that fire with coal need not be worried right now

tons or of all coal consumed in at an average price of per ton according to US Department of Energy Energy Information Administration statistics Spot market prices have skyrocketed within the last year and coal operators finally are feeling confident enough that higher prices are not an anomaly that they are raisingin some cases significantlytheir quotes on new term pacts One and twoyear

stagnant as pools of water in an abandoned strip mine At the same time productivity numbers were climbing as mechanized mining machines took the places of rankandfile Indeed between and DOE data show productivity jumped for underground mines to tons per miner per hour from tons per mine r per hour Surface mining production rose to tons per hour per miner from But technology also has led to personnel shortagessomeone has to be tra ined to operate the hightech equipment that most of todays mines utilize These are engineers working in todays mines said RDIs Morey You have a much more sophisticated work force today You also have a group of workers who got tired of the industrys boomandbust modus operandi who followed opportunities in other industrie s and in other areas of the country and relocated from the coal fields of Appalachia Illinois and others And when workers leave they take their families with themtelling their sons and daughters on the way to nirvana that they shouldnt look back when it comes to working in the mine The result Operators big and small are crying for electricians mechanic s machine operators engineerseven management personnel Companies are ge tting aggressive utilizing radio advertising even its rumored setting up recruiting tables outside the mouths of competitors mines It used to be the little operators were the training grounds for the big guys said independent coal consultant Stanley C Suboleski of Midlothian Va But part of what we are seeing today is that with coal prices higher the little guys can pay better and their people arent leaving for the bigg er companies Mining engineering programs cant keep up At the nations mining engineering schools roughly to graduates a year have hit the job market over the last to years However those numbers vary widely depending on student perceptions Thirty years ago Penn State Pennsylvania State Universitys Mining Engineering program graduated students said Christopher Bise the George and Anne Deike chair in mining engineering and professor of mining industrial health and safety at Penn State Then a year or two after that people saw the energy crisis and we had to graduates a year by the la te s By the early s we had more mining engineers than could be absorb ed and enrollment gradually decreased into the s Now demand is back big time according to Bise but the student mining engineers are not Were averaging about seven or eight graduates a year but I would like to a year he said There is a greater demand than I can supply At the University of Kentucky the mining engineering program has averaged seven to eight graduates per year for the last decade Last September just one incoming freshman entered the program But with the renewed emphasis on energy the new administration with an energy policy were counting on perhaps as many as students registering this fall said Richard Sweigard chairman of the Lexington Ky UK mining engineering program Graduates are hired right out of school generally by Central Appalachian companies Sweigard said But within the last two years outside firms have come calling Weve had TXU and Peter Kiewit come to Lexington looking for mining engineers he said A few companies have called pleading for people but what more can I do UMWA maintains no shortage While the companies are crying the United Mine Workers of America UMWA says there is no shortage that thousands of union personnel sit idle We dont believe there is a shortage of personnel based on existing panelists there are available miners said Doug Gibson communications director of the Fairfax Vabased UMWA A panelist is a member of a panel a list created when a union mine lay s off workers Those workers must be called back when the mine starts hiring Gibson said there are roughly panelists in Pennsylvania alone and thousands also in West Virginia We feel the workers are not being called back due to age or antiunion bias he said Situation may grow worse If indeed the labor shortage is real and critical in the coalfields across the country industry watchers see it continuingif not growing worse in the future With so many people leaving the industry coupled with young people bypassi ng it for something a bit more stable less dangerous more appealing etc t he average age in the nations coalfields ranges from the low to mids Thus within a decade the entire workforce could be turned upside down The shortage only will get worse within the next few years the Universit y of Kentuckys Sweigard said

rescue Edison By Kevin Yamamura Be Capitol Bureau Published July State Assembly leaders Tuesday began another attempt to strike a deal spari ng Southern California Edison from bankruptcy even as company officials predicted lawmakers would not meet their midAugust deadline Gov Gray Davis and the legislators have tried for months to craft an agreement that would restore Edison to financial health and thereby relieve California of having to purchase energy for the states secondlargest utility An initial agreement worked out by Edison and the Democratic governor set an Aug deadline for legislative approval While most lawmakers have left Sacramento for the beginning of a monthlong summer recess Assembly leaders have set an ambitious schedule this week th at could lead to a vote as soon as Friday said Paul Hefner a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg DSherman Oaks That scenario would require calling back Assembly members from throughou t the state and beyond Leaders would have to negotiate a consensus deal befo re Friday Even if the Assembly passes a plan the Senate would also have to return to send it to the governor a move Senate President Pro Tem John Burton earlier said he did not support And in a conference call Tuesday with creditors an Edison official said he does not expect a final deal by the original deadline I think we have to concede the ability to get everything completed by Augu st said Ted Craver chief financial officer of Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison We do expect to continue to work hard on a negotiated solution Edison has an estimated billion in debts to generators banks and alternative energy producers Because any three creditors that are owed each could ask a bankruptcy judge to force the issue some lawmaker s want to broker a deal that would ward off the threat Davis has threatened to call another special legislative session to have lawmakers return to pass an Edison deal by Aug He thinks the date is very real and that they should work toward making th at deadline said Steven Maviglio a Davis spokesman Also it sends a very strong signal to Wall Street that we intend to get this done on time So far creditors have been patient with Edison but that wont last indefinitely said Donald Sheetz president of Street Asset Management who is advising a committee of unsecured creditors Its likely within the next month that something could happen if we dont resolve it as quickly as possible he said But creditors seem willing to hold off because of the diligence of the Legislature to work the thing out Sheetz added The Senate and the Assembly discussed three proposals last week that could not muster enough support to reach the governors desk A group of legislators and Davis officials is trying this week to merge the three plan s two from the Assembly and one from the Senate into one that could gai n support The original deal between the governor and Edison focused on California purchasing the utilitys power lines for billion in exchange for a series of obligations by the company The Senate scrapped that plan last we ek in favor of its own The Senates proposal SB xx by Sen Byron Sher DPalo Alto is now the anchor for a legislative deal It would have the state issue billion i n bonds to pay off Edisons debts to alternative generators and banks The states large businesses would repay the money through a portion of their monthly rates The principal Assembly plan AB xx backed by Hertzberg and written by Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek would have the state purchase Edisons transmission grid for billion Another Assembly proposal woul d charge customers a monthly fee to pay off Edisons debt Components of the two Assembly bills are likely to be included in either th e Senate plan or other connected legislation to be released today Bob Foster Edison senior vice president said he believes the two Assembly proposals have a reasonable chance of restoring the utilitys credit and relieving the state from buying energy But the Senate plan he said would leave Edison with billion in debts that it could not absorb The Bees Kevin Yamamura can be reached at or mailto Bee Staff Writers Emily Bazar and Carrie Peyton contributed to this report PGE questions states cost analysis By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published July Pacific Gas and Electric Co on Tuesday called for public hearings on how t he state has calculated electricity costs for years to come It said state cost projections released to reporters Sunday evening and filed with regulators on Monday appear to be too incomplete to support the sweeping conclusions the state made In particular PGE said in a press release the missing data discrepanci es and conflicting claims make it impossible to determine how much money the state Department of Water Resources wants to collect from PGE customers Although PGE just passes along state power charges it is concerned about the collection formula because that could affect how much money might eventually be available for both PGEs ongoing operations and its past debts PGE filed for bankruptcy protection in April and has repeatedly clashed wi th regulators over how much money it should be allowed to charge in rates State determinations about power costs affect the property legal rights a nd duties of PGE and so the utility has a right to a hearing on the issue PGE said Tuesday in a letter faxed and mailed to DWR director Thomas Hannigan State officials acknowledged Tuesday that they had mistakenly released some inaccurate numbers that conflicted with their final report to the state Public Utilities Commission But they insisted that the result is the same No rate increase will be needed to repay the billions of dollars the state is spending to buy power on behalf of three cashstrapped utilities including PGE It was just an unfortunate error and somebody is trying to exploit that in to something that its not said Joseph Fichera a Wall Street financier advising Gov Gray Davis After studying the numbers for two days however PGE felt that theres very little evidence to support all the conclusions that they offered utility spokesman John Nelson said In particular PGE is concerned that the state appears to be increasing th e amount of money it wants PGE to pay in from cents to cents p er kilowatthour It also wants the state to explain how it can declare its own costs are ju st and reasonable at the same time that state agencies have been telling federal regulators they want refunds because wholesale power costs were unfair The Bees Carrie Peyton can be reached at or mailto Blackouts dont justify takeout Connell says By Ed Fletcher Bee Capitol Bureau Published July While operating in crisis mode Department of Water Resources staff worke d hour days slept in conference rooms and were fed pizza and sushi by the state as the department tried to keep Californias lights on Saying the department charged enough to feed a small army state Controll er Kathleen Connell now is asking those employees to pay the state back about for department food purchases in January We are not going to be paying these bills Connell told reporters Tuesday The state does not buy businesshour meals for staff while they are in town Connell said Additionally the use of a governmentissued credit card to make the purchases was improper she said If the department does not requi re the employees to pay for the takeout meals she said the department will have to absorb the cost The Department of Water Resources began scrambling to buy power Jan aft er Gov Gray Davis declared a state of emergency the same day Northern California was hit with rolling power blackouts As a result of the departments new responsibility staff members buying power were asked to work nearly around the clock said Oscar Hidalgo a department spokesman Buying food for staff during crisis situations is nothing out of the norm Hidalgo said Under emergencies such as these we believe we were in a position to do this Our staff did nothing other than it would do during a flood Hidalgo said Californias recent success in keeping the lights on has led people to forg et the level of crisis the state was in Hidalgo said It seems at every turn people are making Monday morning quarterback calls he said Connell and her aides said buying power is not the same as firefighters getting food while battling a blaze They said using the CalCard for buying food is specifically prohibited Its not an open line of credit she said The Bees Ed Fletcher can be reached at or mailto Utilities sell excess power at a loss By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published July Nobody expected a year like this First there were blackouts in January when theres supposed to be a surplu s of power Now utilities are dumping excess electricity in July a month when theyre used to barely squeaking by So whats going on California is using less power than expected because of a surge in conservation and unseasonably cool weather So those who stocked up including the state Department of Water Resource s and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District are now selling megawatts for less than they paid The state sold megawatt hours of surplus power in the first half of July for an average of about a megawatt hour after lining up supplies for an average of per megawatt hour a loss of about million ove r days Those who want California out of the powerbuying business call this proof that electricity is better left to private businesses which will buy more wisely because theyre trying to maximize profits History has proven that there is nothing less efficient than a governmentrun monopoly said Assemblyman John Campbell who prodded the state to release the statistics on its powersale losses Campbell RIrvine said Tuesday that his office will be requesting more da ta from the Water Resources Department possibly as early as today to bring more scrutiny to preJuly losses and to any ongoing sales The broader issue here is in the past when an Edison or a PGE does this their shareholders bear the loss he said Thats not generally the case say those who have monitored utility issues for years Investorowned utilities such as Pacific Gas and Electric Co ha ve long been allowed to pass reasonable costs along to ratepayers although regulators have disallowed costs that were found to be serious blunders There is nothing in the surplus sales that looks like a blunder at this point said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network a consumer group that often has gone to regulators to challenge utility spending Everyone on occasion sells power at a loss Enron sells power at a loss he said The question is what is their track record over an extended period Unless utilities want to buy all their power in the costly spot market the y will always have too much electricity on some days and too little on others said Jim Tracy SMUDs planning director Thats because they will buy power in advance in blocks to lock in lower prices than they expect at the last minute When we buy a contract its for every day of the week Tracy said If its degrees we need it If its degrees we dont need it Its very common for utilities to be percent to percent off on their forecasts over a years time and in any single month its not uncommon to be percent to percent off target largely because of fluctuations in weather Tracy said The variations can get even more dramatic over shorter periods You could have a real cool June and a hot July and they offset themselves in the big picture he said But this year has been much less predictable than usual for SMUD and other utilities he added because the public has responded so well to pleas for conservation SMUD began unloading power at a loss in spring when it first became obviou s its customers were cutting back on use sometimes by as much as percent and it went through another round of sales in July as temperatures stayed well below normal Its hurting us Tracy said Its nice and cool so our customers dont want it and were selling it for less than what we planned He said he couldnt provide any detailed figures because SMUD staffers generally dont prepare reports on individual sales instead they just giv e the utilitys elected board a monthly report on overall finances While SMUD has taken a hit so far Tracy said he still expects to come in on target for power purchases this fiscal year The state Department of Water Resources also minimized its losses from powe r sales saying it had purchased about percent more power than it needed between July and July a variation well within industry norms for a twoweek period This is really normal said Pete Garris chief of operations for the state s powerbuying arm The July temperatures and the conservation have made forecasting a little bit harder he acknowledged but he said he still hopes to end the year within percent of the projections supplied to his office by the states three big utilities The Bees Carrie Peyton can be reached at or mailto Dan Walters Blackout threat dims but state still faces tough energy decisions Published July Unusually cool summer weather and conservation efforts have lowered power consumption in California and forestalled at least for the moment the threat of blackouts but political and financial aspects of the energy cris is remain very unsettled When the Legislature recessed for a monthlong vacation it left behind the highly controversial issue of whether the state should rescue Southern California Edison from the threat of bankruptcy The larger Pacific Gas and Electric Co has already sought bankruptcy protection and Edison officials have said that without state intervention Edison would likely follow The Legislatures inability to agree on an Edison plan after weeks of publi c and private debate and negotiations and the likelihood that nothing will happen until late August at the earliest add more complexity to an already uncertain financial picture Had the Legislature simply rejected Gov Gray Davis bailout deal with Edison at least the utility its creditors the state Public Utilities Commission and other players in the financial game would have known something But by leaving it unsettled not only what kind of plan but whether there will be any plan at all the Legislature left a very key piece of the puzzle unfilled The state Department of Water Resources which has been buying power for California ever since the utilities lost their ability to borrow money in January declared this week that it can refinance the states billionpl us in power purchase debts plus pay for future power buys within the existin g utility rate structure which includes a hefty rate boost enacted last spring But those assurances are dependent on keeping wholesale power rates which have declined dramatically in recent weeks low and that in turn depends on the unregulated prices of natural gas The Department of Water Resources also says theres enough headroom in th e rate to begin chipping away at the utilities billionplus in power purchase debt but thats pure conjecture at this point Had the Legislatur e Davis and Edison agreed on a bailout scheme the dimensions of Edisons deb t would have been known The Legislature is insisting that Edisons parent company and its debtors absorb some debt rather than place it all on ratepayers but how big a haircut if any will be decreed is also uncertain The uncertainty extends to the Public Utilities Commission which must deci de soon how the revenue stream is to be divided among various claimants wheth er rates need another boost whether Edisons parent company should share liability for its debts and whether the Department of Water Resources will be allowed to pass along its costs to ratepayers without PUC agreement If this all sounds very confusing its because it is Even the experts don t know whether all of these elements can fit together in some workable fashio n uncertainty that was reflected in the sharp questions Tuesday to the firms chief financial officer Ted Craver by holders of Edison debt Craver described the legislative bailout plan as still a work in progress and expressed optimism that a working group of legislators and Davis administration officials could agree on a compromise scheme Craver under persistent questioning indicated that Edison would be willin g to allow an Aug deadline for enacting its deal with Davis to slide a n important element since the Legislature wont return to Sacramento until Aug But he said that even if theres agreement on a deal Edison still doesnt know whether it will mesh with the pending Department of Water Resources and PUC actions that will affect rates So while power blackouts are not imminent the tightly interwoven issues of bailing out Edison the Department of Water Resources power purchases the pending state bond issue and PUC policy remain up in the air And there ar e absolutely no guarantees that those involved can make it all work They are after all the folks who created this mess in the first place by restructuring utilities through expedient politics and reacting slowly when matters began to deteriorate last year The Bees Dan Walters can be reached at or om mailto Water crisis alert sought El Dorado Hills could run out by the end of summer officials to tell state By Peter Hecht Bee Staff Writer Published July Warning that the community of El Dorado Hills could run out of water by the end of summer El Dorado County water officials said Tuesday they will ask state and federal officials to declare a water crisis and allow them to pum p more water from Folsom Lake Amid heated exchanges at a Monday night community meeting board members of the El Dorado Irrigation District were unable to agree on a plan that would have required strict water conservation measures for the fastgrowing community bordering Sacramento County So on Tuesday district officials went to work on a strategy to obtain more water from Folsom Lake construct a new pipeline to bring water down from t he upper Sierra or negotiate to purchase water from other agencies We will not allow the system to run empty EID General Manager Bill Wilki ns said He said the district was writing to the state Water Resources Control Board asking the agency to throw its political weight behind the district s bid for more Folsom Lake water The EID argues it is entitled to take more than its current allotment from Folsom Lake by exercising its water rights for a hydroelectric dam and wate r delivery system called Project in eastern El Dorado County The system heavily damaged by storms in is able to pull out only about twothirds of the water it normally would take from the American River The remainder merely flows down into Folsom Lake But citing a shrunken lake level due to low snowmelt this year the US Bureau of Reclamation cut the amount that all regional water districts coul d pull from Folsom Lake by percent Federal officials say the EID is entitled no special treatment Tom Aiken the bureaus Central California manager said the EIDs request to pull to acrefeet of water from Folsom Lake above its allotment for the year could draw too much cold water from deeper depths of the lake The bureau must release a certain amount of cold water into the American River to protect steelhead and salmon populations downstream he said Aiken also said the EID had plenty of time to plan for its water needs because the bureau issued warnings starting in February that lake levels would be low But the EID says it is in trouble because Folsom Lake is the primary water source for El Dorado Hills While the EID has had problems with Project the agency also has been unable to ship water to El Dorado Hills from some reservoirs in eastern El Dorado County as a result of restrictions imposed by the state Department of Health Services That agency ordered the EID to construct enclosed water tanks to prevent pollutants from entering treated water basins Until the work is done two primary water storage basins cant be used to supply water to western El Dorado County EID officials say El Dorado Hills a booming community of more than residents needs acrefeet of water from Folsom Lake to meet the need s of current residents and an ongoing surge in residential construction EID officials say theyll only receive about acrefeet from Folsom Lake a s a result of the cutbacks ordered by the Bureau of Reclamation At Monday nights special meeting EID board member Al Vargas and other officials warned that the community would run out of water by September if urgent action is not taken Were in a crisis situation and we need to do something Vargas said He urged the EID to immediately declare a Stage water emergency for El Dorado Hills Such a declaration would allow the EID to conduct hearings on whether to issue citations for failure to conserve water suspend water met er sales and impose higher droughtyear water rates On June the EID imposed a Stage water warning that sought a perce nt to percent reduction in water use for all customers in the EIDs more th an squaremile service area in El Dorado County Mandatory measures includ ed prohibitions against using potable or drinking water to wash driveways an d parking lots or to fill ponds With only three of five EID board members present Monday night Vargas and fellow board member Howard Kastan voted to order the more severe Stage water emergency restrictions for El Dorado Hills The plan failed to win the required three votes to pass when board member Dirk Gillmeister decline d to go along Gillmeister said he wanted to delay action until an Aug meeting when two other board members would be present Vargas saying there was no time to waste voted against continuing the ite m The board has consistently tried to sweep this under the rug as if there i s no problem here Ultimately the board directed the EID staff to pursue three possible options begin negotiations to buy water from other agencies seek more wat er from Folsom Lake or build a pipeline to carry more water from eastern El Dorado County But Wilkins said the pipeline project which would take up to days to complete would would free up only to acrefeet for El Dorado Hills much less than needed While the EID wants more water from Folsom Lake its failure to adopt stricter conservation measures may not help politically We felt if they would implement mandatory water conservation measures immediately they could probably squeeze through and meet their needs for the year Aiken said The Bees Peter Hecht can be reached at or mailto PGE Edison disagree on rate increase State says just more than half of revenue needed rest for utilities By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER July SACRAMENTO Pacific Gas Electric yesterday sharply questioned whether t he Davis administration can avoid an additional rate increase but a Southern California Edison official said the existing rates may cover all the costs The opposite reactions to an administration proposal for splitting rate revenue between the state and the utilities reflects differing views of how Gov Gray Davis has handled the electricity crisis PGE broke off negotiations with Davis in early April and filed for bankruptcy Edison has been working with Davis on a legislative rescue plan to avoid bankruptcy and the Assembly may be asked to return Friday to vote on the proposal The latest disagreement is over the administrations announcement Sunday th at the state will need only a little more than half of the revenue from a reco rd rate increase leaving the rest for the struggling utilities The increase began appearing in the bills of PGE and Edison customers last month The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve a similar rat e increase for San Diego Gas Electric next month The Davis administration said it will need cents of a cents per kilowatthour rate increase for PGE and Edison customers to pay off a billion power bond that will be issued in the fall Davis consultants after weeks of speculation said no additional rate increases will be needed to cover the bond pay for longterm power contrac ts and provide a revenue stream for additional bonds to pay off utility debts But PGE and Edison reached different conclusions after looking at the information that the administration provided to the PUC The commission wil l decide how to split the rate revenue next month Edisons chief financial officer Ted Craver told bondholders during a conference call yesterday that all of the costs appear to fit into the existing rates if the administrations model and numbers are accepted But we must remember that we started deregulation with forecasts that made it look like everything fit too Craver said We are facing highly volatile gas prices PGE said the information provided by the administration seems to add up to an additional rate increase next year and called for a public hearing PGE said the administration filing only contains data for the next months Such an omission makes it impossible to analyze the administrations claims to the media that a rate decrease could be likely in PGE sai d in a statement The governors press secretary Steve Maviglio said yesterday evening that the administration is preparing a pointbypoint refutation of the issues raised in PGEs statement The Senate approved an Edison rescue plan last

Tuesday rejected a proposal by an energy company to start building a power plant near a state prison because there arent strict smog prevention measures in place The South Coast Air Quality Management District told Delta Power Co of New Jersey to come back Aug with a revised plan That will leave a little more than a month before the plant is supposed to be operational under the governors emergency fasttrack program for new power plants Delta wants to build a power plant near the California Institution for Men in Chino which would supply about homes with electricity The natural gas facility would cost about million The governors emergency plan eases pollution restrictions and shortens the review process but the plant still must receive approval by the AQMD The agency agreed to give Delta a permit back in May But after environmentalists protested board members expressed concerns about excess nitrogen dioxide that would be emitted by the plant Were under an obligation to act quickly but were under no obligation to suspend our rules AQMD official Peter Mieras said Tuesday SAN LUIS OBISPO Pacific Gas and Electric Co has been cutting down tre es near its nuclear power plant to reduce the possibility of a fire that could knock out power lines during peak demand However utility officials said Tuesday that it wont cut as many trees as it had originally planned PGE officials said they

began cutting down the trees last week beneath highvoltage lines connected to the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant Work wont be completed for another two weeks US plans upgrading of energy bottleneck Firms bid on Path grid job Abraham says By Gordon Smith COPLEY NEWS SERVICE July LOS ANGELES Raising the political stakes in a battle over how to solve t he states power crisis and who will get credit for it Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said yesterday that the federal government plans to have private companies upgrade central Californias Path a bottleneck in the states electrical transmission grid Abraham speaking at a news conference here said federal officials have received bids from unspecified companies interested in building a third transmission line along an mile corridor between Los Banos in Merced County and Gates near Coalinga in Fresno County The line and related improvements would enable an additional megawatts enough power for million households to flow from generating plants in Southern California to the northern part of the state he said There have been moments during the recent blackouts when the southern part of the state had an excess of power and we couldnt get the electricity from the south to the north Abraham said Fifteen hundred megawatts would have made a major difference The bids from private contractors mean the line which will cost an estimat ed million can now be built in a way that doesnt require either the taxpayers or ratepayers of California or the United States of America to ha ve to take responsibility for it Abraham said However that claim was contradicted by Michael Hacskaylo an administrator for the Western Area Power Administration who appeared with Abraham Hacskaylo said ratepayers ultimately would bear the cost of building the li ne through higher electricity rates One way or another there will probably be a transmission rate charge to mo ve power over this new line and it would show up in the overall cost o f power It would not I think show up as a separate charge on electricity bills he said Yesterdays announcement by Abraham caught state officials by surprise Ste ve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said the governor did not know o f the announcement in advance and was unaware of details of the federal proposal to upgrade Path The governor is skeptical of any effort by private companies to increase their stranglehold over the power system in California Maviglio said John Tremayne a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric which owns the existing Path transmission lines said the company has been working with the California Public Utilities Commission for months on a separate proposa l to upgrade Path on its own More recently PGE also has cooperated with federal officials seeking to take command of the project Tremayne said and the company is willing to d o a limited amount of the expansion work in conjunction with other partners We are continuing to work on both project alternatives he said Carl Wood a PUC commissioner called the Department of Energys proposal not helpful theyre giving us help in areas where we dont need it Meanwhile Gregg Fishman a spokesman for the California Independent System Operator which manages most of the states power grid said Path needs to be upgraded but noted that his agency is neutral on whether it should be accomplished under the direction of federal or state officials Members of President George Bushs Cabinet have made a concerted effort in recent weeks to stump for the administrations recently announced energy policy and yesterdays announcement was in that vein Abraham said that solving the longstanding problem of the Path bottlene ck was one of the recommendations in the presidents energy plan The kinds of costs being borne by the people and the economies in the communities affected by blackouts will be considerably greater if we don t act soon he added Reliant Energy Sues California By Associated Press HOUSTON Reliant Energy Cos has sued California to recover money the company says it is owed under power contracts it signed with the state Reliant said it is owed million for unpaid power bills in California but the lawsuit involves only a portion of that amount A Reliant spokesman did not immediately have a dollar figure available and the company did not specify in the lawsuit how much it is seeking The lawsuit filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court applies to contrac ts that Reliant made through the California Power Exchange Corp the nowdefunct exchange that was the states middleman for the buying and selling of power Among the contracts Reliant entered into were those for future purchases t he Houston Chronicle reported Wednesday Reliant said in its lawsuit that because of defaults by purchasers Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co the Power Exchange started liquidating contracts to distribute money to companies such as Reliant But the state seized the contracts before the liquidation was complete and transferred the rights to the California Department of Water Resources the suit said Reliant said that constitutes taking the Power Exchanges property rights without just compensation under the California constitution The Houstonbased company says it should be paid for the reasonable value o f the contracts and hasnt been compensated for damages it suffered when the state took the contracts Steven Maviglio press secretary for California Gov Gray Davis called the lawsuit just another example of Reliant having no shame when it comes to greed Maviglio told the newspaper that the state has said it will pay a fair and just value for the contracts The states compensation and claims board is expected to come up with the amount but Maviglio said that may take

at a loss during the first few weeks of July is a natural consequence of the states entry into the power buying business several energy analysts said yesterday While critics blasted the administration for what they called inept handlin g of power purchases some energy experts and representatives of Gov Gray Davis said the numbers actually reflect a turnaround in the states energy market State officials disclosed this week that mild weather and strong conservati on efforts left California with more power than it needed on some days During the first three weeks of July the state sold megawatt hours at a loss estimated to be about million The sale represents about percent of all electricity purchased during the same period We have achieved one goal which is to bring some normalcy to the entire process said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the Department of Water Resources the agency purchasing the states power The same things that happen normally to a utility are happening to us Hidalgo said California is now the biggest power buyer in the nation We have an impact on the markets every day he said They know when we dont need power and the prices go down They see the market

said the loss is not alarming given the unusual July weather This wouldnt be an issue if it was a hot July and the prices were high said Mark Bernstein a senior policy analyst with Rand Bernstein said more moderate prices have the energy market on a more even trend although he expects natural gas prices rising again as more power plants come on line The key is for the state not to buy too much power at high prices that it will be constantly selling at a loss said Michael Florio of The Utility Reform Network At this point the losses look like pretty small potatoes he said The questions are What is the magnitude and have they seriously overbought into the future Hidalgo who did not dispute the estimated million loss figure said th e Department of Water Resources tries to strike a balance in its contracts T he goal has been to have a mix of contracts that include peak power long ter m and shortterm supply State power buyers intend to have about percent of estimated demand which is determined by the utilities lined up in advance leaving a smal l amount exposed to the volatile spot market According to documents released at the end of May the state has about percent of the estimated demand for the third quarter of the year locked up in longterm contracts There are going to be days when there is a surplus and days when we are short Hidalgo said This is a product that is bought based on a weather forecast If we had planned on July being cool and it wasnt we would have been in big trouble In a letter to Assemblyman John Campbell RIrvine the director of the DWR said

URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive MNDTL Washington A nasty power struggle is looming between Gov Gray Davis and federal energy regulators over who should control Californias energy marke t The possible outcome The five Davis appointees on the board of the California Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid will be dumped in favor of a new board composed of socalled disinterested parties mostly energy experts from industry and academia Davis press spokesman Steve Maviglio said this week that the state has been told informally that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions move could come as early as today When it does the state will fight The governor says he will declare nuclear war if they take the ISO away fr om the state Maviglio said Regulatory commission officials are poised to discuss the change at the urging of private electricity producers who complain that the current CalI SO board fails to meet federal requirements and is weighted against them But consumer advocates wonder why the commission would make changes in the states energy program just when it seems that California might be digging its way out of its crisis through a combination of conservation and power plant construction The timing of the possible regulatory commission order is a question mark however California congressional sources say members of the regulatory commission staff have told them the move probably wont come soon The furor started earlier this month when regulatory commission Chairman Cu rt Hebert was quoted as saying that he wants to issue an order to replace the current CalISO board as soon as August But the commission could delay such an order in an attempt to first deal wi th other pressing topics These include ordering a day evidentiary hearing into Californias demand for billion in alleged overcharges by power generators Or it could be that Hebert cannot muster a majority of the fivemember federal regulatory board to support him WHERE STATE COMES FROM The states position is that federal authorities who have clashed repeated ly with Davis during the states energy crisis do not have the legal power to take away a statecreated authority said Maviglio The idea of stripping away state control of the ISO is being pushed by the Electric Power Supply Association a group of power marketers and seller s The group petitioned the commission to reorganize the board in April Industry representatives argue that the fivemember board is too politicall y tied to the Democratic governor and the Legislature and to the state throu gh the Department of Water Resources which is Californias No power buyer The power producers have been up in arms since January when the state replaced a member ISO board balanced between power producers and consume rs with the smaller fivemember board handpicked by the governor Davis argued that the old board was unwieldy and clogged with people direct ly beholden to the power industry The new board would be more responsive to t he states needs state officials argued Thats the problem power producers said CONTROL AT STAKE It gives too much control to the buyer which is the state said Lynne Church president of the industry association Church said she has member marketers and power sellers who would like to se ll directly to customers especially Californias big industrial power buyers But because the state is about to float a multibilliondollar bond measure for electricity purchases it will require that all power sales go through the state and not through such private buyers Theyre just going to be able to keep competitors out of the grid Chur ch said She said an impartial ISO board would help ensure an open marketplace Mark Stultz a vice president of the power suppliers association said his group hopes that a possible regulatory commission order to regear the ISO would be the first step toward creating one or two regional power buying authorities for the entire Western US grid Wed be happy with a larger regional transmission organization one with greater independence Stultz said But Marc Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America said that shaking up the ISO is a bad idea It would appear California has made a lot of progress in dealing with the problem he said Why do they want to fuss with these people MOTIVES SUSPECT Cooper said he distrusted

schools budget Gov Gray Davis is set to sign into the law this week Silicon Valley educators are preparing to chop programs halt hiring and freeze salary increases as they brace for anothe r year of soaring utility bills District leaders say the million included in the budget to help school s cover their higher power costs is not nearly enough to patch the holes created in their finances by electricity bills that have doubled in some cases in two years We are planning for the worst said Jim Ritchie superintendent of Moreland School District in West San Jose Ritchie said the elementary district may not be able to hire as many teachers as it might need next yea r after dipping into reserves to pay an anticipated utility bill Its like taking it out of the cookie jar Ritchie said Taking it ou t for utilities means you cant take it out if you need a new teacher Education was by far the biggest winner in the state budget battle that end ed Monday The final legislation which Davis has said he would sign by weeks end increases K spending by percent to billion in the fiscal year that began July That brings state spending to about per student In addition to a percent costofliving adjustment that schools may use as they please the budget includes million for schools that score in the bottom half on state tests Several competing bills still winding throu gh the Legislature would determine exactly how schools should spend that money The budget also includes million more to expand afterschool programs a s well as million in additional school aid to correct historic funding inequities among districts The million to offset energy costs will provide approximately per student to every district that reduces its energy consumption percent t he California Association of School Business Officials estimates Many local educators said they were relieved that school aid was not slashe d during a budget year when everything seemed to be on the table But they added that this years increase of percent feels less generous considering that the education budget grew percent last year when the state was flush The doubledigit raises districts negotiated with teachers unions last yea r seem unlikely to be repeated given the growing energy costs District leaders said they approved those large teacher raises to draw more candidat es to the area and to retain teachers fleeing the high costs of Silicon Valley Cupertino schools Superintendent William Bragg said the ballooning cost of power is cutting into the money that might be set aside for new salary increases this year Bragg said the district expects to spend million on power this year a percent increase over two years ago Energyguzzling school construction has added to the increased cost We are

yet another rate increase they say and schools reserves could be drained by even higher energy bills for years But teachers union leaders balked at districts contentions that they are low on funds calling it a bargaining ploy to avoid raises next year Theyre going to have to do some belttightening but its not nearly as extreme as theyre making it out to be said Bob Nichols Santa Clara County representative of the California Teachers Association Nichols said energy costs in California represent a relatively small amount about percent of a districts budget according to a survey conduct ed

published late Tuesday PHOENIX Dow Jones The Arizona Corporation Commission took a major step Tuesday toward terminating the organization charged with overseeing electri c utility competition in the state Although one of the three commissioners favored abolishing the Arizona Independent Scheduling Administrator immediately the regulatory panel decided instead to begin a day process during which time parties will fi le comments and commission staff will prepare a report including recommendations for commission action Lets kill the AISA now advocated Commissioner Jim Irvin noting that there currently is no competition for electric service in Arizona to administrate What scheduling did AISA do yesterday What scheduling did AISA do today The answer is none said Irvin There is no competition There is no need for an AISA What are we doing other than throwing money away Were asking the utilities to throw ratepayers money away In the past commission staff engineer Jerry Smith has described the continued existence of the AISA as critical to competition evolving in Arizona for electric service because it would ensure equal access to the electric grid The question of the continued need for the AISA now that Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC has approved the operating protocols it drafted and participating utilities are abiding by them was raised by Commissioner Marc Spitzer who noted in a July letter to the other board members that competition had not evolved in Arizona as expected when the AI SA was established With the crisis in California the winds have shifted for now and a competitive landscape is taking longer than anticipated to evolve Spitzer wrote He concluded that it would be wasteful to continue spending money on the AISA when its only remaining mission is to ensure fair competition where no competition exists In that letter Spitzer also described a proposed regional successor agency the Desert Southwest Transmission and Reliability Operator or Desert STAR as on the threshold of existence However even as Spitzer was writing that letter the FERC announced that i t now wants four big electric transmission organizations formed to manage the flow of electricity in the Northeast Southeast Midwest and West These megaregional transmission organizations or RTOs would replace the smalle r RTOs such as Desert STAR proposed to operate the electric grid in Arizona New Mexico Colorado eastern Wyoming and west Texas I was operating under the assumption of an imminent filing by Desert STAR with FERC that has been thrown into chaos said Spitzer who nevertheless made the motion to begin the process of considering when and how to termina te the AISA I dont think docketing this reflects a retreat from competition Spitzer said

week the state Senate passed a bill that would allow Edison to float billion in bonds to pay off debt accumulated by buying electricity for more than it could charge customers The bill limits the ways the company c an spend cash raised in the offering and is about billion less than Edison was seeking The Assembly adjourned without passing similar legislation but has worked on two rescue plans more generous to Edison None of the measures includes the proposed billion purchase of Edison s transmission grid that was envisioned in the utilitys original rescue agreement with Davis This is still a work in progress notwithstanding the legislative recess Craver said Edison once seemed likely to join Pacific Gas Electric in US Bankruptcy Court but a reversal in energy prices has given the Rosemeadbased company breathing room Falling natural gas prices have slashed the cost of Edisons power purchase s and generation in half since February Also the utilitys cash flow improv ed after it started collecting a record centakilowatthour rate increase i n June Gas prices being down and the weather being relatively moderate and people conserving has settled the situation a bit said analyst Brian Youngberg o f the Edward Jones investment firm in St Louis But there are a lot of movi ng pieces and this thing probably wont be settled for years Key to keeping Southern California Edison free of Bankruptcy Court is wheth er creditorsnot Edison itselfbelieve that progress continues after the Aug deadline Youngberg said Youngberg said he remains convinced that Edison would not voluntarily file for protection and would end up in bankruptcy only if forced there by unhap py creditors Though the utilitys initial review of the DWR projections are positive Craver said he still has some questions about the DWR plan which would tak e cents from every kilowatthour sold to repay money the state spent whe n it jumped into the power business in January Edison shares fell cents to close at Tuesday on the New York Stoc k Exchange Times staff writer Nancy Vogel in Sacramento contributed to this report Mining suffering an energy shortage With more than of this countrys electricity produced by coalfired plants and more plants being announced seemingly every week good times would appear to be returning to the nations coalfields But from east to west across the land theres a glitch in the good times a situation that while not affecting power plant operators just yet could have a significant impact in the notsodistant future The problem is labor and not the traditional union vs management battles the coal industry has endured since the first piece of the black mineral wa s pulled from the ground No this time the issue is lack of manpower which management says stretche s across the job spectrum but labor says is a contrived situation designed t o keep laidoff union workers out of work High quotes on contracts Companies that fire with coal need not be worried right now most coal is purchased through longterm contracts Still plant operators need to keep an eye on the problem Utilities are th e dominant consumer of US coal last year purchasing roughly million short tons or of all coal consumed in at an average price of per ton according to US Department of Energy Energy Information Administration statistics Spot market prices have skyrocketed within the last year and coal operators finally are feeling confident enough that higher prices are not an anomaly that they are raisingin some cases significantlytheir quotes on new term pacts One and twoyear contract prices being quoted are definitely much higher than they were a year ago said Mark Morey a principal in RDIs Coal Consulting Group in Arlington Va According to data from RDI Consulting the price for Central Appalachia hig h Btu low sulphur coal has jumped to roughly to ton from about ton a year ago Out West Powder River Basin Btu compliance coal has jumped to per ton from roughly per ton one year ago Such prices could cause real consternation for power plant operators in a deregulated world where higher costs cant always be passed directly to customers Many reasons for dismal situation Its just a dismal situation according to Jim Thompson the Knoxville Tennbased general manager of Energy Publishing which tracks coal and energy markets Some companies have delayed expansion projects and even th e opening of new mines You talk to some people now and they say trying to ge t help is even worse than trying to get environmental permits The personnel shortage in the coal industry is not an overnight situation the labor pool has been draining for a number of years and coal operators did little to replenish the supply One reason was that the price for coal was nearly as stagnant as pools of water in an abandoned strip mine At the same time productivity numbers were climbing as mechanized mining machines took the places of rankandfile Indeed between and DOE data show productivity jumped for underground mines to tons per miner per hour from tons per mine r per hour Surface mining production rose to tons per hour per miner from But technology also has led to personnel shortagessomeone has to be tra ined to operate the hightech equipment that most of todays mines utilize These are engineers working in todays mines said RDIs Morey You have a much more sophisticated work force today You also have a group of workers who got tired of the industrys boomandbust modus operandi who followed opportunities in other industrie s and in other areas of the country and relocated from the coal fields of Appalachia Illinois and others And when workers leave they take their families with themtelling their sons and daughters on the way to nirvana that they shouldnt look back when it comes to working in the mine The result Operators big and small are crying for electricians mechanic s machine operators engineerseven management personnel Companies are ge tting aggressive utilizing radio advertising even its rumored setting up recruiting tables outside the mouths of competitors mines It used to be the little operators were the training grounds for the big guys said independent coal consultant Stanley C Suboleski of Midlothian Va But part of what we are seeing today is that with coal prices higher the little guys can pay better and their people arent leaving for the bigg er companies Mining engineering programs cant keep up At the nations mining engineering schools roughly to graduates a year have hit the job market over the last to years However those numbers vary widely depending on student perceptions Thirty years ago Penn State Pennsylvania State Universitys Mining Engineering program graduated students said Christopher Bise the George and Anne Deike chair in mining engineering and professor of mining industrial health and safety at Penn State Then a year or two after that people saw the energy crisis and we had to graduates a year by the la te s By the early s we had more mining engineers than could be absorb ed and enrollment gradually decreased into the s Now demand is back big time according to Bise but the student mining engineers are not Were averaging about seven or eight graduates a year but I would like to a year he said There is a greater demand than I can supply At the University of Kentucky the mining engineering program has averaged seven to eight graduates per year for the last decade Last September just one incoming freshman entered the program But with the renewed emphasis on energy the new administration with an energy policy were counting on perhaps as many as students registering this fall said Richard Sweigard chairman of the Lexington Ky UK mining engineering program Graduates are hired right out of school generally by Central Appalachian companies Sweigard said But within the last two years outside firms have come calling Weve had TXU and Peter Kiewit come to Lexington looking for mining engineers he said A few companies have called pleading for people but what more can I do UMWA maintains no shortage While the companies are crying the United Mine Workers of America UMWA says there is no shortage that thousands of union personnel sit idle We dont believe there is a shortage of personnel based on existing panelists there are available miners said Doug Gibson communications director of the Fairfax Vabased UMWA A panelist is a member of a panel a list created when a union mine lay s off workers Those workers must be called back when the mine starts hiring Gibson said there are roughly panelists in Pennsylvania alone and thousands also in West Virginia We feel the workers are not being called back due to age or antiunion bias he said Situation may grow worse If indeed the labor shortage is real and critical in the coalfields across the country industry watchers see it continuingif not growing worse in the future With so many people leaving the industry coupled with young people bypassi ng it for something a bit more stable less dangerous more appealing etc t he average age in the nations coalfields ranges from the low to mids Thus within a decade the entire workforce could be turned upside down The shortage only will get worse within the next few years the Universit y of Kentuckys Sweigard said

Wed Davis ups the voltage Editorial OC Register Wed Lights go out on Davis power show Commentary Mediator talked of a bigger refund He reportedly suggested a billion deal midway through the failed talks By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau Published July WASHINGTON Midway through the negotiations between California and power sellers to settle the myriad issues arising out of the states energy crisi s the mediator told Californias negotiating team that he thought a deal wort h more than billion would be appropriate a much higher figure than he suggested after the talks ended Monday Whether the statement by Curtis Wagner the chief administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was a negotiating ploy or a reflection of his evolving beliefs is not clear Before the settlement talks began two weeks earlier Wagner said he thought Gov Gray Davis demand for billion in refunds was too high and that a settlement probably would be in the range of billion to billion The disclosure that Wagner had contemplated a much higher figure midway through the negotiations suggests the state had more support than the judge let on Monday when he said after the talks foundered that he thought a deal should involve hundreds of millions maybe a billion dollars While the state wants billion billion of that was for overcharges during the five months preceding last October and are beyond FERCs scope o f review Even as a starting point then the billion mentioned by Wagner represented percent of the money the state was demanding for alleged pri ce gouging between October and May The judges billion figure divided between cash payments and savings from longterm power contracts was confirmed by three sources who asked to be identified only as close to the negotiations because participants had been required to sign confidentiality statements The sources gave virtually identical accounts of a July meeting with Wagn er in which the judge also dismissed as inadequate a million settlement offer made by power generators and marketers By Monday the settlement offer had risen to million But the state refused to back off its billion demand and there never was any seriou s backandforth negotiations during the day period the regulatory commission had given Wagner to craft a deal As a consequence of the failed talks Wagner said Monday that within a week he will send the fivemember commission his recommendations on how it might approach an order refunding power overcharges Among Wagners suggestions is that the commission convene a hearing before a different administrative judge to take testimony from generators marketers and the state on how to arrive at a fair settlement The options sketchily outlined by Wagner on Monday included limiting the ti me when refunds are allowed something that could reduce state claims by abo ut onethird and changing the way power plant costs are calculated to a formula more favored by generators It is not clear whether Wagner who moved from one negotiating team to another during his twoweek quest for a deal ever raised the billion settlement figure to the power marketers and generators Joel Newton who represented Dynegy Power Duke Energy Reliant Energy WilliamsAES and Mirant in the talks said Tuesday he was bound by the confidentiality pledge to keep silent on the internal negotiations Wagner also is refusing all media calls According to the account of the negotiations confirmed by sources Tuesday Wagner was angry at the snails pace of progress after the first week of th e talks On Friday June Wagner called everyone into his hearing room and scolde d them He condemned the California team saying they all ought to wear clow n suits because they were in the pocket of Davis and refused to show any independence He then turned to the generators and said that after a week of talks nothi ng had been heard from them He told them he wanted them to produce real numbers and hard numbers over the weekend and that if they didnt he wou ld and youre not going to like it Wagners admonition apparently moved no one toward a deal On Monday in th e meeting with the California delegation one source quoted Wagner as saying the settlement number he received from the generators and marketers is so low I cant even present it to you Im not happy with the figures theyre not adequate others quoted the judge as saying At that point the sources said Wagner said he was thinking of a settlemen t of billion in cash billion in longterm contract savings and other money from outofstate investorowned utilities and even the federal Bonneville Power Administration which markets power from dams in the Northwest But as the clock wound down on the negotiations nothing much happened unti l Friday and Saturday when the California team met with the five largest pow er generators It was at those meetings that the generators offered million in refund s to settle their disputes with the state But the money would have gone to reduce the tab for what they were owed by the state and California utilitie s and it was loaded with conditions including the state dropping all of its investigations and lawsuits Wagner declared the talks over Monday saying he was unable to bring the parties together The Bees David Whitney can be reached at or Davis repeats threat to sue FERC to get full refund By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau Published July Gov Gray Davis shot words of caution at federal regulators Tuesday warnin g that he will sue them if they order power companies to refund anything less than the billion he and other state officials have demanded The Democratic governor also lobbed threats at state legislators suggestin g that he may call a special session to prevent them from embarking upon a monthlong summer break next week Instead of vacationing Davis said lawmakers must work to approve an agreement between the state and Southern California Edison that would save the utility from bankruptcy Though the governor has indicated previously that the state may take the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to court his announcement Tuesday mad e it clear he intends to follow through Settlement talks with power generators to determine how much if any the companies overcharged California for electricity concluded Monday with no resolution Now the decision rests with the FERCs governing board and Davis said the state wont back away from the billion figure it demanded during talks You order what you think is fair Davis said during a news conference wit h the states top negotiators Well take what you order and well see you in court Davis acknowledged that a legal battle could drag out for months or years He added that he believes the disagreement or even a protracted court battle will not affect a tentative agreement between the state and Ediso n Under terms of the deal money to pay off the utilitys debt would come fro m a state purchase of its transmission lines and from a portion of consumers electricity rates According to the agreement the Legislature must approve the deal by Aug and Davis said he intends to hold lawmakers to that date Davis said the deadline is important because creditor committees will scrutinize the Legislatures every move to determine whether to force Ediso n into bankruptcy court rather than await a political deal Legislators are scheduled to leave for summer recess July and return Aug Davis threatened to use his executive powers to force lawmakers to remain i n Sacramento and work on the Edison agreement if necessary The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at or Dan Walters Davis plays in a virtual world while the energy reality contin ues Published July California still has a very real and very severe energy crisis to wit The state is still running up massive debts as it pays more for power than it can recover from ratepayers and is having trouble borrowing billions of dollars to cover the debt There is a strong possibility perhaps a probability that when summers he at truly descends there will be severe power blackouts as air conditioners demand more juice than California can generate or buy One major utility Pacific Gas and Electric has filed for bankruptcy protection and a second Southern California Edison is on the brink of joining it There is however a virtual energy crisis consisting of political spin media leaks and madefortelevision buzz words and it is rapidly becomin g dominant while the real situation fades into the background This weeks comic opera proceedings before a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge in Washington had little to do with reality and everything to do with the virtual version Gov Gray Davis and other officials demanded billion in refunds from t he generators and brokers who have been selling California power for the past year alleging that California is in Davis words being gouged and rippe d off But the number itself was more or less plucked out of thin air an arithmetic exercise by the state power grids traffic controller not intend ed for a refund proceeding And while Judge Curtis Wagner saw it as unrealisti c Davis and other state officials insisted on its validity There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars Wagner said as a final negotiating session collapsed But thats a far cry from the billion that Davis insists is due If you think California is going to settle for billion in refunds we will see you in court Davis said Tuesday Why is Davis being so belligerent Because its good politics Ever since h e began berating outofstate generators and accusing them of ripping off California Davis approval ratings have been climbing If he settled for substantially less the power generators probably would agree to a couple of billion dollars to rid themselves of the matter Davis would be embarrassed Politically hes served by continuing to portray himself as fighting for California and against the outofstate generators That its more political construct than reality is indicated by another eve nt this week Davis release of state power purchase data from early in the ye ar numbers that were made public only because a judge told him he had to do it Davis and his minions have been accusing Texasbased generators and power brokers of particularly egregious price gouging clearly playing on Californians instinctive mistrust of anything Texan and implying that Texa n George W Bush is a coconspirator But the power purchase records which were released only to journalists willing to pay a stiff fee indicate th at less than percent of Californias power purchase dollars were going to Texas and the private sellers in general charged the state less than such publicly owned utilities as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power The clearly adverse position being taken by FERC and the purchase data that undercut his jingoistic sloganeering are not however deterring Davis from continuing to operate at least for public consumption in the melodramatic virtual world One cannot however ignore reality forever The likelihood of a progenerator decision from FERC means that there will be no easy out for Davis or for his pending deal to prevent Southern California Edison from slipping into bankruptcy court The Legislature has refused to act on the Edison rescue plan while it awaited an indication of whether the utilitys debts would be slimmed down by FERC This weeks farcical events make it more likely that the Edison deal will stall out permanently in the Legislature and its creditors will force the utility into bankruptcy court later this summer Thats part of that nasty old reality that cannot simply be wished away The Bees Dan Walters can be reached at or om Energy Digest Ratepayer panel shot down again Published July SAN FRANCISCO US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali on Tuesday reaffirmed his earlier decision to disband a ratepayers committee that would have give n consumers an official voice in the Pacific Gas and Electric Co bankruptcy case The judge said bankruptcy court isnt the right forum for refunding rates o r settling potential future claims He eliminated erroneous statements from the opinion he originally issued seven weeks ago US bankruptcy trustee Linda Ekstrom Stanley who had mov ed for reconsideration called the new version a very careful decision but d id not rule out an appeal Stanley on May appointed an official committee of ratepayers to represent PGE customers saying they might be forced to pay for the utilitys massiv e losses Claire Cooper Missing megawatts Conservation saving state from blackouts Published July A public that doesnt believe that Californias electricity crisis is genui ne is nonetheless acting as if it is Experts are revising down scary predictions of rolling blackout after rolling blackout as Californians have opted to conserve rather than consume During June Californians cut back on electricity use by roughly megawatts when it mattered the most on hot afternoons Those decisions shaved about percent from the expected demand Thats equivalent to the output of nine or mediumsize power plants Last June grid operators ha d to call six shortage alerts This June which was hotter they called none For a state thats been derided as selfish and wasteful thats nothing sho rt of amazing Some of what Californians are doing now to conserve isnt likely to become habit in the long run Businesses may want to turn back on all the banks of lights Homeowners may decide that degrees is the right temperature when power is short but too warm when Californias supply emergency is over Yet theres a huge potential payoff into the future if some of these change s become permanent Its encouraging that the most effective forms of conservation switching to more energyefficient appliances or manufacturing techniques have yet to be implemented on a large scale Subsidies for these programs have yet to translate into changes in business es and in homes that will lower demand even further For a while this spring some attempted to diminish the role of conservatio n Conservation is a personal virtue said Vice President Dick Cheney But Californians know its become both a personal and public necessity The public may have thought the electricity shortage was an illusion but everyone knew that the higher electricity bills that began arriving in June were real And so was the risk that the lights would go out on hot days Yes the state needs more supply to catch up with the growth in demand Yet long after the crisis is over there will be plenty of potential on the efficiency side of the equation as well to protect the quality of life and reduce the high electricity costs that will likely plague the state for yea rs Governor tells FERC to be fair and then some Davis firm on demand for billion refund By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER July SACRAMENTO Gov Gray Davis had a tough message for federal regulators yesterday after the failure of settlement talks in Californias bid to get an billion refund from electricity suppliers See you in court The governor said California will seek a full billion refund for electricity overcharges even if federal regulators award the maximum refun d of billion allowed under their guidelines Our message is just order what you are going to order Davis said of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission We believe you should order billion But you order what you think is fair We will take what you order then we will see you in court Davis joined by his negotiating team made the remarks at a news conferenc e a day after two weeks of closeddoor talks with suppliers in Washington failed to reach an agreement An administrative law judge made a recommendation to the regulatory commission that Davis top negotiator Michael Kahn chairman of the California Independent System Operator expects to result in a refund of mo re than billion Davis said that a revealing decision will be made by the commission which he hopes has embarked on a new path with the appointment by President Bush o f two new members Pat Wood of Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania Are they on the side of consumers as the federal power act envisions them being Davis asked or are they just there to do the industrys bidding as they have so often in the past Kahn said rules adopted by FERC cut off the refund period at last October trimming billion from the billion overcharge claimed by California dating to May He said FERC has no jurisdiction over municipal utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power that sold power to the state The municipal districts overcharged the state by about million according to Kahn As a result he said the maximum refund that FERC could order for Californ ia is about billion We made it clear to everyone that if we did not settle for billion w e would seek redress in court for the remainder of the money above billion Kahn said Calpine of San Jose and several other generators have expressed interest in the states offer to negotiate oneonone with the state while the federal regulators consider their decision Kahn said Calpine says deal with state close on alleged overcharges By Don Thompson ASSOCIATED PRESS July SACRAMENTO Calpine Corp said Tuesday it is near agreement with Califo rnia officials over money the state says the company overcharged for electricity That would make it the first company to settle a part of the billion t he state wants in negotiations before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission However San Josebased Calpine has offered far less than the million the state claims it is owed We obviously disagree with that number because we disagree with some of t he assumptions used for the estimate said Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander We dont think its anywhere near that We think its a low number He wouldnt specify the companys counteroffer but noted new FERC figures showing the company did million in business with the state in the first five months of this year The California Independent System Operator estimated the company owed more in overcharges than it had in total sales for the period from May to May a financial impossibility Highlander said The ISO essentially multiplied what Calpine was able to produce by the amou nt it charged for electricity Highlander said without taking into account ho w much electricity the company actually sold ISO spokesman Michael Bustamante defended the projections by the states gr id operator estimates he said were validated during two weeks of FERC negotiations that ended Monday The ISO took the methodology adopted by the federal regulator in a June order capping electricity rates then worked backward to May to reach its estimate Bustamante said Generators and state negotiators were unable to reach a settlement during t he two weeks of talks overseen by FERC chief administrative law judge Curtis L Wagner leaving Wagner to make his own recommendation to the commission Wagner said Monday the state may be owed perhaps billion in overcharges but said that could be offset by money the generators are owed for the powe r they sold into the state California officials believe generators owe about billion in refunds usi ng the June order that Wagner adopted as his benchmark even given Wagners determination that the commission can only consider overcharges after Oct At one point during negotiations Wagner told California officials he thoug ht an appropriate settlement should top billion according to one negotiator who spoke on condition he not be named Wagner suggested generators could pay billion in cash and billion in longterm electricity contracts at cheaper rates the source said That was very different from the million in refunds Wagner privately said generators were offering For instance the source said while Reliant Energy on Monday offered million in refunds California believes Reliants share of overcharges is closer to billion Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers applauded the possibility that some generators will settle with the state without waiting for a FERC decision and likely protracted court battle We need to solve this problem and move on SmutnyJones said Associated

sought such recognition to ensure the utility would not raise rates further as a way of paying off its debts But US Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali agreed with PGE and the official creditors committee and rejected the idea for the second time in two months Montali suggested instead that ratepayers organize an informal committee to bring their concerns to the court and said the ratepayers also could bring matters before the state Public Utilities Commission A separate committee of ratepayers would have been able to vote on the fina l reorganization of the company a plan that could affect power

Ratepayers Panel From PGE Case Power Customers are not creditors in the utilitys bankruptcy ruling says Action does not preclude refunds for consumers TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER July SAN FRANCISCO A federal judge Tuesday reaffirmed his decision to bar a ratepayers committee from Pacific Gas Electric Cos bankruptcy case and denounced the committees attorney for suggesting that the action could prevent PGE customers from receiving refunds for excessive energy charges Judge Dennis Montali ruled against a US trustee and the ratepayers committee in deciding that ratepayers as a group had no claims and were not creditors when PGE filed for bankruptcy on April But Montali criticized misguided remarks by a committee attorney on July and news media accounts that followed the hearing The judge said the repor ts left the misconception that by disallowing a ratepayers committee he would reject all claims of ratepayers and they could lose out on future refunds The judge and PGE officials emphasized that there are no matters involving PGE customer refunds before the state Public Utilities Commission State officials are seeking about billion in refunds however from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for alleged overcharges to Californian s by energy companies since last year The distribution of any ratepayer refunds would be decided by the PUC and customers would be paid whether or not they filed Bankruptcy Court claims b y a Sept deadline the judge and PGE attorneys said The judge took the highly unusual step of directing PGE and US Trustee Linda Ekstrom Stanley to consider remedies to allay any confusion among PGEs million customers He suggested publishing clarifications in newspapers that carried the erroneous information in PGE customer bills and on Web sites Stanley had formed a ratepayers committee of business government and consumer representatives saying they will be affected by PGEs Chapter reorganization But Montali decided that ratepayers do not qualify as creditors under bankruptcy law and are not entitled to official status that allows them to participate in the bankruptcy and receive funding from PGE Stanley said she

postponed selling th e citys surplus power to the state so he can examine how it will impact ratepayers Hahns predecessor Richard Riordan said last month the citys Department of Water and Power would sell its extra electricity about megawatts a day to the state at cost between July and September The contract was supposed to have been signed last week Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said Tuesday that the stat e is ready to sign the contract Were ready to sign he said Like most negotiations that arent final things go back and forth The new Hahn administration wants to review the document before it Davis had threatened to seize surplus power from municipal utilities which havent been subjected to the California energy crisis because he claimed they were gouging the state TEMECULA Calif AP State officials said they are studying alternative routes for a power transmission line proposed by San Diego Gas and Electric Co The utility wants to run a volt power line through southwestern Riverside County connecting its power grid with Southern California Edison s The cost of the project is estimated at million and must be approved b y the states Public Utilities Commission But state officials listed alternative routes in papers released at a publi c hearing Tuesday Some of the other ideas include putting the transmission line around the edges of an Indian reservation or running a route through t he Cleveland National Forest Once a final selection is made the information will be given to PUC commissioners who will either approve or deny the project Many residents who live in the path of the proposed transmission line dont want the project An attorney representing several groups that oppose SDGE s plans said there was no mention of alternative routes in environmental documents submitted by the company Looking at the various route segments offered by SDGE as alternatives is like trying to arrange the deck chairs on the Titanic said attorney Mark Mihaly Associated Press White House bends under energy conservation pressure Posted at am PDT Wednesday July BY H JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON AP Under pressure to include more conservation measures tha t reduce energy use congressional Republicans are moving toward a compromise to increase fuel efficiency requirements for sport utility vehicles as part of an energy package Key House GOP lawmakers said Tuesday they expect some increase in fuel economy requirements especially for SUVs in energy legislation working it s way through the House Democrats who have a majority in the Senate also favor requiring improved motor vehicle fuel efficiency At the same time the Bush administration signaled its willingness Tuesday to begin a rulechanging process that would allow the first increase in yea rs in the federal corporate automobile fuel economy or CAFE standard Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta asked Congress to lift immediately a sixyear prohibition that bans the department from consideration of fuel economy increases Lawmakers already agreed this year not to extend the ban beyond September but Mineta said he wants to start examining possible changes right away CAFE standards which mandate fuel economy requirements for vehicle fleets have not been increased since their introduction in That years law spurred by energy shortages in the early s required passengers cars to meet a fleet average of at least miles per gallon Light trucks a category that includes SUVs vans and pickups have to meet a mpg fleet average With the widespread popularity of SUVs and vans in recent years many environmentalists have argued that the lower truck standard has compromised the intent of the law SUVs and vans comprise more than percent of the passenger vehicles on the road today As three committees began crafting energy legislation lawmakers were searching for a bipartisan compromise to increase fuel economy requirements for motor vehicles Some increase in the CAFE requirement was virtually assured several GOP lawmakers said although disagreements remain on how much of an increase whether it should apply to automobiles as well as SUVs vans and small trucks and the timetable for phasing in new requirements Energy legislation that the House Energy and Commerce Committee was taking up later Wednesday contains no fuel economy provision But Rep Billy Tauzin RLa the committee chairman said discussions were under way to work out a compromise on a fuel economy proposal He said he expects an amendment on CAFE to be added to the bill either during deliberations in his committee or on the House floor Rep Joe Barton RTexas chairman of the subcommittee drafting the energy package saw a good chance the truck standards will be raised and said the automobile standard might be increased as well Other GOP sources who talke d about the private discussions on condition of not being identified by name said a likely outcome is that the truck standard will be increased three or four mpg and the auto standard left alone Momentum for some CAFE increase has been growing in recent weeks as GOP lawmakers came under increasing pressure to come up with additional conservation proposals to those proposed in the White Houses energy policy It largely focuses on production with few specific measures to dramaticall y curb energy demand Democrats have pressed for tougher automobile fuel economy standards Automakers have fought attempts to increase the standards They say such government edicts limit consumer choice and force manufacturers to build smaller cars that customers dont want Supporters of increased fuel econom y argue that new technologies are available to increase fuel efficiency witho ut decreasing vehicle size President Bushs energy blueprint would consider CAFE increases but not before a National Academy of Sciences report is issued probably this month on impact of the standard on energy savings safety and auto industry competition Davis ups the voltage Published Wednesday July in the San Jose Mercury News Vow to sue for refunds may be a bluff but he should keep pushing FERC THE strategic choice facing Gov Gray Davis in the struggle over electricit y price refunds has come down to three questions When do you negotiate when do you demand and when do you bluff Negotiations are over Davis declared Tuesday He demanded that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order refunds now The case is nearly a year old he said They have to decide which side theyre on Probably no one but Davis knew to what extent he was bluffing when he also said If you think California is going to settle for billion in refund s we will see you in court A FERC administrative judge said Monday that the amount due the state may b e around billion or perhaps nothing at all when counterclaims against t he state are subtracted Energy experts are divided about whether the state would win a suit to overturn a decision by a federal commission The federal courts have some limited jurisdiction according to University of California Energy Institut e director Severin Borenstein but that a court would reverse a commission in a case like this is extremely unlikely Frank Wolak a Stanford economist had the opposite view when asked whethe r the state has a good chance of winning I think so It happens all the time At a Sacramento press conference Davis continued to insist that there have been overcharges of billion But other state officials conceded that only billion of that is actually on the table in the FERC proceedings Davis said hell take what he can get there and sue for the rest The state argues that because FERC has determined that wholesale prices hav e not met the Federal Power Acts requirement to be just and reasonable refunds are in order But the commission has not defined what portion exceeded just and reasonable Throughout his press conference Davis used the prospect of litigation like a goad to spur the federal regulators into action But if you listened carefully he also indicated hell give them more time to consider the case Considering the iffy odds of winning in court we suggest he keep goading t he federal commissioners while giving them all the time they need Wednesday July Lights go out on Davis power show Three new developments show that some economic reality finally is being applied to Californias electricity crisis First The nations chief energy judge said Monday that California is owed maybe billion in refunds from power generators a fraction of the billion demanded by Gov Gray Davis reported the Register yesterday Even that billion amount might be balanced by the amount the state still owes the power producers To suggest workable and marketoriented solutions to the California electricity crisis Judge Curtis Wagners recommendation will be taken up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which is being petitioned for the money by the state of California Because the judges words will bolster FERCs apparent desire not to grant the refunds the state probably will go to court where the matter could be stuck for years In the long term this may indicate that competitive electricity has a future even in California but not thanks to the state Robert Michaels a professor of economics at Cal State Fullerton told us Hes referring to t he states botched deregulation effort which has been made worse by Go v Gray Davis and other officials since the crisis began a year ago FERC since the s favors competition within the parameters of politica l reality Mr Michaels added Now were at square one The industry doesn t owe billion to California As this process continues he said another positive aspect will be that a lot of facts will get aired Well see what has been happening in the markets in which power is bought and sold Second light already is shining on one area This crisis was not Made in Texas by cronies of President Bush as Gov Davis and other Democrats hav e been contending In May the governor attacked the president for ignoring the greed of thes e Texas energy companies such as Reliant and Dynergy In fact according to information on state power contracts the governor finally released Monday Texas companies were way down on the list of producers In roughly the first five months of the year the state shelled out billion to Atlantabased Mirant the most any company was paid for electricity followed by billion to Powerex the marketing arm of BC Hyd ro in British Columbia in Canada It also paid million to the Los Angel es Department of Water and Power reported the San Jose Mercury News Only about percent of our states power during this period came from companies with headquarters in Texas Third and finally a new study by the Cato Institute shows what should be done next lAbolish retail rate caps allowing prices to be set by the market This would be a better system than the present one where the state buys th e electricity and passes much of the cost along through the state budget pai d by taxpayers and bonds paid for by longterm electricity price increases Higher immediate prices would encourage conservation and production leadin g in time to lower prices lMove to realtime pricing so people shift activities such as washing to offpeak hours lAbolish the Independent System Operator which moves electrons around Give this function back to the utilities who did it far better before deregulation Gov Davis should set the pace by ending his Clintonian bla me shifting and embracing these realistic solutions

Three former San Diego Gas Electric Co employees who worked at a Duke Energy plant said Thursday that the generator destroyed working parts withheld power supply or otherwise took actions that they believe drove up the price of electricity State officials said the whistleblowers comments at a state Senate hearin g today could provide the most damaging illustration yet that power generator s held down production to inflate prices on the spot market Gov Gray Davis has long alleged that power companies have overcharged the state and utilities Jimmy Olkjer a former assistant control room operator at Dukes South Bay plant in San Diego said in a phone interview that during the states power shortages Duke cut supply Although Duke a Charlotte NCbased company owned the plant and it contracted with SDGE to operate the unit he said Rather than creating more power they were creating less Olkjer said I think there was manipulation of the market The California Public Utilities Commission and several state legislative committees continue to investigate price manipulation allegations and Attorney General Bill Lockyer has said he will take witnesses to a grand ju ry next month The generators have denied they manipulated the market We stand behind our maintenance practices and have done a good job keeping the power flowing Duke spokesman Tom Williams told the CBS television network But former mechanic Glenn Johnson said he saw generation units taken down for economics Ed Edwards also a mechanic said he was ordered to destroy pallets of working parts We were asked myself and other employees to disperse of perfectly good parts that were used to make repairs of systems and components Edwards said State Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana chairman of the marketmanipulation committee said his staff has been looking for employees or others with intimate knowledge of power plant operation to come forward and he promise d that others will testify at future hearings Its the first time that weve had evidence from directly within power plants in California that the ramping up and ramping down of power generati on was a response to price and not to demand Dunn said He said he would reach no conclusions until Duke and other generators testi fy next month but he added that the former employees testimony raises suspicions at first blush The Bees Kevin Yamamura can be reached at or Consumers cut their own power in protest By Silvina Martnez Bee Staff Writer Published June When the temperature hit degrees at pm Thursday Larry Lynch turned off the air conditioner unplugged the refrigerator pulled out the TV cord s and shut down all other appliances in the house Lynch a yearold newsletter publisher in Sacramento responded to the Roll Your Own Blackout Thursday and joined thousands throughout the state to protest energy policies and promote conservation by stopping the use of energy from pm But the data coming off the grid at the California Independent System Operator didnt show the effort During the first hour of the voluntary shutoff the demand for energy by PGE customers in Northern California was almost the same as at the same ti me Wednesday ISO officials said Protesters didnt expect significant changes on the grid I feel it will at least send a message that we dont have to depend on it energy said Jackie Bell a consultant at the Capitol joining the conservation drive from her apartment on Fulton Avenue Its just a symbolic act said Peter Lopez of Sacramento who decided to use the evening to meditate Maybe Ill just go outside stare at the star s and try to spot a few constellations in the night It was the longest day of the year and one of the hottest But those determined to advocate conservation didnt mind the sacrifice People are getting focused on the fact that we have power at our end sai d Joan Blades a spokeswoman for MoveOn a grassroots organization in the Ba y Area and one of hundreds of online groups passing along the call for the voluntary blackout An electrical engineer in Oakland started the Roll Your Own Blackout idea when he posted a note in a political chat room in April Then an artist in Los Angeles forwarded the email to a number of friends and from there it quickly spanned the globe By Thursday afternoon more than people had signed up at the MoveOn Web site to join the protest Blades said Many threw blackout parties In San Francisco the nonprofit group Global Exchange gathered hundreds around a big bonfire at Ocean Beach At his home in east Sacramento Lynch did fine without electricity for thre e hours He ate tuna salad for dinner watered the lawn and when it got dark he opened the windows and let some air in We should show that people are willing to shut the power off if the prices go too high he said ISO has not declared a power emergency since May We have seen a consistent conservation on a daytoday basis and its making the difference between blackouts and no blackouts ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said McCorkle encouraged initiatives like Roll Your Own Blackout People are conserving she said And we can only support this whole effort The Bees Silvina Martnez can be reached at or Davis consultants had contract with Edison The disclosures turn up the hea t on the governor for hiring the exClinton aides By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau Published June Two consultants hired to advise Gov Gray Davis on energy policy officially disclosed their contract with Southern California Edison on Thursday but Davis aides insisted it is not a conflict because Edison and the Governor s Office have the same goal Communications consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani have drawn intense criticism since they were hired last month to shape the Democratic governor s public response to the state energy crisis The former Clinton administration communication aides nicknamed the Masters of Disaster for their spin on the Whitewater travel office and fundraising controversies at the Clinton White House have come und er fire for receiving a sixmonth amonth contract more than the governor or anyone on his staff makes Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who is running for governor nex t year has called for an investigation into potential conflicts State Controller Kathleen Connell a Democrat has said she will not issue paychecks to the pair pending her own investigation The criticism mounted after the duos economic interest disclosure forms we re released late Thursday showing that each has received at least und er contract from Edison in the past year But Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean defended their credibility saying theres no conflict of interest because Lehane and Fabiani both disclosed that they had worked for Edison before they signed their contracts with the state Besides she added Edison and the governor are working toward the same goa l Both want the Legislature to adopt a memorandum of understanding a propose d agreement that would prevent Edison from going bankrupt by financing a sta te purchase of the utilitys transmission lines Its not a conflict because theres been full disclosure McLean said Edison and the Governors Office have the same goal passing the MOU Wer e working together at this point with Edison But opengovernment groups and Republican lawmakers bristled at the notion that disclosure negates any potential conflict Derek Cressman of the California Public Interest Research Group pointed to a section of state law that prohibits public officials from influencing decisions if it would have a material financial effect on a business enti ty that provided them or more within the last year You have two individuals on the government payroll who had previously been on the Edison payroll and its not clear to whom their loyalties are he said Just because theyve revealed it doesnt mean theres not a conflict there and that theyre not serving two masters On Thursday Jones said he is awaiting the results of the Fair Political Practices Commission investigation and agrees with Connells decision this week to withhold payment from the consultants This further calls into question the ethics of how these individuals were hired and contracts were let Jones said Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte believes theres no question that Lehan e and Fabiani are violating conflictofinterest laws and suggested that the two should be paid out of Davis campaign funds which had reached million by Jan Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga added that he would not vote for a state budge t as long as Lehane and Fabiani remain on the state payroll The state of California does not need to be paying political wordsmiths a month he said I just wish Davis were as frugal with the taxpayers money as he is with his campaign money The Bees Emily Bazar can be reached at or State deal may ease blackout threat Canada to supply energy as summer demand rises By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO California may be able to avoid some of the blackouts predict ed for this summer thanks to a littleknown powerswapping agreement with a Canadian utility The arrangement is expected to give California electricity in July and Augu st from the hydroelectric generators of BC Hydro in British Columbia despite a serious drought in the Northwest California has sold surplus power in recent months to the governmentowned utility which is expected to return power to the state as heat drives up t he demand for electricity State deal may ease blackout threat Continuing coverage Californias Power Crisis Despite the energy crunch the state often finds itself with surplus power that can be sold or swapped For instance advance power purchases that provide energy at a better price may deliver more power than needed at any given time particularly during offpeak hours BC Hydros reservoirs and hydroelectric generators are a little like an electricity storage battery By importing California power BC Hydro has be en able to conserve water that can be released this summer to produce power fo r California As a result of the agreement and other factors state power buyers say they are in a stronger position going into the hot summer months than they had expected So far this week the state has managed to get through a heat wav e without so much as a Stage power alert We are in much better shape at this point than I imagined we would have be en as little as a month ago said Ray Hart head of the power purchasing unit in the state Department of Water Resources The North American Electric Reliability Council which last month predicted hours of rolling blackouts for California this summer has noticed a change in recent weeks We dont seem to have the crisis we were all expecting said Ellen Vancko a council spokeswoman But whether that is a shortterm or a longterm eve nt we dont think anyone knows yet Much of the credit for avoiding blackouts is given to unexpectedly high conservation by Californians and an increased supply of power Many generators that had been shut down for maintenance or lack of payment are n ow back on line But the hydroelectric power agreement had gone unnoticed until now Hart mentioned it during a Senate Energy Committee hearing this week But h e declined to reveal the amount of power banked with BC Hydro saying it coul d hurt the states competitive position in the market If I start talking specifics said Hart then I have to give out what I am doing every single day and I have no market position In the past California routinely sent power to a number of utilities in th e Pacific Northwest during the winter when residents there needed heat Northwest utilities returned power to California in the summer when air conditioning drove up demand Little was expected from the reciprocal arrangement this year because California was short of power last winter as electricity prices soared and drought has sharply lowered reservoirs in the Northwest But the agreement with BC Hydro will provide at least some power this summer The state was forced to begin buying power in January after its two largest utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric were unable to borrow because of a billion debt The rates that the utilitie s could charge their customers were frozen under a failed deregulation plan a s the cost of power on the wholesale market skyrocketed Hart said it took time to convince BC Hydro which has demanded cash for so me electricity that it could safely do business with California despite big debts owed to generators for power they supplied to the utilities We have only been able to do it for the last couple of months said Hart It took a long time to get them to do it because of credit issues A spokesman for BC Hydro said the utility engages in power swaps but does n ot release the name of the other parties or the terms of the agreements Our first priority is taking care of our own said Warren Cousins of BC Hydro We are still looking for opportunities to help out other entities when we can Hart said the state has another arrangement with the federal Bonneville Pow er Authority but again refused to provide details He said the state has sold surplus power to several buyers including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Information about state power purchases had been closely guarded until recently Gov Gray Davis pressured by lawsuits and a court ruling releas ed edited versions last week of longterm power contracts worth billion The Davis administration said it agreed to release contract information because power prices have dropped easing competitive pressures Exworker Duke manipulated market By Bill Ainsworth UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June SACRAMENTO A former operator at Duke Energys Chula Vista plant said he was told frequently by company officials during the past year to alter the plants output in a way that may have boosted electricity prices The operator Jimmy Olkjer said he was even ordered to cut power generatio n during energy emergencies when the state faced rolling blackouts because o f a scarce supply of electricity He said he believes reducing the electricity generation helped the company charge higher prices It looks like thats what they were doing Olkjer said in an interview He and another former plant employee said that during the past year the company regularly operated its leastefficient turbine possibly to justify higher prices The allegations which they plan to repeat today at a state Senate hearing investigating power generators provide the first insider evidence that Duk e Energy may have manipulated output at its South Bay plant to drive up price s Duke based in North Carolina leases the South Bay plant from the San Dieg o Unified Port District A March report by the Independent System Operator which manages California s electricity grid alleged that by withholding power Duke and four other owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollars in overcharges to California consumers Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy North America said that varying th e output of the generating units at the Chula Vista plant had nothing to do with trying to achieve higher prices He said the changes in output helped balance the states grid by dancing i n the market providing flexibility for grid managers by allowing the plan t to add or reduce power quickly Williams added that the aging South Bay plant produced as many megawatts la st year as it did in Olkjer served as a plant operator for years mostly when the plant was owned by San Diego Gas Electric Co After Duke took over the plant worke rs were guaranteed their jobs for two years In April when that period ended Duke laid off Olkjer and other workers Now he is retired During the two years Duke has managed the plant Olkjer said operators frequently got calls from officials with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in Salt Lake City telling them to adjust their production schedule Some employees at the plant monitored the hourly price of electricity poste d by the Independent System Operator and recognized a correlation he said We noticed that a lot of times when the price was down our megawatts wou ld go down he said If the price was up often the megawatts would go up Olkjer said he was never told why he was being ordered to turn the plants output up and down When he asked he said company officials told him it w as none of his business Still he was puzzled particularly when he was told to throttle down the plant during electricity emergency alerts as he says he did Jan when the state declared a Stage alert with the possibility of rolling blackouts It doesnt make sense to cycle up and down when theres a Stage alert he said Duke spokesman Williams said the company may turn down units at the orders of the ISO during a Stage alert because the grid manager can find cheaper power somewhere else Lisa Szot spokeswoman at the ISO said she couldnt determine whether the ISO had ordered Duke to power down its Chula Vista plant Jan Olkjer said the frequent adjustments of power production which sometimes occurred every halfhour wear out the plants equipment Its harder on the machinery he said Its like driving down the street putting your foot on the gas and then slamming on the brake Before deregulation Olkjer said the four units at Chula Vista which have the capacity to produce megawatts had been operated steadily during mu ch of their history S David Freeman formerly general manager of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and now chief energy adviser to Gov Gray Davis said rapid cycling had become more common under deregulation and is hard on equipment We had almost megawatts of generating capacity down for repair last winter said Freeman referring to what industry experts agreed was an extraordinary level of plant outages over several months SDGE which built the Chula Vista plant in the s sold it to the Port District for million In the port leased the plant to Duke Energy for years in what critics are now calling a sweetheart deal The company pays minimal rent but has made large profits In the first quarter of this year Duke which owns three other plants in California sa id profits rose percent to million from energy sales and trading Duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for electricity It asked per megawatthour this year By comparison before the energy crisis began electricity sold for around per megawatthour an amount which powers about homes Federal regulators have ordered the company to refund million to the state for charging excessive prices unless the company can justify them In May the company offered to pay the state to settle any price gouging investigations but Gov Gray Davis declined Olkjer and Ed Edwards Jr who worked at the plant for years before bein g laid off in April said they couldnt understand why Duke ran the inefficient highcost turbine unit during the past year while other generators sat idle They said they believed it may have been an attempt to fetch a higher price for electricity because the company got extra fees when it ran Williams the Duke spokesman said the opposite was true He said Duke ran the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive It ran on jet fuel which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the other units Edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destroyed It ran so frequently and so hard it needed extensive repairs he said Edwards told CBS News last night that plant outages at Chula Vista were prolonged because one supervisor ordered him to dump spare parts The former power plant employees said they felt compelled to come forward because they saw the impact the power crisis was having on their community It kind of irritated me because you know theres people on a fixed income that cant afford a big utility bill said Olkjer Staff writer Craig D Rose contributed to this story Estimates of Power Profits Disputed Electricity A study of overcharges by suppliers may be flawed state officials say Davis quoted the figures to Congress By DOUG SMITH ROBERT J LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL Times Staff Writers Gov Gray Davis contention that California has been nicked for billio ns of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study that state officials concede may have significant flaws according to interviews and confidential government documents Those costsestimated by the state to be as high as billionwere central to Davis testimony this week before a US Senate committee where he again denounced power wholesalers and urged federal regulators to give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us The governors impassioned demand however was based on shaky calculations The formulas are being reworked said Charles Robinson vice president of Californias grid operator which prepared the study Robinson said he had no idea how much the amount allegedly overcharg ed by the generators might change For now he said the agency stands by the numbers But internal documents from the California Independent System Operator warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quantify the alleged excess profits could be well off the mark Whats more the documents caution against relying on the agencys stu dy as a basis for allegations of overchargingas Davis did during his testimo ny Wednesday That warning was particularly important because the documents provide for the first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy supplier prospered from the states power troubles between last summer and February The largest amounts were charged by four outofstate power companies according to the confidential CalISO report Okalhomabased Williams Cos led the group with million followed by Duke Energy with million Southern Company Energy Marketing now Mirant with million and Relian t Energy Services with million When told of the alleged profiteering attributed to them executives o f the companies insisted the numbers were grossly overstated because of CalISOs poor methodology Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his companys entire energy earnings for North America were less than the amount it was accused of reaping unfairly in California It doesnt add up It doesnt come close to adding up Williams said What CalISO has done is highly irresponsible math Paula HallCollins a Williams Cos spokeswoman said the firm would need to study the ISO report further But generally she said such reports fail to fully account for electricity production costs We maintain that we have not overcharged and that we have operated legally Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley also questioned the figures saying Theres a lot of misinformation out of there A Mirant spokesman said We haven t overcharged We havent manipulated We havent withheld Even some firms alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree we re outraged Joe Ronan vice president for government and regulatory relations at Calpine said the million attributed to his company doesnt bear any relation to reality Anybody can throw out any number he said Its like McCarthyism Where is the evidence A spokeswoman for Davis conceded that his refund figure was an estimat e but defended it as reasonable Its no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute an estimate of how much theyre gouging us senior advisor Nancy McFadden sai d Despite the cautions expressed in the CalISO documents officials Thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to the agencys figures as potential overcharges The way it should be characterized is the amount paid above a competitive benchmark said Robinson who is also CalISOs general counse l The first version of the nowdisputed CalISO study was made public in March It estimated that power sellers earned billion in excess profit s between May and last February The report later revised upward to billion became a crucial element of the Davis Administrations campaign against alleged electricity price gougers This week just before Davis appearance in Congress the study was updated again adding another billions in alleged excess profits throu gh May The orginal study which did not include actual pricing data was most ly intended to prod federal regulators into seeking information from generator s that the state had been denied Robinson said Thus far the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered refunds of only million Next week FERC is convening an unusual settlement conference aimed at addressing the outstanding claims by the state as well as those of sellers who claim they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars by California utilities One encouraging signal for state officials came this week when FERC reiterated an earlier order that Duke Energy pay millions in refunds The order stemmed from the companys sale of electricity at a megawatt hourfor thousands of hours FERCs order said Dukes pricing had resulted in million in billings A fair price for that power would have been per megawatt hou r the agency said Tom Williams a Duke spokesman said the firm is willing to accept the lower price He said he company has yet to collect a dime Times staff writers Elizabeth Shogren and Dan Morain contributed to th is story Edison Plans Bond Offer at Rate Debt Yield is about double what a creditworthy company would pay analyst s say But will investors bite By JERRY HIRSCH Times Staff Writer Edison International is offering investors what analysts are calling a n unprecedented interest rate for billion in notes to refinance debt Even so its far from certain that the Rosemeadbased power company will find enough buyers to complete the deal A failure by Edison to refinance million in bank debt that comes due June and an additional million in notes due in July could put t he company precariously close to bankruptcy and cast a shadow on Californias plan to sell billion in bonds to pay for power purchases said Dan Scotto a bond analyst at PNB Paribas in New York Even though it would at first appear to be a company setback it woul d really be a major setback for the state said Scotto who added that Edisons credit troubles could translate into higher prices for California s proposed bond offering Edison however said Thursday that the deal is moving forward We believe our deal is going well and we are comfortable with it said Jo Ann Goddard vice president for investor relations She declined to discuss other details of the offering Goldman Sachs Group Edisons investment bank expects to formally pri ce the offering Monday Edison officials would not comment on the proposed pri ce of the note offering but Wall Street sources said the power company was shopping the issue at the rate Edison floated the plan earlier this month as a way to tap the borrowi ng power of a profitable subsidiary to trim debt that comes due this year and to insulate itself from a possible bankruptcy of its ailing utility unit The utility Southern California Edison has lost billions of dollars on electricity sales over the last year The high interest rate on Edisons proposed sale of sevenyear notes i s about double what a creditworthy company would pay for a similar bond or note issue and would add a premium amounting to tens of millions of dollars in annual interest costs to the companys already strapped financial condition analysts said Its a full two percentage points higher than the average rate for other junk or speculative bonds And corporate bonds wit h similar ratings are going out at to Edison originally started marketing the issue at a full two percentage points higher than what analysts initially expected but then raised the rate to in recent days because it was finding few takers on Wall Street The word is that they couldnt get people interested and that they might not be able to get it done said Kurt Stabel a money manager at Street Asset Management in Newport Beach The higher rate however might be pulling investors out of the woodwo rk and has increased the chance that Edison will pull off the deal Scotto sai d This never promised to be a day at the beach Scotto said I think it is really a question of find the right price the price at which people fee l comfortable with the risk Both Stabel and Scotto said that Edisons note offering is unusually complicated and requires far more explaining or selling than typical corporate offerings Mission Energy Holding Co a company created by Edison for the sole purpose of issuing these bonds will offer the notes The assets of Edison Mission Energy a subsidiary that owns a network of power plants across the United States and in Asia Australia and New Zealand will secure the debt Mission Energy Holding plans to issue the proceeds to Edison in the fo rm of dividends giving the parent company funds to pay off a substantial portion of its debt The notes will have a credit rating of BBminus and come due in according to bond rating agency Standard Poors Thats slightly higher than the neardefault CC rating now carried by Edison If

Plans for Baldwin Hills Plant Power Homeowners and environmentalists rejoice at decision The site is proposed as a acre state park By JOE MOZINGO Times Staff Writer In a victory for environmentalists and nearby homeowners an energy company announced Thursday that it was abandoning its plan to build a power plant on the site of a proposed state park in the Baldwin Hills La Jolla Energy Development Inc in a letter to the state Energy Commission said it was withdrawing its application for fasttrack approval of the megawatt plant and will not pursue the Baldwin facility in the future We listened to the community La Jolla President Steve Wilburn said in an interview Thursday We need to find another place for this equipment The project was to be a joint venture between La Jolla and Stocker Resources an oil company that leases the land where the trailersized naturalgas plant would sit Stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether they will pursue the project At this point its just La Jolla pulling out Stocker spokesman Steve Rusch said But most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the fasttrack schedule the state has implemented to relieve the energy crisis The state commission was scheduled to decide whether to approve the project today in Sacramento but the hearing has been canceled The news sparked elation among environmentalists and nearby homeowners who had fought the proposal on grounds that it would pollute neighborhoods and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together acres of public open space in the hills Were getting ready to have the biggest party said Tony Nicholas president of the hills United Homeowners Assn This shows how a community can come together for a common goal and mobilize the people in a matter of days About of the residents in the hills are African American and many saw the issue as a matter of environmental justice In addition Stocker and La Jolla were seeking approval for the plant within days of filing their application under the governors emergency power orders By following this fasttracked procedure they would have bee n able to avoid the normal timeconsuming environmental review process That angered opponents even further and nearly people showed up at a public hearing Monday to fight the project But what officials said turned the tide against the projectat a time when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possiblewa s testimony from a South Coast Air Quality Management official who said his agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly Executive Director Barry Wallerstein said his agency would have to conduct hearings that would take up to days pushing construction well beyond a Sept deadline set by the governor for fasttrack projects He also said it was unlikely Stocker could get needed exemptions from federal clean air laws In a letter to the Energy Commission this week Wallerstein wrote It appears that the Baldwin Energy Facility could not begin operation until so me time in the first part of at the earliest By Wednesday night the energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statemen t recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a plant citing Wallersteins concerns Conservationists embraced the outcome as a sign that the movement to create a park was gaining steam The Baldwin Hills Conservancy was created last year with the idea of creating green space for the densely populated neighborhoods of south Los Angeles With support from the governor and loca l politicians the state recently bought a acre parcel in the area for an unprecedented million This is a great day for the Baldwin Hills and all the people who have worked so hard to bring this worldclass vision to reality said Esther Feldman president of Community Conservancy International and the main organizer to build the park Also applauding La Jollas decision were state Sen Kevin Murray DCulver City and Assemblyman Herb Wesson DCulver City who had come o ut strongly against the project They and others questioned whether the small amount of power provided by the facilitycoming online after the dog days of summerwould do much to relieve the energy crisis Im ecstatic Wesson said At this point the environment has won The plant would have sat on what is a working oil field about feet from the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area And according to park proponents it would lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy on what would be a halfmile bridge of land arching over La Cienega Boulevard Rusch the spokesman for Stocker said much of the information circulating about the trailersized plant is false The plan did not call for a stack with billowing smoke he said If the issue is air quality weve cleaned air quality up In the last decade Rusch said the companys existing oil pumps on the property have reduc ed nitrogen oxide emissions from tons to tons a year The power plantwith two foot stackswould ultimately add about tons a year He said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing it s own power to pump oil while also contributing an extra megawatts to the state grid during the energy crisis Residents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve the energy problem Said Mary Ann Green president of the Blair Hills Homeowners Assn We just hope that Stocker would be responsive to the outcry from the community Western states could feel pinch from California pricing KAREN GAUDETTE Associated Press Writer Friday June Associated Press URL cgibinarticlecgifileDnewsarchiven ation alEDTDTLtypeDnews PDT SAN FRANCISCO AP When power supplies stretch thin across the West this summer who will deci de whether Silicon Valley computers Washington apple orchards or Las Vegas casinos get first dibs on whats left Its a key question raised by the decision of federal energy regulators thi s week to cap electricity prices throughout the West using a formula based o n Californias power costs Economists energy industry executives and officials in all states are beginning to analyze the fit of this new piece in the energy puzzle Though most call the order a good step that could prevent price gouging others worry the pricing system could lead to electricity shortages for Californias neighbors or prompt utilities to stock up on power contracts to fend off shortages That could diminish any leverage power buyers might hav e as they compete for the remaining megawatts available each day Tying the highest possible power price to California could cause a problem come winter when power demand drops in the Golden State said Gary Ackerma n director of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents most sellers of energy States where consumers need electricity to heat furnaces through the winter would be unable to outbid each other above the price cap which is usually determined by a formula based on the highest bid for lastminute power duri ng the most recent energy supply emergency in California That may leave power wholesalers and not a free market to decide who gets the energy Certainly California has a tremendous pull on our prices and has for probably the last year said Claudia Rapkoch spokeswoman for Montana Powe r Co which supplies natural gas and electricity to twothirds of the Big Sk y state What it means for this winter were just going to have to wait and see California utilities had much more control over power supplies before deregulation in obligated them to sell off their power plants to encourage competition This brought lower prices for a time but gave contr ol over power supplies to wholesalers that arent obligated by state law to serve the serve the best interests of local customers Rather than appointing one power grid manager to decide how to divide power in the West Ackerman predicts utilities in nonderegulated states will simply sell their power within their borders That would hurt California which this week imported about percent of its electricity and its remaining supply from local plants owned by outofstate power companies Price cap or not utilities in the region will watch out for each other as best they can because they might need the favor returned said Charles Reinhold executive consultant for Electric Resources Strategies in Ariz Saddled with rising bills that threatened to exhaust the states budget California recently began to sign longterm contracts with generators Gov Gray Davis credits the change for helping to drastically reduce

Energy Inc to avoid refunding millions of dollars to California for charging exorbitant electricity prices in January and February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission first ordered the refunds on March and Duke responded by filing a challenge But the commission on Monday rejected the companys appeal and reiterated its earlier order claiming Du ke had abused its power in the California energy market when it sold power for per megawatt hour We will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding or behavior the commission said Duke acknowledged this month that it had charged per megawatt for about megawatt hours sold to the states major utilities in January a nd February netting it more than million in receivables The commission did not specify how much money Duke should refund but it directed the company to readjust its January billings for those hours to a price of From a FERC document it appears that about hours occurred in January which would result in a total refund for that month of million Duke is one of the companies that have been identified by both the Californ ia Independent System Operator the manager of the states electricity grid a nd the FERC as having exercised market power and overcharged Californians for electricity Meanwhile employees at the South Bay power plant in San Diego run by Duke are expected to testify in a state Senate committee

There was a reason Gov Gray Davis donned a dark blue jacket and endured beastly humid degree heat this week in an area behind the Capitol known as the House swamp The nation was watching And after months of political free fall his messa ge seemed to be taking hold California has been bilked out of billion while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was asleep at the switch Davis declared repeating testimony he had delivered hours earlier in the airconditioned confines of a Senate hearing room Wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as television cameras and two dozen reporters recorded the scene the California governor apparently couldnt resist taking another shot For nearly a year Ive been pounding on this commission to enforce the law The states energy crisis with its volatile spot markets outofstate generators and dearth of alternative energy providers is a dizzyingly complex policy puzzle The politics are much simpler Democrats present themselves as consumer crusaders defending helpless utility customers from greedy energy conglomerates and misguided regulators Republicans portray themselves as stewards of the free market and longterm solutions rejecting price caps and refunds as heavyhanded overreactions with Sovietstyle results The Democratic populism seems to be winning the battle Though the debate i s far from settled the consumeroriented approach to Californias energy woe s has raised their hopes of winning back the House of Representatives in and the White House in Republicans are scared out of their minds about this said one gleeful Democrat on Capitol Hill who suggested that the White Houses lackadaisica l response to Californias problems would rile consumers from coast to coast This could rival Pete Wilsons alienation of Latinos said the Democrat referring to the former Republican governors strident stand against illega l immigrants which many blame for the partys weak standing in California A sign of the GOPs concern surfaced this week with television ads finance d by anonymous sources but produced by Republican Party strategists that bla me the Democratic governor for Californias energy problems Democrats who long have worried that the crisis could cost Davis a second term now take credit for having pressured the White House and federal regulators to take a more active role The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which had previously resisted suc h efforts took steps toward controlling wholesale electricity prices Monday Later in the week two commissioners appointed by President Bush testified that they might be open to further price restrictions and support huge refunds to California And just yesterday Vice President Dick Cheney who has been among Californias most vocal critics told Senate Democrats behin d closed doors that he could support refunds to California if federal regulators agreed according to those in the meeting There is no doubt in my mind that action taken by federal regulators was the direct result of pressure for price relief led primarily by the California delegation Davis said The pressure did not come only from Democrats Republican lawmakers some o f whom fear the crisis could cost them seats in wrote FERC last week requesting commissioners to take further actions to help the state The Democrats public relations success follows an effort by the party to raise the profile of its consumer crusade Hardly a day has passed in the past several weeks without a group of Democrats holding a news conference t o attack the White House the Republican controlled House or FERC for inactio n But it may have just as much to do with a White House that has been far mor e focused on longterm energy production than the immediate concerns of Californians Even as it engaged in a legitimate policy dispute over how to solve the power mess the Bush administration appeared indifferent to the plight of residents experiencing skyrocketing energy bills and rolling blackouts Bush tried to correct that impression with a trip to the state last month But the damage appears to have extended beyond California A CBS NewsNew York Times poll released this week of adults from acro ss the country showed that only one in three voters approved of the job Bush w as doing on energy More than half the respondents said that protecting the environment was a higher priority than producing energy yet barely one in said that Bush shared that priority Some Republicans say that Bush was in a nowin position contending that anything he did would have been attacked by Californias opportunistic governor Politics is Davis main objective and I dont see the Bush administrati on being that way said Rep George Radanovich RFresno The question for some analysts is whether Democrats might have been too successful By pressuring the federal government to take a more active role Democrats may lose their ability to point the finger at a convenient scapegoat Davis has always needed rate caps much less than he needed a scapegoat No w that FERC has given him what he wants or close enough to it its a lot harder for him to lay blame back on Washington when the blackouts kick in said

The document could be vital to how legislators vote on the billion de al to buy Southern California Edisons power lines said Terry Francke genera l counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition which filed the lawsu it in Alameda County Superior Court The power line deal was brokered by the governor to help the cashstrapped utility Legislators must approve the power grid purchase by Aug or the utility can back out Davis also has a billion agreement to purchase San Diego G as and Electrics power grid which also would require the Legislatures approval Pacific Gas and Electric has not agreed to sell its transmission lines The power lines report was completed in April by California Electric and Magnetic Fields Program an agency set up by the state Department of Health Services to study the issue Francke said Both state agencies and their directors are named in the lawsuit Efforts to keep the report secret are suspect Francke said If its known theres some danger do you want the state owning that liability he asked The study began in after the state Public Utilities Commission committ ed million for research and education on the subject Francke said The state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and electric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies based on those findings he said The report was scheduled to be released to the public on May but at the last minute the Public Utilities Commission apparently instructed the staf f of the EMF Program to keep the reports secret the lawsuit said State health services spokeswoman Lea Brooks said that the report was only a draft and that her department was following orders from the PUC The PUC wanted to see the draft before it is released she said We prepared the report for them We are following their request Brooks refused comment on the lawsuit saying her office hadnt seen it PU C officials were not available for comment Studies on the effects of magnetic fields have resulted in no clear consens us on their effects Francke said Thats what makes the state study important for legislators to consider before voting on the governors deal to buy transmission lines he

of popularity on Wall Street While all eyes have been on Enrons enormous profits here and its enormous pull in Washington DC the reputed titan of the newly incarnated free wheeling power industry has lost half its market capitalization more tha n billion since its peak in August Forgive Californians for savoring a bit of schadenfreude over the Houston boys reversal of fortunes But what gives Isnt this the company that was fattening up on the backs of the states beleaguered utilities residents a nd state budget Isnt this the company with such close ties to the Bush administration that Kenneth Lay Enrons chairman was reported to have interviewed a candidate for a job on the commission that regulates his company Yup That Enron On Monday Enron shares hit a week low of after the Federal Ener gy Regulatory Commission decided to apply the same price controls to power marketers such as Enron that had applied to powergenerating companies for months Thats a far cry from August when the companys shares peaked at Theres a whole kaleidoscope of issues that Enron is being challenged with in the marketplace right now none of which on the surface is a major deal said Donato J Eassey an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities in Houston But when you combine them all I think whats happening here is you have a crescendo with this FERC announcement You have people saying OK the growth rate is now in question That growth rate was an eyepopping percent in revenues for the Unite d States on a twoyear average and nearly percent in the rest of the worl d Enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews but as the sto ck continued to drop Tuesday morning chief executive Jeff Skilling issued a statement to the markets in which he reiterated strong confidence in its earnings guidance The stock rebounded slightly throughout the week closin g at yesterday In a speech at the Commonwealth Club last night Skilling blamed regulatory interference with the free market for investor flight from his company Our stock prices have gotten hammered he said Theyre half what they were a year ago Tumbling stock prices werent the only bad news for Skilling last night A protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began speaking As Skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face a woman was arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges Enron isnt the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with Californias power crisis and are now suddenly headed south Shares of Reliant Energy Inc AES Inc and Williams Companies Inc which generate a nd sell electricity in California and El Paso Energy Corp which sells natur al gas here are all trading near week lows The main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in Washington abou t power price controls reregulation and now the possibility of big refunds being ordered for California Even Calpine Corp of San Jose which has developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played th e spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics dropped nearl y percent yesterday to But none of the companies has been hit as hard as Enron Such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any company It leaves it less money to invest in its own growth and because executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price a sharp decline makes it more difficult to retain talented leaders While Enrons power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine the firm h as been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other regio ns in recent months In the financial press the continuing knock on Enron is that its business lines are so new and complex and the company is so secretive about its operations that analysts and fund managers dont feel confident in their understanding of what it does A look at the firms recent troubles exemplifies its diversity For instance Enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state governme nt of Maharashtra in India over a megawatt power plant there The Dahbol Power Co which is percent controlled by Enron stopped construction on a second phase of the project on Sunday claiming it is owed million by t he Maharashtra State Electricity Board The state has accused Enron of chargin g too much and not generating enough and stopped buying power from the plant last month Closer to home Enron has struggled with its investments in fiberoptic bandwidth The company buys and sells unused highspeed bandwidth space treating it like a commodity as it does electricity coal or natural gas B ut the fiberoptic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear that for all the longdistance cable laid in the ground there have not bee n enough last mile connections set up for users to actually take advantage of it Earlier this year Enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with Blockbuster to offer what it called video on demand in which customers a t home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it transmitted via fiberoptic cables Then there was the FERC ruling For months the agency had resisted aggressive price controls in the West preferring to let the market run its course But as control of the US Senate was handed to Democrats this mont h and President Bush appointed a tough Texan regulator named Patrick Wood III to the commission the agency changed its tune It expanded price controls to all hours of the day spread the controls throughout the Western region and brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent So under current calculations that means Enron could sell power for no mor e than per megawatt in a shortage and about during normal hours f ar short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly charging during the past year In part the companys gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of the businesses Enron has decided to pursue And the hardcharging company h as a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets But sometime s that approach gets it in trouble as was the case last year when Enron had to take a million charge for its failed investment in Azurix a global water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply the same way it had done for electricity service as governments privatized their water systems The opportunities never materialized Add it all together and Enron has a tough time supporting a priceearnings ratio of nearly considerably above the liberal standard of health whic h is The company had less than billion in profits on more than billion in revenues last year Still a survey by Thomson FinancialFirst Call found that analysts expect Enron to deliver earnings of cents per share in the second quarter up from cents last year and per sha re on the year Most maintain a strong buy rating on the stock But investors with big positions in Enron have taken a hit Hardestput of them will be the Janus funds which as Enrons largest mutual fund investo r held nearly billion of its stock as of the end of April In a semiannual report to investors John Schreiber a portfolio manager said the stock price of the newage energy merchant was a victim of negative psychology resulting from the California energy crisis Janus declined to make fund managers available for interviews

going to make mistakes But I dont think any of the mistakes Enron has made hit the core of the company Email Christian Berthelsen at San Francisco Chronicle PageB Power firm accused of pricefixing Former employees say Duke Energy slowed production of electricity to create an artificial shortage boost profits BY DION NISSENBAUM Mercury News Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO One of the largest companies producing power in California ordered workers to throw out spare parts and shut down equipment in an effo rt to drive up the price of electricity former power plant workers said Thursday Speaking out on the eve of appearances at a state Senate hearing the three men offered the strongest evidence yet that at least one power producer Duke Energy sought to make more money by creating an artificial shortage that may have created huge electricity price spikes Their intent in my opinion was to boost the price up said Glenn Johnson a mechanic who worked for two decades at the Chula Vista power pla nt now run by Duke If Ive got the only box of penicillin in town and your e sick I can charge a million dollars a box he said If you want to liv e youre going to have to pay Officials at Duke angrily challenged the accusations calling them irresponsible charges by disgruntled workers who were let go in April Their allegations are just comical just highly erroneous said Tom Williams a spokesman for Duke which runs four plants in California that produce enough energy for nearly million homes The charges come as the state heads into negotiations next week with generators over the billion the state claims its consumers have been overcharged Duke based in Charlotte NC came under considerable criticism when it disclosed that it charged the state a record a megawatthour for power in January Federal officials have called the charg e unreasonable and ordered Duke to refund California the money The employees who first made their allegations public on CBS Evening News Thursday night will be the only witnesses today at an energy crisis hearing headed by lawmakers who suspect that power companies have been illegally gouging California State Sen Joe Dunn DGarden Grove chairman of a committee investigating price gouging said the allegations raise serious concerns While we stil l need to hear the other side of the story from Duke if theres any truth to the information I believe it would be devastating to the generators he said Perfectly good parts In interviews with the Mercury News Thursday night the three former plant workers said that they were directed to scale back energy production and throw out good spare parts that kept the plant from getting up to full powe r for weeks Ed Edwards who worked in the Southern California plant said that he was told to get rid of many boxes of good spare parts Edwards said he tossed more than pallets of parts into a dumpster I dont know why they were throwing away perfectly good parts he said It didnt make sense Johnson said the lack of onsite parts prevented workers from quickly fixin g problems that reduced the amount of power the plant could produce Sometime s he said it took weeks to get parts Johnsons suspicions of gouging were echoed by Jimmey Olkjer who spent years in the plant and worked as an assistant control operator Even at times when California regulators were warning residents the state might not be able to find enough energy to prevent imminent blackouts Olkj er said he was directed to scale back the amount of electricity the plant was producing In hindsight it looks to me like they were manipulating the power Olkjer said Duke called the allegations baseless and said the workers didnt understand the reasons for the actions Continued accusations repetitive investigations and inflammatory rhetoric concerning the companys operation s in the state are distracting attention from the true issue of solving Californias energy crisis Duke said in a statement Williams did not directly dispute the workers allegations But he said the y did not understand the reasons behind the decisions State directives Duke cut back on the amount of power it was producing in response to directives from state regulators at the Independent System Operator which runs the power grid Williams said They did not know that the ISO was instructing them to go up and down to meet supply and demand he said An ISO spokeswoman said that the grid manager sometimes asks generators to produce more or less power to adjust traffic on the transmission system or respond to the states electricity needs Some companies bid power into the reserve market which means these plants run only when the extra energy is tapped ISO officials say they are prohibited from discussing individual bids As for the spare parts Williams said they were eliminated as unnecessary after Duke bought the plants from San Diego Gas Electric Williams said Duke has one of the best performance records in the state wi th its power plants offline for unscheduled maintenance only about percen t of the time All three workers were given severance packages and let go in April But Edwards disputed any contention that they were trying to get back at Duke Im not a disgruntled employee he said Im just telling the truth o f what I saw the last two years I worked there No matter what the reasons were for the decisions Duke has made huge profi ts during the California energy crisis And those profits apparently created good cheer among Duke executives At one party Johnson said executives gleefully celebrated their good

electricity wholesalers a Texas energy executive told a crowd at the Commonwealth Club of California Jeffrey Skilling CEO and president of Houstonbased Enron Corp wiped awa y the remnants of a pie hurled by a protester Thursday and placed the blame squarely on Californias energy regulators The state Public Utilities Commission in the early s put together a broken market by preventing utilities to pass along the full cost of power and discouraging power contracts that would have lowered dependence on buyi ng lastminute power Skilling said Because of these rules the power consumers of the state of California we re thrown totally to the mercy of the spot market Skilling said PUC president Loretta Lynch defended the regulators actions last week saying utilities have been free to enter into longterm contracts Utilitie s countered that the PUC never made clear what contracts it would accept whi ch left open the possibility they would later be overruled I think consumers in California are angry and they should be Skilling said Prices in California shouldnt be as high as they are Skilling also Congratulated Davis for Californias unprecedented conservation Denied accusations that Enron chairman Kenneth Lay personally interviewed candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees interstate energy markets Told the audience to expect a report that would show California municipal utilities have profited the most selling power to the state Said price caps ordered by FERC earlier this week would likely damage the markets and would only exacerbate the problem Acknowledged that municipal utilities in the state have managed to provid e cheaper power to their customers and even profit from the power crisis by selling off extra power despite public control Enron has come under fire after accusations from Davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply Enron denies such claims and joins other power producers in arguing that t he state and utilities still owe them billions in unpaid bills Davis acknowledges that Pacific Gas Electric Co which has declared bankruptcy and Southern California Edison together still owe generators such as Enron Duke Energy Mirant and Reliant Energy about billion for past electricity sales Our success is linked to efficient markets not higher prices in Californ ia or anywhere else Skilling said Protesters gathered outside the building wearing pig masks and carrying handmade signs one of which read Greed is the only power crisis Its basically Enron and the other companies raising prices said Berna rd Greening a Santa Clara computer programmer who said hes unhappy with the record prices for electricity and natural gas Pete Snoek of Tiburon said he believed what Skilling had to say I believe the energy situation has been politicized so badly Snoek sai d saying he was one of several in the audience to shush protesters during the meeting I hear the same people out there as if its a sin to make any money in this country State officials counter that wholesalers charged as much as billion in illegal overcharges dating back to May Companies have said Californias claims are wildly exaggerated The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already estimated that wholesalers owe California million in overcharges for the first four months of the year Davis and others say thats a mere drop in the bucket Enron has also been tied to President Bushs handsoff approach to the ener gy crisis Company chairman Kenneth Lay is a friend and one of the largest campaign contributors to Bush and the GOP Several prominent members of the Bush administration hold stock in the company Enron is one of several major GOP donors accused of meeting secretly with Vice President Dick Cheney as he drafted the Bush administrations energy plan Enron is one of the worlds leading electricity natural gas and communications companies with

center and Jimmy Olkjer are to appear before a state Senate committee today Photo Dave Yoder The Register Three former Duke Energy workers say they were ordered to tamper with equipment at a San Diego County power plant causing mechanical problems that helped drive up electricity prices during the states energy crisis The workers say they will offer eyewitness testimony to a state Senate committee today the first public accounts from power plant employees of h ow energy production may have been manipulated Duke officials deny most of the allegations The whistleblowers mechanic s Ed Edwards and Glenn Johnson and control room operator Jimmy Olkjer lost their jobs four months ago State Sen Joe Dunn the Santa Ana Democrat who is chairing the investigati ve committee on pricefixing said his staff will attempt to verify the accoun ts from the whistleblowers But their mere presence in a Capitol hearing room is expected to set off a media circus And if the accusations are true it could have wideranging effects on the North Carolina companys operations in California Duke officials were working late into the night to prepare for the hearing and have scheduled a news conference later today They were doing all kinds of things that didnt make sense Johnson said in an interview But if you asked them why to explain they told you to shut up and do your job The testimony comes on the heels of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruling Thursday ordering Duke to refund million in overcharges for January This information lends credence to the concern that there was a deliberate strategy for outages for the sole purpose of impacting price Dunn said What they are saying is disturbing Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said the fact that the former workers lo st their jobs may be shaping their testimony The proof is in the pudding Production is up and weve had fewer forced outages since weve taken over said Williams But controlroom logs obtained by The Orange County Register show Dukes trading arm ordered its South Bay power plant in Chula Vista to reduce production minutes after Stage Three alerts were issued The logs are for January the same month that Duke was accused of overcharging in California The three former Duke workers each worked at the Chula Vista plant for more than two decades when it was owned by San Diego Gas Electric They lost their jobs when Duke assembled a new team to run the plant The three whistleblowers outlined their accusations in interviews with the Register The accusations include The company ordered workers to throw unopened boxes of bolts steam seals valves and other parts into Dumpsters The parts were needed to perform routine maintenance but were no longer available when repairs were required Duke officials acknowledge that new parts were discarded but say the high inventory tax made it more efficient to order parts as needed because they could be delivered within hours Edwards and Johnson say they were ordered to dismantle critical equipment necessary for the generating units to run at full capacity Because parts were thrown away they couldnt make repairs and generators ran at diminish ed capacity for days or weeks Energy experts say this allegation if true would allow Duke to withhold energy from the marketplace which could drive up the price Duke officials counter that production has increased at its power plants and forced outages have decreased since they took over But in late there was a spike in outages at the Chula Vista plant according to records kept by the states powergrid operator The plant reported hours of outages from October through December There were relatively few outages before that The mechanics say the inability to perform repairs forced them to use a small expensive generator that was rarely powered up before Duke took over the plant Experts say that could have been used to exploit federal rules allowing generators to justify prices based on the costliest units online Olkjer says he received orders from Dukes trading arm to reduce production Then when energy prices jumped he would get new instructions to power up again Duke officials did not respond to Olkjers claim Stanford professor Frank Wolak an expert in Californias energy market sa id that if their testimony can be proven the state could be refunded millions of dollars and future energy prices could be dramatically reduced What they are saying is amazing This is a classic plot Ive always wondered how they kept the generators out for so long said Wolak who heads an electricity market surveillance for the California agency that oversees the buying and selling of power They were very happy to have the m offline because it allowed them to make more money Wolak said the testimony seems to back up research conducted by the state Independent System Operator which runs most of the states power grid and oversees the buying and selling of electricity in California In a report to federal regulators ISO said that from May to November Duke withheld electricity from the states power grid percent of the tim e The report accused more than a dozen power plant companies of powering down generators to create scarcity in the marketplace that would in turn drive u p prices In a separate report the state power grid operator accused Duke of overcharging California again in January of this year resulting in the million refund order Duke officials say charging a megawatthour wa s justified during a short period of time Federal regulators disagreed and said the power merchant should have charged no more than per megawatthour Williams Dukes spokesman said that the company has been an ethical operator All but percent of the time we were operating Thats very good sa id Williams adding that when SDGE owned the plant forced outages took place percent of the time But Dunn said that if the testimony from the whistleblowers is true and Duke had the ability to manipulate prices federal regulators would be required under the Federal Power Act to move them out of the competitive marketplace This would mean they would be moved back into a costbased market structu re and would only be allowed to recover costs at a fair rate of return This would bring the prices down dramatically in California Dunn said What generators fear most is being returned to costbased rate regulation Allegations of market manipulation Nearly a dozen investigations are under way to determine if energy producers illegally manipulated Californias dysfunctional electricity market Here a re the main allegations Was power deliberately withheld to boost prices Several investigators including the Public Utilities Commission the California attorney general and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

would keep its plants offline Williams has denied any wrongdoing Did companies collude Traders and producers were able to share information on Web sites that helped them determine when to get the

the players from the state to utilities to power generators will be in one room trying to settle who owes whom money and how much The state wants billion in refunds from generators they say charged too much for electricity The generators want billions from the utilities and t he state that they say didnt pay the bill for other power they bought And Californias ratepayers just want to keep the lights on I dont think theres billion Wagner said Thursday from his office at FERC headquarters I think there may be a billion or so He spent much of the day fielding calls from some of the several hundred people who could show up in his hearing room Monday Lets see Ive talked to Reliant to Dynergy once Mirant Im going to talk to Dynergy again this afternoon And Ive talked to the governors

the gavel and renders a decision after both sides make their cases settlement conferences give him a chance to wheel a nd deal First thing Ill make an opening statement of some kind give em a pep talk Wagner said And if we have any big wheels there Ill let them say a thing or two After the introductions hell start to work through the issues Hell take one guy aside he said then maybe two Then maybe a group And little by little he hopes to bring them together By all accounts this case could be more difficult than any he has handled This has got more dollars Wagner said Thursday Wagner asked Californias Independent System Operator and the pow er sellers for information that can help him sort out the complicated issues He wants the ISO to calculate what wholesale electricity prices wold have been had the price caps FERC ordered Monday been in effect in the fall of And he wants the power companies to tell him how much power they have to se ll short and long term And as if his task

refund The governor tells a Senate panel that power operators bilked our state June By DENA BUNIS and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register WASHINGTON Gov Gray Davis told anyone here who would listen Wednesday th at overcharges from what he calls greedy power generators have now risen to billion billion more than earlier reported And he wants that money back The governor said if the meetings federal regulators have ordered next week to try and hammer out the differences between power companies utilities an d the state do not end with that kind of money in Californias pocket hell be back They must be required to give us back our money Davis told the Senate Government Affairs Committee during two hours of testimony and questioning It was the first time Californias chief executive has testified on the states crisis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The billion is the amount Californias Independent System Operator says generators overcharged utilities and the state from May to May of this year It had initially calculated that between May and February there were billion in overcharges Davis said Those figures are a far cry from the million that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say s were overcharges Thats because FERC only looked at three months of rates and only when the state was in an energy alert The governor faced tough pointed questioning from Republican members and glowing praise and sympathy for his states plight from Democratic colleagues Everything from refunds to longterm contracts will be on the table at next weeks settlement meeting FERC has given the parties until July to make a deal If they cant the administrative judge overseeing the talks will make a recommendation to FERC which can order the paybacks Sen Barbara Boxer introduced a bill Wednesday to require refunds if FERC doesnt act Not surprisingly generators dont see the refund issue the governors way Its just crazy said Tom Williams a spokesman at Duke Energy I dont know how theyre coming up with these numbers And theres skepticism about next weeks talks The negotiations are going to be like the SALT Treaty said Gary Ackerman president of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents power suppliers I question whether it can happen and work out Also at issue is money generators say they are owed by the utilities Davis said thats about billion But power companies say its more like billion to billion Whatever the figure Davis said we want to see their money in our pockets before we talk about working anything out on their end The settlement conference was part of FERCs order instituting aroundtheclock price caps for California and its Western neighbors Those price caps were made possible experts agree because California lawmakers from both sides of the aisle riled up the public enough over the issue that the Bush administration felt the heat The question is whether that can work with refunds Pressure could come from a number of places said Charles Cook a nonpartisan political analyst who has followed Californias crisis It cou ld come from Republican members from the state from party donors in Californi a who President George W Bush is going to have to go back to and then may be from his economic advisers who say that California cant be allowed to go belly up Davis and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said new FERC Commissioner Patri ck Wood a confidant of Bush has been receptive to their refund pleas That w as the case Wednesday when Wood expected to be named FERC chairman sometime this year told members of the Senate panel that refunds may be an important tool in the regulatory toolbox If were to be a vigilant market cop we need to make sure that our bite

Davis seeks legislative approval for his plan to buy the transmission lines of both San Diego Gas Electric and Southern California Edison Any involvement by GE in the states transmission grid could be a conflict of interest said a lawmaker involved in the efforts to end Californias power crisis Youve got someone with generation and transmission systems how do they keep them separate and do they said Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek Thats a concern for me Would they have the ability to restrict competitors access to transmissions Bob Mitchell TransElects vice president said the company

averted Wednesday as power reserves remained above percent Track the states blackout warnings on the Web at wwwcaisocomSystemStatushtml In rolling blackouts together is all relative June I have a confession to make Im an N And as an N I cant help feeli ng a little guilty I feel guilty that I wont be called upon to share the pain of all those As in Irvine and Laguna Woods or the Ms in Costa Mesa and Cypress While the Ms in Fountain Valley suffer and sweat through rolling blackouts Ill be sitting pretty Because Im an N And the dirty little secret about rolling power blackouts is how many of us are out there Allow me to explain As you may have heard Southern California Edison has been required to set up a public notification system for rolling blackouts If you hear on the news that the power guys are expecting rolling blackouts you can go to a Web si te wwwscecom or call a tollfree phone number to see if you r rotating outage group is on the list for going temporarily dark How do you know which group youre in On your Edison power bill next to your account number theres a code that starts with A or M A A M M and so on Thats your outage group number But wait Theres another category of outage group If your power bill has the code number N on it it means that youre exempt from rolling blackouts You see under Public Utilities Commission rules electric power customers who provide essential public health safety and security services such as fire and police stations hospitals jails and so on are automatically exempt from rolling blackouts even if they have emergency generators on site And because of the way electric power service is set up anybody who s on the same circuit with an essential service provider is also exempt from rolling blackouts For example my house shares a circuit with a fire station So Im an exemp t N as are the other power customers on the same circuit But heres the kicker According to an Edison spokesman percent of all Edison customers are Ns that is they share circuits with essential service providers and thus are currently exempt from rolling blackouts Let me repeat that Half of all Edison customers are exempt from rolling blackouts For San Diego Gas Electric customers its percent Mind you this isnt something Edison likes to publicize When I asked abou t it for a column three months ago Edison said it didnt know how many power customers are automatically exempt And when the company unveiled its blackout warning plan this week neither the Edison press release nor news reports mentioned the percent exemption figure True even exempt power customers can be affected by rolling blackouts at work at the store at a traffic light Still the next time you hear some power company or government official say Were all in this together dont believe it When it comes to rolling blackouts the truth is that only half of us are really all in this togethe r And even an N can see that isnt fair

demanded Wednesday that power generators refu nd California nearly billion in electricity charges It is unconscionable for the generators to profit from their egregious overcharges Davis told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee Davis testimony highlighted a change in political tactics in the states power crisis after a Monday order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissi on expanding wholesale price relief for California and other Western states And the governor got some support from two FERC members who said Wednesday that they are prepared to order Californias energy suppliers to make heavy refunds because of overcharging But the two commissioners Pat Wood III and William Massey agreed with their FERC colleagues that California officials and energy companies should be given a chance to settle the multibilliondollar refund dispute in the next three weeks before the commission acts the Washington Post reported During his testimony Davis gave tepid praise to FERC which he said final ly took a positive step in imposing the limits But he continued to press the independent agency to recover what he said were overcharges The FERC has been on a sitdown strike because we havent received a dime Davis said The commissions action on price controls has been wellreceived diminishi ng appeals among West Coast Democratic governors and lawmakers and a handful o f Republicans for congressionally mandated caps But the commissions order didnt quiet demands that generators be required to pay back overcharges and Davis led the charge Wednesday to exploit that issue Davis said the California Independent System Operator the Folsombased agency that manages the states power grid found the state was billed billion more than the competitive market would have warranted for power deliveries for the months ending June Davis insisted that FERC move promptly to order the energy companies to gi ve back the money and that Congress should help pressure the agency to do so I do believe that FERC should get a clear signal on refunds from this committee Davis told the Democratcontrolled panel during a hearing into whether FERC has responded properly to the crisis The energy commission has ordered reviews of about million in potentia l overcharges in the past several months But that amount is dwarfed by the billion that Davis is now seeking in refunds While the commission is continuing to review possible overcharges it has y et to order a single dollar in refunds The power generators deny they have overcharged California saying market conditions and the utilities shaky credit ratings warranted high prices Wood and Massey who talked to the Post after their testimony Wednesday before the committee said they are ready to require generators and markete rs to refund revenue that exceeded the price ceilings imposed by FERC on Monda y We should have given the California parties guidance on refunds Massey told the Post A good place to start was to take Mondays order and appl y it starting October and see what you get in refunds Depending on the time period and whether private generators and municipal utilities would be required to pay the refunds could exceed billion so me energy attorneys calculated Wednesday In its Monday order the commission said it wanted all the parties to sit down with an administrative law judge to see if they could work out a refun ds settlement The settlement conference begins Monday Commission Chairman Curt Hebert told the Senate panel at Wednesdays hearin g that if no deal is reached after three weeks the commission would seek advice from the judge on how it might order a resolution The commission stands ready to act expeditiously Hebert pledged While Davis took the offensive at Wednesdays hearing Republicans didnt give him a free ride The Republican National Committee passed out hand fan s touted as Gray Davis solution for summer blackouts The fans were paid for by a small Sacramento Republican consulting firm MB Associates The questioning by the committees chairman Sen Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and other Democrats was friendly But Republicans tried to pai nt Davis as the culprit in a crisis he could have solved a year ago How did you let things get totally out of hand asked Sen Fred Thompson of Tennessee the committees senior Republican Davis said his administration began the push to build new generating plants to meet the impending power shortage four months after he took office in I make no apologies for the aggressive actions weve taken the governor said Republican lawmakers warned that demanding refunds could actually add to Californias power woes if energy investors become spooked about sanctions and take their business elsewhere resulting in a decreased electricity supply Under pointed questioning from Thompson Davis shot back The people I represent are mad They want us to fight back Davis said Obviously we want the state to be an attractive place for investment But we dont want companies walking all over our citizens Separately the top Republican on the Senates Energy and Natural Resources Committee said it was unrealistic and perhaps unfair for Davis to expect FERC to immediately order refunds Theyre going to have to go back to court and prove these charges that indeed there was manipulation in the marketing of power And thats going to be very difficult to do said Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska Even if a refund deal is reached its uncertain how much of an effect it might have Of the billion identified by the ISO roughly twothirds o f that was incurred by California utilities that still owe generators billion s of dollars for past power deliveries Hebert also noted that ratepayers in other Western states would have to be included in refund considerations Meanwhile Sens Dianne Feinstein DCalif and Gordon Smith ROre said Wednesday that because of FERCs action they were pulling back their bill at least for now to require that wholesale prices in the West be set at th e cost of production plant by plant plus a margin of profit However House Democrats said that while they were happy the commission had taken action they still want a vote on a tougher pricecap proposal offere d by Democratic Reps Jay Inslee of Washington and Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco The Bees David Whitney can be reached at or The New York Times contributed to this report Energy Digest State moves to tax plants Published June In a move aimed at squeezing more tax revenue from large instate power generators the state Board of Equalization on Wednesday edged closer to stripping local governments of their authority to tax power plants State Controller Kathleen Connell a member of the board proposed that the state take over the assessments The amount local governments may assess power plants is limited by Proposition but the state is able to place higher values on the properties Supporters of the move say the state could collect million to million more than local governments But the boards staff while acknowledging that the state could extract mor e from power plants than local governments during the current energy crisis said it is unclear what would happen to the price of power and value of pow er plants in the future Local governments worried that the new assessment system could shortchange their revenues opposed the move But the board which voted unanimously to give the plan tentative approval said the Legislature intends to distribut e the power plant money as though it were taxed locally Plants producing fewer than megawatts and cogeneration facilities would be exempted from the rule change The bill closely resembles AB by Assemblywoman Carole Migden DSan Francisco which has been approved by th e Assembly and awaits Senate action Bee Capitol Bureau Davis demands nearly billion for electricity overcharges By H Josef Hebert ASSOCIATED PRESS June WASHINGTON California Gov Gray Davis demanded that power generators r efund nearly billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal regulators have looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the Federal Ener gy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in California and other Western states was a step forward But its actions do nothing about the overcharges over the past year he said The governor a Democrat has been criticized by Republicans who charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of hand Customers might have to pay debt advocate says Continuing coverage Californias Power Crisis Davis defended his actions saying the state has stepped up approval for ne w power plants and strengthened conservation programs He also said the state has little control over price gouging by outofstate power generators The governor once said he could solve Californias problems in minutes But it appears that California has continued to try and hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities putting California taxpayers in jeopardy said Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities not under FERC jurisdiction Sen Joe Lieberman DConn chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee said the FERC which regulates wholesale electricity sales has been slow t o respond and surprisingly reluctant to assure that electricity prices are just and reasonable as required by the Federal Power Act The agencys response to the Western power problem raises serious question s about whether FERC has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy markets not only in the West but across the rest of the country The federal agency whose commissioners were to testify later in the day imposed limited marketbased price caps on Monday in California and oth er Western states from Washington to Arizona The agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues Months ago the FERC singled out million in alleged overcharges by pow er generators The power companies have since challenged the agencys findings and the matter remains in dispute To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California complained Davis He said that between May and the beginning of this month power generators are believed to have overcharged California billion They must be required to give us back our money said Davis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The state spent billion for electricity in and billion in and is projected to pay nearly billion this year said Davis Power generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market h e said Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the problem He said newly approved power plants will provide additional megawatts of electricity by including megawatts by the end of this summer Everything that can be done to bring reliable affordable energy to California is being done except wholesale price relief he said This administration has minimized this crisis for more months said Sen Patty Murray DWash alluding to President Bushs repeated refusal to urg e the FERC to mitigate electricity prices Bush has strongly opposed price controls although he indicated support for FERCs limited price mitigation effort this week Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that businesses can get lowincome loans and require that FERC press its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not only in California but in the Pacific Northwest where electricity prices have also skyrockete d Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price caps based o n the cost of generation at individual power plants Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and reasonable pri ce is laughable said Sen Fred Thompson of Tennessee the committees rankin g Republican Hard price caps dont work when supply is the problem The y make a bad situation worse he said After FERC issued its limited price control order this week Senate Democra ts on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to require more stringent costbased price caps on Western electricity sales Democrats in the House however said they would continue to pursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action Davis spars with GOP senators over electricity rates By Finlay Lewis and Joe Cantlupe COPLEY NEWS SERVICE June WASHINGTON California Gov Gray Davis sparred with Senate Republicans Wednesday as he blamed federal regulators for averting their gaze from an alleged billion scheme to bilk the states electricity consumers Testifying in front of the Senates Government Affairs Committee Davis demanded that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC order power companies to refund the overcharges But the governor also found himself obliged to ward off GOP claims that Davis own policies triggered the state s energy crisis The partisan giveandtake reflected the mounting political stakes involved in Californias plight With both parties preparing for next years congressional elections the subtext of Davis testimony appeared to involv e a recognition that the states energy problems could affect the outcome of several California races How did you let things get so totally out of hand asked Sen Fred Thomps on of Tennessee the committees ranking Republican as he greeted Davis who made a longawaited appearance here after weeks of transcontinental sniping over assigning responsibility for the states energy woes Thompsons question could have been lifted from the script of a millio n GOP advertising campaign launched earlier this week in California that attempts to put the governor on the spot for the energy crisis Davis rebuttal involved a long recitation of his moves to bring more power on line in the state and to encourage greater conservation Weve been working on this for a very long time and to suggest otherwise would be inaccurate he told Thompson Saying that he is determined to hold FERCs feet to the fire on the refun d issue Davis complained to the committee It is unconscionable that the commission looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion Recent public opinion polls show that Davis has lost substantial ground wit h California voters since the electricity crisis hit but Wednesdays round o f activities here found him on the offensive Obviously this is the equivalent of a political nuclear weapon for him observed Norm Ornstein a congressional affairs expert at the American Enterprise Institute Several hours after Davis completed his testimony the five FERC commissioners appeared before the committee but they largely ignored the governors accusations On Monday FERC issued an order restricting energy prices in California and much of the West for the next months and setting up a procedure for reviewing refund claims The commission is not ducking these issues said FERC Chairman Curtis L Hebert However there remains a substantial gap between Davis calculation of electricity overcharges in California and the million in refunds assessed so far by FERC The struggle over refunds will enter a new phase on Monday when the review procedure outlined by FERC will begin before FERCs chief administrative la w judge Curtis L Wagner Jr Pairing off against the power companies will be senior officials of the Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid Davis told reporters that it was the ISO that produced the billion estimate of Californias electricity overcharge To date not a single penny has been returned to Californians Davis told the committee It is unconscionable that the generators be allowed to keep these egregious overcharges California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is reviewing possible price gougin g and Davis said later he would anticipate some strong action coming out of his office before the end of the summer Davis expects to meet on Monday in Sacramento with Bushs two new FERC GOP appointees Pat Wood III and Nora Brownell about natural gas discrepancie s in California California was paying two to three times more in natural gas and the president agreed with me this is something that could be fixed Davis told a press conference after meeting with the California congressional delegation Reps Duncan Hunter REl Cajon and Darrell Issa RVista were among the Republicans who met with Davis It was a good meeting with the governor Hunter said adding that FERC h as taken steps to lock down prices and the results speak for themselves I think we are all working together and its a good sense of common ground That was not the mood in the committee hearing however Sparring with Davis Thompson argued that there had been ample advance warnings of the crisis including a report foreseeing an imminent ener gy shortage and the fact that the state was undergoing a rapid period of economic growth spurred by the energyintensive hightech industry Did you see those developments Thompson asked Did they cause you concern Davis sought to shift the focus back to his predecessor Gov Pete Wilson and the State Legislature that designed an energy deregulation plan now widely recognized as having been seriously flawed However he said those problems did not become apparent until last year Thompson also criticized Davis recent rhetoric castigating the power companies for price gouging and suggested that the tactic could backfire by dissuading the energy sector from making needed investments in the states power infrastructure The people I represent are mad replied Davis They want us to fight bac k and thats what Im doing He said he is determined that the state cease serving as a cash cow to a l ot of energy companies Poway not proceeding on power plant proposal Council worried about financial burden By Brian E Clark UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June POWAY Citing financial risks the City Council has pulled the plug on a proposed million power plant in the South Poway Business Park Though there was no formal vote Mayor Mickey Cafagna told City Manager Jim Bowersox who was lukewarm at best to the proposed plant that his staf f should not spend any more time or money on the project Socalled peaker plants are small lessefficient plants that can produce up to megawatts of electricity Usually they run only several hours a da y when demand is greatest At the council meeting Tuesday night Cafagna said he saw little reason to invest in the plant especially since there are no guarantees that Poway could claim any of the power it produced Instead he said the city should monitor a plan put forth by Rep Duncan Hunter REl Cajon that would coordinate the use of diesel generators owne d by large businesses to help avoid the blackouts that are expected to plague the state this summer If the council had chosen to proceed with the peakerplant proposal an idea it first explored in March it would have had to pay San Diego Gas Electric Co up to to go through the application process An additional would have been authorized for a consultant Those two figures made City Council members blanch Im not willing to commit any of the publics money on this said Councilwoman Betty Rexford I think it would be better for the city to be handing out energyefficient light bulbs to save energy Campaign helps seniors bear summer Program to use stickers identifying cool zones By Anne Krueger UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June During a heat wave or rolling blackout this summer look to the polar bear for relief The bear is on a decal that will be placed at the entrances of about buildings around San Diego County that have been designated as cool zones The program kicks off today the first day of summer The cool zones were the idea of Supervisor Dianne Jacob She was looking fo r a way to offer relief to seniors and the disabled who are particularly vulnerable to heat exhaustion and dehydration Jacob said she was concerned that many seniors might not use their air conditioners this summer because of high electric bills Or they would have to suffer through a power outage during a rolling blackout She said she wants to avoid a disaster like the one in Chicago in Mor e than residents most of them elderly died when the power went out duri ng a heat wave The buildings identified as cool zones include senior centers libraries enclosed shopping malls

formed a coalition to promote a major improvement to the San Diego Gas Electric transmission grid The utility is seeking approval for a volt transmission line that would run from southwest Riverside County to north San Diego County SDGE hopes to have the socalled Valley Rainbow Interconnect in place by San Diego business executives plan to lobby state energy regulators to approve the mile set of looming poles and highvoltage wires in order to boost capacity along the SDGE transmission network The Valley Rainbow Interconnect will ensure a reliable delivery of power f or San Diegans for years to come said Jessie Knight Jr of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce The collection of business leaders includes chamber officials as well as executives of the San DiegoImperial Counties Labor Council and the San Die go Economic Development Corp Calling themselves the San Diego County Valley Rainbow Alliance members pl an to testify at California Public Utilities Commission meetings on behalf of the project Three community hearings have been scheduled by the CPUC to solicit input o n the proposal from residents of San Diego and Riverside counties They were scheduled in Pauma Valley and the Riverside County communities of Wincheste r and Temecula No organized opposition to the network has surfaced in San Diego County But a group of Temecula Valley area residents have spent months fighting th e project Among other things they worry about the effect that the longplanned series of foot poles might have on their property values The CPUC held a hearing last night at the Pauma

adamant on refund at hearing Davis on Capitol Hill visit deflects blame for shortages Finlay Lewis and Joe Cantlupe COPLEY NEWS SERVICE June WASHINGTON Gov Gray Davis sparred with Senate Republicans yesterday as he blamed federal regulators for ignoring what he said was a billion scheme by power companies to bilk Californians Testifying before the Senates Government Affairs Committee Davis demanded that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order power companies to refu nd the overcharges But the governor was forced to respond to Republican claims that his polici es turned a solveable problem into a fullblown energy crisis The partisan giveandtake reflected the mounting political stakes involved in Californias plight The subtext of Davis testimony involved a recognition that the states energy problems could affect the outcome of several California House races next year as well as the governors own reelection How did you let things get so totally out of hand Sen Fred Thompson of Tennessee the committees ranking Republican asked Davis Thompsons question could have been lifted from the script of a millio n GOP advertising campaign launched earlier this week in California that attempts to put the governor on the spot for the energy crisis The campaig n follows weeks of criticism by Davis of federal regulators and of President Bush for failing to address the energy problem Davis rebuttal involved a long recitation of his moves to bring more power on line in the state and to encourage greater conservation Weve been working on this for a very long time and to suggest otherwise would be inaccurate he told Thompson The Democratic governor said he is determined to hold FERCs feet to the fire on the refund issue It is unconscionable that the commission looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion he said Davis grievances received more attention here than they might have just weeks ago before Democrats took control of the Senate and its committees after Sen Jim Jeffords of Vermont bolted the Republican Party to become an independent A sympathetic committee chairman Democratic Sen Joe Lieberma n of Connecticut made Davis the star witness of yesterdays hearing Recent public opinion polls show that Davis has lost substantial ground wit h California voters since the electricity crisis hit but Republicans have acknowledged that Davis and Democrats in recent weeks have gained the upper hand over the Bush administration in the energy debate Despite some GOP criticism yesterday Davis was clearly on the offensive Obviously this is the equivalent of a political nuclear weapon for him observed Norm Ornstein a congressional affairs expert at the American Enterprise Institute Several hours after Davis completed his testimony the five FERC commissioners appeared before the committee but they largely ignored the governors accusations On Monday FERC issued an order to control energy prices in California and much of the West for the next months and to set up a procedure for reviewing refund claims The commission is not ducking these issues said FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert However there remains a substantial gap between Davis calculation of electricity overcharges in California and the million in refunds assessed so far by FERC which have been contested by power generators The struggle over refunds enters a new phase Monday when the review procedu re outlined by FERC will begin before the commissions chief administrative la w judge Curtis Wagner Jr Facing off against the power companies will be senior officials of the Independent System Operator which runs the California power grid Davis told reporters that it was the ISO that produced the billion estimate of Californias electricity overcharge To date not a single penny has been returned to Californians Davis told the committee It is unconscionable that the generators be allowed to keep these egregious overcharges Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif yesterday introduced legislation to provide f or refunds The power companies although acknowledging huge profits have denied allegations of price gouging or market manipulation There has been no evidence to suggest that suppliers bilked anyone Mark Stultz a vice president of the Electric Power Supply Association told the Associated Press California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is reviewing possible price gougin g and Davis said after the hearing he anticipated some strong action from Lockyer in the next few months Davis said he plans to meet on Monday in Sacramento with Bushs two new FER C appointees Pat Wood III and Nora Brownell about natural gas discrepancie s in California Davis said California has been paying up to three times more for natural gas than elsewhere in the country The president agreed with me this is something that could be fixed Davis told a reporters after meeting with the California congressional delegation Reps Duncan Hunter of El Cajon and Darrell Issa of Vista were among the Republicans who met with Davis It was a good meeting with the governor Hunter said adding that FERC h as taken steps to lock down prices and the results speak for themselves I think we are all working together and its a good sense of common ground That was not the mood in the committee hearing however Sparring with Davis Thompson argued that there had been ample advance warnings of the crisis He noted a report forecasting an imminent ener gy shortage and the fact that the state was undergoing a rapid period of economic growth spurred by the energyintensive hightech industry Did you see those developments Thompson asked Did they cause you concern Davis sought to shift the focus back to his predecessor Republican Gov Pe te Wilson and the state Legislature which approved an energy deregulation pl an now widely recognized as seriously flawed However he said those problems did not become apparent until last year Thompson also criticized Davis recent rhetoric castigating the power companies for pricegouging and suggested that the tactic could backfire by dissuading the energy sector from making needed investments in the states power infrastructure The people I represent are mad replied Davis They want us to fight bac k and thats what Im doing He said he is determined that the state cease serving as a cash cow to a l ot of energy companies Littleknown transmission company has billiondollar backers By Jennifer Coleman ASSOCIATED PRESS June SACRAMENTO Through an alliance with a littleknown startup company General Electric Co is trying to enter Californias transmission lines business Although TransElect a twoyearold company based in Washington has no experience in the transmission business it has the financial support of GE s billion financial arm GE Capital TransElects latest offer comes as Gov Gray Davis seeks legislative approval for his plan to buy the transmission lines of both San Diego Gas Electric and Southern California Edison Any involvement by GE in the states transmission grid could be a conflict of interest said a key lawmaker involved in the efforts to end Californias yearlong power crisis Youve got someone with generation and transmission systems how do they keep them separate and do they said Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek Thats a concern for me Would they have the ability to restrict competitors access to transmissions TransElect first made overtures to buy the transmission lines in February offering more than billion for those owned by SDGE Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Although Davis has reached a deal with Edison to buy their lines for billion and a billion pact with SDGE TransElect has said it will offe r Edison billion and SDGE million Bob Mitchell TransElects vice president said the company made its offer believing that the Legislature wont approve the deals to buy the two utilities lines GE joined forces with TransElect March when GE Capital Services Structured Finances Group Inc announced it had bought a minority stake in the company Neither company would reveal the size of the investment But a GE statement said its investment enables GE Capital Global Energy to coinvest with TransElect as it acquires transmission assets throughout th e US Now however both GE and TransElect are trying to downplay their relationship Ken Koprowski a GE spokesman said the company made a small financial investment and were not involved in the management of the company He add ed that the company invests in many other energy projects including power plants Theres no connection with what were doing in California and GE Mitchel l said What Koprowski and Mitchell call a lowprofile arrangement has generated lobbying activity Several lawmakers said they had met with Mitchell about TransElects offer GE Capital hired lobbyist Phillip Schott a week after investing in TransElect Schott referred calls to GEs lobbyist KahlPownall Advocates one of Californias biggest political lobbying firms Fred Pownall KahlPownalls head referred all questions on the bill to GE Capital headquarters In California many hurdles remain for TransElect First the Legislature would have to kill the deals with SDGE and Edison Then the companies woul d have to turn to TransElect to buy their lines So far utility leaders are skeptical Edison CEO John Bryson rejected the TransElect offer Tuesday calling it a phony bid by an unknown company We dont know this company I suppose nobody does Bryson said at a town hall meeting in Los Angeles The reason the transmission lines are in the deal is that we consider it our responsibility to try to stay serving our customers as a healthy utility Other than the governors offer the transmission system isnt for sale Bryson said TransElect remains interested in investing in California but has postpone d sending a letter offering billion for Edisons lines Mitchell said I think its potentially an attractive deal when we can create the right climate for it Mitchell said From the perspective of the people of California its one less financial obligation they have to take on The Memorandum of Understanding between Edison and the governor needs legislative approval by August and many lawmakers have balked at the plan Keeley said he isnt convinced that selling the assets to a private company is the best longterm solution for the state Im not prepared at this stage to believe that we should sell something as significant as the transmission system to an entity that is not regulated b y the state and where our ability to have anything to say about the transmission system is in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions venue he said Should the Davis plan fail Mitchell says his offer would remain It appears to me and many other people that the Legislature is not going t o allow the people of California to pay an excessively high price he said The billion offer is a very strong price Mitchell said he doesnt blame the utilities for rejecting his initial offers since the governor has promised more But he stressed that the company has a future in the industry and plans to go public eventually Formed in TransElect is trying to be the countrys first national transmission company As utilities deregulate they are allowed to sell assets including the transmission lines The American Transmission Company a private transmission company based in Wisconsin has a similar mission as TransElect but not the level of financial backing said ATC spokeswoman Maripat Blankenheim Theyre out there out with a really big check book she said Davis Asks for Energy Refund Help Power Governor urges US Senate action to get back the money that was wrongly taken from us By RICHARD SIMON Times Staff Writer WASHINGTONCalifornia Gov Gray Davis seeking to shift the focus of the energy debate urged Congress on Wednesday to turn up the political hea t on federal regulators to help California recover billion in estimated overcharges by power generators Davis told a Senate panel that the order issued Monday by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to limit Western electricity prices was a ste p in the right direction But more aggressive action is needed he said to give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us Gov Gray Davis wipes his brow outside the Capitol after discussing his remarks to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee AFP Davis remarks to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee suggest th at the political warfare between Sacramento and Washington did not end with FERCs decision to police wholesale electricity prices more aggressively By demanding federal intervention to recover money already paid to pow er generators Davis continued to insist that the Bush administration and federal regulators must share responsibility for solving the states energy problems Yes they have provided some relief Davis said of FERCs price mitigation mandate But thats only half the job The other half of the jo b is give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us On his first trip to Capitol Hill since Democrats took control of the Senate Davis appeared before a Governmental Affairs Committee that display ed more sympathy toward his administration than it did when Republicans ruled it One committee member fellow Democrat Robert Torricelli of New Jersey bluntly warned FERC We are watching how the people of California are treated and we are watching very very closely Davis noted that federal regulators have already determined that wholesale power rates charged to California were unjust and unreasonable Even so he said not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California Governor Calls Rates Egregious Its unconscionable if generators are allowed to keep these egregious overcharges Davis said imploring the committee to hold FERCs feet to t he fire Californias electricity grid operator has calculated that the state paid about billion more than a competitive market would warrant for electricity from May to May So far FERC has only identified abo ut million in possible overcharges which were confined to January and February To some extent FERC has already agreed to play a bigger role in seeki ng refunds although not necessarily the full billion that Davis is seeking Next week representatives of the state electric utilities and power generating companies are scheduled to begin talks in Washington on possible refunds California Gov Gray Davis testifies before a Senate committee He implored its members to hold FERCs feet to the fire AFP The settlement conference which begins Monday is scheduled to run fo r consecutive days including weekends which is unusual for a regulatory proceeding Presiding over the conference will be Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis L Wagner Jr who admonished participants Wednesday to make sure th at they send representatives who have authority to approve any agreements reached during the negotiations Wagner can extend the conference if necessary The purpose of the conference is to settle past accounts and structure new arrangements for Californias energy future Wagner said in a scheduling order To reach those goals the parties must agree on how much of the electricity load will be shifted away from the volatile spot market for immediate delivery into stable longterm contracts refunds and creditworthiness matters the order said Edison General Counsel Stephen E Pickett said the utility is pleased that regulators set up the meeting with power generators to discuss refunds to the utilities dating back to Oct Certainly it is a positive step toward resolving many of these issues Pickett said in a conference call Tuesday with creditors San Diego Gas Electric expressed similar muted optimism SDGE has been a supporter of customer refunds and were encouraged that the FERC is working toward a settlement SDGE spokesman Art Larson said But Reliant Energy spokeswoman Pat Hammond expressed skepticism about the billion overcharge figure cited by Davis That number sounds like t he price of all the power theyve bought in the last year in California and w e obviously dont feel that is owed by Reliant and other power producers Donato Eassey a Houstonbased energy analyst for Merrill Lynch said he expects the FERCmediated conference to produce a compromise in which all partiesgenerators utilities and consumersget a haircut But that outcome he suggested might beat the alternatives Youve got to put this problem behind you he said because if you dont youll have a problem of biblical proportions FERC Members Also Before Senate Panel Adding to the pressure for refunds Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif introduced a bill Wednesday that would require FERC to order rebates if federal regulators determine that prices charged were unjust and unreasonable The five members of FERCs governing board also appeared Wednesday before the Senate panel but were scheduled later in the day to avoid a publ ic confrontation with Davis The governor met privately Wednesday with two new board members including Patrick H Wood III a Bush ally from Texas who according to Davis has indicated a more aggressive approach to refunds might be in order Still there was no shortage of partisanship at the committee hearing Republican aides passed out handheld fans bearing the inscription Gray Davis solution for summer blackouts Davis handed out a slick page book detailing steps his administration has taken to ease the powe r crunch The Bush administration issued a Department of Energy study asserti ng that California would face twice as many rolling blackouts if hard price ca ps were imposed on wholesale electricity Davis did not escape a scolding from Republican senators for his criticism of the Bush administrations refusal to impose firm price control s Sen Fred Thompson RTenn pointedly asked Davis how he let things get totally out of hand and excoriated the governor for assigning blame fo r the states problems to the Bush administration federal regulators former Gov Pete Wilson and various corporate pirates He also faulted Davis for not acting sooner to pass on higher wholesale costs to consumers If I passed on a increase to the citizens of California there would be an outrage the likes of which you have never seen Davis responde d Republican senators also challenged Davis on how he hopes to stimulate more power plant construction in California if state officials continue to attack generating companies They noted that the state attorney general eve n suggested that the chairman of one power company deserved to be locked in a cell with an amorous inmate named Spike This is a rough business Davis responded The people I represent a re mad He also told his Republican critics If you were in my shoes and faci ng the extraordinary price increases you would feel as I do Our first obligation is to fight back Davis urged the committee to keep pressure on FERC to rein in natural gas prices which until recently have been as much as eight times higher th an the national average FERC Chairman Curtis L Hebert Jr assured the committee that his agen cy is aggressively pursuing remedies to Californias energy price spikes and supply shortages We have been engaged he said citing more than orde rs issued by the agency to address the power crisis Commissioner William L Massey a Democrat who has urged stronger federal intervention in the electricity markets said he regrets the commission did not act sooner Businesses have closed down putting thousands out of work and hurtin g the Western economy and all because of a broken electricity market he said By acting months ago we could have prevented much of the economi c carnage Despite the tensions Davis elicited some sympathy from even his Republican critics I wouldnt wish your problems on my worst enemy Thompson told Davis Times staff writers Nancy Rivera Brooks in Los Angeles and Thomas S Mulligan in New York contributed to this story House Approves Utility Aid for Needy Congress Bill would add million to program that helps families pay their bills Strict price caps are blocked By JANET HOOK Times Staff Writer WASHINGTONIn its first direct legislative response to the nations burgeoning energy crisis the House on Wednesday approved legislation that would provide an additional million to help lowincome families pay their power bills The bill amounts to a midyear increase of for the billion energy assistance programtwice as much as President Bush had proposed adding to help the poor cope with increases in utility bills Before final action on the bill House Republican leaders blocked Democratic efforts to force votes on a broader response to the energy crisi s in the West strict energy price caps that reach beyond the restraints imposed Monday by federal regulators Republicans argued that price caps would not solve Californias energy problem while Democrats accused the GOP of being cavalier about the crisis faced by consumers This says to the people of the West Your emergency doesnt count to us said Rep Nancy Pelosi DSan Francisco But such assertions were countered by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay RTexas who said Members should reject the siren song of price caps an d remember this Government price controls will mean more blackouts The issue erupted during debate on a billion midyear appropriatio n bill to cover unanticipated costs and emergency expenditures including billion for the Defense Department and million to help the Internal Revenue Service pay the cost of sending out rebate checks authorized by the recently enacted tax cut law The measure passed to In an earlier vote Bush barely escaped an embarrassing slap when Democrats moved to cut the proposed IRS increase by millionthe cost o f a letter the agency is sending to tell taxpayer of their impending tax reba te Democrats complained that the letter which prominently mentions Bush reads like a piece of campaign literature Republicans said it was needed t o save people from calling the IRS about their checks The amendment failed to The bill now goes to the Senate where Democrats are considering an ev en bigger increase in energy aid for the poor Overall the House bill would provide the billion requested by Bush But it would change some spending priorities For instance Bushs Office of Management and Budget objects strongly to provisions that would rescind million in money appropriated for the Federal Emergency Management Agencyjust as the disaster relief agency is facing big outlays to cope with damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison That provision to rescind the money came under attack from Democrats a nd Republicans posing the debates most serious challenge to the bill But an effort to send the bill back to the Appropriations Committee and restore th e money was defeated on a party line vote of to The energy aid for the poor is provided through the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program which helps the poor and elderly pay heating and airconditioning bills In California a family of four must earn less than to be eligible and the average benefit is a year Although Republicans and Democrats have been divided over broad questions of energy policy there has been a bipartisan consensus on more help for needy consumers So despite pressure to hold down the cost of the supplemental spending bill House Republicans doubled Bushs request for billion in additional energy aid GOP leaders blocked on procedural technicalities Democratic amendments to increase the funding even more Republican leaders also fought efforts by Democrats to turn debate on the spending bill into Congress first broadgauged discussion on the nations energy crisis Democrats wanted to offer major energy amendments including one to impose strict costbased price caps on wholesale electrici ty in Californiastricter price restraints than the policy announced Monday b y the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Proponents of the stricter caps echoing complaints by California Gov Gray Davis and others said FERCs order did not go far enough to guarantee relief for consumers against blackouts shortages and price gouging Republicans argued that price caps would be counterproductive and that Californias problems will be solved only by increasing the energy supply Democrats lost a procedural vote that blocked their amendments from coming to a voteIt was an important victory for Republican leaders wh o had feared mounting support for price caps even within their own party However momentum flagged this week after the FERC decision The House bill also includes million for a Defense Department plan to make military bases in California selfsufficient and get them off the states power grid during shortages million for planning and environmental studies for a proposed upgrade in an electrical transmission line in Central California known as Path Summer Starts Power Doesnt Stop Energy Consumers show they can take the heat with their conservation helping to limit demand But experts remain wary By MITCHELL LANDSBERG Times Staff Writer As unwelcome as the killer bees as hyped as Pearl Harbor the big bad summer of officially arrived today anddid someone forget to turn out the lights After months of dread the Blackout Summer began on a curiously bright note Despite several days of summerlike weather there was barely a whisp er about blackouts The state that couldnt plug in a night light in January without tripping electrical shortage alarms managed to enter the summer wit h electricity to spare For the moment power supplies look healthy Wholesale electricity prices are a sliver of what they were just a month ago Demand for power is down apparently the result of a successful conservation campaign And California officials appear to have won their monthslong battle with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which imposed price and supply contro ls on the Western electricity market beginning at midnight last night All in all an auspicious beginning for what many have warned would be a dreadful summer So why arent California energy officials blowing up balloons for the big endofcrisis party We are not out of the woods said Richard Sklar the states energy supply czar We are not out of the woods on price and we are not out of t he woods on availability His view is echoed by most of those who closely watch the states electrical market So far Californias supplydemand balance is coming closer to bestcase predictions than to the worst But it is a delicate balance On Wednesday with temperatures hovering around summer norms operator s of the statewide power grid managed to maintainif just barelythe of operating reserves they strive for When reserves dip below that the state begins ascending the ladder of staged emergency declarations that eventuall y lead to blackouts Total electricity use in the state peaked about pm at megawattsa high for the year but well below the states alltime record of megawatts which was set on July State officials credit conservation with shaving off about megawatts an amount that easily means the difference between blackouts or no blackouts on most days There is no doubt in my mind that conservation has led directly to the situation that were in now said Mike Sloss who tracks conservati on for the California Energy Commission Richard Roher who crunches conservation numbers for the commission said consumers appear to be continuing to cut their electricity use by abou t There also has been good news on the supply side of the equation Afte r months in which power plant breakdowns and shutdowns were costing the state as much as megawatts of electricity at a time most plants are now online and outages were down to megawatts Wednesday Most small alternative energy suppliers finally reached agreement thi s week in their epic contract battle with Southern California Edison putting that vital segment of the states energy production back in business And i n the next two weeks the states first two new major power plants in a decad e are scheduled to open adding more than megawatts to the power streamenough to serve about typical homes State officials are also hoping that the FERC ruling which limits prices in the state Western region and requires generators to sell available power to California will ease the situation further Everyone is very interested to see how tomorrow unfolds pricewise a nd supplywise Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for Californias grid operator said Wednesday For all the positive signs no one is predicting that the state will weather the summer without blackouts No one knows how many power plants wi ll break down Nor does anyone know the extent to which Californians best intentions to conserve will melt away in a sustained heat wave While the past few days have been hot they havent been searing It w as in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday in Riverside in Sacramento in Palm Springstoasty but far from the hottest weather any of those places can expect this summer Nor was it unusually hot in surrounding states whose ability to sell power to California depends in part on their own energy needs Electricity use generally rises with the thermometer because air conditioners use more power than most other appliances If it gets hot in California and its also hot in the Northwest and its hot in Phoenix we could run into some significant problems said Jan SmutneyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Assn a trade group for power plant owners in California The state has benefited recently from imports of electricity from the Northwest where snow runoff is cascading through electrical turbines But those imports are expected to dry up later in the summer as stream flowswhi ch have been kept high to assist salmon runsare scaled back to levels that reflect the regions winter drought So the summer of could still be interesting And it may begin wit h a blackout after all For weeks now an email campaign has spread through the Internet calling on people to voluntarily cut off most or all of their power between pm and pm tonight The protest called the Roll Your Own Blackout is the idea of a Southern California artist who worked in tandem with a software engineer fr om Berkeley Their intention is to protest the energy policies recently announced by President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney When you hear Mr Cheney who drafted the energy plan deriding conservation as merely a personal virtue it is as though he believes virtu e has no place in government policy and that would be a very dangerous thing said Dave Aragon the software engineer The California crisis gave birth to their campaign but Aragon said he is hoping that the protest goes beyond the states borders Worldwide would be fine he said Board Votes to Let State Tax Power Plants Proposal Levies on property currently are made by counties The revenue would increase say proponents of change By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOState tax collectors endorsed a proposal Wednesday that could force power plant owners to pay tens of millions of dollars more in taxes next year The fivemember Board of Equalization voted unanimously to assert jurisdiction over the property taxes paid by companies with power plants th at produce more than megawatts Under the boards proposalwhich faces public hearings before it takes effectthe state would seize from counties the authority to tax these plants State control could potentially enrich government coffers because the state would tax the plants based on their fair market value while counties tax power plant owners based on the original value of the plants plus a annual inflation rate Consumer advocates argue that the value of private power plants has skyrocketed in the past year as the price of wholesale electricity soared in the malfunctioning market created under Californias deregulation plan Under deregulation utilities sold power plants to private companie s many of them based out of state for a total of billion They are making exorbitant profits said Lenny Goldberg executive director of the California Tax Reform Assn a nonprofit group largely fund ed by unions He called the power plants vastly underassessed Board of Equalization Chairwoman and state Controller Kathleen Connell said the move is necessary not only because it might bring in more tax revenue but because California itself could soon build power plants or own power lines under plans pushed by Gov Gray Davis We may not be getting the best value through the current system sai d Connell especially if the state proceeds with plans to own plants in California It makes sense to act now to bring all generating facilities under th e same assessment system she said For many decades the Board of Equalization levied property taxes on power plants because they were owned by utilities and regulated by the stat e But in after the launch of deregulation the tax board voted to allow counties to assess property taxes on power plants under a formula set by Proposition the ballot measure that limits property taxes for homeowners and businesses The boards vote Wednesday launches a process of public hearings that could lead to a reversal of that decision Officials from several cities that are home to power plants urged the Board of Equalization to take no action Under the current system cities with power plants get a greater share of property tax revenue which is generally split among local governments and schools Long Beach got about a year in property tax revenue when the state was assessing taxes said city Controller Barbara Hennessy but now gets nearly million a year Shari L Freidenrich treasurer for Huntington Beach said a reversal of the boards tax method could cost the cityhome to a major power plant million a year in property taxes A bill pending in the Legislature by Assemblywoman Carole Migden DSa n Francisco would protect those cities by guaranteeing that they get the sam e proportion of property tax revenue even if the state reasserts control over power plant assessments Goldberg of the California Tax Reform Assn argued that allowing the state to tax plant owners based on market value would bring in more revenue for the entire state As an example he estimated that a big power plant on Monterey Bay own ed by Charlotte NCbased Duke Energy North America would have paid Monterey County at least an additional million in property taxes last year under the proposed method of assessment The plant valued by the county at million is probably worth about billion given market conditions Goldbe rg said The power industry argues that when California lifted state regulation of power plants in those plants became businesses no different from a department store or bakery in terms of property tax status We would expect to be treated like any other business in California h as been treated since Prop went into place said Duke spokesman Tom Williams Davis spinmeisters

NDTLtypeDnews Gov Gray Davis decision to hire the Masters of Disaster two former ClintonGore spin doctors has led to a lawsuit by an antitax group and a refusal by the state controller to pay the two political strategists Since the energy crisis began Davis has hired several nationally known experts to advise him But the recent contract for Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani has opened a political wound in part because the two men are considered fiercely partisan and politically ruthless State Controller Kathleen Connell a Democrat who continually fights with Davis said yesterday that she will refuse to pay Lehane and Fabiani with state funds Their contract is worth for six months Connell said its hard for her to imagine that Lehane and Fabiani are worki ng on state policy as required by law and not politics From my viewpoint youre asking Californians to survive with fewer lights on and youre asking them to assume the burden of billion in longterm debt for power Connell said Its just another slap in the face to ask them to pay for people to explain the situation away The National TaxLimitation Committee a Sacramento group that mostly monitors legislation filed a lawsuit last week alleging that Fabiani and Lehane are violating the Political Reform Act because they also have done work for Southern California Edison as consultants Its considered a conflict of interest for public officials to work on issu es that affect companies that pay them more than either through paycheck s or stock Davis is actively negotiating with Edison on a bailout plan to ke ep the utility from bankruptcy ADDING INSULT TO INJURY Lewis Uhler with the TaxLimitation Committee said We are kind of addin g insult to injury to then have the governor who feels the pressure of this crisis to spend this kind of dough for damage control Secretary of State Bill Jones last week asked the Fair Political Practices Commission to investigate Lehane and Fabiani and their relationship with Edison Jones said the unseemly conflicts of interest by Davis advisers during the energy crisis are increasing the peoples cynicism A spokeswoman for the FPPC said the agency was reviewing Jones complaint Both

House and for Vice President Al Gore during his failed campaign They earned the nickname Masters of Disaster fo r consistently handling public relations matters during Clintons various scandals Davis spokesman Hilary McLean said Lehane and Fabiani were hired to explain what the state is doing to help solve the crisis on a short and longterm basis She said financial experts are consulting with the governor on the Edison deal They worked in the White House and worked on policy issues McLean said and believe me what they are working on right now is the public policy aspect of the California energy crisis Davis is not the first elected official to hire former political strategist s with public money President Bush put his political strategist Karl Rove in a senior White House position Rove recently revealed that he held stock in an energy trading company that stands to benefit from Bushs energy policy CLEARLY A CONFLICT But state Senate Minority Leader Jim Brulte said the contract for Lehane an d Fabiani is clearly a conflict of interest in regards to Edison and far different from the other consultants Davis has hired Brulte promised he would not vote for a state budget that includes the Lehane and Fabiani contract The governor has hired millions of dollars worth of consultants who are experts on bonds and experts on energy In each of these cases we have giv en him the benefit of the doubt Brulte said There is no doubt here The appropriate people to pay for this is the Gray Davis campaign committee The increased political pressure on Davis comes as several Republicans are entering the race for governor At one time Davis was considered all but invincible in but the energy crisis has badly damaged his standing among voters according to recent polls The governor is also using his own political pressure orchestrated by chie f adviser Garry South Fabiani and Lehane among others to boost his image a nd change federal policy Since Davis has no control

lauded the change propos ed by State Controller Kathleen Connell saying assessment rules that apply to the counties allow energy firms making huge profits to save millions in property taxes The power companies vowed to challenge the boards plan Board member Johan Klehs said the board is not bound by its decision because the power industry did not live up to its claim that deregulation would bring California lower rates for electricity Klehs said the thinking then was that county assessment would yield a value that was more fair because competition would reduce profits for generators If you didnt keep your end of the bargain I dont see why we should keep ours Klehs said But whether power suppliers would pay more under board authority is open to question No matter who does the evaluation the record profits reaped by energy firms over the past year and a half cannot be considered when their next assessment is made January By then rates for electricity will like ly be lower as more supplies come on line state contracts kick in and federa l price caps continue Connell herself said she did not advocate the change to maximize tax revenues but to ensure the most consistent and most accurate method of setting property tax values for the estimated power plants that will be online in California within a few years This discussion is not about raising taxes or denying the protection of Proposition said Connell She said she proposed the change because the state is gearing up to buy its own power plants and transmission lines and should therefore take a stronger role in setting tax policy for generators Connell challenged estimates of potential multimillion dollar increases in tax revenues advanced by Lenny Goldberg executive director of the Californ ia Tax Reform Association Goldberg said Monterey County should have received at least million mor e in taxes on the Moss Landing plant acquired by Duke Energy which he claime d had made as much as million in profits over the past year Goldberg sa id the other or so plants divested by the utilities were similarly undervalued They are making exorbitant profits Goldberg said They are vastly underassessed But cities that are now benefiting from local assessment of power plants within their borders say the change could have a drastic impact on their finances Under the boards decisions cities where plants are located draw a heftier share of the taxes than they did when the plants belonged to the stateassessed utilities Those cities may keep their enhanced share of the revenues under a bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Carole Migden that would also shift authority fo r power plant assessment to the state board The bill AB passed the assembly and is headed for hearings in the state Senate But city officials said they were still uneasy over the transfer of assessment power to the board saying it could lead to unpredictable fluctuating revenues and possible concessions to big industry Long Beach City Controller Barbara Hennessy cited a past settlement agreeme nt with the utilities that she said dropped evaluations for the power plants they formerly owned My concern is that something like that would happen in

top federal energy regulator told a Senate panel yesterday that he would consider denying power generators the right t o charge market prices for electricity If carried out the suggestion by Patrick Wood one of Bushs two new appointees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would mark a stunni ng aboutface for an agency that until Woods arrival had resisted heavy intervention in Californias electricity market Such a move would hand a huge victory to Gov Gray Davis who earlier in th e day told the Government Affairs Committee that FERC should order power generators to pay California billion in refunds for alleged overcharges Davis arrived in Washington for what had initially been billed as star testimony urging FERC to impose price caps After federal regulators approv ed a form of price controls on Monday Davis swiftly pivoted to demand that FE RC order generators to pay refunds It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state out of billion Davis told panel chairman Joe Lieberma n who had offered Davis the forum before his investigatory committee as soon as Democrats took control of the Senate a few weeks ago Lieberman promised Davis that he would pressure regulators to order the refunds And Sen Barbara Boxer a California Democrat introduced the Electricity Gouging Relief Act of that would force FERC to do so But it now appears that FERC may be much more amenable to Davis complaints than it was little more than two weeks ago before Wood was sworn in In his first action at the agency Wood the former head of the Texas Publi c Utilities Commission was a chief catalyst behind a to vote by FERC Monday to impose a sweeping price ceiling on electricity throughout Western states Wood also said that while refunds might be useful to chasten electricity sellers Congress might consider giving FERC the power to impose punitive triple damages for generator overcharges and impose other administrative penalties in addition to refunds TREBLE DAMAGES Ordering refunds is one issue Wood said But an administrative penalty is perhaps a useful tool in our tool chest and I think perhaps even treble damages much as exist in antitrust laws If were going to be a vigilant market cop we need to make sure our bark matches our bite Wood said a return to the traditional costofservice regulation that exist ed before California partially deregulated electricity in remains on the table That would restrict companies from charging whatever the market coul d bear Temporarily revoking a companys authority to sell at market rates a rig ht granted by FERC could be an effective way to deter price manipulation he said Woods comments may offer some insight on how FERC intends to rule on sweeping allegations of market manipulation by Californias power grid managers The state has demanded that federal regulators revoke the rights of six generators to sell electricity at market rates The California Independent System Operator said the companies prices should be set by determining the ir generating costs plus a reasonable return Bushs other new appointee Nora Mead Brownell a former Pennsylvania utili ty regulator also suggested a much more forceful federal role You dont just open the market declare victory and walk away Brownell said Competition in a newly deregulated market she added doesnt just happen overnight Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said Davis has had extensive conversations with Wood that lead him to believe Wood would be amenable to refunds Davis thinks theres a real meeting of minds there Maviglio said Davis met privately with Wood and Brownell yesterday and Wood is scheduled to meet with Davis again in Sacramento on Monday When Woods name was first floated as a Bush appointee it was widely assum ed he would follow in the footsteps of fiercely freemarket FERC chairman Curt Hebert a Republican appointee of President Clinton whom Bush elevated to head the agency But in his first few public comments since taking office Wood has consistently charted a much more regulatory course Bush is considered like ly to tap Wood as FERC chairman perhaps this fall Echoing a longstanding Davis complaint that FERC has been asleep at the wheel Wood and Brownell said that once properly deregulated electricity markets are in place federal regulators should actively monitor and enforc e market rules SETTLEMENT TALKS As part of its Monday pricecontrol action FERC also ordered settlement talks between the state of California and its electricity suppliers that wi ll start in Washington on Monday at FERC headquarters and last for days FE RC judge Curtis Wagner will preside The refund total Davis gave senators is nearly times more than the million in overcharges that FERC has alleged so far Maviglio said any refunds of alleged overcharges that occurred after the state began buying power January would go to the state Refunds of overcharges before that date would to go the states utilities one of whic h Pacific Gas and Electric Co is in bankruptcy Wood warned that the price controls imposed by FERC this week will not prevent blackouts this summer because electricity remains in short supply We didnt promise that it would be a panacea Wood said I think quite frankly we want to make sure that we mitigate not only the price but mitiga te the expectations that things are going to be rosy this summer on the West Coast They are not There will be blackouts but I think what we wanted to take a step on was to make sure that those blackouts the insult of those wouldnt be accompanied by the injury of a very high and unjust bill for th e power GOP SCOLDS DAVIS While Davis was greeted warmly by Democrats on the committee Republicans took him to task for mismanaging the states electricity crisis and trying to lay the blame on Bush For Gov Davis the cause of the states crisis is simply that a bunch o f Texas cowboys got in the corral and decided to take advantage of California said ranking panel Republican Fred Thompson of Tennessee All of the policies that were clearly part of the problem were locked into place and kept there until they created a disaster How was it that you seemed to let this get totally out of hand he asked Davis But Davis stuck to his insistence on refunds Give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us he said Email Carolyn

cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NSDTLtypeDnews Nonprofit agencies that serve Santa Clara Countys needy are about to get relief from skyrocketing energy costs that could keep them from doing their jobs A unique grant program to help them cut their utility bills was announced yesterday along with the findings of a foundation survey of nonprofits that reported gas and electric costs have gone up an average percent at a time when the slowing economy has increased demand for their services To help the nonprofits keep energy bills down so they can meet rising need Community Foundation Silicon Valley has begun handing out grants to local agencies to buy energyefficient equipment and conduct energy audits to determine other ways to reduce expenses The privately funded energy grant program was said to be the first of its kind in Northern California since the onset of the current energy crisis For more agencies something as simple as purchasing a new refrigerator or installing ceiling fans can lead to hundreds of dollars in savings said Peter Hero president of Community Foundation Silicon Valley Our goal is to help keep energy costs down so that our local nonprofits can avoid cutti ng services to the community The survey released yesterday showed that most agencies have already initiated such energysaving measures as turning off lights cutting down a ir conditioning and turning off computers and appliances but are still forced to dip into reserves to pay utility bills The agencies said Hero face stiff challenges in taking conservation to t he next step A performing arts group for example cant just simply turn off the spotlight in the middle of a show The announcement of the grants part of a energy crisis response fund created with donations from several private foundations was made in San Jose at St Elizabeths Day Care Center whose gas and electricity bill s have tripled in some months according to Executive Director Robert Freiri The churchrun day care center which serves more than children was on e of three agencies that received the first of the foundations energy savin g grants yesterday It will use the money to pay for an extensive energy audi t of the yearold facility Other grant recipients were San Juan Bautista Child Development Center in east San Jose which plans to buy an energysaving commercial stove for its central kitchen and Concern for the Poor which runs the San Jose Family Shelter A shelter official said the money will be used to purchase energy efficient refrigerators and other energysaving appliances Meanwhile Hero said his foundation was seeking matching funds from other donors and that he expects the energy grant program to double or triple i n size within the next few weeks A surprising finding in the survey he said was that while the stock marke t plunge may have contributed to an average percent drop in donations to t he charitable groups during the first quarter of this year philanthropic givi ng in Silicon Valley was still percent higher this year than in when the economy was booming I may be an optimist but it seems philanthropy is so much more on the rad ar screen of Silicon Valley even among the dotcomers whose stocks and jobs have taken a beating said Hero Hero was joined at the news conference by Greg Larson president and CEO of United Way Silicon Valley who told how his own agency is being rescued fro m mounting energy bills by an anonymous Silicon Valley contractor The contractor he said has donated as part of in planned upgrading of heating and air conditioning systems as well as electrical retrofitting of United Ways Silicon Valley Nonprofit Center in San Jose T he center provides office and meeting space for more than nonprofits Without such energyefficient improvements said Larson United Way would have to cut about a year from its critical services budget to meet the recent percent increase in utility bills Email Bill Workman at San

The gold rush in Californias electricity market when generators could name any price for their power may be over New federal limits taking effect today have chilled Western power markets keeping prices cool even as a heat wave drives up demand in California Its still too early to say how effective those regional rules will be and California leaders are urging tougher controls But market analysts no long er expect a return to the huge markups seen earlier this year I think the party has gotten a lot quieter said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute The federal controls for the first time limit market prices throughout the West under a complex formula based on the operating costs of the plant that is the most expensive to run The prices will change based on which plants are selling power during shortages That limit is currently per megawatthour although companies can add percent for California sales t o reflect credit uncertainty Thats a far cry from daily prices that averaged to and at times neared per megawatthour earlier this year Prices have been falling since late May as power plants returned to operati on from scheduled maintenance cool weather dampened demand and hydroelectric imports exceeded expectations The states longterm power contracts also contributed to the decline But as rising temperatures threatened blackouts this week daily prices for Northern California held at a modest per megawatthour according to Bloomberg News Service less than a third of the cost during similar shortages in May Power contract prices for electricity delivered later this summer and next year reflect lower profit expectations They know theres going to be a ceiling on prices and thats bearish news said Mike Wilczek senior reporter for Platts Power Markets a division of McGrawHill Theyve sold the market down Theyre not sure what the cap will be at any given time But they do know it wont be able t o spike to the extremes it did before Energy industry officials have been studying the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions Monday order and say its too soon to declare the profit party over Prices can always go higher and always go lower said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum If theres somethi ng to be worried about its the unknown Once its known our fears will calm down and well be able to start working with it Expectations were much higher just two months ago Predictions of routine rolling blackouts prompted energy traders to bid up summer electricity pric es to per megawatthour Although the summer has just begun the states power picture now looks less ominous Experts agree energy companies will still make a tidy sum in California an d industry officials say generators arent shelving plans for new plants These sorts of caps are not going to put any kind of squeeze on them Borenstein said They just arent going to see quite as large profits as they have been An analyst who works closely with power marketers said they no longer expec t easy money Theyre having a hell of a time now justifying the prices they charged earlier this year said the analyst who asked not to be identified Wh at they are saying is its going to be more difficult to make more money in th e market Past federal regulatory orders in December and April have been followed by higher prices leading many California officials to press for even stricter moves such as refunding past profits But this weeks order suggests the agency which includes two new appointee s of President Bush is more serious about keeping the market in check The order includes a demand that Duke Energy which owns four California power plants refund with interest profits from charging the state per megawatthour earlier this year The company said it never collected its million bill which included an percent markup for the states uncertain credit But in an order more strongly worded than any to date federal regulators made clear they disapproved of the companys claim We will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding behavior regulators wrote in the order Duke Energys bidding at multiples of its marginal costs in an attempt to recover pastdue amounts c an in no way be found to be just and reasonable State leaders who have accused federal regulators of falling down

contribut e to prices experts say June By DENA BUNIS The Orange County Register WASHINGTON Federal regulators could turn out to be heroes or goats dependi ng on whether Mondays pricecontrol ruling helps California turn the corner o n its electricity crisis And it could be years before anyone can legitimately make that call Meanwhile spin abounds and Californians who ultimately pay the energy bil ls will have to sit tight and hope Several factors combine to make it difficult experts say to predict how much good the soft price cap ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will do I can think of an awful lot of different reasons that would affect energy prices said Robert Michaels a professor of economics at California State University Fullerton and a consultant to power producers The weather lower naturalgas prices new power coming online conservatio n and longterm contracts all contribute to lower prices And those things figure into the price the state and if they get back into the market utilities will pay for electricity Experts pored over the order when it was released saying the fine print is crucial to how the market will be affected Its a positive development but its just half the battle said Gov Gra y Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio The other half is getting the refunds ba ck to California he added referring to allegations of generator overcharges The fight is not over Davis will testify this morning before the Senate Committee on Government Affairs along with the FERC commissioners Not everyone was happy with FERCs turnaround Julie Simon vice president of policy at the Electric Power Supply Association the national trade association for power said the order is incredibly intrusive It worries me that this could have a detrimental impact on California getting the investment that it needs and the type of market structure so people can get the benefits of competition Whatever happens with prices nothing in the order will do anything to ease the chances of blackouts says a former California Public Utilities Commission chairman Blackouts are in the short term and have nothing to do with the price of electricity said Mitch Wilk a utility consultant who ran the PUC from to Despite the uncertainties there was enough confidence that the FERC action would at least stabilize a chaotic market that even Sen Dianne Feinstein a fierce critic of the agency thanked the commissioners who appeared before the Senate energy committee Tuesday And she and Sen Gordon Smith ROre pulled back their bill that would have established costbased price caps in the West Lets watch and wait and see how this order works Feinstein said As the pressure mounted politically for price controls two things happened Republicans including President George W Bush began talking about caps that werent really caps And energy analysis and economists usually oppose d to such regulation began to soften I would fear price caps which dont have any market connection said Stev en Fetter a utility bond rater with Fitch Inc in New York Fetter testified before the Senate energy panel Tuesday This plan he said maintains a connection to the supplyanddemand patterns That is definitely a positive Fetter said the order once implemented in all states in the West shou ld ramp down some of the volatility I came all ready for a brawl over price caps he said And instead got a love fest regarding regulations FERC Chairman Curt Hebert whose turnaround on this issue has been attribut ed to political pressure and the presence of two new GOP commissioners committ ed to helping California continued to insist Tuesday that the price controls are not caps He said May and Junes low prices are proof that the more limited price controls put on in April are working The approach has been working and I believe it will work better Hebert told the senators Spot prices in California and the rest of the West are lower than at any time in the last year Lower prices eventually filter down to consumers Stable prices mean large rate increases can probably be avoided But longterm Wilk said electricity rates are going to go up no matter what happens The days of cheap electricity and no power plants are long over And regardless of whether caps serve to keep prices at least in check the order has changed the playing field Wilk said Its a new ballgame he said The order he added sends a signal to generators that to the extent they were trying to play around either legally or illegally with prices thinking they have sympathetic ears in

WASHINGTON A lengthening list of politically endangered California Republicans appears to have spurred the Bush administration into a retreat on the states volatile electricity pricing issue White House desire to keep Republican control of the US House in next years elections will be an unspoken but clear concern when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meets Monday to reconsider its pricing policy according to a wide range of analysts who have studied the situation The expected turnaround on the part of FERC and the White House is due at least partly to complaints from embattled California House Republicans that Democrats have gained the political high ground as voters come to believe that outofstate energy companies are engaged in price gouging and profiteering Republicans have come to realize that the entire pricing structure here is a potential political killer said Tony Quinn a Sacramento political analyst with past ties to the GOP After months of condemning price controls the administration gave the gree n light to FERC to devise a plan to restrain wholesale electricity prices in California and nearby states by pegging them to the costs of the least efficient producer in a given market This approach has already been invoked in California in energysupply emergencies The plan before FERC would leave it in place during the summer months in California and much of the rest of the West regardless of energy availability While far more generous to the industry than the pricecap formula being advanced by congressional Democrats and California Gov Gray Davis the pricing mechanism likely to be embraced by FERC represents a substantial retreat by the agency and the White House Until now both have insisted on giving free play to market forces except in emergencies The more savvy Republican leaders here have figured out that you cant go down in flames for an ideological position when your constituents are being hurt said political scientist Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of Claremont Graduate University With the GOP enjoying only an vote margin over the Democrats in the Hous e Republican strategists in recent days have focused on assessments showing that a number of Republicanheld seats in California could switch hands due in large part to soaring electricity prices The list includes Reps Doug Ose of Sacramento author of the pricing plan now under consideration by FERC and Rep Steve Horn of Long Beach a widel y respected moderate According to some analysts others in jeopardy are Reps Elton Gallegly of Simi Valley Richard Pombo of Tracy and Gary Miller of Diamond Bar Quinn also argued that Rep David Dreier of San Dimas chairman of the powerful Rules Committee and a rising GOP star in the House could face energyrelated problems and that Rep Mary Bono of searingly hot Palm Sprin gs could find herself losing some ground in her otherwise safe GOP constituenc y The California energy crisis has all the earmarks of a classic attack issue said John R Pitney a political scientist at ClaremontMcKenna College You have a Republican administration headed by two people with connections to the oil industry and you have a very visible problem and a solution that is easy and plausible Democratic price controls Alarmed by these developments House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas this week launched a damagecontrol effort by assigning a team of Republicans to help counter Democratic attacks on the White House The teams assignment includes daily floor speeches defending Bushs energy policies The energy crisis is only the latest development in a trend that has increased the sense of Republican congressional vulnerability in California Even before this springs blackouts and stratospheric energy bills longte rm demographic shifts were tilting the state in a Democratic direction Congressional redistricting also is expected to exact a toll on the Republican delegation Compounding the partys troubles was the perception that Bush having lost California handily to Democrat Al Gore last fall had written off the state in terms of his expected reelection campaign in Then came the loss of Republican control of the US Senate a development that reminded GOP strategists of their tenuous position in the US House The administration soon discovered that California is still populated by a large number of Republican congressmen who didnt appreciate the White Houses stance on the problem said Steve Smith head of a think tank at Washington University in St Louis that studies problems of politics and economics Meanwhile Democrats here appear to be betting that the pending FERC plan will solve neither Californias energy pains nor the GOPs political problems House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt told reporters on Thursday that the measure would amount to only a kind of tweaking of FERCs existing emergency pricing order for California an approach that he said has pr oven ineffective overly complicated and loaded with loopholes Gephardt added It still allows huge price gouging by the electric compani es with regard to wholesale prices in California House panel rejects Democratic plan for energy price caps By Alan Fram ASSOCIATED PRESS June WASHINGTON House Republicans rejected a Democratic effort Thursday to impose federal price caps on electricity prices in the Western United State s amid an intensifying partisan divide over energy By a near partyline vote the House Appropriations Committee rejecte d a proposal by Rep Nancy Pelosi DCalif that would have required the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to tightly limit electricity rates Youve made your own bed in California said Rep Sonny Callahan RAla who chairs the panels energy and water subcommittee Pelosis proposed costbased caps which would have expired in March would have been stricter than both the price restrictions that FERC ordered imposed in April and limits the agency plans to approve at a special meetin g next Monday Her proposal also would have allowed states to go to federal court to seek refunds for overcharges since June I think Republicans dont know how much damage they did to themselves today Pelosi told reporters afterward Theyve voted in favor of the gougers In a subsequent interview she said it was as if Republicans had been lini ng up to drink KoolAid a reference to the poisoned drink used in the Jonestown mass suicide and murder in Guyana Pelosis amendment was among several energy proposals by Democrats that the GOPcontrolled committee shot down as it approved a billion measure providing extra money this fiscal year mostly for the Pentagon In other largely partyline votes the panel defeated Democratic amendments that would have doubled the bills money for energy assistance for the poor to million added million for hydroelectricity improvements and provided million to support loans to improve the capacity of transmission grids Its pure demagoguery House Majority Whip Tom DeLay RTexas said in a brief interview regarding the Democratic amendments If Democrats had an energy policy theyd have had one in the last eight years They have no credibility on this issue whatsoever They are responsible for the energy crunch more than anybody I know Spotlighting the high political stakes House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt DMo took the unusual step of issuing a written statement about the committees energy votes He said President Bush and Republicans are committed to helping the Big Energy special interests and accused them of obstruction Republicans from California and other Western states voted with few exceptions against the Democratic energy proposals underlining the degree to which the response to the regions energy crisis has become a partisan issu e Many in the GOP support Bushs emphasis on increasing energy production and argue that price caps will prompt supply shortages A lot of these are put there to try to save the governors political donkey Rep Randy Duke Cunningham RCalif said speaking in an interview about the Democratic amendments California Gov Gray Davis a Democrat has repeatedly demanded that the federal government cap wholesale electricity prices Bush opposes the idea Rep JC Watts of Oklahoma chairman of the House Republican Conference said Thursday at a natural gas industry luncheon Price caps do not addres s the core issues of high energy prices and volatility They will lead to rationing and blackouts During the debate over the price cap amendment DeLay placed blame for the power crisis on California officials This was the result of overgovernment regulation responding to environmental extremism and as a result limiting electricity supplies he said But Democrats accused the GOP of opposing action that could help suffering Californians If you think let them eat cake is your party motto be my guest said Rep David Obey DWis I dont think the American people will think much of that A subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee also has rejected a price cap proposal similar to Pelosis In other votes Thursday the Appropriations panel rejected an amendment by Rep Nita Lowey DNY to provide million to fight

Appropriations Committee wwwhousegovappropriations House members wwwhousegovhouseMemberWWWhtml Federal Energy Regulation Commission wwwfercgov Plan would allow private energy companies to own grid rights ASSOCIATED PRESS June SACRAMENTO The federal government has endorsed a plan that calls for private energy companies to purchase the rights of a key piece of Californias transmission grid The plan would allow those private companies to control the flow of electricity and charge transmission fees to any agency or utility wanting t o move power on the lines The US Department of Energy on Wednesday invited private energy companies to help pay for the expansion of the transmission grid known as Path an mile stretch of hightension wires in the Central Valley The wires can move about megawatts of power between Southern California and Silicon Valley and San Francisco Pacific Gas Electric owns the original lines and has been urged by state officials to expand the grids capacity The wires may become increasingly important this summer when rolling blackouts are expected Longterm contracts recently signed by the state an d power wholesalers are for electricity produced in Southern California but transported to Northern California through Path Gov Gray Davis has sought to outright purchase transmission grids owned by PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric Several power generators said Wednesday they didnt know whether they would pursue rights to the Path grid Expanding the grid will cost between and million and take two years to complete Companies have until July to express their interest to the federal government One company based in Washington DC has shown interest in Southern California Edisons grid TransElect executive vice president Robert L Mitchell said he plans to send a letter next week to Edison chief John Brys on offering to buy the grid for billion PUC to determine role in handling SoCal Edison deal By Justin Pritchard ASSOCIATED PRESS June SAN FRANCISCO Californias top power regulators are expected to decide Thursday what role they should play in handling a deal where Southern California Edison would sell its power lines to the state in an effort to avoid bankruptcy The fivemember California Public Utilities Commission faces a lengthy agenda but nothing will be more spotlighted than a series of proposals tha t would begin to clear the way for approval of a deal Gov Gray Davis struck with Edison on April But before the PUC will push through the deal its members must vote on whether they have legal authority over it said PUC President Loretta Lynch Davis on Wednesday warned that time is growing short for legislative action I believe the patience of Edisons creditors is wearing very thin he said Im beginning to see the same signs as with PGE before that utility declared bankruptcy Senate leader John Burton DSan Francisco said the Legislature and the public need to know exactly what is in the deal and would hold hearings on the it as soon as next week Davis and Edison signed a Memorandum of Understanding on April The commission plans to address several items in that MOU at the meeting Thursday including a decision on delaying a review of how much Edison charges customers for power until On Wednesday the PUC voted to approve a version of a deal that Edison struck with smaller generators called qualifying facilities It should le t these plants keep churning out power as they look to collect more than billion that PGE and Edison owe them Lynch said Small generators account for about onethird of the states daily power supply But many powered down because Edison and nowbankrupt PGE didnt p ay for months of power they used earlier this year The commissionapproved plan offers stable rates for five years to generato rs using wind solar geothermal or other renewable sources It also raises th e rates the utilities must pay to gasfired generators Small generators have said they will suspend their lawsuits against Edison for days if they receive back payments Under the deal Edison will pay at least percent of what it owes to qualifying facilities If they pay back what they owe us the lawsuits would be dismissed and the claims would be settled said Jerry Bloom a spokesman for the California Cogeneration Council which represents many small natural gasfired power generators Wednesdays vote should also help Californias power managers in their dail y search for enough power to avert more rolling blackouts during the summer Lynch said She said that while the small generators could have received a higher rate for their power by breaking their contracts and selling electricity on the open market the deal guarantees the states utilities will buy the power It gives them stability Lynch said Having the qualifying facilities on line this summer is so crucial In March the PUC ordered PGE and Edison to pay qualifying facilities for power delivered starting in April Since that cash began to flow many smal l generators have kickstarted their operations adding much needed power to the grid Davis called the PUC approval a substantial move forward But the qualifying facilities agreement the PUC approved Wednesday might fa ll apart if the Legislature doesnt approve a Davis larger rescue plan to buy Edisons transmission lines Lynch said she hopes to resolve most outstanding matters on the Edison agreement at a PUC meeting scheduled for June She called the day tim e frame Davis gave to resolve the issue arbitrary and said the PUC is pushi ng ahead at an amazingly quick pace Lynch said however that while Edison officials have pressured regulators to approve the deal they have not fully cooperated during PUC hearings She said that while Edison has not cooperated with PUC requests for information during hearings on the deal the utility has pressured the PUC to rubber stamp its agreement with Davis Edison officials objected to Lynchs assertion that the utility was less th an forthcoming saying any insinuation that it has not fully cooperated with a ll of the PUCs requests and investigations is wrong and offensive On the Net wwwcpuccagov Customers feel pain of energy surcharges By Frank Green UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June Roland Hogue is getting nickelanddimed to death by the energy crisis It seems that everywhere the retired General Dynamics worker shops these da ys be it the diner cleaners or florist hes forced to cough up a surcharge to help the business defray its soaring electricity costs Such incremental charges are separate of course from his home utility bil l which has more than doubled in the last year Its getting ridiculous said Hogue who was waiting yesterday afternoon in front of the Pacific Theatres at Grossmont Center to buy a ticket priced with an extra cent surcharge advertised on a nearby sign Im on a fixe d income I need every penny I can save California residents have for months endured rolling blackouts and spiking electricity rates Now theyre increasingly paying extra energy fees at the corner shop And many arent taking the drubbing in stride You can see the increased checks at Dominos where customers calling for pizza delivery are warned in a recorded message that a cent energy surcharge will be tacked onto their bill Or at parks like the San Diego Zo o extra per ticket and hotels such as the Hyatt Regency in La Jolla a perroom surcharge and the Sheraton Harbor Island We didnt have a choice because our gas and electric bill has gone from a month to a month Bruce Ross the manager at Boulevard Cleaners Laundry said about the cent utility surcharge the business recently added to each customer invoice We could have folded our costs in to the overall bill but we wanted our customers to know where the money was going The fee has been costly to Boulevard Several customers miffed by the charg e have picked up their clothes and stormed out for good Ross said A few companies have been forced to rescind their energy surcharge after negative reactions from customers Taco Bell for instance this week reluctantly withdrew the cent energy surcharge it imposed at some of its Southern California outlets on Friday after it was inundated with consumer complaints Taco Bell which did not specify how many stores issued the surcharges sai d it had added them to offset power cost increases Some people are getting nasty one local Dominos clerk said about the companys surcharge They cuss at you and hang up the phone San Diegobased Jack in the Box is among companies that have opted to raise prices instead of imposing surcharges Primarily because of higher energy costs the firm hiked the prices of its Jumbo Jacks and tacos by percent in the first quarter and is about to institute another round of price increases that will be lower than before spokeswoman Karen Bachmann said Increase temporary Analysts say many businesses are choosing the surcharge over raising prices because consumers understand that energy costs are soaring The surcharge also implies that the fee will be temporary Raising prices in this very competitive environment has been tough to do f or the last five years said George Whalin president of Retail Management Consultants in San Marcos By adding a surcharge retailers can package it and soften the blow Meanwhile consumers in other parts of the country likewise are beginning t o feel the pinch of energy surcharges especially at hotel chains Hotel officials say the surcharges are a temporary response to the higher costs of natural gas and electricity Hilton Hotels Corp Wyndham International Bass Hotels Resorts Inc Starwood Hotels Resorts Worldwide Inc and Marriott International have tacked on the surcharges to guests hotel bills in among other places Boston Chicago Dallas and Miami The highest fees have been in New York City where Marriott International recently was charging per room per night in all of its Manhattan hotels Charles Porter general manager of the Sheraton Steamboat Resort in Steambo at Springs Colo has so far resisted implementing a surcharge despite a percent jump in natural gas prices Porter said many large groups book their rooms months and even years in advance and changing the contract could lead to cancellations Were reacting to competitive conditions that change on a daily basis Porter said Costs jumped Porter said his gas and electric bills for January February and March totaled compared with during the same period last year Figures for April and May are not available because the hotel is closed tho se months You just dont budget for that Porter said Not only do hotels buy electricity from natural gaspowered generating plants they also use the fuel for heating cooking and laundering tons of linens every day Most chains have taken conservation measures including installing lowwattage light bulbs adjusting thermostats and cutting down on exterior lighting Some suggest to guests who are staying multiple nights that they not have their towels and bed linens changed each day Right now the costs are so astronomical that we have to take other steps a s well and add the surcharge said

this report Frank Greens email address is His phone number is Chula Vista to get larger peakuse power plant By Amy Oakes UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June The California Energy Commission yesterday approved plans for a megawatt peakuse power plant to be built in Chula Vista despite the citys objections Ramco Inc will begin construction of the natural gasfired combustion turbine generator by June at the companys site at Main St said Dale Mesple a Ramco consultant The location already houses a megawatt peakuse plant The new facility must be operational by Sept according to Gov Gray Davis emergency procedure for siting plants This is the th license granted for plants that will only be used during peak periods when power supplies are low according to the governors Web site Chula Vista having already approved plans for the companys first peakuse plant in September opposed the additional facility citing increases in noise and air pollution The commission in response directed Ramco to comply with the special landuse conditions placed on the megawatt plant The larger plant must conform to all applicable local state and federal landuse requirements including general plan policies zoning regulations and local development standards The commission also required Ramco to extend a planned sound wal l completely around the facility Mesple said it will not be a problem to extend the wall which was going to be built on the southern side of the acre site and to follow the federal state and local regulations applied to the first plant Im meeting all of the same requirements and qualifications as I would hav e if I had applied through the city Mesple said Councilwoman Patty Davis said it is good that Ramco will have to follow previous regulations such as a decibel noise level threshhold but she still feels the additional plant should not be built here Really I feel like weve done our fair share Davis said referring to th e approval of the first peakuse plant and the South Bay Power Plant But with the governors orders we dont really have any choice The governor in February gave the commission authority to fasttrack peaku se plants that could be operating by Sept Under his plan proposals would be exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act review process Mesple has said the company had not planned to expand its Chula Vista facility until the governors order that reduced a normally to month process to days Ramco submitted a complete application with the commission May The commission held a public hearing and site tour eight days later The city held its

warmwater request By Terry Rodgers UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June Duke Energy which operates the South Bay Power Plant yesterday withdrew i ts request to increase the temperature of its seawater

marine life including green sea turtles Appearing before the San Diego Regional Water Quality Board meeting at Chul a Vista City Hall Duke Energy executives said they were dropping their reque st because of a condition proposed by the boards staff The staff was willing to allow a higher temperature as long as Duke Energy would agree to pay to fix any environmental problems arising from the warmwater discharge That condition would require Duke Energy to write a potential blank check by making it responsible for unknown mitigation costs said company spokesm an Thomas C Williams No business could be expected to put itself through th at kind of uncertainty The South Bay plant which generates enough power for homes is allowed to discharge coolant water that is degrees warmer over a hou r average than the natural temperature of the bay The company had asked to increase the limit to degrees Duke executives said their request was made solely to comply with an executive order by Gov Gray Davis urging power companies to generate as mu ch electricity as possible to minimize the likelihood of rolling blackouts thi s summer Raising the temperature limits of the plants coolant water would have enabled it to produce more power during offpeak hours The plant already operates at maximum levels during peak hours when energy is most in demand and that wont change the company

Electricity was cheap and companies routinely won rate hikes to cover their costs burying theft in catchall categories such as line losses according to Lee Cordner a former Pacific Gas Electric manager and now an energy consultant in San Rafael Calif They just charge everyone else more to make up for it Cordner said Now that generation costs are soaring regulators and consumer watchdo gs are

political pressure mounts By RICARDO ALONSOZALDIVAR Times Staff Writer WASHINGTONThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is clearly heedin g external politics as it prepares for a larger role in Californias power crisis but the biggest catalyst for change may be within its walls On the outside a new Democratcontrolled Senate and powerful Republicans in the House have been clamoring for more assertive interventio n But inside two pragmatists recently appointed by President Bush to FERCs fivemember governing board have already compromised the laissezfai re course that Chairman Curtis L Hebert Jr had set for the small insular agency FERCs new power crisis policy to be unveiled at a special board meeting Monday is expected to move closer to the fixed price caps sought b y California leaders FERCs version would allow electricity prices in the We st to move up and down significantly but with upper limits However the plan was still a subject of intense internal debate Thursday at FERC Even after its expected approval by the FERC board it mu st survive additional rounds of political and technical vetting by other key players in the power crisis As California has already learned tinkering with power markets is no easy task and todays solutions can swiftly turn into tomorrows unintende d consequences For Hebert a proud Mississippian and avid freemarket advocate growing impatience with FERC on Capitol Hill is not the only problem He risks losing a working majority on his own commission if the two new member s ally themselves with dissenter William L Massey in favor of stronger intervention That would isolate and embarrass Hebert who is already in a difficult spot because of persistent rumors that Bush will replace him as chairman with newly appointed Commissioner Patrick H Wood III What we see here is someone who is a strong noninterventionist Republican who has found himself in a position where he has to abandon that to some extent said James J Hoecker immediate past FERC chairman in the Clinton administration Chairman Hebert doesnt have to be a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing FERC which functions like a national public utility commission is charged by law with assuring just and reasonable rates for wholesale electricity Last year the commission made a formal finding that prices in California were neither But the modest price mitigation measures it adopted were widely criticized as mere nibbling around the edges Not so says Hebert I dont think there is any doubt that the commissions plan is working and is bringing down prices he told reporter s this week He condemned what he called the ideology of price caps The two new FERC members Wood and Nora M Brownell have not offered ringing endorsements of FERCs actions to date During Senate confirmation hearings last month they indicated they favored closer tighter scrutiny o f industry Wood past chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission and a confidant of the president signaled in interviews that a return to regulation would be preferable to dysfunctional markets that deprive consumers of the benefits of competition No tool is off the table even if its a bad tool Wood told the PBS program Frontline The two newcomers sounded more like Massey the commissions lone inhouse critic than like Hebert the market purist In April when the commission first adopted price limits Massey pointed out flaws that FERC n ow seems poised to address For one he said the limits only applied during power emergencies T he evidence is persuasive that the problem of unfair prices exists hours a day seven days a week Massey said I have no confidence that prices wil l be just and reasonable during all hours Masseys view was voiced by many others as Wood prepared to assume his new job on the panel Wood told The Times in an interview that he heard complaints from Republicans as well as Democrats Prominent among the Republicans demanding more aggressive action by FE RC is Rep Doug Ose of Sacramento author of a bill calling for roundthecloc k price limits throughout the West Massey was no longer a voice in the wilderness In fact how he votes and what he says Monday will be closely watched on Capitol Hill and in California particularly by Democrats looking for an early signal of the plans credibility His viewpoint is considered very highly said Howard Gantman a spokesman for Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif As Masseys stock rose Heberts portfolio was in growing jeopardy The Democratic changeover in the Senate improved the prospects of pric e cap legislation introduced by Feinstein and Sen Gordon Smith ROre Fix ed price caps are anathema to Bush as well as Hebert but may prove politically unstoppable if California electricity costs spiral out of control this summ er The debate has changed from doing nothing to mitigation to doing something punitive said one FERC official who requested anonymity Running out of maneuvering roomand perhaps time as chairmanHebert decided to make a bold move On Monday he announced that he would convene a special commission meeting for next Monday to strengthen FERCs price mitigation plan for California and the West Price mitigation appears to be a way to avoid using the words price cap or costbased rate which some members of the Bush administration fi nd objectionable Feinstein said Frankly I dont care what they call it as long as they get the job done FERC sources said the options being discussed include roundtheclock price limits throughout the West requiring all generators in the region to sell available power during emergencies establishing a framework for large power users to sell back electricity at peak times and tightening rules on energy traders On Tuesday leading House Republicans sent a letter to Hebert endorsin g Oses pricelimit approach giving Hebert some cover on the political right Even if a political compromise can be worked out within FERC more difficulties are bound to arise Thorny technical problems must be addresse d For example Generators have complained that FERCs current price limits force them to sell some power below cost currently no framework exists fo r setting price limits throughout the Western region and FERC has no authori ty over large public generators such as the Bonneville Power Administration Former FERC Chairman Hoecker said Heberts gradual metamorphosis resembles that of California Gov Gray Davis who at first swore he would n ot accept rate increases for consumers Its kind of creeping reform Hoecker said FERC didnt do the most aggressive thing firstjust like the governor of California Everybody is sidling into it incrementally a little bit at a time State Objects to Power Pricing Formula Energy Air

Energy Regulatory Commission which took effe ct May places a limit on how much generators can charge when the states electricity reserves are depleted The price is based in part on the maximu m cost incurred by any of them to generate a megawatt of electricity State cleanair officials object to that pricing formula In addition to fuel and labor costs power companies can include prices paid for air pollution credits as well as the penalties and fees assessed for producing excessive emissions from power plants running to keep the lights on Air quality officials are concerned that may entice companies to manipulate the price of the credits in order to inflate their overall base costs thereby raising the profit bar for everyone The issue is crucial because FERC is scheduled Monday to consider expanding the price limits to all time periods Nobody else that we can figure out would benefit from this but power generators said Barbara Baird legal counsel for the South Coast Air Quali ty Management District The power companies would all be able to recover that cost regardless of whether they actually incurred that cost Ironically power plants no longer are required to buy and sell credit s to exceed the standards after Gov Gray Davis granted them special relief earlier this year Nonetheless power companies among others continue to actively trade the credits on the open market That practice air quality officials say is driving up the costs of the credits and making it harder for other industries to buy them Because of increased electricity generation the price of pollution credits traded in the Los Angeles region has risen astronomically in the pa st year Credits that traded for about cents per pound of pollution a few years ago now fetch roughly per pound Mike Scheible deputy executive officer for the state Air Resources Board says the federal order also creates incentives for generators to use highpolluting equipment which is more expensive to operate in order to boost the amount they can charge for electricity when rate limits affect pricing Its unfair to make California ratepayers pay more for electricity to mitigate their emissions It doesnt pass the straightface test for being fair Scheible said Since California power prices began to escalate last year third parti es have bought pollution credits and then sold them back to the power companie s at a steep profit air quality managers told state senators at a hearing Thursday Carol Coy deputy executive officer at the AQMD said one company Phoenixbased Pinnacle West reported a air emissions credit purchase on March then sold the same credits March for million Company spokesman Alan Bunnell said the transaction was perfectly lega l and not dissimilar from other trades that routinely occur in the emissions trading market But state Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana chairman of the Senate select committee inquiring into the matter said wholesalers often blame the cost of the credits in part for the high price of electricity He said he is concerned that there has been a laundering of NOx nitrogen oxide credits thats driving up the cost of both the credits and electricity Nitrogen oxide is a smogforming gas caused by fuel combustion It actually would be beneficial for energy companies to have those smog credit costs go higher said state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey Air quality officials aired their objections on Thursday before Dunns committee which is investigating whether companies manipulated California power prices for greater profits after the state deregulated electricity in In recent weeks it has begun to subpoena documents from various ener gy companies and utilities The federal order regulating prices has been widely criticized in California as full of loopholes that will allow power producers to continue making exorbitant profits During official power emergencies spurred by shortages of electricity it requires generators to charge prices based on a complex formula that includes pollution mitigation costs and the price of natural gas Air quality officials have also filed objections with FERC The federa l regulator has been reluctant to interfere in the energy crisis and has continued to defend the free market as a solution to the states power problems but it is under increasing pressure to act The state Senate committee known as the Select Committee to Investiga te Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market was also expected to hea r testimony Thursday from Southern California Edison However in a turn of events that surprised and angered lawmakers the utility refused to send a witness It also sent a letter stating it would not comply with a formal request to produce documents At present our companys resources are devoted to survival a compa ny lawyer wrote adding that our law department is stretched to the limit Refineries may keep chugging in outages PUC looks to grant blackout exemption Kelly St John Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Demands by the states oil refineries for protection from rolling blackouts should be met a member of the state Public Utilities Commission said yesterday in releasing a draft decision to grant the exemption While the recommendation from PUC Commissioner Carl Wood still faces a full hearing by the fivemember PUC later this month oil industry officials consider it a promising development in their intense lobbying campaign to keep refineries running This is a very good step said Scott Folwarkow spokesman for the Valero refinery in Benicia which has no backup generators to use in blackouts W e do play an essential role and the refinery needs to be protected The industry has repeatedly issued warnings that gasoline prices would soar if refineries were hit by rolling power blackouts Power interruptions of just an hour can send refineries out of commission for days shrinking gas supplies and leading to higher prices Earlier this month San Franciscobased Chevron Corp warned that it would reduce gasoline production at its two California refineries unless it was exempted from power outages Gov Gray Davis has also urged the PUC to designate petroleum refineries as essentialuse customers who are exempt from blackouts because their services are needed for public health and safety A Davis spokesman declined comment on the draft decision last night Skillednursing facilities and water agencies have joined oil refineries in intense lobbying for the essentialuse designation But the PUC has a limited number of exemptions it can offer to businesses By the agencys own standard at least percent of the electrical load mu st be exposed to blackouts Today half of the load is already exempt leaving just a percent margin to divide between facilities Yesterday a PUC administrative law judge issued a companion ruling asking energy producers the California Energy Commission and electric utilities t o provide additional information on fossil fuel production The PUC will consider that information along with public comment when it votes on Woods draft decision June While the economic impacts caused by disruption of fossil fuel production are potentially devastating Wood said the commission must balance these economic impacts against the potential impacts on public health and

roundtheclock Carolyn Lochhead Chronicle Washington Bureau Thursday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Washington Federal regulators are poised to impose roundtheclock price restrictions on wholesale electricity sold to California a move short of what Democrats have urged but far stronger than what the Bush administratio n has for months indicated it was willing to do The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected Monday to extend its April order which limits prices generators can charge during power emergencies to apply at all times and across the entire Western region sources inside the agency confirmed yesterday FERC also is expected to increase market monitoring expand refunds for overcharges by generators during power emergencies and order generators to sell into the Western grid during power emergencies among other things FERC Commissioner William Massey a Democratic appointee who strongly dissented from the April order because he believed it was too narrow would not comment on the expected action other than to say he had been urging greater intervention relentlessly for some time Although power prices are plunging for the first time since the crisis bega n Massey said it was too soon to declare victory We dont know whats going to happen in the next hour or tomorrow or the next month Massey said We are certain this is a market short of power plants Supply and demand are not in reasonable equilibrium and when that is true prices can soar at the drop of a hat and the wealth transfer can b e exorbitant Massey said that until supply and demand came into reasonable balance in California which he expects to occur in months to two years as new powe r plants come on line there has got to be hoursaday sevendaysaweek price mitigation in effect to protect consumers period The expected FERC action coincides with rising political pressure on the agency from Democrats and increasing numbers of Republicans to intervene mo re forcefully in Californias power market despite fierce resistance to price controls from the Bush administration REINFORCEMENTS That pressure ratcheted up sharply when Democrats assumed control of the Senate and began scheduling legislation to order FERC to impose price caps The agencys move also coincides with the arrival of two new Bush appointee s Patrick Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell who are widely viewed as more receptive to intervention than the current chairman Curt Hebert a Republican appointed by former President Bill Clinton and named chairman by President Bush The agencys April order which took effect May puts a ceiling on price s pegged to the least efficient power plant It has been applied during two power emergencies so far Experts are divided on how much if any effect t he order has contributed to the recent sharp drop in prices Many factors fro m cool weather to increased conservation to the return of several nuclear generators that were down for maintenance are also at work Rep Doug Ose a Sacramento Republican who first pushed FERC to expand its April order said yesterday he believed the expected new action would provi de a pretty good middle ground between Democrats call for a specific maximu m price or cap the generators can charge and the Bush administrations opposition to price controls Rep Darryl Issa an Oceanside Republican added that the agencys action w as part of a pattern of escalating engagement by the administration and a more activist FERC AS LONG AS IT WORKS Sen Dianne Feinstein said the action expected Monday was likely to fall short of what she wanted although she called it another step forward While FERC is likely to avoid using the words price caps to describe its plan it called its original order price mitigation Feinstein said I dont care what you call it as long as it works Feinstein testifying yesterday at a Government Affairs Committee hearing o n energy said she believed the new order would still permit price manipulati on because the caps are set at the price charged by the least efficient therefore highest cost and most polluting generators Feinsteins bill to force FERC to impose price caps until is scheduled for committee action this month She wants firm price caps based on each generators costs much like the regulatory regime in place before Californias electricity restructuring Some economists argue however that the type of price controls FERC is expected to use more closely correspond to the price that a functioning market would produce Price caps have become the nexus of the entire Washington debate over Californias electricity crisis The Bush administration contends that pric e controls would make blackouts worse by discouraging electricity sales and investment while Democrats led by Feinstein and California Gov Gray Davi s contend that generators are deliberately withholding power to jack up price s OBJECTIONS TO CONTROLS WITHER Republicans on Capitol Hill many of whom face reelection next year have shown less resistance to price controls and that resistance melted even mo re yesterday after a letter from several House Republicans urged FERC to intervene more forcefully Still most of the Republicans now urging greater federal regulation of electricity markets hail from California Republicans from outside the stat e yesterday blasted Davis for mishandling the crisis and blaming the Bush administration for not helping The efforts to place the blame on the current administration or hire a month consultants to spin the issue do not help said Sen Fre d Thompson RTenn referring to two highpriced political aides Davis has hired Some suggest temporary price controls through Thompson said While that may get us through the next election temporary price controls have rarely stayed temporary Sen Larry Craig an Idaho Republican argued there were a host of reasons for Californias blackouts from a drought in the Northwest to a shortage o f power plant construction across the West Leave it to politicians running scared and looking for scapegoats to obfuscate this otherwise obvious reality Craig said Put simply and bluntly this reality does not suit the political needs of Gov Davis and his compatriots Energy at a glance Energyrelated developments yesterday PUC TELLS EDISON TO PAY OF BILL OWED TO SMALL FIRMS Small companies that need cash to continue generating power will be paid percent of their back bills by Southern California Edison under an order passed yesterday by the state Public Utilities Commission The measure is one of the remedies designed to ensure that small power plants stick with their contracts to sell electricity to Californias three cashstrapped utilities Pacific Gas and Electric Co has already been ordered by a bankruptcy judge to pay percent of its back debt to its sma ll generators San Diego Gas and Electric Co had no outstanding bills The commission also opened the door to higher rates for small suppliers tha t can prove their operating costs are not being covered by a state payment formula Others can opt for a new fixedrate contract All can earn higher

of the longterm deals should be disclose d and whether shortterm energy contracts should be released over Davis opposition Since the state started buying power for customers of Californias reeling utilities in January Davis has refused to make the contracts public sayin g disclosure would reveal the states negotiating strategies give power sellers an advantage and drive prices up In court documents the governor s lawyers said the information should remain secret until January when the states current power purchasing authority expires News organizations including The Chronicle and eight Republican legislato rs sued for disclosure saying the documents were public records that would le t Californians evaluate the spending of billions of tax dollars On Tuesday Davis reversed course and said he was willing to make public immediately the details of billion in longterm contracts with suppliers if the judge released the state from confidentiality agreements i n the contracts The governor said that market conditions had improved and th at enough contracts had been signed that disclosure would not seriously damage the states bargaining position He gave reporters a few more details yesterday acknowledging that the stat e was locked into some longterm contracts at prices above those now availabl e on the spot market We were paying a lot more in January and February than we are now on the spot market because we have dramatically shrunk the spot market providing reliable power for California at affordable rates Davis said In court yesterday however Deputy Attorney General Timothy Muscat sought to delay contract disclosure two weeks to give the energy sellers who are n ot parties to the lawsuit time to comment But the judge said the states failure to keep contracting companies abreas t of the suit did not justify delaying disclosure Quinn ordered the longter m contracts released Friday after the state deletes details that would reveal suppliers trade secrets and other proprietary information Muscat said the state would edit out several categories of information he described as technical including energy delivery points and data on suppliers efficiency in converting natural gas to electricity News media lawyer Alonzo Wickers IV protested any deletions Keeping those socalled technical issues secret thwarts the publics understanding of the

get much easier than this Pull a plug Flip a switch If you dislike utilities like the environment or know anyone who does you might already have received an email call to Roll Your Own Blackout for three hours next week on the day of the summer solstice Flocks of anonymous emails have been swooping across the Internet for week s promoting the handrolled voluntary blackout aimed at fostering conservation It is a phenomenon that points out just how deeply energy issues have worme d into the national consciousness as well as how much the Internet has becom e the worlds water cooler and its bulletin board The messages urge people everywhere to turn out their lights and unplug wha t they can from to pm Thursday creating a dip in energy use that woul d roll across time zones part protest

very least her lights and television will be off Its beautiful outside now Its nice to sit on the porch As it gets dark er I dont mind using a flashlight to read and spend some time with my partner and our new kitties she said Nyborg a hightech recruiter who calls herself a quiet activist sai d shell be taking part to demonstrate that people can come together to conserve I take great offense at President Bushs comment that its our right as Americans to waste fuel I dont think it is Were also stewards of the planet she said David Aragon a Berkeley engineer who says he coined the phrase Roll Your Own Blackout online for a similar protest said the idea had its roots in politics but is nonpartisan He said he just learned this week that Los Angeles artist Monica Rex was th e one who expanded his notion scheduled it for the first day of summer and sent it out into the world Rex said she emailed a few paragraphs to about friends in midApril and posted them on a handful of Web sites to make people aware that they have t he power over how energy is used She thought so little of it at the time that she didnt keep a copy I didnt know it would get anywhere actually she said But it took off By midMay multiple copies were landing in email boxes of nearly everyone with environmental or energy interests An organic farming public relations firm publicized it further saying millions of people had been alerted Newspapers from Seattle to Denver began writing about the anonymous upswelling Web pages sprang up dedicated to it Everyone I know has seen it This has swept the globe said Jeff Softley a West Hollywood bartender and longtime environmentalist who has tried for mo re than a decade to promote the idea of an Energy Fast on Earth Day Softley who knows a little about stirring up community action was so stru ck by how quickly the message moved that he speculated a big environmental gro up was probably behind it trying to appear grassroots I just think it caught peoples imagination said Rex I am just amazed at how things move around the Internet She theorizes that her name was stripped off early in the forwarding process making it appear anonymous wh en she had no particular interest in either hiding from the idea or in promoti ng it It really doesnt take much to bring a single idea to millions of people said David Goff a University of Southern Mississippi professor who coedit ed the book Understanding the Web When you get it in the hands of likeminded people it doesnt take long f or that multiplier effect to operate and it will go very far very fast he said Email and Webdriven protests have triggered fuel boycotts in Great Brita in and Internet boycotts in France Goff said and were in the early stages of this The whimsical blackout message circulated in several versions calls o n people turn off what they can then light a candle to the sun god kiss an d tell make love tell ghost stories do something instead of watching television have fun in the dark Many versions say the voluntary blackout a simple protest and a symboli c act is being held to protest Bushs disdain for conservation energy efficiency and alternative fuels Some variants direct people to books on alternative energy and energy efficiency Some say the candle should burn for the sun goddess Some add a gentle caution to unplug only what can be safely dispensed with Michael Straus of Point Reyes said he plans to take part by having a candlelight dinner with his parents Straus whose Beyond Organic PR firm helped tout the idea said he put the message out over a public interest an d academic news wire after it kept landing in his mailbox The message has zinged from state to state and reportedly reached Europe an d Asia It has hit email lists devoted to everything from feminism to usedbook sellers A Texas newspaper credited it to a river protection grou p called American Rivers something the flattered but bemused organization denied Millions of people would have to be involved for their efforts to show up o n the computers of the California Independent System Operator in Folsom whic h constantly monitors electricity use to match demand with supply If million households turned off a single watt light bulb at once megawatts would drop off the states electric grid probably not noticeab le amid or so megawatts of early evening demand said Jim Detmers an I SO vice president But to megawatts of reduced demand might be detectable under the right conditions if sudden changes in wind or temperatures or cloud cover dont obscure the effect he said Computer engineer Aragon said he has no idea how many people will turn off and tune out June Thats almost like speculating on the spot price of electricity he said I wouldnt touch it The Bees Carrie Peyton can be reached at or New pacts could ease blackouts Edison crafts fiveyear deals to help relieve the fiscal burden on its alternative energy suppliers By Jim Sanders Bee Capitol Bureau Published June In a move that could help ease blackouts this summer Southern Califo rnia Edison has negotiated fiveyear deals designed to relieve the financial burden on its alternative energy suppliers Gov Gray Davis hailed the pacts which state officials helped negoti ate as an important step toward stabilizing the energy market and ending litigatio n over about billion owed by Edison The move also could help taxpayers cutting up to million off th e states energy tab this year by reducing the amount of power needed from th e expensive spot market officials said The agreements apply specifically to Edisons suppliers however and do not resolve similar disputes involving Pacific Gas and Electric Co The pacts also add a new twist to an ongoing dispute over Davis bid to save Edison from bankruptcy by buying its transmission lines for billion a nd providing other financial incentives Davis warned at a press conference Wednesday that rates promised in t he pacts are tied to legislative approval of the rescue plan I believe given the changed circumstances that legislators will ta ke a different look at the plan he said Im not saying its a certainty b ut Im saying theres now renewed interest Senate President John Burton ridiculed the governors assertion and m ade it clear he wont be pressured There are an awful lot of questions here and I think it ill behoove s the governor who has not always moved with alacrity to say that the Legislatu re is dragging its hands on this issue Burton said Legislators currently are crafting one or more alternatives to the go vernors rescue plan which they say has little support in the Assembly or Senate Southern California Edison a massive private utility declined comme nt Wednesday on the QF qualified facilities agreements or the governor s rescue plan California taxpayers have spent billions of dollars since January buy ing power on behalf of Edison and another financially strapped private utility PGE One major problem for Edison has been the billion debt owed to f irms that generate alternative energy from wind geothermal solar biomass and gasfired cogeneration facilities As debts rose each week some QFs were forced to quit producing elect ricity thus exacerbating the energy crisis and forcing California to buy more powe r on the spot market Statewide most of the alternative energy providers though still fin ancially strapped have resumed production The new Edison pacts would add to megawatts of new electricit y by enticing suppliers to exceed existing contracts They would provide a mechanism for repaying Edisons debts to the alt ernative energy firms They also promise separate rates for electricity from renewab le sources and gasfired facilities Key parts of the deal include Rates for electricity produced by gasfired plants would vary based o n the cost of natural gas at the CaliforniaArizona border Edison would pay cents per kilowatthour plus a capacity charge for energy produced by wind solar and other renewable energy sources The firm would pay an estimated to cents per kilowatthour depen ding on natural gas costs for electricity produced by gasfired plants The pacts give Edison and the owners of gasfired cogeneration facili ties the ability to renegotiate if market conditions change dramatically The initial reaction from a number of firms has been favorable

a former member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission will participate in their first meeting Monday when the panel meets in an unusual session on California rates Among those most heartened

Hebert ASSOCIATED PRESS June WASHINGTON Under growing political pressure federal regulators are preparing new but still limited price restrictions for electricity in California and other Western states according to government officials Congressional and private industry sources said the Federal Energy Re gulatory Commission is almost certain at a meeting next week to expand a price mitigation directive to cover all transactions in California and expand it to other states including the Pacific Northwest The limited price caps announced in April now apply only to Califor nia and only to periods when a supply emergency is in effect because power reserves have fallen below percent California Gov Gray Davis has called them inadequate and full of loopholes for power generators to skirt controls Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif told a Senate hearing it now appear s that the April order will be broadened She said it was another step forward b ut far short of the costbased price caps she and other congressional Democrat s have sought Several other sources speaking on condition of anonymity also said they expected the FERC to broaden the April order The commission chairman Curtis Hebert said price mitigation issues will be discussed at its Monday meeting The fivemember commission of three Republicans and two Democrats has come under attack from Democrats in Congress and from Davis They contend the agency has been far too timid in curtailing price gouging in the wholesale Western power markets The commission regulates wholesale electricity markets and interstate natural gas pipelines Under a law it is required to ensure prices are just a nd reasonable Hebert a Republican named as chairman by President Bush in January defended the agency at an energy forum Wednesday Our price mitigation plan is working said Hebert citing recent de clines in electricity and natural gas prices in California and elsewhere in the West Acknowledging the criticism he said of the FERC Were not the most popular people in town right now This week electricity prices on the spot market in California fell t o below a megawatthour for the first time this year Natural gas prices also eased Earlier year price have frequently surpassed a megawatt hour t en times what they were in precrisis A megawatt is enough electricity to serve about homes California officials have said it is too early to tell how the FERCs April order has affected prices The reason for the price drops is unclear Feinstein said She noted that Californias attorney general this week announced plans for a grand jury to consider criminal charges against some power generators and marketers Also Wednesday several economists told a Senate hearing that tempora ry price controls if structured properly should not impede electricity investments and supplies as Republican lawmakers and the administration repeatedly have argued It is incorrect that regulation necessarily interferes with supplies Cornell economist Alfred Kahn a prominent deregulation advocate told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee It was the Senates first hearing on Californias energy crisis since Democrats recently took power Kahn said that if price caps were temporary exempted new power plant s and provided sufficient profits there will be no shortage of people intereste d and willing to build new power plants The greatest danger is continued chaos said Paul Joskow an econom ist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology He too urged some price contro ls based on costs of production Sen Fred Thompson RTenn said the economists were painting a ro sy picture He read letters from several Wall Street analysts who insisted th at price controls would be a recipe for disaster and make investors reluctan t to enter the

Governor plans to release details on states power purchases By Don Thompson ASSOCIATED PRESS June SACRAMENTO California signed longterm electricity contracts at prices higher than those now available on the daily spot market Gov Gray Davis acknowledged Wednesday as a judge ordered him to release the pacts details But Davis said the longterm contracts between the state and power generato rs helped break the price spiral that had driven electricity prices to record heights Critics said other factors played a larger role in what they warned is a temporary price drop and said Davis foolishly locked in longterm rates at the markets peak The price the spot market on electricity is coming down because weve locked in longterm contracts Davis said This is Economics We were paying a lot more in January and February than we are now on the spot market because we have dramatically shrunk the spot market providing reliable power for California at affordable rates By next month the state will have to buy less than half the power it needs on the daily market making the generators compete for a smaller share of t he market and forcing prices down he said Davis said that will stabilize a wildly fluctuating market for the long ter m although the cost may exceed market costs in years to come The contracts along with new plants more conservation criminal and regulatory investigations into price gouging and possible price caps have combined to cut costs Davis said Saying there will be a day of accounting for price gougers Davis also sa id a pincer effort from Sacramento and Washington forced energy producers to lower prices Davis appeared Wednesday as a San Diego superior court judge ordered the state to release the contract details by noon Friday Several news organizations and Republican Assemblyman Tony Strickland RThousand Oaks sued Davis saying the contracts used state money and shou ld be open to the public For months Davis had refused to do so saying that would hurt the states negotiating position Earlier this week however he asked San Diego Superi or Court Judge Linda B Quinn to lift the confidentiality clauses in the contracts because the secrecy was no longer that important The contracts worth almost billion could keep longterm rates relatively high for years if the recent decline in prices remains in place Contract records obtained by the Los Angeles Times showed the state is committed to buying power at prices up to a megawatthour during peak demand periods and more than for power at times when demand is low By comparison the state recently bought peak power for less than an hour and less than an hour at night when demand is less Wholesale prices have dropped recently but they could rise this summer whe n temperatures and air conditioning use climb Energy analysts agreed with Davis that a convergence of factors led to lowe r prices not just the longterm contracts Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute called the prices in the states contracts disturbingly high compared to those available a few years ago but the state didnt have much choice In essence Borenstein said the contracts mean California now pays its hig h power bill on an installment plan in which generators agree to string out their profits over years instead of recouping them now But Peter Navarro an economist at the University of California Irvine sa id the Davis administration negotiated from a position of severe weakness Th ey generators had us over a barrel and they stuck it to us Davis Navarro said adopted a longterm strategy to fight a shortterm crisis The administration will look particularly foolish if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission acts next week to rein in higher power prices after months of refusing to intervene Navarro said This is a huge mistake thats been made by the state and whats being show n here is the depth of it said Assemblyman David Cogdill RModesto who supported Stricklands suit In effect we locked in an energy crisis for the next years said Harv ey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights He called fo r Attorney General Bill Lockyer to toss out any contracts he determines overcharge the state Davis energy adviser S David Freeman former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said the contracts altered the marketplace a nd freed the state from its nearly total reliance on the volatile spot market The war aint over Freeman said but we have landed on enemy territory and we are rolling them back Draft of blackout plan offers forecasts instead of warnings By Jennifer Coleman ASSOCIATED PRESS June SACRAMENTO In May Gov Gray Davis announced a plan to give California ns detailed warnings of rolling blackouts to help businesses and residents pla n for outages But a draft of the plan obtained by The Associated Press has changed the proposed onehour blackout warning to a probability forecast which one utility official called a vague warning thats wrong more often than its right The onehour notice is expected to be wrong twothirds of the time because the Independent System Operator will continue to look for power to keep the lights on said several people who participated in meetings to plan the blackout notifications Under Davis plan the ISO manager of the states power grid will also issue a hour rolling blackout forecast and the hour location notification Peter Navarro an economist with University of California Irvine who works on energy issues called the onehour blackout notice a very blunt instrument Its going to be like the typical California forecast sunny hot and dry with a chance of rolling blackouts Navarro said How do you prepare for that The Governors Office of Emergency Services coordinated the plan to impleme nt Davis order by consulting private and municipal utilities the ISO and the Public Utilities Commission The plan will be presented to Davis by Friday Even after the issuing the minute blackout notice the state will keep looking for lastminute power said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle Th e public knows the ISO doesnt have a crystal ball but it can provide information to help them make critical decisions A utility official who participated in the calls and who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the onehour blackout probability forecast doesnt come anywhere close to whats been promised to the public Instead of a real onehour notice of an outage that people can rely on and make plans for theyre just going to get another vague warning thats goin g to be wrong far more often than its right the executive said The utilities will make the biggest differences in handling blackouts said Steve Conroy a spokesman for Southern California Edison which participate d in one of the conference calls There is more advance notice from the utilities to our customers Conroy said Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Co have joined Pacific Gas and Electric Co in assigning customers a block number so they will know what neighborhood are next to be hit by a blackout The newest element thats required is to make geographic information available to the public It was already available to public safety offices said John Nelson spokesman for PGE Blackout forecasts Conroy said are very much like a weather forecast an d subject to change McCorkle said forecasts will also encourage power conservation and further lessen the chance of blackouts Eric Lamoureux an emergency services spokesman said the plan isnt intend ed to predict a blackout but give a sense of when theyre likely Utility customers dont need a guarantee just a warning that blackouts cou ld occur said Michael Shames executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network The objective here is to allow customers to prepare for the eventuality of blackouts he said The people will not rebel if the lights stay on What we do need is more than minutes notice Jennifer Ng the owner of Moonlight Cleaners in Elk Grove said shed welco me two days notice for blackout It took her more than a week to catch up on work that a couple hours of blackouts halted at the dry cleaners she said It affects businesses more than people think Ng said If I had more warning I would be able to stay late the night before or bring in more people To really give a true blackout warning Shames said the ISO must draw the line and stop shopping for electricity to keep the lights on Plus Shames added repeated false alarms could lose their effectiveness Thats why they shouldnt be issued cavalierly Shames and Navarro have called for a price ceiling for lastminute power bu ys and a willingness to suffer blackouts in prices dont come down The Legislature is now considering a bill to allow state power buyers to stop shopping for power California governor to release details of states power purchases By Alexa Haussler ASSOCIATED PRESS June SACRAMENTO Gov Gray Davis is close to releasing details of longte rm contracts between the state and power generators a move that would end a lengthy battle over whether the agreements should remain confidential Davis for months had refused to release information on the contracts but h is aides said Tuesday the disclosure was expected this week The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that confidential government recor ds show state officials agreed to contracts at prices higher than those now being paid in the daily spot market The contracts which total nearly billion could burden consumers with relatively high utility rates if the recent trend toward lower electricity and natural gas prices continues Records obtained by the Times show the state is committed to buying power a t prices up to a megawatthour during peak demand periods and more than for power at times when demand is low In comparison the state recentl y purchased peak power for less than an hour and less than an hour a t night when demand dropped The recent purchases reflect a drop in wholesale prices which could rise again this summer when temperatures climb and air conditioning use surges The theme here is the governor embarked on a longterm strategy for a shortterm crisis Peter Navarro an economist at University of California Irvine told the Times They pretty much got this exactly wrong State officials defended the longterm contracts crediting the agreements with altering the marketplace The contracts also have freed the state from its nearly total reliance on the volatile spot market This was all a well thoughtthrough plan of action said Davis energy adviser S David Freeman former head of the Los Angeles Department of Wate r and Power The war aint over But we have landed on enemy territory and w e are rolling them back Republican lawmakers and several news organizations including The Associat ed Press sued Davis in March saying his refusal to release the contracts details violated the California Public Records Act Still Davis refused saying that revealing the details would put the state at a competitive disadvantage in other contract talks Oklahomabased Williams Energy one of the generators with a state contract opposes the release of the contract details Information contained in those is proprietary information that allows us t o be competitive and to bid competitively said spokeswoman Paula HallCollins Raymond Hart Department of Water Resources deputy director wrote power generators Monday saying the department would ask a judge Wednesday to thro w out a confidentiality provision in the contracts Meanwhile the Times also reported Wednesday that executives and board directors from power companies gained millions of dollars through stock sal es last year State

Stock prices for energy companies enjoyed robust growth last year Report Energy executives selling stock for millions ASSOCIATED PRESS June LOS ANGELES Executives and board directors from power companies that s tate officials accuse of profiteering from the energy crisis have gained million s of dollars through stock sales according to a newspaper report The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that these executives exercised options and sold stock for double triple and even times the level of prior years The newspaper based its findings on trading data supplied by First CallThomson Financial and federal regulatory findings Kenneth L Lay chairman of Enron netted million in option transactio ns in according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission The amount was triple his level and nearly times what he made in Lay also has made stock sales since November that have been worth nearly million Lay and other power company executives have shown a knack for timing their stock sales near the top of the market Many of the companies shares have fallen since the bulk of the stock sales the Times reported Critics claim corporate profits for the power companies have been driven up by the energy crisis in California and the West The crisis created a bull market for publicly traded power companies making the shares held by the executives particularly lucrative State officials were outraged but not surprised by the transactions It is part of a pattern of smart trading by these guys said state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey who chairs the Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee The mentality is to get everything that you can and then ride out the bust I think they are figuring that by this time next year the party will be ov er and they will be left sitting in a room with plastic cups halffilled with stale beer Bowen added The stock sales seemed logical to Loretta Lynch president of the Californi a Public Utilities Commission It stands to reason that if the companies are making exorbitant profits then the individuals who run the companies are also making exorbitant profits she said The power executives who sold stock dealt shares of the following companies Virginiabased AES Corp Duke Energy Corp of North Carolina the Houstonbased energy firms of Enron Corp and El Paso Corp and San Josebased Calpine Corp Jeffrey K Skilling CEO of Enron filed regulatory documents in May announcing his intention to sell shares of Enron stock for million Skilling in netted more than million in similar transactions Harvey Padewer president of Duke Energys Energy Services division sold Duke stock for million in February netting million State and federal agencies are investigating several large energy companies to determine if they conspired to boost prices either by limiting the construction of power plants or by manipulating the supply of natural gas needed to run power plants No one is claiming the stock trades were illegal but critics have linked t he transactions to the profits gained in California The generators have no shame said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov Gray Davis It speaks to how there has been a massive transfer of wealth from California and the West to Texas and the Southeast Lay and Enron officials declined to comment on stock trading by executives and a spokesman for AES also declined to comment on the matter A spokesman for Duke Energy said many of the sellers at Duke continue to ho ld large amounts of the companys stock and sold the their stock to capitalize on a healthy market Many of these people have a lot of stock and this is an opportuni ty to diversify their personal portfolios at an opportune time when Dukes sto ck is up said Terry Francisco a spokesman for Duke Energy News briefs on Californias power crisis ASSOCIATED PRESS June HUNTINGTON BEACH An energy company says a restriction prohibiting it f rom selling power generated at its California plants outofstate violates interstate commerce laws AES Corp filed a petition Monday with the California Energy Commission claiming the restriction should be withdrawn because it hinders the company s efforts to negotiate a contract with the state Department of Water Resource s which brokers power deals for the state AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said Tuesday that the two sides are close to an agreement and filing the petition was a backup if negotiations fail The Arlington Vabased company recently won approval from the states Energy Commission to restart two idle generators in Huntington Beach but were told it could only sell the megawatts produced at the Orange Count y plant to California utilities The yearold units which will reopen in August will generate percen t of the megawatts needed by the state to avoid rolling blackouts this summer Customers of SDGE may not get back million Money might be part of state deal to buy electric grid By Jeff McDonald UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER June Talks to allow state ownership of the poles and wires that push electricity across San Diego County have dragged on in numbing detail for months But with the deal between Gov Gray Davis and Sempra Energy extremely close local politicians and a consumer advocate fear its price will inclu de hundreds of millions of dollars that had been headed for ratepayers pocket s San Diego city and county officials took the unusual step yesterday of criticizing regulators and the parent company of SDGE for excluding them from secret negotiations State must bare secret energy deals FERC appears set to expand its price curbs Davis announces deal to boost summer power supply Continuing coverage Californias Power Crisis Mayor Dick Murphy meanwhile dispatched a letter to the president of the California Public Utilities Commission pleading to be invited to the table I need your assurance that the city will be permitted to actively participate in the formation of any proposed settlement the San Diego may or wrote The ratepayers of San Diego city and county deserve no less At stake more than million paid to SDGE by its million customers over recent months Utility company executives claim the cash should go to shareholders while local elected officials consumer advocates and even state regulators say t he money belongs to customers The disputed windfall accumulated over several months as SDGE used longterm contracts to buy power at one price then sell the electricity to consumers at a much higher rate Customers were billed the larger of the two costs a practice SDGE parent Sempra Energy said was appropriate even though SDGE has insisted for month s that under deregulation it merely distributes power Shareholders deserve to make money on contracts that they took the risk for said company spokesman Ed Van Herik who was unable to specify how mu ch electricity is bought and sold under the agreements SDGE may still be benefiting from the longterm deals it reached with Louisville Gas and Electricand Pacificorp The agreements ran between and the end of this year according to San Diego City Attorney Casey Gwinn Because of the litigation he was allowed to review the contracts but is not permitted to disclose their value There is a fundamental fairness principle that is at issue here Gwinn said Earlier this year state regulators ruled that the value of the contracts should help pay down a socalled balancing account some million SDG E says it spent on power but hasnt been allowed to collect from customers Utility company lawyers appealed that ruling and the case remains locked in litigation But in an apparent policy reversal the PUC last week joined Sempra in aski ng the appeals court to delay considering the claim while the governors offic e deals for the network of SDGE power poles and transmission lines Gwinns office was served notice of that filing Tuesday The value of the longterm contracts has become a critical issue in those executivelevel discussions which San Diego area politicians say is unfair Its a slap in the face county Supervisor Dianne Jacob said They charg ed us more and now theyre making a big profit Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers Action Network said a closeddoor deal between Davis and Sempra could undermine the PUC ruling that the SDGE contracts are ratepayer assets The PUC will never hear it the city of San Diego and UCAN will never get a chance to argue it in court he said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor is carefully weighing the plight of San Diego consumers as he pushes ahead with negotiations to buy t he SDGE electric grid Were extremely close to an agreement with the utility and first and foremost in the governors mind are the interests of San Diego ratepayers he said The deal is going to be a balanced business transaction Acquiring the poles and wires that move power across the state is a key pie ce of the governors plan to resolve the electricity crisis in California Dav is struck a deal with Southern California Edison but Pacific Gas and Electric declared bankruptcy in April so those assets are in dispute Even though transmission lines make money for the three investorowned utilities critics worry that buying the electric grid may not be wise because the system is old and in need of more than billion in upgrades PUC attorney Gary Cohen said he sympathizes with the San Diego County elect ed officials who first brought the complaint over the SDGE contracts to his office But ending the power struggle in California is more important If theres a deal those contracts are just one part of it Cohen said I understand their frustration The contracts are up on appeal and they won But in fairness everybody needs to wait and see what the whole resolution will be Discussions include not only talk of a price for SDGE transmission lines likely around billion according to Shames but also whether the utili ty adequately hedged its power purchases against rising costs and the reasonableness of other buying practices Theres a bunch of issues on the table Cohen said Its difficult and conceivably impossible to settle cases where you have a whole bunch of parties if everybody is insisting theyre part of the negotiations State Sen Dede Alpert whose September legislation established the balancing account now in dispute said she doesnt care who receives publ ic accolades for steering the value of the SDGE contracts to ratepayers I certainly expect this needs to be something that benefits the people of San Diego the Coronado Democrat said But whether the credit goes to the city of San Diego the PUC or the governor I dont think matters Vallejo City Council votes to switch work hours to save power ASSOCIATED PRESS June

claiming momentum toward solving the electricity crisis announced an agreement yesterday to keep unpaid small generators on line this summer Davis said a pincers movement from Washington DC and Sacramento is telling energy pricegougers that the days of figuratively raping and pillaging California are over and there will be an accounting Attorney General Bill Lockyer announced that a criminal grand jury will beg in meeting in Sacramento early next month to investigate whether the states electricity and natural gas markets were manipulated and whether illegal profits were made Davis also said he was optimistic about getting legislative approval of som e variation of his longstalled plan to keep Southern California Edison out o f bankruptcy Im not saying its a certainty Davis said But I am saying there is no w a renewed interest in ratifying something like the memorandum of understanding that we have worked out with Edison Davis said the Legislature can change the proposal but the amendments must be acceptable to him and to Edison The Senate is planning to begin hearing s on the Edison plan in a few weeks The governor said pressure on electricity suppliers is coming from investigations longterm contracts that have lowered spot market prices an d increased energy conservation by Californians Davis said pressure in Washington is coming from congressional hearings and the possibility that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will order regional price limits or refunds for overcharges in California The governor also said three new power plants could begin operating in the next days an apparent reference to Calpines megawatt plant near Yu ba City and its megawatt plant at Pittsburg and a megawatt Mission EnergyTexaco plant in Kern County The small nonutility generators that operate as qualifying facilities under a federal program are capable of providing about a quarter of the pow er needed by the state In March blackouts during two days were said to have resulted in part fr om small generators who were not operating because they had not been paid Dav is announced an agreement yesterday between Edison and its QF contractors The Davis administration thinks the agreement could produce an additional to megawatts of power a megawatt is enough for to homes thi s summer because some generators had previously contracted to sell less power than they are capable of producing Richard Katz a former assemblyman from Van Nuys asked by Davis to negotiat e the agreement said the QF contractors will receive an average of about cents per kilowatthour during the fiveyear contracts Katz said generators who use renewable energy sources such as solar win d geothermal and biomass will be paid an average of about cents per kilowatthour He said that cogenerators who use natural gas and sell the excess heat to businesses will receive an average of cents to cents per kilowatthour The generators will receive percent of the money they are owed when the contracts are signed and the full debt eventually will be paid with interest Katz said the new rates for the small contractors are tied to legislative approval of the Edison rescue plan But Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton DSan Francisco disagreed saying action by the Public Utilities Commission yesterday implemented the agreement between Edison and the small contractors FERC appears set to expand its price curbs By Joe Cantlupe COPLEY NEWS SERVICE June WASHINGTON Facing mounting political pressure the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seems poised next week to greatly expand existing energy price restrictions that now kick in only during emergencies Hints of the move surfaced yesterday as a Senate committee started investigating FERCs response to the California power crisis The current order limits prices only when the states power reserves dip below percent the level at which a Stage alert is called Critics including Gov Gray Davis say that order is full of loopholes because any price can be charged when no emergency has been declared which is most of the time Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif told the Governmental Affairs Committee yesterday that it now appears that on Monday FERC may extend this order t o the entire Western energy market and may ensure that the order stays in pla ce at all times This sounds good on the face of it and it may well be added Feinstein However this situation is ripe for manipulation as I believe they have been doing she said of power generators in the state She said that FERC is essentially considering a flexible price cap that like the existing order sets the price on the cost of producing electricit y at the mostcostly leastefficient power plant FERC officials declined to discuss the agencys possible action next week or Feinsteins remarks FERCs previous price mitigation order went into effect May and some federal regulators say it caused wholesale electricity prices to plummet in California Megawatts that once cost an average of more than and sometimes several thousand dollars recently dropped to below during peak usage A megawatt powers about homes But some observers say that many factors are responsible for the sudden pri ce drop including cooler weather conservation and state longterm electricit y contracts At a meeting of the California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco yesterday Chairwoman Loretta Lynch said she is very encouraged that FERC is reconsidering its earlier decision but said the result would be absolutely inadequate because FERC would cap prices at a relatively high rate according to The Associated Press Yesterdays Washington hearing by the Governmental Affairs Committee was th e Democraticcontrolled Senates first foray into Californias emotionally charged power crisis and seemed a harbinger of intensified partisan wrangli ng to come Feinstein and Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif used the hearing to make pleas for immediate action on price caps and to complain about FERC Today we see no semblance of really meaningful regulation Feinstein sai d Committee Chairman Joseph Lieberman agreed The fact of the matter is that the California market is not even functional said Lieberman DConn I think its fair to say if the feder al government doesnt step in and provide temporary price relief the natural trend toward deregulation will come to a halt California officials have sought price caps to rein in what they term outrageous electricity costs charged by outofstate companies But the Bush administration has vehemently opposed caps saying they would discourage investment in new power plants In recent weeks however some key congressional Republicans have softened their position saying they would not oppose limited controls FERC itself heavily criticized by Davis and others as a donothing agenc y appears to be showing a new face with two new members appointed by Bush promising more aggressive monitoring of the power industry Feinstein and Rep Henry Waxman DLos Angeles have sponsored bills that would enact tougher price caps The legislation is expected to be debated later this month Sen Fred Thompson RTenn the ranking Republican on the committee oppos ed Boxer and Feinsteins calls for price caps and said that California officia ls were partly to blame for the states problems for acting too late State must bare secret energy deals Judge orders release of pacts with suppliers By Karen Kucher and Craig D Rose UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITERS June The states secret energy deals wont be secret much longer Even as some details about Californias longterm power contracts began to emerge a Superior Court judge yesterday ordered the almostfull release of the states agreements with power suppliers by noon tomorrow to attorneys representing news organizations and a dozen state lawmakers Judge Linda B Quinn also set a hearing for June to decide whether to order the state to release information about its costly spotmarket electricity purchases something the state only wants to do six months afte r the transactions are completed The news organizations and legislators filed suit under the Public Records Act seeking the contracts that bind the state to more than billion in power purchases over the next decade Revelations that California has contracted to pay as much as per megawatthour to Constellation Energy Group Inc quickly brought complaints that the state had overpaid for electricity The price of the commodity is now plunging The Los Angeles Times and at least one other newspaper which obtained som e of the longterm state contracts reported that power costs ranged to as lo w as and down to about when the state supplies fuel to generating plants By comparison spot prices yesterday for power were from to per megawatthour far below levels earlier this year when prices averaged more than for several months and reached a high of nearly Until last June prices rarely exceeded per megawatthour Deregulation advocates said prices would decline as the market was opened up Gov Gray Davis strategy in dealing with budgetbusting costs over the pas t year has been to sign longterm deals to avoid buying in daily markets Yesterday he said comparing contracted electricity costs to spot prices is unfair The price of spot market electricity is coming down because we have locked in longterm contracts Davis said We knew this going in The purpose of getting longterm contracts is to wean ourselves away from a spot market The governor referred to the oftencited criticism that Californias soarin g power prices were caused partly by an excessive dependence on buying power in daily markets as opposed to under longer contracts Severin Borenstein an expert in electrical deregulation from the Universit y of California Energy Institute agreed that comparing current spot prices with contract prices was unfair Speaking at a news conference yesterday hosted by the governors press secretary Borenstein said the deals should be analyzed in the context of conditions that existed as they were negotiated Spot prices during the first three months of this year for example averag ed about per megawatt hour But a prominent critic of deregulation said that neither buying strategy presented an acceptable option for consumers They gouge you with spot prices or they gouge with term contracts said Harvey Rosenfield president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica which is expected to lead a ballot initiative next year over deregulation We have to get out of this deregulation disaster Parts censored For months Davis refused to make public details about the contracts sayin g that revealing information about the deals would put the state at a disadvantage in contract negotiations The state became a major electricity buyer after the nearbankrupt utility companies were unable to make purchases on their own This week however Davis agreed to release the contracts with certain portions censored The governors change of heart came as the newspaper reports emerged and critics alleged that the state was overpaying A spokesman for Enron Corp said yesterday that the state had many opportunities to secure power at lower prices than it appears to have paid under the contracts Enron however declined to sell any power to the stat e under contract Outside of court yesterday Deputy Attorney General Tim Muscat said that th e state has secured enough contracts in the past month to feel comfortable releasing longterm contract details The state has signed contracts or agreements in principle that cover muc h of the states unmet electricity needs he said We have finally reached critical mass and now we think we can disclose the contracts and still protect the publics interest in getting the best deal and going forward with negotiating agreements Muscat said But he added that the state wants to keep private some technical contract information that could harm the states contract partners Media opposed You are going to be looking at a contract that has to percent of the content in it Muscat told reporters gathered outside Quinns San Diego courtroom The only thing that could be removed are some technical issues Alonzo Wickers an attorney representing the coalition of media organizations said he will oppose allowing the state to omit portions of t he contracts and will seek full information about spot market buys Wicker said that having complete access to the documents is essential to t he publics full understanding of the contracts Wickers is representing the Copley Press which publishes The San Diego UnionTribune the Los Angeles Times the San Jose Mercury News the San Francisco Chronicle Dow Jones the McClatchy newspapers The Orange County Register Bloomberg and The Associated Press Muscat had unsuccessfully sought days to provide the documents to plaintiffs He said the states business partners needed to have the opportunity to raise objections to releasing the information The contracts contain confidentiality clauses Among those seeking a delay in the judges ruling yesterday was an attorney representing Morgan Stanley a marketer in power transactions who said he had just learned of the litigation this week Once the contracts are publicly disclosed the eggs cannot be unscrambled said attorney Eric Landau who said his clients competitive position could be hurt by the release of information Staff writer Ed Mendel contributed to this report NEWS ANALYSIS Senate Democrats to Use Power to Illuminate Bush Energy Plan By RONALD BROWNSTEIN Times Political Writer WASHINGTONIt was a sign of things to come when Sen Joseph I Lieberman DConn bounded into the chairmans seat Wednesday to convene a hearing on electricity price controls in the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee With their sudden ascension into the Senate majority Democrats have regained control of one of Congress most effective weapons the power to summon witnesses to investigative hearings backed by the authority to subpoena documents And that could signal a major shift in the debate on a broad range of issuesenergy policy foremost among them Though the Democrats lack a coordinated strategy several committees plan hearings through the summer and fall that will shine a sustained spotlight on Bush administration energy policy decisions and the role of energy companies in rising gasoline and electricity prices Through these hearings the Democrats hope to reshape the climate of public opinion aroun d the energy debate pressure both federal regulatory agencies and private companies to change their behaviorand score some political points by painting President Bushs policies as a boon to the energy industry What this allows us to do is continue some of the unpleasant conversations that Bush is trying to avoid and that Bush could avoid in the more controlled atmosphere when Republicans held the Senate said one Democratic strategist That prospect presents obvious problems for Bush who already is battling the perception in opinion polls that he favors producers over consumers in the energy debate But these inquiries also carry dangers for Democrats who spent six years charging that congressional Republicans misused their investigative authority through repeated hearings into allege d ethical misdeeds by the Clinton administration The public doesnt want to see a party thats out for blood If they go down that path the public will turn off just like it turned off on the Republicans said John Podesta President Clintons White House chief of staff But what these investigations and oversight hearings can do is real ly help tell a story about whose side this White House is on and what th e impact is on real peoples lives Senate Republicans wasted no time denouncing the hearings as a waste o f time Let me tell you what the name of the game is now Its pure politics said Sen Frank H Murkowski RAlaska who chaired the Energy and Natural Resources panel until the Democratic takeover Asked about Wednesdays proceedings he replied Is that going to produce any more energy Conscious of both the opportunities and risks Democrats are moving cautiously to exercise their new clout Lieberman has not issued any subpoenas in his investigation into Californias power crisis and his firs t hearing Wednesday was a sedate affair that broke no new ground Still the authority to investigate has always been one of Congress most potent tools particularly when Capitol Hill and the White House are held by different parties Over the last century congressional hearings have largely divided int o three categories One tradition centers on allegations of ethical wrongdoin g in the executive branchsuch as the probes that unearthed the Teapot Dome oil scandal during Warren G Hardings presidency vetted the Watergate burglary that led to President Nixons downfall or examined the Whitewater land deal and campaign fundraising during Clintons presidency Hearings also have been used to look for misbehavior in the private sector usually as an attempt to lay the groundwork for reform legislation such as the Depressionera hearings on the stock market crash that led to t he creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission And finally legislators have used the hearing forum as a competitor to the presidents bully pulpitas a means to draw attention to ideas the Whi te House opposes Probably the most successful example of that occurred in the s when nationally televised hearings by Sen William Fulbright DArk on Vietnam crystallized opposition to the war During Clintons presidency Republicans emphasized ethics investigations So far in the energy debate Democrats are focusing on the second and third categories Hearings of the sort Lieberman is conducting arent designed to disru pt like the hearings during the Clinton administration they are designed to force new issues in the debate said Johns Hopkins University political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg who has written extensively on the process A s long as the energy debate was conducted only inside the Republican Party i t was a debate between proponents of free markets and proponents of freer markets At Wednesdays hearing Lieberman summoned half a dozen economists to make the case for the price caps on electricity rates that California Gov Gray Davis supports and Bush adamantly opposes Next Wednesday Lieberman will convene a second hearing that will give Davis a national forum to make his case for price controlsthen summon officials from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to explain why they have rebuffed that request Sources say Lieberman is considering a third hearing that would summon electricity producers whom Davis has accused of gouging California As Lieberman proceeds Sen Jeff Bingaman DNM the Energy Committees new chairman is scheduling hearings next week on electricity prices and the Environmental Protection Agencys decision to continue requiring the use of ethanol as a fuel additive in California Sen Carl Levin DMich is advancing on a slower but potentially broader track as he examines rising gas prices The subcommittee he heads intends to ask major oil companies to voluntarily produce various documents on the issue a request aides expect will be followed up with a subpoena during the summer The aides say Levin is not likely to require oil company executives to publicly testify until late fall Sen Larry E Craig RIdaho predicted Democrats will have a difficul t time attacking Republicans on energy Theyre going to try to make politic s out of a crisis he said But for eight years under Clinton there has been this silent echo of nothing in the area of production Under the ir watch little to nothing has been done and many forms of energy have been discouraged Even inside Democratic ranks opinion varies on what the hearings migh t accomplish Davis aides believe the forums could create momentum for pricecap legislation sponsored by Sens Dianne Feinstein DCalif and Gordon Smith ROre But that bill faces difficult odds in the Senate the more practical benefit of the hearings one source close to Lieberman said may be to increase pressure on FERC to act That may already be happening Senior FERC officials told The Times on Tuesday that in response to the growing political heat the agency is considering a significant expansion of the price limits it has already ordered Likewise Levin believes that the prospect of subpoenas and compelled public testimony later this year will have a moderating quality on gasoli ne price and supply decisions that oil executives make this summer as one aid e put it More broadly Democrats believe any evidence that either oil or electricity producing companies have manipulated price increases will make it tougher for Bush to sell an energy agenda that stresses increased productio n And during the hearings Democrats see an opportunity to solidify their contention that the administration has given the energy industry too loud a voice in setting policy One of the things these hearings can do is begin to pull back the curtain on who is in the room Podesta said Who is giving the advice Who is calling the shots Yet Democrats also appear acutely conscious of the danger of appearing overly partisan particularly Lieberman who has meticulously cultivated a reputation for working across party lines Tellingly sources close to both Davis and Lieberman say that the governors appearance at next weeks heari ng was more his idea than the senators The goal here isnt to get Bush insisted one close Lieberman advisor Its to crystallize some of the differences in terms of policy approaches Times staff writer Richard Simon contributed to this story US Invites Private Funding for Grid Expansion Bush plan targeting Path a key transmission point in the Central Valley sets up a showdown with the state By NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOPrivate energy companies could own rights to a key piece o f Californias electrical transmission grid thereby gaining influence over t he flow of electricity and its price under a plan launched Wednesday by the federal government At the direction of President Bush a federal power agency Wednesday invited outside parties to help pay for the expansion of Path an mile stretch of highvoltage wires in the Central Valley that constrains the flow of power Pacific Gas Electric owns the original wires which can move about megawatts of power but the financial backers of an expansion would w in the rights to move an additional megawatts on the new lines Any company or utility hoping to move electricity through that choke point would have to pay the owners of the transmission rights a fee and abi de by their rules The federal solicitation for investment sets up a showdown with California which is urging Pacific Gas Electric to expand its existing lines at Path Gov Gray Davis also is pursuing outright purchase of the transmission grids owned by PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric What you have is two processes on two different tracks said Jim Pop e president of a group of municipal utilities eager to expand Path He said the hope of his organization called the Transmission Agency o

Department of Water Resources which signed the power contracts called the federal effort to attract partners on a Path expansion project disconcerting I think the governors plan to acquire the transmission grid is goo d for the people of California said Hart I think it protects them from marketers that would have a tendency to want to lock it up and jack the rat es up Federal law mandates that transmission grid owners offer fair fees and open access But owners of transmission rights can sell that ability to mov e electricity in a secondary market and experts say that in the complicated rules that govern transmission rights there is room for manipulation Transmission constraints can influence price by barring some buyers and sellers from reaching one another If youre going to pay for

The effect elsewhere may prove minimal By GARY POLAKOVIC Times Environmental Writer Gov Gray Davis decision this week to relax emission controls at powe r plants will help keep the juice flowing but will also retard progress against smog The changes are bound to cause mischief for some California areas on t he cusp of achieving healthful air after more than years of effort Even a little extra pollution could be enough to thwart attainment of the national healthbased ozone standards in the Bay Area San Diego and Ventura County officials say Moreover in case the governors strategy doesnt work he has left op en the option of tapping the dirtiest power source availablelegions of backu p diesel generators Those engines would provide a few hundred more megawatts but at a terrible price for air quality because they lack controls and can spew about times more pollutants than the very dirty peakers that Davis exempted from emissions controls Monday Were trying to make the best of a bad thing but in the short term we are getting rolled Air quality is going to suffer more this year and ther e will be some impacts said Dick Baldwin executive officer for the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District Across most of Southern California however the energy crisis is not likely to lead to dirtier air this year air quality officials say The reason is that Californias power plants some of the cleanest in the nation contribute just of the smogforming emissions during summer and half as much the rest of the year The lions share of the Southlands air pollution comes from cars and trucks Twothirds of the power plants in the region will be equipped with devices to render them cleaner by summer according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District which regulates air pollution in Los Angeles Orange and parts of Riverside and S an Bernardino counties Those improvements should reduce overall power plant emissions about a third this year although pollution from individual generators may be highe r according to the state Air Resources Board For the most part California air quality officials say the challenges they will face because of the energy crisis are temporary and surmountable but they acknowledge that they are under intense pressure from politicians energy companies and manufacturers to relax regulations California has mor e smog than any other state and the worlds most stringent and comprehensive program to tame it although progress toward a healthy environment is still slow On the other hand officials are attempting to balance the need for a clean environment with the need to keep the economy humming The power crisis too can be hazardous to people when blackouts knock out traffic signals or cause heavy equipment to malfunction in the workplace An executive order that Davis issued Monday lifts emissions limits on heavily polluting power plants allowing municipalities and energy companie s to produce as much power and smog as necessary The decision was reached after utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power noted that operating restrictions on socalle d peaker plants were leaving hundreds of megawatts of capacity unused Peakers are typically run by gasfired turbines similar to jet engines Th ey produce limited power but lots of pollution which is why their use was strictly controlled in the first place Under the governors plan power producers will pay per ton of extra smog produced by the turbines The money will go into a fund to pay f or cleaning up dirty trucks buses boats and farm equipment to offset the pollution from the power plants Government estimates show that the plan could provide up to megawatts of additional electricity but an additional tons of pollutants this summer Meanwhile emissions from cars trucks buses and consumer products continue to decline Air quality is dramatically better today in the Southland than it was a decade ago Credit rigorous controls on everything from lighter fluid to paint oil refineries to autos bakeries to landfills The trend of improving air quality should accelerate as power companie s pay the millions of dollars in fees and penalties to help fund smogcutting programs The funds will be used to switch vehicles farm equipment and boa ts to clean fuels many of which can be converted this year to help offset pow er plant emissions said Catherine Witherspoon policy advisor for the state a ir board On the whole theres not going to be a lot more smog We expect declining emissions from power plants Witherspoon said Across Southern California power plant emissions are up this year whi le smog levels remain largely unchanged Boilers and turbines have released mo re than tons of pollutants so fartwice as much as they had by this tim e last year Yet just days of unhealthful ozone levels have been recorded anywhere in the region so far this year The peak ozone reading has been parts per million a level comparable to last years said Joe Cassmassi senior meteorologist for the AQMD Smog levels are strongly influenced by weather and in the approaching summer ozone season Cassmassi said conditions this year should be no wors e than last year In fact he forecasts that by August tropical storms from t he Gulf of California will bring unsettled air which tends to reduce smog He said that by years end the region can expect a gradual return to El NiFo conditions which portends an early end to smog season The way the weather is lining up it will be a typical year in a longterm trend and the trend is toward improving air quality he said The increased emissions from power plants however might be just enou gh to add one or two smoggy days to some communities with little margin for error San Diego the Bay Area and Ventura are close to meeting the federal onehour ozone standardthe benchmark for healthful air and the culminatio n of a multibilliondollar cleanup effort spanning decades Those communities are racing against Clean Air Act deadlines that if not met could trigger federal sanctions and restrictions on highway funds If we can make it through November without having two more violations this year we would be in attainment said Dick Smith of the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District That means the air quality is not being exceeded and it would allow certain onerous and burdensome regulatio ns to go away The margin is even closer in Ventura County which was once one of the smoggiest places in the nation Now the county is almost in compliance with air quality standards but just one day of unhealthy ozone would push it ov er the line Baldwin said A megawatt Reliant Energy Co peaker plant in Oxnard may be the deciding factor it might produce up to tons daily of smogforming nitrogen dioxide this summer a increase in those emission s in the county Baldwin said Air quality officials opposed the governors decision but acquiesced with an understanding that an alternative plan to press into service backup diesel generators would be delayed In the short term there may be some negative impacts on air quality but if it avoids use of diesel backup generators its a small price to pay said Barbara Lee president of the California Air Pollution Control Officer s Assn PUC Acts to Aid Alternative Energy Suppliers Regulators permit utilities to modify contracts with small power providers to maximize production By TIM REITERMAN and DAN MORAIN Times Staff Writers SAN FRANCISCOMoving to end disputes that have threatened to increase blackouts state regulators Wednesday took steps to stabilize prices paid t o hundreds of alternativeenergy producers while encouraging them to increas e the amount of power they provide to California utilities this summer and beyond The Public Utilities Commission gave permission for the utilities to change their contracts to make them more attractive to the generators whic h supply more than a quarter of the states electricity PUC President Loretta Lynch said that such contracts would provide lon g term stability and reasonable prices for generators that rely on expensive natural gas and for producers of renewable energy such as solar and wind power It means the maximum amount of power will be available this summer she said The disputes between the energy producers and the utilities that owe them hundreds of millions of dollars have erupted in state courts US Bankruptcy Court the PUC and the state Capitol Although the vast majority of the generators are delivering power many have said they are in financia l difficulty and want out of their contracts with the utilities The commission specifically encouraged the utilities to adopt fiveyea r contracts at fixed prices proposed by the Independent Energy Producers and incentive payments to induce generators to produce more power than their contracts currently require The PUC also unanimously ratified settlements reached Tuesday between Southern California Edison and dozens of small power producers but the agreements are tied to Gov Gray Davis controversial deal to rescue the Rosemeadbased utility from nearbankruptcy It is a substantial move forward Davis said Jerry Bloom of the California Cogeneration Council also praised the PUCs action as a step forward for the states small generators But he cautioned that of the companies providing power to Pacific Gas Electr ic and San Diego Gas Electric still do not have contracts that provide a fai r return That leaves half of them operating at a loss and the possibility of severe blackouts still hovers over the state Bloom said Before the Southern California Edison agreements can be consummated Davis said the state Legislature must approve the complex deal he struck with the utility in April to allow it to pay off its debts and regain financial stability The deal calls for the state to buy Edisons transmission lines for nearly billion and issue up to billion in ratepayersecured bonds to allow the utility to pay off debts from electricity purchases Davis Edison rescue plan has stalled with virtually no support in either house and the governor urged that lawmakers begin hearings on it Otherwise he warned the Southern California utility could go bankrupt Senate leader John Burton DSan Francisco said many lawmakers from both parties are convinced that Davis is trying to place the Legislature in a position to take political heat if the Edison deal goes sour and the utilit y follows PGE into filing for bankruptcy protection In a filing with the PUC Edison said its agreements with the generato rs will provide significant benefits to the utility and its ratepayers the alternativeenergy producers and the state by providing for stable and reasonable pricing over the next five years at a time when both prici ng and supply are highly uncertain The agreementsreached Tuesday after months of negotiations that were facilitated by the governors officeaddress the issues of repaying debts to generators while establishing prices for future sales Edison stopped paying those generators in November and resumed in late March only under orders from the PUC PGE which also resumed payments in March had been paying cents of each dollar owed its alternative produce rs By the time the PUC ordered continuing payments to the alternative energy producers which Edison owes as much as billion the small companies were running out of cash and some had stopped operating helping to cause two days of statewide rolling blackouts in March Under terms worked out with key representatives of the alternativeenergy producers Edison would pay of what it owes the generators for electricity produced between last Nov and March In addition Edison would pay annual interest on the debt A second payment would be made when Edison is restored to creditworthiness through approval of the rescue deal by the PUC and the state Legislature or by some other solution Edison said Full payment woul d be made to the generators five days after Edison receives funds to pay off its own debts Edison also agreed to pay producers of renewable energy a fixed rate of a megawatthour for five years The PUC meanwhile failed to meet a deadline of last Friday for actin g on aspects of Davis deal with Edison I have urged them to move more quickly the governor said Reiterman reported from San

TONY PERRY Times Staff Writer SAN DIEGODespite statements from Gov Gray Davis that full disclosur e of the states longterm power contracts was imminent attorneys for the state balked Wednesday at disclosing the contracts until key details are removed The attorneys also opposed making public any shortterm spot market contracts for at least six months warning that to divulge those contracts now would undercut the states negotiating stance and ensure summer blackou ts Attorneys for several news organizations and Republican state legislators accused the governors attorneys of stalling and making the iss ue needlessly complex On Tuesday Davis dropped his earlier opposition to making longterm contracts public and indicated that the contracts might be made public as early as Wednesday But Deputy Atty Gen Tim Muscat representing Davis asked Superior Court Judge Linda Quinn for two weeks to prepare redacted versions of the longterm contracts that total nearly billion Opposing attorneys who had sued to make the contracts public complained that the facts that Davis wants to keep secret are key to understanding the contracts and to determining whether the governor has obligated taxpayers to pay inflated prices Theyve conceded the public interest in disclosure and no matter ho w thin they slice the baloney that concession is really deafening said Sacramento attorney Charles Bell representing legislators who assert th at keeping the contracts secret violates the California Public Records Act Quinn ruled that the longterm contracts must be made public by noon Friday although she will allow the governor to keep certain portions secret at least until June while she considers legal arguments from both sides She expressed annoyance at the slow pace of negotiations between the t wo sides and the apparent slowness of the attorney generals efforts to alert private companies that their contracts with the state might be made public This is an amazing situation Quinn said Eric Landau Orange County attorney for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co the Wall Street brokerage firm that serves as an energy marketer said he had only recently learned that the contracts might become public All w e are asking for is the ability to review the proceedings he said Muscat said the governor wants to avoid details including indexes that would link the price of electricity to natural gas prices delivery points and transaction costs Disclosure of those terms he said would provide information to competitors of the companies that have signed agreements with the state and allow for market manipulation The Times reported Wednesday that the state has committed to buying power at prices up to a megawatthour during peak demand periods and more than for power at times when

cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Demands by the states oil refineries for protection from rolling blackouts should be met a member of the state Public Utilities Commission said yesterday in releasing a draft decision to grant the exemption While the recommendation from PUC Commissioner Carl Wood still faces a full hearing by the fivemember PUC later this month oil industry officials consider it a promising development in their intense lobbying campaign to keep refineries running This is a very good step said Scott Folwarkow spokesman for the Valero refinery in Benicia which has no backup generators to use in blackouts W e do play an essential role and the refinery needs to be protected The industry has repeatedly issued warnings that gasoline prices would soar if refineries were hit by rolling power blackouts Power interruptions of just an hour can send refineries out of commission for days shrinking gas supplies and leading to higher prices Earlier this month San Franciscobased Chevron Corp warned that it would reduce gasoline production at its two California refineries unless it was exempted from power outages Gov Gray Davis has also urged the PUC to designate petroleum refineries as essentialuse customers who are exempt from blackouts because their services are needed for public health and safety A Davis spokesman declined comment on the draft decision last night Skillednursing facilities and water agencies have joined oil refineries in intense lobbying for the essentialuse designation But the PUC has a limited number of exemptions it can offer to businesses By the agencys own standard at least percent of the electrical load mu st be exposed to blackouts Today half of the load is already exempt leaving just a percent margin to divide

Washington Bureau Thursday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews Washington Federal regulators are poised to impose roundtheclock price restrictions on wholesale electricity sold to California a move short of what Democrats have urged but far stronger than what the Bush administratio n has for months indicated it was willing to do The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected Monday to extend its April order which limits prices generators can charge during power emergencies to apply at all times and across the entire Western region sources inside the agency confirmed yesterday FERC also is expected to increase market monitoring expand refunds for overcharges by generators during power emergencies and order generators to sell into the Western grid during power emergencies among other things FERC Commissioner William Massey a Democratic appointee who strongly dissented from the April order because he believed it was too narrow would not comment on the expected action other than to say he had been urging greater intervention relentlessly for some time Although power prices are plunging for the first time since the crisis bega n Massey said it was too soon to declare victory We dont know whats going to happen in the next hour or tomorrow or the next month Massey said We are certain this is a market short of power plants Supply and demand are not in reasonable equilibrium and when that is true prices can soar at the drop of a hat and the wealth transfer can b e exorbitant Massey said that until supply and demand came into reasonable balance in California which he expects to occur in months to two years as new powe r plants come on line there has got to be hoursaday sevendaysaweek price mitigation in effect to protect consumers period The expected FERC action coincides with rising political pressure on the agency from Democrats and increasing numbers of Republicans to intervene mo re forcefully in Californias power market despite fierce resistance to price controls from the Bush administration REINFORCEMENTS That pressure ratcheted up sharply when Democrats assumed control of the Senate and began scheduling legislation to order FERC to impose price caps The agencys move also coincides with the arrival of two new Bush appointee s Patrick Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell who are widely viewed as more receptive to intervention than the current chairman Curt Hebert a Republican appointed by former President Bill Clinton and named chairman by President Bush The agencys April order which took effect May puts a ceiling on price s pegged to the least efficient power plant It has been applied during two power emergencies so far Experts are divided on how much if any effect t he order has contributed to the recent sharp drop in prices Many factors fro m cool weather to increased conservation to the return of several nuclear generators that were down for maintenance are also at work Rep Doug Ose a Sacramento Republican who first pushed FERC to expand its April order said yesterday he believed the expected new action would provi de a pretty good middle ground between Democrats call for a specific maximu m price or cap the generators can charge and the Bush administrations opposition to price controls Rep Darryl Issa an Oceanside Republican added that the agencys action w as part of a pattern of escalating engagement by the administration and a more activist FERC AS LONG AS IT WORKS Sen Dianne Feinstein said the action expected Monday was likely to fall short of what she wanted although she called it another step forward While FERC is likely to avoid using the words price caps to describe its plan it called its original order price mitigation Feinstein said I dont care what you call it as long as it works Feinstein testifying yesterday at a Government Affairs Committee hearing o n energy said she believed the new order would still permit price manipulati on because the caps are set at the price charged by the least efficient therefore highest cost and most polluting generators Feinsteins bill to force FERC to impose price caps until is scheduled for committee action this month She wants firm price caps based on each generators costs much like the regulatory regime in place before Californias electricity restructuring Some economists argue however that the type of price controls FERC is expected to use more closely correspond to the price that a functioning market would produce Price caps have become the nexus of the entire Washington debate over Californias electricity crisis The Bush administration contends that pric e controls would make blackouts worse by discouraging electricity sales and investment while Democrats led by Feinstein and California Gov Gray Davi s contend that generators are deliberately withholding power to jack up price s OBJECTIONS TO CONTROLS WITHER Republicans on Capitol Hill many of whom

gallon at pump Davis says Jane Kay Chronicle Environment Writer Wednesday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTLtypeDnews The Environmental Protection Agency turned down Calfifornias request for a waiver of a cleanair law yesterday forcing the state to begin using ethan ol in gasoline as it phases out another additive that has polluted groundwater State officials have argued that ethanol which reduces smogproducing chemicals is not needed to meet the states air pollution requirements Gov Gray Davis reacted angrily to the EPAs decision saying it would rais e gas prices significantly and expose the state to shortages Their refusal will probably cost Californians cents a gallon at the pump Davis said yesterday while visiting a community health center in San Francisco It will do nothing to clean up the air and it is the triumph o f politics over good science The consumers of California once again get the shaft The Bush administration once again sides with special interests Im not going to ta ke it The EPAs denial is the latest sign of friction between the White House and Davis who have been battling over electricity prices The California Energy Commission estimates that consumers will pay million more a year for gasoline if refineries have to convert to ethanol That translates to an increase of to cents for each gallon of gas If ethanol supplies are inadequate or if refineries encounter problems consumers could see gas shortages and price spikes as high as cent a gallon according to the commission But EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said that the state had failed to sh ow that a waiver of a federal Clean Air Act provision would not reduce air quality The law requires regions of the country with the worst air to use oxygen additives in gas to reduce smog California requested the waiver because it is phasing out the additive MTBE or methyl tertiary butyl ether which has polluted groundwater throughout t he state Ethanol is the only other additive approved under the federal Clean Air Act DIFFICULTIES ADMITTED Whitman acknowledged that California faced a dilemma in keeping MTBE out of its drinking water while satisfying the federal law However she said oxygen adding substances such as MTBE and ethanol in gasoline do reduce smogforming chemicals and should be used in urban areas with the worst air quality MTBE DILEMMA The administration is concerned about the risks of MTBE in drinking water in California and other states Whitman said Clean air and clean water are equally important We do not want to pursue one at the expense of the other Since the widespread use of MTBE in it has become a major problem in California and other states tainting groundwater and threatening the drinking water supplies of some areas Winston Hickox secretary of the California EPA said yesterday that the planned ban might be delayed if the state Energy Commission decided there were unsurmountable problems with converting to ethanol But he didnt believe California would back off on its efforts to rid gas of MTBE Sen Dianne Feinstein yesterday accused President Bush of turning a blind eye to California and Sen Barbara Boxer said the decision was another example of Bushs insensitivity to Californians Feinstein has introduced a bill that would give governors the authority to waive the additive requirement if their gas met other standards OIL INDUSTRY DISMAYED Oil industry officials in California who have argued that refiners could make an additivefree gas that qualified with federal and state requirement s to reduce smog also said they were disappointed with the decision Over the last four years weve made more than billion gallons of cleanerburning gas that had no added oxygen no MTBE no ethanol said Fred Gorell spokesman for Chevron Corp The gas meets all the requirement s But we cant sell it in Southern California and Sacramento because of the federal requirement BOON TO FARMERS If MTBE is banned in and theres an oxygen additive requirement ther e would be no other choice than to use ethanol Gorell said Ethanol is made primarily from corn and the EPA decision is a boon to Midwestern corn growers and lawmakers from states such as Illinois Iowa Minnesota and South Dakota who had lobbied the Bush administration heavily to deny the waiver The decision would create a substantial market for ethanol According to the Renewable Fuels Association an ethanol industry group California would need about million gallons a year to use as an additiv e in gas In the industry expects to produce billion gallons and i s gearing up to make million gallons more with the addition of plants BIG INITIAL COSTS Adding ethanol to Californias gas supply would require a major investment in infrastructure Gorell said Some of the costs would go to modify refinerie s as well as terminals where the ethanol blending would be done Costs of transporting ethanol from Midwestern states would not be the bigge st problem Gorell said Ethanol can be brought by ships and barges just as most of the MTBE is brought now Ethanol also can be brought by railcars which are prohibited from carrying MTBE But refiners can work with ethanol he said Even if the waiver were grante d there would a new market for ethanol in Los Angeles to combat carbon monoxi de in the winter anyway Environmental groups welcomed the EPAs decision yesterday Bluewater Netwo rk of San Francisco said a coalition of groups supported maintaining the additive requirement to protect the air and the use of renewable ethanol in gas The requirement could also be a boon to the states agricultural industry The state has only two plants that make about million gallons of ethanol a year from cheese whey and the sugar and starch from outdated soda pop Six new California plants are planned for next year The boost in ethanol would help farmers who are suffering from global competition and other problems

deals the state has signed with electricity generators Davis and his advisers said they have signed enough contracts that releasin g the information will not seriously jeopardize the states bargaining position Administration officials however said the contracts contain confidentiality clauses and they will ask a judge today to release the stat e from those provisions Republican lawmakers and several media organizations including The Chronicle have filed suit against Davis demanding that the contracts be made public We now believe that the balance tips in favor of disclosure rather than continuing to withhold the contracts said Davis senior adviser Nancy McFadden In San Francisco yesterday Davis said he always intended to release the information six months after the contracts were signed Obviously the market conditions are a little more favorable now he said On balance we think its the appropriate time to release the information Davis request will be heard at a court hearing today in San Diego on the suits filed by the media and GOP lawmakers against Davis But it is unclear whether the judge will go along with the administrations request or how the Davis administration will be able to proceed if it is denied Paula HallCollins a spokeswoman for Williams Co said the energy company will monitor the court hearing We maintain that the contracts contain proprietary information she said Patrick Dorinson a spokesman for Mirant also expressed concern about what information might be released We think it is important for the people of California to have information on revenue and capacity information but we are sensitive to specific terms being released that could be misused by our competitors in the marketplace he said The state has been purchasing power since Jan While much of that has been on the expensive spot market state officials have also locked in contracts for longterm deals However no information on the terms of the contracts or how much the state is committed to spend has been released Ray Hart Department of Water Resources deputy director sent letters to power generators yesterday saying the department will ask a judge to throw out the confidentiality provision in the contracts The letter states that there will be some redactions on information that is considered proprietary McFadden said the move was not made because the state was concerned about losing its lawsuits She said she expected the court to release the state from the confidentiali ty agreement The governors office then would release the documents as early as this week she said Lawmakers also have been demanding the release of the information so that they can proceed on a plan to keep Southern California Edison out of bankruptcy If the judge refuses to release the state from the confidentiality clause the administration will negotiate with the generators individually to allow the contracts to be made public McFadden said But Terry Francke general counsel with the California First Amendment Coalition said he would be surprised if a judge allowed the request I dont believe the court would simply absolve a party from a contractual agreement at a proceeding where the other party is not present he said Francke also questioned whether the state had the right to sign contracts containing a confidentiality clause There is a very serious question as to whether the state of California can legally in effect promise to ignore the Public Records Act he said Roger Myers an attorney for The Chronicle said there is good case law in the state supporting the

elicit fierce debate in Congress BY JIM PUZZANGHERA Mercury News Washington Bureau WASHINGTON California moved to political center stage Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans clashed in Congress over how to solve the states electricity problems Wielding the new power gained since the Senate shifted from Republican control last week Sen Joseph Lieberman DConn held the first of two hearings into the response of federal regulators to Californias energy crisis The Democrats are focusing their pressure on members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission who are poised Monday to consider a major expansion of limited electricity price controls enacted in April The heat is on and its going to produce some light at the end of the tunnel predicted Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif Feinstein has sponsored legislation to force the commission to set temporar y price caps The bill is scheduled to be considered by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on June after wallowing for months while Republicans controlled the Senate Republicans assailed the Democrats for failing to address the problem of increasing the supply of energy in favor of shortterm fixes such as price caps Let me tell you what the name of the game is now Its pure politics said Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska the leading Republican on the energy committee And the Democratic plan is to try to cement in the minds of voters that President Bush favors corporate interests at the expen se of consumers But in a nod to the growing pressure for some federal action Murkowski an ardent opponent of price caps said he would support a day ceiling on electricity prices in California set at a megawatthour throughout t he West The idea would be to prevent the sharp spikes in prices during emergency periods that have led to power suppliers selling electricity to California at shortterm prices of as much as a megawatthour Governors of Western states could opt out of the plan and the limits could be extended as much as more days in onemonth increments Such highprice limits are also known as circuit breakers and have been put in place in Texas Pennsylvania and in New England in the past It coul d emerge as a Republican alternative to Feinsteins bill which would set harder price caps for months based on each suppliers cost to produce t he energy plus a builtin profit level But Feinstein and California Gov Gray Davis would not support the ceiling This proposal says Go ahead gouge us all the time except for a few hours during periods of extreme peak demand said Davis media representative Steve Maviglio Its toothless and provides no real temporary relief There was no consensus on price caps from a group of six leading energy experts convened by Lieberman before his Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday Four invited by Lieberman including Severin Borenstein director of the Energy Institute at the University of CaliforniaBerkeley supported price caps Two experts invited by the Republicans Lawrence Makovich senior director at Cambridge Energy Research Associated and William Hogan of Harvard Universitys Kennedy Scho ol of Government did not But Alfred Kahn a retired Cornell University economics professor who helpe d deregulate US airlines in the s said temporary price relief is necessary and failure to help California could lead other states to halt their electricity deregulation plans And rather than discouraging investme nt in new power plants electricity regulation through the years encouraged su ch high spending on infrastructure that Kahn referred to it as goldplating of circuits With electric power we have not had the problem of shortages under regulation he said All the experts agreed that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission needs more resources and should become more vigilant in the way it monitors electricity They have some very good people at FERC but they dont have enough Hogan said Paul Joskow the director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said the commission must become more like the Securities and Exchange Commission in actively monitoring possible electricity markets All five commissioners along with Davis will testify at a hearing Wednesd ay by Liebermans committee regarding whether FERC has fulfilled its obligatio ns to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates in California Curt Hbert the FERC chair Wednesday defended the commission and said its California price mitigation plan put in place in April has helped lower prices in California in recent days There is no doubt the plan is working to bring down prices and making generation capacity available Hbert said He would not say whether the commission would expand its plan aroundtheclock and to other Western states as a commission source told the Mercury News is being considered FERC has been urged to do that by some key Republicans in Congress On the same day Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham went before a House subcommittee to push for action on the administrations national energy pla n which calls for increasing domestic supplies through more oil and naturalg as drilling and greater use of coal and nuclear power Every step we take toward wiser use of energy and more diverse supplies a t home will make us that much less dependent on overseas suppliers and less vulnerable to supply shocks imposed on us from abroad Vice President Dic k Cheney who headed the task force that drafted the plan said in a speech before the United States Energy Associations Efficiency Forum Wednesday Wednesday congressional Republicans charging that Democrats had tried to derail the plan threatened to use parliamentary stalling tactics unless Democrats set a date in the near future to consider Bushs proposals PUC commissioner issues draft decision to exempt refineries from blackouts SAN FRANCISCO AP A state power regulator has issued a draft decision that would exempt oil refineries from rolling blackouts and keep California s gasoline prices from potentially skyrocketing The California Public Utilities Commission will consider commissioner Carl Woods proposal on June Administrative Law Judge Burton Mattson issued a companion ruling Wednesday requesting a coalition of energy producers PUC commissioners and electric utilities to provide more information about foss il fuel production to help the PUC decide whether to grant more exemptions Gov Gray Davis has asked the PUC to come up with a plan to minimize disruption of fossil fuel production this summer A rolling blackout is capable of causing refineries to lose up to a week of production which cou ld create gasoline shortages and drive up prices at the pump While the economic impacts caused by disruption of fossil fuel production are potentially devastating the commission must balance these economic impacts against the potential impacts on public health and safety asserted by applicants in our other exemption process Wood said in a written statement Four oil refiners Valero Energy Tosco Exxon Mobil and Equilon Enterprises are petitioning the PUC for blackout exemptions at facilities that produce about onefourth of the states refining capacity of milli on barrels per day Meanwhile Californias biggest refiner Chevron Corp has taken its exemption case directly to Davis The San Franciscobased company which controls about percent of the states refining capacity told Davis the company will curtail production unless regulators or state lawmakers protec t its two California refineries from blackouts Davis sent a letter last week to the PUC supporting the oil industrys request for a blackout exemption said his spokesman Steve Maviglio FERC may expand cap Senators say regulators are set to extend price controls throughout the Wes t June By DENA BUNIS The Orange County Register WASHINGTON Federal energy regulators are poised Monday to extend limited price controls on the electricity market to hours a day seven days a we ek throughout the Western states Californias senators said Tuesday If the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does what Democratic Sens Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein have heard it plans to do it would represent a further softening by FERC in the face of mounting political pressure FERC had adamantly opposed limits on a free electricity market until April when it approved its first limited controls Experts believe such a move could moderate wholesale prices but to what extent and what the effect could be on ratepayers is uncertain It would be a step in the right direction Boxer said Tuesday after she Feinstein and California House members from both parties met with Vice President Dick Cheney It still doesnt give us the kind of help with pric e gouging that we need Cheney who reiterated the administrations opposition to firm price caps told members who pressed him for a Californiaspecific solution to watch wh at FERC does at its meeting next Monday Two new FERC commissioners recently appointed by President George W Bush could be voting Monday Energy watchers say their presence could turn FERC into a more activist agency In April FERC ordered a pricecontrol plan based on a complicated formula of what it costs generators to produce a kilowatt of electricity But critics particularly FERC Commissioner Richard Massey called it meaningless becaus e it only applied during shortages and did not extend beyond California Political heat triggers FERCs switch The panel seems more responsive to the voice of public officials June By DENA BUNIS and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register WASHINGTON The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may be an independent body But its members sure can feel a political sledgehammer coming at them For months the proopen markets majority on the commission has resisted pleadings by California officials to put price caps on wholesale electricit y prices They broke down somewhat in April and put limited controls on the market on ly during electricity emergencies and only in California Since then the political heat has become intense And its come to a head this week as The new Democraticcontrolled US Senate begins hearings today on the electricity crisis in California The two new FERC commissioners Nora Mead Brownell and Patrick Wood have been sworn in and will begin attending meetings Brownell who was sworn on as the fifth commissioner on Tuesday said she and Wood were planning a tri p to California soon after next weeks second Senate hearing at which they will testify Key Republicans House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Rep Billy Tauzin RLa and energy subcommittee chairman Rep Joe Barton RTexas sent a letter to FERC urging it to expand its limited controls this summer to cover all the western states all the time I think there is a growing political consensus in Congress in California most everywhere that an effective price mitigation plan in this California market has to cover all hours Richard Massey a FERC commissioner who ha s been critical of what he calls half a loaf measures his colleagues have taken thus far said Tuesday Massey would not confirm that the commission plans on Monday to expand pric e controls to hours a day and to other Western states But even if it does its unclear how far such an action will go toward solving Californias problem and whether it could open up new problems Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which manages most of the states electric grid said the plan would have some effect on prices in California But it may not go far enough she said We welcome any decision to move forward with roundtheclock mitigation which is something weve called fo r from the beginning Energy experts and some lawmakers worry that the method the FERC plan uses which sets costbased wholesale rates based on the leastefficient power plants operating in California could lead to market manipulation The minute prices are linked to the cost of operating the least efficient plant an incentive for plants to be inefficient is created said Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif I am concerned that this order will continue to provide energy generators the opportunity to manipulate prices as I believ e they have been doing Democrats in California and on Capitol Hill have been calling for firm pric e caps Thats the only way they say that the generators can be prevented from gouging the states ratepayers But Gov Gray Davis is ready to be convinced this latest possibility will work The devils in the details of course Davis said in a statement Mark m e down as a doubting Thomas The FERC has been on a sitdown strike but if they are finally for price relief hallelujah Wholesale power prices have dropped dramatically in the state in the past t wo weeks But Feinstein said so far its unclear what has caused the decline the earlier FERC action the possibility that generators are worried about investigations into alleged price manipulation or the increased pressure fr om Congress There is some evidence that the April FERC action had an effect Two weeks ago during a Stage alert Californias Independent System Operator imposed FERCs pricing plan and bought power at a megawatt about onethird the price offered earlier that day said Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network a consumer advocacy group in San Francisco But Hoge said even it FERC expands controls on Monday California has alrea dy paid too high a price The state has already spent more than billion too much on electricity in the past year said Hoge Register staff writer John Howard contributed to this report Davis to air details about power buys He had refused to divulge the contract terms June By ALEXA HAUSSLER The Associated Press SACRAMENTO After fighting off demands for information for months Gov Gray Davis plans to release this week the muchsought details of longte rm contracts between the state and power generators aides said Tuesday At issue are details of contracts with companies worth billion ov er the next years for the purchase of nearly million megawatthours of electricity Davis administration officials said The contracts fine print was not immediately disclosed The average price was about per megawatthour In recent months the cost of wholesale electricity in California has fluctuated widely from less than per megawatthour to Early last year before Californias energy crisis exploded power cost to per megawatt Republican lawmakers and several news organizations including The Orange County Register sued Davis in March saying his refusal to release the contracts details violates the California Public Records Act Davis still refused saying that revealing the details would put the state at a competitive disadvantage in other contract talks Raymond Hart Department of Water Resources deputy director wrote power generators Monday saying the department will ask a judge today to void a confidentiality provision in the contracts Oklahomabased Williams Energy one of the generators with a state contract opposes the release of the contract details a spokeswoman said Energy notebook Edison makes deal to pay generators of renewable power June ROSEMEAD Southern California Edison has reached an agreement with small pow er generators that could ease the bankruptcy threat the utility is facing and ensure Californians a critical source of power through the summer The California Public Utilities Commission is expected Wednesday to approve the plan that would require Edison to make partial back payments to renewab le energy generators many of which have sued the utility and curtailed power production The plan would raise the rates being paid to generators that use natural ga s and offer a stable rate for five years to generators using wind solar geothermal or other renewable sources The agreement also requires Edison to pay at least percent of what it ow es generators The deal removes the threat of legal action against the utility if full payment for power bought since January is made within six months after the PUC order becomes final I think its a good balanced deal for both sides and the only issue will be making sure the PUC will adopt the deal said Jerry Bloom a spokesman for the California Cogeneration Council which represents many small natur al gasfired power generators Burton calls for batteries to keep traffic signals lit SACRAMENTO State Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco introduced a bill Monday that would provide battery backups for traffic signals at critical intersections throughout the state in hopes of preventi ng potentially deadly accidents during rolling blackouts The bill would require the California Energy Commission with the Californi a Highway Patrol to identify critical intersections based on traffic accidents and the presence of children Although the state has signalized intersections only the estimated intersections equipped with lightemitting diodes a more energyefficient kind of light would be eligible Battery backups cost to each The money for the program would come from funds provided to the California Energy Commission for conservation efforts said Dave Sebeck a Burton spokesman It is unclear whether cities counties and other agencies that have already installed backups would be reimbursed by the state To become law the bill must be approved by the energy and appropriation committees in the Senate and Assembly pass both houses by a twothirds majority and be signed by Gov Gray Davis Sebeck said Officials at the energy commission and the CHP declined to comment Tuesday because they have not reviewed the legislation In Orange County only of intersections in a Register survey released this week will be equipped with battery backups as of July Bill to allow state seizure of power plants advances SACRAMENTO A State Assembly committee approved legislation Tuesday that wou ld allow the state to seize power plants that regulators determined had charge d unreasonable prices for electricity The Assembly Judiciary Committee voted to approve a bill by Assistant Majority Leader Juan Vargas to allow the state to seize and run power plant s for to months and then pay their owners for the use of the plants The state Public Utilities Commission would first have to determine if the plants sold electricity at unjust and unreasonable prices The measure which supporters concede stands little chance of becoming law at this point is designed as a warning to power generators selling electricit y in the California market Its a tremendous effort to send a message to the generators said Wendy Harmon a spokeswoman for Vargas a Democrat from Chula Vista The bill still must pass at least one Assembly committee as well as pass a floor vote and be approved by the state Senate and then signed by the governor Gov Gray Davis has said he wants to leave the option open of supporting legislation allowing the state to seize power plants Power generators say that the possibility the state may seize power plants has slowed the building of new plants in the state prolonging the supply shortage that has contributed to soaring wholesale prices Mirant said this month it was postponing construction of an alreadyapprove d plant in Contra Costa because of concern about whether the state would seiz e power plants A spokesman for Davis said at the time he would be surprised if the company didnt proceed
