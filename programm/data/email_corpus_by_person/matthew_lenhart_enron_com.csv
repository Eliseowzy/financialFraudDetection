Hull Bryan Bass Eric JOHN HARRINGTON RYAN JONES FRANKLIN LOBO JENNIFER BAUER SACHIN SASTE GLENN LYDAY Subject Fwd a day in the life this is an old one but a great one If you dont like this email then you just dont understand A chronology of events for Saturday December and the early morning hours of Sunday December Arise play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at fullfreaking blast Get in car drive to New Braunfels Tee off me and a buddy were the FIRST teetime of the morning Turn crack open first beer Crack open second beer Crack openyou get the idea Finish holes as well as beers sign scorecard for smoooooth Headed for San Antonio Buy three packs for pre and postgame festivities We decide we dont have enough booze so we doubleback to a liquor store and buy the good ol ml plastic bottle Traveler Jim Beam Arrive at the tailgate spot Awesome day Not a single cloud in the sky About degrees I decide that were going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Were on the second floor of a twostory parking garage on the corner a couple hundred of us Were hooting and hollering like wildmen The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas AWESOME MOMENT In the postserenade serendipity grown men are bumping chests with one another each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Again we hoot and holler like wildmen Again the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us this time however with the Nebraska fight songs Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I begin the walk to the Alamodome somehow managing to stuff the Traveler and cans of beer into my pants I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans They are taunting me I am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as CellPhone Flop Out Remember flop out for a dollar The rules are similar I tell this Nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop out his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl And then I spoke these memorable words And not those damn refundable tickets either You request those nonrefundable nontransferrable sonsofbitches He backs down He is unworthy I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix nonrefundable and nontransferrable Price He is humbled He lowers his head in shame I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans I am KING and these are my subjects I distribute the beers in my pants to the cheering masses I RULE the pregame kingdom Kickoff Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy I notice something troubling Nebraska is big Nebraska is fast Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas The first quarter mercifully ends yards total offense for Texas Zero first downs for Texas Im still talking shit I pour another stiffy from the Traveler Four minutes to go in the first half the Traveler is a dead soldier I buy my first beer from the Alamodome merchants While I am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone Safety Halftime score Nebraska Texas I wish I had another Traveler While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime I attempt to revive the classic Briceism from the South Bend bathroom Hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock He is unamused I buy my nd and rd beer from the Alamodome merchants I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka I send them off to purchase Sprites so that we may consume their vodka I have not lost faith Nebraska is a bunch of pussies No more vodka The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives I purchase two more beers from the Alamodome merchants Score is Nebraska Texas I am beginning to lose faith This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field I call Southwest Airlines Im sorry sir Those tickets have been confirmed and are nonrefundable and nontransferrable I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter As it turns out the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than minutes on the game clock I am enraged by this policy I ask loudly Why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking PA system Back in my seats I am slumped in my chair in defeat All of a sudden the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts Whazzis I mutter awaking from my coma Iz we winnig Did wez scort Alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score The largest by far cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters S K and A in the Nebraska spelled out in their end zone I cheer wildly I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it I am thirsty Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck I would taunt them with some offcolor remarks about their parentage but I am too drunk to form complete sentences With my last cognitive thought of the evening I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October they would be playing Florida State for the national championship Back in the car On the way back to Austin for the TexasArizona tip off We can still salvage the day I crack open a beer It is warm I dont care We have stopped for gas I am hungry I go inside the store I walk past the beer frig I notice a Zima Ive never had a Zima I wonder if its any good I pull a Zima from the frig I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows Zima sucks I replace the empty bottle in the frig There is a Blimpie Subs in the store I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub There is no one there I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives I eat them I am still hungry I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami The patrons in the store fear me I dont care We are in South Austin I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour My truckmate is tired of my singing He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides Youre Going to Miss Me When Im Gone and Neon Moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own I tell him to fuck off and restart Neon Moon We arrive at the Erwin Center My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage I tell him hes an idiot I tell him we will never get out I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here He ignores me I think hes still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes I whistle Neon Moon loudly I am rallying I have warm beers stuffed in my pants Were going to kick the shit out of Arizona Halftime score Texas Arizona I am pleased I go to the bathroom to pee for the th time today I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom Brice There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom I am disappointed I tell myself out loud that I have a Niiiiiice cock No one is amused but me I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can Needless to say they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center much less Bud Light out of a can I am stopped by an usher Where did you get that sir I tell him no shit Oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs Would you mind throwing this away for me I take the last swig and hand it to him He is confused I pretend Im going to the bathroom but I run away giggling instead I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me I sneak into a large group of people and sit down The usher walks by harmlessly I am giggling like a little girl I crack open another can of Bud Light I am lost In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings I have no ticket stub I cannot find my seats Texas is losing Texas is being screwed by the refs I am enraged I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it A concerned fan asks if Im OK and perhaps I shouldnt take it so seriously I tell him to fuck off After the fourth consecutive worst fucking call I have EVER seen I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects However on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a onequarter inch gash over my eye I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt Perhaps I think to myself Im taking this a bit seriously I am standing in the bathroom peeing Im so drunk I am swaying and grunting I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye My pants are bloody I have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist I look like I should be in an episode of Cops Texas has lost I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits I am stopped every seconds by a good samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why I am covered in blood but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving With my one good eye I have located the parking garage I walk up six flights of stairs promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I take a nap I awake from my nap I see my friend in the drivers seat I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I am too tired to punch my friend I call my friend a Stupid fuck I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck I am jostled The truck is moving I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor I jump out of the truck walk to the edge of the parking facility and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to Neon Moon We are moving We are out of beer I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers I am happy I return to my vehicle We have emerged from the parking facility We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him We are all going to die tonight We have finished threequarters of the bottle of Glenlivet We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsthers Ed has to pee He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsthers The PollyEsthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club Fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughter Ive been working this door for almost a year Ive been working doors in this town for almost years And I can honestly say that I aint never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three Sorry cant let you in We attempt to reason with him He laughs harder We find a bar that lets us in We take two steps in the door and hear Last call for alcohol I turn to the group and mutter See dat wasnt that fuckin hard Day dont fuckin do that at the Awamothe awaomthe alabfuck it that stadium we was at today We order shots of tequila and three beers Back on the street We need food We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katzs The cab fare is We give him and tell him to keep it There is a minute wait We give the hostess We are seated immediately We order two orders of fried pickles a Cobb salad a bowl of soup two orders of Blueberry blintzes two Reuben sandwiches a hamburger two cheese stuffed potatoes an order of fries and an order of onion rings The food arrives We are all asleep with our heads on the table The waiter wakes us up We eat every fucking bit of our food Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted We dont give a shit The tab is with tip Im sleepy I wake up next to a strange woman She is the bartender at Katzs She is not pretty

this email then you just dont understand A chronology of events for Saturday December and the early morning hours of Sunday December Arise play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at fullfreaking blast Get in car drive to New Braunfels Tee off me and a buddy were the FIRST teetime of the morning Turn crack open first beer Crack open second beer Crack openyou get the idea Finish holes as well as beers sign scorecard for smoooooth Headed for San Antonio Buy three packs for pre and postgame festivities We decide we dont have enough booze so we doubleback to a liquor store and buy the good ol ml plastic bottle Traveler Jim Beam Arrive at the tailgate spot Awesome day Not a single cloud in the sky About degrees I decide that were going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Were on the second floor of a twostory parking garage on the corner a couple hundred of us Were hooting and hollering like wildmen The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas AWESOME MOMENT In the postserenade serendipity grown men are bumping chests with one another each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Again we hoot and holler like wildmen Again the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us this time however with the Nebraska fight songs Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I begin the walk to the Alamodome somehow managing to stuff the Traveler and cans of beer into my pants I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans They are taunting me I am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as CellPhone Flop Out Remember flop out for a dollar The rules are similar I tell this Nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop out his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl And then I spoke these memorable words And not those damn refundable tickets either You request those nonrefundable nontransferrable sonsofbitches He backs down He is unworthy I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix nonrefundable and nontransferrable Price He is humbled He lowers his head in shame I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans I am KING and these are my subjects I distribute the beers in my pants to the cheering masses I RULE the pregame kingdom Kickoff Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy I notice something troubling Nebraska is big Nebraska is fast Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas The first quarter mercifully ends yards total offense for Texas Zero first downs for Texas Im still talking shit I pour another stiffy from the Traveler Four minutes to go in the first half the Traveler is a dead soldier I buy my first beer from the Alamodome merchants While I am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone Safety Halftime score Nebraska Texas I wish I had another Traveler While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime I attempt to revive the classic Briceism from the South Bend bathroom Hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock He is unamused I buy my nd and rd beer from the Alamodome merchants I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka I send them off to purchase Sprites so that we may consume their vodka I have not lost faith Nebraska is a bunch of pussies No more vodka The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives I purchase two more beers from the Alamodome merchants Score is Nebraska Texas I am beginning to lose faith This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field I call Southwest Airlines Im sorry sir Those tickets have been confirmed and are nonrefundable and nontransferrable I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter As it turns out the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than minutes on the game clock I am enraged by this policy I ask loudly Why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking PA system Back in my seats I am slumped in my chair in defeat All of a sudden the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts Whazzis I mutter awaking from my coma Iz we winnig Did wez scort Alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score The largest by far cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters S K and A in the Nebraska spelled out in their end zone I cheer wildly I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it I am thirsty Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck I would taunt them with some offcolor remarks about their parentage but I am too drunk to form complete sentences With my last cognitive thought of the evening I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October they would be playing Florida State for the national championship Back in the car On the way back to Austin for the TexasArizona tip off We can still salvage the day I crack open a beer It is warm I dont care We have stopped for gas I am hungry I go inside the store I walk past the beer frig I notice a Zima Ive never had a Zima I wonder if its any good I pull a Zima from the frig I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows Zima sucks I replace the empty bottle in the frig There is a Blimpie Subs in the store I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub There is no one there I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives I eat them I am still hungry I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami The patrons in the store fear me I dont care We are in South Austin I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour My truckmate is tired of my singing He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides Youre Going to Miss Me When Im Gone and Neon Moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own I tell him to fuck off and restart Neon Moon We arrive at the Erwin Center My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage I tell him hes an idiot I tell him we will never get out I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here He ignores me I think hes still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes I whistle Neon Moon loudly I am rallying I have warm beers stuffed in my pants Were going to kick the shit out of Arizona Halftime score Texas Arizona I am pleased I go to the bathroom to pee for the th time today I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom Brice There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom I am disappointed I tell myself out loud that I have a Niiiiiice cock No one is amused but me I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can Needless to say they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center much less Bud Light out of a can I am stopped by an usher Where did you get that sir I tell him no shit Oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs Would you mind throwing this away for me I take the last swig and hand it to him He is confused I pretend Im going to the bathroom but I run away giggling instead I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me I sneak into a large group of people and sit down The usher walks by harmlessly I am giggling like a little girl I crack open another can of Bud Light I am lost In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings I have no ticket stub I cannot find my seats Texas is losing Texas is being screwed by the refs I am enraged I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it A concerned fan asks if Im OK and perhaps I shouldnt take it so seriously I tell him to fuck off After the fourth consecutive worst fucking call I have EVER seen I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects However on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a onequarter inch gash over my eye I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt Perhaps I think to myself Im taking this a bit seriously I am standing in the bathroom peeing Im so drunk I am swaying and grunting I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye My pants are bloody I have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist I look like I should be in an episode of Cops Texas has lost I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits I am stopped every seconds by a good samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why I am covered in blood but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving With my one good eye I have located the parking garage I walk up six flights of stairs promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I take a nap I awake from my nap I see my friend in the drivers seat I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I am too tired to punch my friend I call my friend a Stupid fuck I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and

traffic is beginning to move on the second floor I jump out of the truck walk to the edge of the parking facility and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below My friend looks at me like I just

vehicle until someone gives me two beers I am happy I return to my vehicle We have emerged from the parking facility We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him We are all going to die tonight We have finished threequarters of the bottle of Glenlivet We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsthers Ed has to pee He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsthers The PollyEsthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club Fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughter Ive been working this door for almost a year Ive been working doors in this town for almost years And I can honestly say that I aint never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three Sorry cant let you in We attempt to reason with him He laughs harder We find a bar that lets us in We take two steps in the door and hear Last call for alcohol I turn to the group and mutter See dat wasnt that fuckin hard Day dont

blocks to Katzs The cab fare is We give him and tell him to keep it There is a minute wait We give the hostess We are seated immediately We order two orders of fried pickles a Cobb salad a bowl of soup two orders of Blueberry blintzes two Reuben sandwiches a hamburger two cheese stuffed potatoes an order of fries and an order of onion rings The food arrives We are all asleep with our heads on the table The waiter wakes us up We eat every fucking bit of our food Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted We dont give a shit The tab is with tip Im sleepy I wake up next to a strange woman She is the bartender at Katzs She is not pretty

the article below but if you need a quick summary bc you dont have time to read the whole article here it is The Southeastern Conference is unequivocally the paragon of the college football conferences CKL SEC TRADITIONS A weekly column by Chris Warner Perspectives on SEC Football and Thoughts on the Impending Football Season I would like to kickoff this column with a few choice quotes from the annals of a most colorful and telling SEC gridiron history Southern football fans are knowledgeable fair and loud They are proud of their football heritage their schools and their teams And they share a deep pride that goes with being from the south George Mooney the irreplaceable Voice of the Volunteers in the s The true football fan pays no attention to time or mileage when there is a big game to see John Heisman head coach Auburn University In Baton Rouge the focal point of everything is Tiger football Jim Corbett In Baton Rouge its not a law to love LSU but the city fathers could probably get one passed if they needed to Charles McClendon head coach LSU After so many years at a school you become a member of the football family Bob Fulton I dont care where a man comes from or how he spells his name All I ask is that he be loyal to Georgia proud of that jersey and try like the devil to win Wally Butts head coach Georgia Deep inside were still the boys of autumn that magic time of the year that once swept us on to Americas fields Archie Manning Tradition is a rich asset for any team Tradition and success are traveling companions Wallace Wade head coach University of Alabama The above quotes were excerpted from Criswell Freemans The Wisdom of Southern Football As football season creeps ever closer the avid enthusiast finds it difficult to contain the unbridled excitement and anticipation that bubbles like summertime sweat within their pigskinthirsty souls Football season is that special time of year that not only means the beginning of another healthy slate of competitive gridiron contests filled with spectacular plays and high dramaits also the definitive rallying point for the onslaught of all the expected pomp pageantry and circumstance that goes handinhand with the college game In no conference in the country is this statement more true than the traditionrich Southeastern Conference The ongoing rivalries the colorful histories and traditions the premier tailgating the coquettish southern bells in their gameday garb the reunion of lasting friendships and the competitive fire and spirit that accompany the game all make the entire SEC football experience a very real and visceral oneeven to the most casual observer The Southeastern Conference is unequivocally the paragon of the college football conferences and the season figures not to disappoint the thousands of rabid fans that flock to the stadiums each week throughout the southeast as well as the millions more who tune in from home on the tube to follow their respective teams Quite frankly SEC football has never been bigger or better The southern cultural phenomenon only continues to grow with each passing season The number of fans and the competition that they long for each and every weekend of the football season has never been bigger or better In the SEC again set attendance records for its games and with the many recent expansions to existing stadiums in the conference those records should again fall at the end of this season Five Reasons Tiger Fans Can Be Excited About the Football Season Lou Tepper is no longer in Tiger Town Heralded by professional defensive coaches as a guru and a defensive genius prior to his arrival at LSU the former Illinois head coach led the LSU defense to its worst twoyear performance in the history of the school If you are interested in immortalizing the Tepper legacy at LSU for your scrapbook copies of his book Complete Linebacking can still be obtained at a discounted price no less at most local book outlets In Teppers absence maybe the Tigers will return to the days of coach Charlie Mac and the standout defensive units that were his trademark while at the Ole War Skule Speaking of Coach Mac I caught up with him last week at his home and he sounded as spry as a spring chicken He told me that he is doing great and that he enjoys cycling in the mornings to stay in shape Coach told me that he hopes that the LSU players have fun this year because he said having fun is what its all about If you cant have any fun youre in big trouble Contrary to popular belief the Tigers are deep at quarterback Preseason prognosticators have cited the injury to Rohan Davey as a core reason why the Tigers will have trouble at the quarterback position They all opined early that both Booty and Nall had difficulties leading the offense and that the injury to Davey was a major setback to the Tiger offense However reports from summer camp indicate that Rohan is now within percent of his normal range of motion on his knee and in light of this it would appear that the Tigers are again threedeep at the quarterback position The resurgence of Rohan is a tremendous boost to the team Known for his leadership ability both on and off the field Rohan possesses the true grit that wins ball games I caught up with former LSU AllAmerican and coach Gaynell Tinsley at his Highland Road home a few weeks ago and he told me that he thought that Rohans performance against Arkansas was the best he had ever seen by an LSU quarterback True frosh Marcus Randall impressed in the LA High School AllStar game last week but he is a likely redshirt with the logjam of experienced competition ahead of him Nick Saban Derided unfairly early by most SEC media outlets as being incompatible with Louisianians unique culture and high football expectations Saban is easily the best thing to happen to LSU football since Kevin Faulk A consummate professional Saban exudes confidence and paints a clear vision for the future of the program His presence in Red Stick has made an immediate impact on the program evidenced by the recent glowing comments at media days by seniors Louis William and Fred Booker Saban was also unfairly chastised heavily by the media for his inability to bring any assistants with him to LSU from his previous staff at Michigan State However Coach Saban recently aptly stated at the SEC media days that only a couple of his previous staff members had ever been south of the MasonDixon line That notwithstanding you cannot argue with the fact that Saban has compiled a great staff of southern coaches Tiger fans should find further solace in the fact that coach Saban has never had a losing record as a football coach Trev Faulk Bradie James at Linebacker All good defenses have a common traitgreat linebacking play and youll be hardpressed to find two better young horses than these two Outside linebacker and pass rushing specialist Jeremy Lawrence is another super sophomore to keep your eyes on These guys all have good wheels and will put the leather on you when they get the chance James number Faulks recent acquisition of Mealeys lucky will undoubtedly prompt many fans and commentators to make countless puns and jokes related to LSUs linebacking duo Predictions Dont Mean Diddly The other day I was scouring through the many rolls of microfilm in the basement of Middleton Library at LSU and I stumbled upon this most interesting fact In August LSU was picked to finish th out of SEC teams Auburn which had won the national championship the year prior with Shug Jordan was picked to repeat as conference champs followed by Ole Miss and Mississippi State Of course in spite of the dismal preseason ranking by the SEC sportswriters the Bengal Tigers went on to record their only unblemished season and national college football championship to date This story should only serve to encourage fans that are despondent over the outcome of the past two seasons in Tigertown Anything can happen in the SEC and remember the old adage says that history repeats itself Keep the faith Tigerfans Until next time

got invited to this year between the two of us and also sometime this summer Celeste and I are going to California to visit Alex and Kelly Ill let everyone know about the invite but it may be easier

Re Congrats PM Florval Hows married life I wanted to congratulate you and Celeste Again sorry we were not able to make it down for the wedding I think it is safe to assume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the First Communion we went to that Saturday I hope there are some good stories I am guessing you are back from the honeymoon at this point and you guys had a great time Hopefully you will hold off on populating the earth with any more Florvals At least give everyone a few more years to begin preparations I hope we can somehow try to get together in the near future I may try to get down there sometime late summer or fall Also there is always an open invitation at the Casa De Trahan here in DC actually Northern VA And to think in my st years all I thought existed was the Westbank There is so much more Thought you might get a kick out of that comment This invitation is good if anyone is passing through or would like to visit our nations capitol Its such a better place now that the White Trash that was living in the White House has moved out I know it not as cool as Melancon living blocks from Wrigley but you know The invite holds good not only for Mr Mrs Louis Florval Generes what the hell is that but also any of the other bums down in Houston that I have not seen if a few years Later Val Donnie

LenhartHOUECT on AM on AM To Trahan Don cc Subject Re Congrats Donnie Sounds good and you missed one hell of a weekend From what I hear everyone had an awesome time Celeste and I counted weddings we got invited to this year between the two of us and also sometime this summer Celeste and I are going to California to visit Alex and Kelly Ill let everyone know about the invite but it may be easier for you to let me know next time you come in town Send me your phone numbers again when you get a chance Val Val Generes eCommerce Technology Consultant Houston Trahan Don To Val ccenture cc Subject Re Congrats PM Florval Hows married life I wanted to congratulate you and Celeste Again sorry we were not able to make it down for the wedding I think it is safe to assume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the First Communion we went to that Saturday I hope there are some good stories I am guessing you are back from the honeymoon at this point and you guys had a great time Hopefully you will hold off on populating the earth with any more Florvals At least give everyone a few more years to begin preparations I hope we can somehow try to get together in the near future I may try to get down there sometime late summer or fall Also there is always an open invitation at the Casa De Trahan here in DC actually Northern VA And to think in my st years all I thought existed was the Westbank There is so much more Thought you might get a kick out of that comment This invitation is good if anyone is passing through or would like to visit our nations capitol Its such a better place now that the White Trash that was living in the White House has moved out I know it not as cool as Melancon living blocks from Wrigley but you know The invite holds good not only for Mr Mrs Louis Florval Generes what the hell is that but also any of the other bums down in Houston that I have not seen if a few years Later Val Donnie

welcome to another edition of ABCs Monday Night Football tonight broadcasting from beautiful Fed Ex Field in Washington DC Im Al Michaels and joining me in the booth are two new members of the ABC family Dennis Miller and Dan Fouts DENNIS MILLER Wow Monday Night Football I dont want to appear nervous but Im under more strain right now than Linda Tripps capri pants I have to tell you Im conflicted about this I usually like to be the outsider the rabblerouser the iconoclast but I also like a nice seat at a sporting event And this seat is as nice as they get except I think I took one of Boomers old squeak toys up the when I sat down DAN FOUTS I was a quarterback MILLER Thanks for that insight Mr Peabody Dan Fouts everyone Im looking over here and hes giving me that same blank stare I see when I put my dog on the phone Hey this isnt the Senior Tour Chi Chi Try to keep up MICHAELS Tonight the New England Patriots will try to get started on the right foot after a disappointing showing last season They take on the Washington Redskins whose owner Daniel Snyder has paid out million in free agent salaries and bonus payments in the offseason and is looking for results MILLER Snyder is throwing around cash like a screech monkey playing with a popup Kleenex dispenser But hes a real hard it must be great to coach this team Norv Turner comes to work every day hands his balls to Gus the yearold equipment guy who puts them in a footlocker behind the Stairmaster until the end of the game Did you catch that one chewing Turner received last season Lee Harvey Oswald got off easier in that little room at the Dallas PD And when Turner finally got out of there you could tell he was looking around desperately praying for Jack Ruby to show up and end his ing

the article below but if you need a quick summary bc you dont have time to read the whole article here it is The Southeastern Conference is unequivocally the paragon of the college football conferences CKL SEC TRADITIONS A weekly column by Chris Warner Perspectives on SEC Football and Thoughts on the Impending Football Season I would like to kickoff this column with a few choice quotes from the annals of a most colorful and telling SEC gridiron history Southern football fans are knowledgeable fair and loud They are proud of their football heritage their schools and their teams And they share a deep pride that goes with being from the south George Mooney the irreplaceable Voice of the Volunteers in the s The true football fan pays no attention to time or mileage when there is a big game to see John Heisman head coach Auburn University In Baton Rouge the focal point of everything is Tiger football Jim Corbett In Baton Rouge its not a law to love LSU but the city fathers could probably get one passed if they needed to Charles McClendon head coach LSU After so many years at a school you become a member of the football family Bob Fulton I dont care where a man comes from or how he spells his name All I ask is that he be loyal to Georgia proud of that jersey and try like the devil to win Wally Butts head coach Georgia Deep inside were still the boys of autumn that magic time of the year that once swept us on to Americas fields Archie Manning Tradition is a rich asset for any team Tradition and success are traveling companions Wallace Wade head coach University of Alabama The above quotes were excerpted from Criswell Freemans The Wisdom of Southern Football As football season creeps ever closer the avid enthusiast finds it difficult to contain the unbridled excitement and anticipation that bubbles like summertime sweat within their pigskinthirsty souls Football season is that special time of year that not only means the beginning of another healthy slate of competitive gridiron contests filled with spectacular plays and high dramaits also the definitive rallying point for the onslaught of all the expected pomp pageantry and circumstance that goes handinhand with the college game In no conference in the country is this statement more true than the traditionrich Southeastern Conference The ongoing rivalries the colorful histories and traditions the premier tailgating the coquettish southern bells in their gameday garb the reunion of lasting friendships and the competitive fire and spirit that accompany the game all make the entire SEC football experience a very real and visceral oneeven to the most casual observer The Southeastern Conference is unequivocally the paragon of the college football conferences and the season figures not to disappoint the thousands of rabid fans that flock to the stadiums each week throughout the southeast as well as the millions more who tune in from home on the tube to follow their respective teams Quite frankly SEC football has never been bigger or better The southern cultural phenomenon only continues to grow with each passing season The number of fans and the competition that they long for each and every weekend of the football season has never been bigger or better In the SEC again set attendance records for its games and with the many recent expansions to existing stadiums in the conference those records should again fall at the end of this season Five Reasons Tiger Fans Can Be Excited About the Football Season Lou Tepper is no longer in Tiger Town Heralded by professional defensive coaches as a guru and a defensive genius prior to his arrival at LSU the former Illinois head coach led the LSU defense to its worst twoyear performance in the history of the school If you are interested in immortalizing the Tepper legacy at LSU for your scrapbook copies of his book Complete Linebacking can still be obtained at a discounted price no less at most local book outlets In Teppers absence maybe the Tigers will return to the days of coach Charlie Mac and the standout defensive units that were his trademark while at the Ole War Skule Speaking of Coach Mac I caught up with him last week at his home and he sounded as spry as a spring chicken He told me that he is doing great and that he enjoys cycling in the mornings to stay in shape Coach told me that he hopes that the LSU players have fun this year because he said having fun is what its all about If you cant have any fun youre in big trouble Contrary to popular belief the Tigers are deep at quarterback Preseason prognosticators have cited the injury to Rohan Davey as a core reason why the Tigers will have trouble at the quarterback position They all opined early that both Booty and Nall had difficulties leading the offense and that the injury to Davey was a major setback to the Tiger offense However reports from summer camp indicate that Rohan is now within percent of his normal range of motion on his knee and in light of this it would appear that the Tigers are again threedeep at the quarterback position The resurgence of Rohan is a tremendous boost to the team Known for his leadership ability both on and off the field Rohan possesses the true grit that wins ball games I caught up with former LSU AllAmerican and coach Gaynell Tinsley at his Highland Road home a few weeks ago and he told me that he thought that Rohans performance against Arkansas was the best he had ever seen by an LSU quarterback True frosh Marcus Randall impressed in the LA High School AllStar game last week but he is a likely redshirt with the logjam of experienced competition ahead of him Nick Saban Derided unfairly early by most SEC media outlets as being incompatible with Louisianians unique culture and high football expectations Saban is easily the best thing to happen to LSU football since Kevin Faulk A consummate professional Saban exudes confidence and paints a clear vision for the future of the program His presence in Red Stick has made an immediate impact on the program evidenced by the recent glowing comments at media days by seniors Louis William and Fred Booker Saban was also unfairly chastised heavily by the media for his inability to bring any assistants with him to LSU from his previous staff at Michigan State However Coach Saban recently aptly stated at the SEC media days that only a couple of his previous staff members had ever been south of the MasonDixon line That notwithstanding you cannot argue with the fact that Saban has compiled a great staff of southern coaches Tiger fans should find further solace in the fact that coach Saban has never had a losing record as a football coach Trev Faulk Bradie James at Linebacker All good defenses have a common traitgreat linebacking play and youll be hardpressed to find two better young horses than these two Outside linebacker and pass rushing specialist Jeremy Lawrence is another super sophomore to keep your eyes on These guys all have good wheels and will put the leather on you when they get the chance James number Faulks recent acquisition of Mealeys lucky will undoubtedly prompt many fans and commentators to make countless puns and jokes related to LSUs linebacking duo Predictions Dont Mean Diddly The other day I was scouring through the many rolls of microfilm in the basement of Middleton Library at LSU and I stumbled upon this most interesting fact In August LSU was picked to finish th out of SEC teams Auburn which had won the national championship the year prior with Shug Jordan was picked to repeat as conference champs followed by Ole Miss and Mississippi State Of course in spite of the dismal preseason ranking by the SEC sportswriters the Bengal Tigers went on to record their only unblemished season and national college football championship to date This story should only serve to encourage fans that are despondent over the outcome of the past two seasons in Tigertown Anything can happen in the SEC and remember the old adage says that history repeats itself Keep the faith Tigerfans Until next time

Subject DUMP AT WORK Weve all been there but dont like to admit it Weve all kicked back in our cubicles and suddenly felt something a brew down below As much as we try to convince ourselves the WORK POOP is inevitable For those of you who hate pooping at work as much as I do I give you the SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR TAKING A DUMP AT WORK Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure ESCAPEE Definition A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing poop in a stall This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panicembarrassment This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding If you release an escapee do not acknowledge it Pretend it did not happen If you are standing next to the farter at the urinal pretend that you did not hear it No one likes an escapee it is uncomfortable for all involved Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy JAILBREAK Used in conjunction with escapee Definition When forcing poop several farts slip out at a machine guns pace This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover If this should happen do not panic remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred COURTESY FLUSH Definition The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME WALK OF SHAME Definition Walking from the stall to the sink to the door after you have just stunkup the bathroom This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in As with all farts it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER Definition A colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it You will often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine under their arm Always look around the office for the Out of the Closet pooper before entering the bathroom THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK PFN Definition A group of coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident This group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS SAFE HAVEN Definition A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom TURD BURGLAR Definition A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that occur when work taking a dump at work If this occurs remain in the stall until the TURD BURG leaves This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact CAMOCOUGH Definition A phony cough which alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall This can be used to coverup a WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE ASTAIRE Definition A subtle toetap that is used to alert potential TURD BURGLARS that you are occupying a stall This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied If you hear an ASTAIRE leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace WATERMELON Definition A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water This is also an embarrassing incident If you feel a WATERMELON coming on create a diversion See CAMOCOUGH HAVANA OMELET Definition A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water Often accompanied by an escapee Try using a CAMOCOUGH with an ASTAIRE UNCLE TED Definition A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper as you should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees FLY BY Definition The act of scouting out a

Again the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us this time however with the Nebraska fight songs Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced that we

taunting me I am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be

make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl And then I spoke these memorable words And not those damn refundable tickets either You request those nonrefundable nontransferrable

phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans I am KING and these are my subjects I distribute the beers in my pants to the cheering masses I RULE the pregame kingdom Kickoff Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy I notice something troubling Nebraska is big Nebraska is fast Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas The first quarter mercifully ends yards total offense for Texas Zero first downs for Texas Im still talking shit I pour another stiffy from the Traveler Four minutes to go in the first half the Traveler is a dead soldier I buy my first beer from the Alamodome merchants While I am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone Safety Halftime score Nebraska Texas I wish I had another Traveler While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime I attempt to revive the classic Briceism from the South Bend bathroom Hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock He is unamused I buy my nd and rd beer from the Alamodome merchants I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka I send them off to purchase Sprites so that we may consume their vodka I have not lost faith Nebraska is a bunch of pussies No more vodka The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives I purchase two more beers from the Alamodome merchants Score is Nebraska Texas I am beginning to lose faith This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field I call Southwest Airlines Im sorry sir Those tickets have been confirmed and are nonrefundable and nontransferrable I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter As it turns out the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than minutes on the game clock I am enraged by this policy I ask loudly Why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking PA system Back in my seats I am slumped in my chair in defeat All of a sudden the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts Whazzis I mutter awaking from my coma Iz we winnig Did wez scort Alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score The largest by far cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters S K and A in the Nebraska spelled out in their end zone I cheer wildly I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it I am thirsty Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck I would taunt them with some offcolor remarks about their parentage but I am too drunk to form complete sentences With my last cognitive thought of the evening I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October they would be playing Florida State for the national championship Back in the car On the way back to Austin for the TexasArizona tip off We can still salvage the day I crack open a beer It is warm I dont care We have stopped for gas I am hungry I go inside the store I walk past the beer frig I notice a Zima Ive never had a Zima I wonder if its any good I pull a Zima from the frig I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows Zima sucks I replace the empty bottle in the frig There is a Blimpie Subs in the store I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub There is no one there I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives I eat them I am still hungry I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami The patrons in the store fear me I dont care We are in South Austin I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour My truckmate is tired of my singing He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides Youre Going to Miss Me When Im Gone and Neon Moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own I tell him to fuck off and restart Neon Moon We arrive at the Erwin Center My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage I tell him hes an idiot I tell him we will never get out I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here He ignores me I think hes still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes I whistle Neon Moon loudly I am rallying I have warm beers stuffed in my pants Were going to kick the shit out of Arizona Halftime score Texas Arizona I am pleased I go to the bathroom to pee for the th time today I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom Brice There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom I am disappointed I tell myself out loud that I have a Niiiiiice cock No one is amused but me I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can Needless to say they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center much less Bud Light out of a can I am stopped by an usher Where did you get that sir I tell him no shit Oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs Would you mind throwing this away for me I take the last swig and hand it to him He is confused I pretend Im going to the bathroom but I run away giggling instead I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me I sneak into a large group of people and sit down The usher walks by harmlessly I am giggling like a little girl I crack open another can of Bud Light I am lost In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings I have no ticket stub I cannot find my seats Texas is losing Texas is being screwed by the refs I am enraged I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it A concerned fan asks if Im OK and perhaps I shouldnt take it so seriously I tell him to fuck off After the fourth consecutive worst fucking call I have EVER seen I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects However on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a onequarter inch gash over my eye I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt Perhaps I think to myself Im taking this a bit seriously I am standing in the bathroom peeing Im so drunk I am swaying and grunting I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye My pants are bloody I have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist I look like I should be in an episode of Cops Texas has lost I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits I am stopped every seconds by a good samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why I am covered in blood but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving With my one good eye I have located the parking garage I walk up six flights of stairs promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I take a nap I awake from my nap I see my friend in the drivers seat I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I am too tired to punch my friend I call my friend a Stupid fuck I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck I am jostled The truck is moving I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor I jump out of the truck walk to the edge of the parking facility and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to Neon Moon We are moving We are out of beer I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers I am happy I return to my vehicle We have emerged from the parking facility We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him We are all going to die tonight We have finished threequarters of the bottle of Glenlivet We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsthers Ed has to pee He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsthers The PollyEsthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club Fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughter Ive been working this door for almost a year Ive been working doors in this town for almost years And I can honestly say that I aint never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three Sorry cant let you in We attempt to reason with him He laughs harder We find a bar that lets us in We take two steps in the door and hear Last call for alcohol I turn to the group and mutter See dat wasnt that fuckin hard Day dont fuckin do that at the Awamothe awaomthe alabfuck it that stadium we was at today We order shots of tequila and three beers Back on the street We need food We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katzs The cab fare is We give him and tell him to keep it There is a minute wait We give the hostess We are seated immediately We order two orders of fried pickles a Cobb salad a bowl of soup two orders of Blueberry blintzes two Reuben sandwiches a hamburger two cheese stuffed potatoes an order of fries and an order of onion rings The food arrives We are all asleep with our heads on the table The waiter wakes us up We eat every fucking bit of our food Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted We dont give a shit The tab is with tip Im sleepy I wake up next to a strange woman She is the bartender at Katzs She is not pretty

Kickoff Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy I notice something troubling Nebraska is big Nebraska is fast Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas The first quarter mercifully ends yards total offense for Texas Zero first downs for Texas Im still talking shit I pour another stiffy from the Traveler Four minutes to go in the first half the Traveler is a dead soldier I buy my first beer from the Alamodome merchants While I am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone Safety Halftime score Nebraska Texas I wish I had another Traveler While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime I attempt to revive the classic Briceism from the South Bend bathroom Hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock He is unamused I buy my nd and rd beer from the Alamodome merchants I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka I send them off to purchase Sprites so that we may consume their vodka I have not lost faith Nebraska is a bunch of pussies No more vodka The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives I purchase two more beers from the Alamodome merchants Score is Nebraska Texas I am beginning to lose faith This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field I call Southwest Airlines Im sorry sir Those tickets have been confirmed and are nonrefundable and nontransferrable I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter As it turns out the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than minutes on the game clock I am enraged by this policy I ask loudly Why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking PA system Back in my seats I am slumped in my chair in defeat All of a sudden the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts Whazzis I mutter awaking from my coma Iz we winnig Did wez scort Alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score The largest by far cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters S K and A in the Nebraska spelled out in their end zone I cheer wildly I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it I am thirsty Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck I would taunt them with some offcolor remarks about their parentage but I am too drunk to form complete sentences With my last cognitive thought of the evening I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October they would be playing Florida State for the national championship Back in the car On the way back to Austin for the TexasArizona tip off We can still salvage the day I crack open a beer It is warm I dont care We have stopped for gas I am hungry I go inside the store I walk past the beer frig I notice a Zima Ive never had a Zima I wonder if its any good I pull a Zima from the frig I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows Zima sucks I replace the empty bottle in the frig There is a Blimpie Subs in the store I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub There is no one there I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives I eat them I am still hungry I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami The patrons in the store fear me I dont care We are in South Austin I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour My truckmate is tired of my singing He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides Youre Going to Miss Me When Im Gone and Neon Moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own I tell him to fuck off and restart Neon Moon We arrive at the Erwin Center My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage I tell him hes an idiot I tell him we will never get out I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here He ignores me I think hes still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes I whistle Neon Moon loudly I am rallying I have warm beers stuffed in my pants Were going to kick the shit out of Arizona Halftime score Texas Arizona I am pleased I go to the bathroom to pee for the th time today I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom Brice There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom I am disappointed I tell myself out loud that I have a Niiiiiice cock No one is amused but me I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can Needless to say they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center much less Bud Light out of a can I am stopped by an usher Where did you get that sir I tell him no shit Oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs Would you mind throwing this away for me I take the last swig and hand it to him He is confused I pretend Im going to the bathroom but I run away giggling instead I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me I sneak into a large group of people and sit down The usher walks by harmlessly I am giggling like a little girl I crack open another can of Bud Light I am lost In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings I have no ticket stub I cannot find my seats Texas is losing Texas is being screwed by the refs I am enraged I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it A concerned fan asks if Im OK and perhaps I shouldnt take it so seriously I tell him to fuck off After the fourth consecutive worst fucking call I have EVER seen I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects However on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a onequarter inch gash over my eye I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt Perhaps I think to myself Im taking this a bit seriously I am standing in the bathroom peeing Im so drunk I am swaying and grunting I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye My pants are bloody I have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist I look like I should be in an episode of Cops Texas has lost I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits I am stopped every seconds by a good samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why I am covered in blood but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving With my one good eye I have located the parking garage I walk up six flights of stairs promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I take a nap I awake from my nap I see my friend in the drivers seat I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I am too tired to punch my friend I call my friend a Stupid fuck I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck I am jostled The truck is moving I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor I jump out of the truck walk to the edge of the parking facility and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to Neon Moon We are moving We are out of beer I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers I am happy I return to my vehicle We have emerged from the parking facility We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him We are all going to die tonight We have finished threequarters of the bottle of Glenlivet We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsthers Ed has to pee He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsthers The PollyEsthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club Fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughter Ive been working this door for almost a year Ive been working doors in this town for almost years And I can honestly say that I aint never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three Sorry cant let you in We attempt to reason with him He laughs harder We find a bar that lets us in We take two steps in the door and hear Last call for alcohol I turn to the group and mutter See dat wasnt that fuckin hard Day dont fuckin do that at the Awamothe awaomthe alabfuck it that stadium we was at today We order shots of tequila and three beers Back on the street We need food We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katzs The cab fare is We give him and tell him to keep it There is a minute wait We give the hostess We are seated immediately We order two orders of fried pickles a Cobb salad a bowl of soup two orders of Blueberry blintzes two Reuben sandwiches a hamburger two cheese stuffed potatoes an order of fries and an order of onion rings The food arrives We are all asleep with our heads on the table The waiter wakes us up We eat every fucking bit of our food Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted We dont give a shit The tab is with tip Im sleepy I wake up next to a strange woman She is the bartender at Katzs She is not pretty

Don cc nich otmail com t bjb SubjectRe Congrats Donnie Sounds good and you missed one hell of a weekend From what I hear everyone had an awesome time Celeste and I counted weddings we got invited to this year between the two of us and also sometime this summer Celeste and I are going to California to visit Alex and Kelly Ill let everyone know about the invite but it may be easier for you to let me know next time you come in town Send me your phone numbers again when you get a chance Val Val Generes eCommerce Technology Consultant Houston Trahan Don To Val ccenture cc Subject Re Congrats PM Florval Hows married life I wanted to congratulate you and Celeste Again sorry we were not able to make it down for the wedding I think it is safe to assume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the First Communion we went to that Saturday I hope there are some good stories I am guessing you are back from the honeymoon at this point and you guys had a great time Hopefully you will hold off on populating the earth with any more Florvals At least give everyone a few more years to begin preparations I hope we can somehow try to get together in the near future I may try to get down there sometime late summer or fall Also there is always an open invitation at the Casa De Trahan here in DC actually Northern VA And to think in my st years all I thought existed was the Westbank There is so much more Thought you might get a kick out of that comment This invitation is good if anyone is passing through or would like to visit our nations capitol Its such a better place now that the White Trash that was living in the White House has moved out I know it not as cool as Melancon living blocks from Wrigley but you know The invite holds good not only for Mr Mrs Louis Florval Generes what the hell is that but also any of the other bums down in Houston that I have not seen if a few years Later Val Donnie

Darwin Award its an annual honor given to the person who provided the universal human gene pool the biggest service by getting killed in the most extraordinarily stupid way As always competition this year has been keen again Some candidates appear to have trained their whole lives for this event THE RUNNERUPS Detroit A yearold man got stuck and drowned in two feet of water after squeezing head first through an inch wide sewer grate to retrieve his car keys San Francisco A yearold stockbroker who totally zoned when he ran according to his wife jogged off a foot high cliff on his daily run Buston NC a man died on a beach when an footdeep hole he had dug into the sand caved in as he sat inside it Beachgoers said Daniel Jones dug the hole for fun or for protection from the wind and had been sitting in a beach chair at the bottom when it collapsed burying him beneath feet of sand People used their hands and shovels trying to claw their way to Jones a resident of Woodbridge VA but could not reach him It took rescue workers using heavy equipment almost an hour to free him while about people looked on Jones was pronounced dead at the hospital Lompoc CA Santiago Alvarado was killed as he fell facefirst through the ceiling of a bicycle shop he was burglarizing Death was caused when the long flashlight he had placed in his mouth rammed into the base of his skull as he hit the floor Dahlonega GA ROTC cadet Nick Berrena was stabbed to death by fellow cadet Jeffrey Hoffman who was trying to prove that a knife could not penetrate the flack vest Berrena was wearing Selbyville DE Sylvester Briddell Jr was killed as he won a bet with friends who said he would not put a revolver loaded with four bullets into his mouth and pull the trigger Windsor Ontario Daniel Kolta and Randy Taylor died in a headon collision thus earning a tie in the game of chicken they were playing with their snowmobiles Taos NM A woman went to a poison control center after eating three birthcontrol vaginal inserts Marie Valishnokov who spoke little English thought the inserts were candy or gum being unable to read the foil wrappers After the third one she realized something was wrong with her throat and her mouth began to fill with a sourtasting foam She ran for the Poison Control Center where doctors were able to flush the foam from her mouth throat and stomach with no ill effects La Grange GA Attorney Antonio Mendoza was released from a trauma center after having a cell phone removed from his rectum My dog drags the thing all over the house he said later He must have dragged it into the shower I slipped on the tile tripped against the dog and sat down right on the thing The extraction took more than three hours because the cover to Mendozas phone had opened during insertion He was a real trooper during the entire episode said Dr Dennis Crobe Tony just cracked jokes and really seemed to be enjoying himself Three times during the extraction his phone rang and each time he made jokes about it that just had us rolling on the floor By the time we finished we really did expect to find an answering machine in there Bremerton WA Christopher Coulter and his wife Emily were engaging in bondage games when Christopher suggested spreading peanut butter on his genitals and letting Rudy their Irish Setter lick them clean Sadly Rudy lost control and began tearing at Christophers penis and testicles Rudy refused to obey commands and a panicked Emily threw a bottle of perfume at the dog The bottle broke covering the dog and Christopher with perfume Rudy leaped back tearing away the penis While trying to get her unconscious husband in the car to take him to the hospital Emily fell twice injuring her wrists and ankle Christophers penis was put in a Styrofoam ice cooler Chris is just plain lucky said the surgeon who spent eight hours reattaching the penis Believe it or not the perfume turned out to be very fortuitous The high alcohol content which must have been excruciatingly painful helped sterilize the wound Also aside from it being removed the damage caused by the dogs teeth to the penis per se is minimal Its really a very stringy piece of flesh Mr Coulter stands an excellent chance of regaining the use of that limb Washington Animal Control has no plans to seize Rudy AND THE WINNER Paderborn Germany Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt fed his constipated elephant Stefan doses of animal laxative and more than a bushel of berries figs and prunes before the pluggedup pachyderm finally let fly and suffocated the keeper under pounds of poop Investigators say illfated Friedrich was attempting to give the ailing elephant an oliveoil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on him like a dumptruck full of mud The sheer force of the elephants

Blanchard was a GDI his first semester at LSU While livin g in Power dorm Blanchard once overheard one of the Pi PHi for boys that h e was hanging out with say Hey Dude Sorority girls are hot Blanchard being from Paincourteville and not being what we would call a master of the English language though that this fresh Pi Phi meant All greek girl s are good in bed So what did Blanchard do He went out and found the f irst GREEK girl he could and he started dating her After many pleasant y ears some of which I will not mention for Tims sake and mine Tim and his Greek Goddess are engaged Yes thats right Tim took Lenharts advi ce because we all know that Lenhart is the authority on relationships with the opposite sex I mean who wouldnt take his advice and Tim decided to start his life sentence with a lovely girl who has bunch of friends who al l give it up like it was going out o f style Tims wedding is on THE DAY OF THE MISSISSIPPI STATE GAME For those of yo u who are not Tiger fans which seems to be most of you these days that i s Oct th I know it is an away game which is better than having a wed ding on a home game But some of us who are fans like to go to the out of town games True story here I went to a wedding with Louise and her mot her on Friday night You have not lived until you take two dates to a wedd ing one of whom is engaged to your good friend and the other whom cannot s peak the language Anyway after the wedding that we attended Louises mo m asked me if I would prefer Tims wedding ceremony be in either half Engli sh and half Greek or all in Greek I responded I do not care I will be listening to the LSU game on my headphones anyway I know what some of y ou are saying it is only one game Yes and I am sure that was the only w eekend they could hav e it since so many of us from New Orleans have been to a wedding at the Greek Cultural Center because all of us from New Orlea ns have been to numerous weddings goat roasts there Anyway it is a don e deal and we are all happy for the couple The real point of this email is to organize Tims bachelor party We have it planned for the weekend of September what a novel idea Plan a w edding event on a weekend where there is neither an LSU event nor Jazz Fes t We are planning to go to Vegas As per our current plans we would leave on that Thursday the th I think and return on Sunday Paw Paw Blanchard heard that in September his game of choice really starts hittin g that of course would be the nickel slots Paw Paw already has his Pan ama Jack hat his Geaux Dinardeaux Tshirt his jams and his bl ack socks with brown leather sandals packed and ready His fanny pack is s tuffed with Twinkies and silver dimes He is really fired up about the shrimp cocktail early bird special of course The plans are to get there Thursday night Nicky get more drink tickets Thursday night we can get settled possibly gamble a bit On Friday mayb e play golf although I will probably be too drunk hung over missing fo r an early tee time On Friday night we can go clubbin as I am sure The Tricky Texas Trio Lenhart Landry and Mitch will want to do On Sat urday Tim wants to wake up early get the sports section of the Advocate drink coffee and bitch about the Tigers Instead we are going to watch a nd bet on College Football all day Saturday night Tim wants to go see Sigfried and Roy However we are not doing that If he wants to see gay men play with caged tigers he can find out the next time Nesbitt tries out for the LSU cheerleading team Instea d either SaturDay or Friday night myself and a select group yet to be de termined but including Lenhart if he is not doing his best Ricky Martin im pression at Club CK will go on a recon mission to the Deja Vu Therefore on Saturday night we will have entertainment in the room that some of us have seen before and who know what is expected of them that way Lenhart will not make the entertainment cry when he asks them to fuck his Elway bl owup doll Remember Tim If you use a strap on it is not considered ch eating I am a future lawyer I should know This weekend is September There is no excuse for you to come up with w hen you have this much notice Out of money Bullshit Save up until the n Have to work Bullshit Take a vacation day Actually September wil l be the first month that I will be gainfully employed But I know that m y boss the Honorable GThomas Porteous will let me off for one day if deb auchery will be had although I may have to put a few hundreds on black for him periodically throughout the weekend For those of you who will be recently married I already have an excuse for you Honey Tim came to all OUR wedding functions The least I can do i s return the favor For those of you that will be married shortly after Tim I also have an exc use Baby Schmoopy I wish your tits were as big as Mindy if want oth er people to come to our wedding functions then I have to attend theirs For all of you single guys no excuse Please respond to this

Original Message From Lawrence Centola mailto Sent Thursday April AM To sdarrah maziarz socalcinephile bcambr chadlandry matthewlenhart MMMarcantel nicholasdanna RCasey timothyblanchard tdietz valgeneres dural Subject Re Blanchard As we all know Blanchard was a GDI his first semester at LSU While living in Power dorm Blanchard once overheard one of the Pi PHi for boys that he was hanging out with say Hey Dude Sorority girls are hot Blanchard being from Paincourteville and not being what we would call a master of the English language though that this fresh Pi Phi meant All greek girls are good in bed So what did Blanchard do He went out and found the first GREEK girl he could and he started dating her After many pleasant years some of which I will not mention for Tims sake and mine Tim and his Greek Goddess are engaged Yes thats right Tim took Lenharts advice because we all know that Lenhart is the authority on relationships with the opposite sex I mean who wouldnt take his advice and Tim decided to start his life sentence with a lovely girl who has bunch of friends who all give it up like it was going out o f style Tims wedding is on THE DAY OF THE MISSISSIPPI STATE GAME For those of you who are not Tiger fans which seems to be most of you these days that is Oct th I know it is an away game which is better than having a wedding on a home game But some of us who are fans like to go to the out of town games True story here I went to a wedding with Louise and her mother on Friday night You have not lived until you take two dates to a wedding one of whom is engaged to your good friend and the other whom cannot speak the language Anyway after the wedding that we attended Louises mom asked me if I would prefer Tims wedding ceremony be in either half English and half Greek or all in Greek I responded I do not care I will be listening to the LSU game on my headphones anyway I know what some of you are saying it is only one game Yes and I am sure that was the only weekend they could hav e it since so many of us from New Orleans have been to a wedding at the Greek Cultural Center because all of us from New Orleans have been to numerous weddings goat roasts there Anyway it is a done deal and we are all happy for the couple The real point of this email is to organize Tims bachelor party We have it planned for the weekend of September what a novel idea Plan a wedding event on a weekend where there is neither an LSU event nor Jazz Fest We are planning to go to Vegas As per our current plans we would leave on that Thursday the th I think and return on Sunday Paw Paw Blanchard heard that in September his game of choice really starts hitting that of course would be the nickel slots Paw Paw already has his Panama Jack hat his Geaux Dinardeaux Tshirt his jams and his black socks with brown leather sandals packed and ready His fanny pack is stuffed with Twinkies and silver dimes He is really fired up about the shrimp cocktail early bird special of course The plans are to get there Thursday night Nicky get more drink tickets Thursday night we can get settled possibly gamble a bit On Friday maybe play golf although I will probably be too drunk hung over missing for an early tee time On Friday night we can go clubbin as I am sure The Tricky Texas Trio Lenhart Landry and Mitch will want to do On Saturday Tim wants to wake up early get the sports section of the Advocate drink coffee and bitch about the Tigers Instead we are going to watch and bet on College Football all day Saturday night Tim wants to go see Sigfried and Roy However we are not doing that If he wants to see gay men play with caged tigers he can find out the next time Nesbitt tries out for the LSU cheerleading team Instead either SaturDay or Friday night myself and a select group yet to be determined but including Lenhart if he is not doing his best Ricky Martin impression at Club CK will go on a recon mission to the Deja Vu Therefore on Saturday night we will have entertainment in the room that some of us have seen before and who know what is expected of them that way Lenhart will not make the entertainment cry when he asks them to fuck his Elway blowup doll Remember Tim If you use a strap on it is not considered cheating I am a future lawyer I should know This weekend is September There is no excuse for you to come up with when you have this much notice Out of money Bullshit Save up until then Have to work Bullshit Take a vacation day Actually September will be the first month that I will be gainfully employed But I know that my boss the Honorable GThomas Porteous will let me off for one day if debauchery will be had although I may have to put a few hundreds on black for him periodically throughout the weekend For those of you who will be recently married I already have an excuse for you Honey Tim came to all OUR wedding functions The least I can do is return the favor For those of you that will be married shortly after Tim I also have an excuse Baby Schmoopy I wish your tits were as big as Mindy if want other people to come to our wedding functions then I have to attend theirs For all of you single

THIS ARTICLE INTO THE HANDS OF EVERY LSU FAN YOU KNOW SPORTS COMMENTARY LSUs famed Death Valley is a fraud Mike Bianchi October It happened yet again earlier this week The talking heads on one of the sports networks came on and started previewing Floridas game at LSU on Saturday and sure enough the first words out of Pavlovs mouth were these Tiger Stadium might just be the toughest place in the nation to play Give that man a liver snack This is my No pet peeve in all of sports the perpetual misinformation and baseless genuflecting at the mere mention of LSUs Death Valley The three biggest myths in popular world culture are in reverse order The Loch ness Monster The Skunk Ape LSUs homefield advantage Why is it that magazine after magazine and commentator after commentator insist on perpetuating the biggest fish story in college football Sport magazine named Tiger Stadium the most feared roadplaying site in America Gannett News Service named Tiger Stadium the most dreaded road site in America Just last week ESPNcom did a poll asking respondents to name the five college football venues they would most like to visit The choices Michigan Notre Dame Tennessee Nebraska and LSU Are you kidding me Putting Tiger Stadium on a list with other such legendary football destinations is like conducting a poll of the great vacation destinations and offering up these choices Hawaii Orlando Tahiti Las Vegas and Scranton Do the people who conduct these polls actually I dont know pay attention You want to know how intimidating Tiger Stadium is LSUs home record against Alabama the past years is LSUs home record against SEC teams the past years is LSUs home record against Floridas past two football coaches Galen Hall and Steve Spurrier is Its so easy to win at LSU that Hall beat the Tigers in and UF officials were so impressed they fired him the next day Actually LSU barely plays better at home than it does away That SEC home record over the past decade is only barely better than its road mark Has any venue been more of a onehit wonder than Tiger Stadium which has been living off Billy Cannons famous punt return for nearly a halfcentury now Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods had Billy Dont Be a Hero LSU had Billy Do Be a Hero Not just anybody goes into Tiger Stadium and wins everybody and his brother does UAB did last year Houston did in In the past three years Ole Miss Alabama Auburn Florida and Georgia have Are we leaving anybody out Oh yeah I almost forgot Kentucky has too ESPN college football analyst Lee Corso says its not Tiger Stadium thats so tough its Tiger Stadium at night thats so tough If you check it out over the last few years Ill bet you they win eight out of home games at night he said Not so fast my friend Well then how about seven out of Corso said Wrong again In the s LSU was at home at night thats barely six out of And a lot of those victories came against moonpies such as Arkansas State Western Carolina and Pinkys Cosmetology Institute Its name is Tiger Stadium they should call it Pussycat Pavilion Opponents call it Death Valley they should call Life Blood Its time to stop spreading the biggest lie in all of sports That Tiger

Will Barnhill Jim Cc mailto Subject Racist photos of fraternity members rocks Auburn brings condemnation By DREW JUBERA mailto mailto Atlanta JournalConstitution Staff Writer Auburn Ala When the Southern Poverty Law Center received a call this week about Internet photos of an Auburn University fraternity member dressed as a rifletoting Klansman pretending to lynch a white student in blackface the staff checked out the photos date We wanted to verify that it was taken in not said Kelvin Datcher of the center in Montgomery that tracks incidents of bigotry The kids who called us were frantic The photo and others of students in blackface wearing Afros jewelry and jerseys with the lettering of a black fraternity were taken this year at Halloween parties at two fraternity houses and posted on the Internet by a partyphoto service The incident has rocked the campus of more than students which bills itself as the loveliest village on the plain and says it is intent on recruiting minorities As the photos illustrate a racist segregated past is hard to escape Students at Auburn and other colleges have no personal memory of Jim Crow segregation But when it comes to socializing many students gravitate toward those of their own race And social fraternities and sororities many of which used to enforce racial exclusionary clauses remain some of the last bastions of segregationist attitudes Last year when a black freshman applied to the University of Georgias allwhite Alpha Gamma Delta most of the members were adamant that she be rejected If we had a black girl in our sorority none of the fraternities would want to do anything with us one was quoted as saying That incident came to light because one sorority member Ali Davis filed a racial discrimination complaint UGA temporarily suspended Alpha Gamma Delta during an investigation Davis saying she felt ostracized later left the school Around the country the Kappa Alpha Order which is fond of displaying the Confederate battle flag has been implicated in various racial incidents in recent years the Southern Poverty Law Center reported The Louisiana Tech University chapter was placed on probation after a confrontation with black football players in which frat members made racist remarks the center said At Millsaps College in Mississippi Kappa Alphas dressed in Afro wigs and blackface to protest prominority initiatives In February the KA chapter at the University of North Texas received a fiveyear suspension for disorderly conduct and verbal intimidation after some members were accused of racist remarks Such antics arent limited to Kappa Alpha or the South the Southern Poverty Law Center said Several fraternities and sororities at New Hampshires Dartmouth College threw a ghetto party in which students dressed up as urban AfricanAmericans a theme that has surfaced at other campuses while a sorority there promoted a slave auction fundraiser The Sigma Chi fraternity at the University of NebraskaLincoln burned a cross at one of its ceremonies Such incidents leave college administrators especially those assigned to foster diversity wringing their hands Weve been working so hard to do the right thing and then something like this happens Doyle Bickers Auburns director of admissions said Wednesday of the warped Halloween humor It breaks your heart You cant escape your history added Jim Hardin an adviser in the student life center When something like this comes up the question is Have you really changed or are you just putting on a good front What has changed at Auburn according to many black students who make up percent of the student body is the administrations swift and open reaction Interim President William F Walker immediately condemned the costumes as shocking and outrageous and suspended the fraternities Beta Theta Pi and Delta Sigma Phi He attended a meeting of the Black Student Union and promised a thorough but swift investigation which is expected to be completed within days Stories on the incident were displayed on the universitys Web site Delta Sigma Phi has expelled the two members who dressed as a Klansman and his lynching victim and suspended four others Similar things have happened before said Roland Harris a junior management information systems major and member of Phi Beta Sigma one of four historically black fraternities on campus But this time a lot of people saw it and they have to do something Auburn admitted its first black student surrounded by Alabama state troopers in The first black man pledged a traditionally white fraternity in and there currently is one black pledge among those fraternities Auburns overall black population is still less than at most Southeastern Conference universities but steppedup recruiting efforts led to a percent increase of AfricanAmericans admitted to this years freshman class One sign of changing times The universitys Student Government Association president is an AfricanAmerican We were finally beginning to say Thank God were making some headway and here comes this sad unfortunate damaging incident said John BelloOgunu head of the universitys office of multicultural affairs It will no doubt be detrimental to our efforts to attract not only minority students but faculty and other staff as well BelloOgunu said the administrations reaction has been on the mark He added that more action is needed including diversity training for fraternities At the invitation of university officials and students the Southern Poverty Law Center will conduct a mass workshop on tolerance on Wednesday Prentice Gilbert an Auburn senior who oversees the campus historically black fraternities and who has helped recruit black students said it will take time to remedy the Halloween incidents impact I have to keep reminding myself these were the actions of a few individuals who do not represent Auburn as a whole Gilbert said This is the most devastating blow we could take The bottom line is do we really want to be the Auburn family he added If so we really could become the loveliest village on the plain as our motto says Ned Hansen Senior Recruiter Medical Marketing LucasGroup Recruiting

the article below but if you need a quick summary bc you dont have time to read the whole article here it is The Southeastern Conference is unequivocally the paragon of the college football conferences CKL SEC TRADITIONS A weekly column by Chris Warner Perspectives on SEC Football and Thoughts on the Impending Football Season I would like to kickoff this column with a few choice quotes from the annals of a most colorful and telling SEC gridiron history Southern football fans are knowledgeable fair and loud They are proud of their football heritage their schools and their teams And they share a deep pride that goes with being from the south George Mooney the irreplaceable Voice of the Volunteers in the s The true football fan pays no attention to time or mileage when there is a big game to see John Heisman head coach Auburn University In Baton Rouge the focal point of everything is Tiger football Jim Corbett In Baton Rouge its not a law to love LSU but the city fathers could probably get one passed if they needed to Charles McClendon head coach LSU After so many years at a school you become a member of the football family Bob Fulton I dont care where a man comes from or how he spells his name All I ask is that he be loyal to Georgia proud of that jersey and try like the devil to win Wally Butts head coach Georgia Deep inside were still the boys of autumn that magic time of the year that once swept us on to Americas fields Archie Manning Tradition is a rich asset for any team Tradition and success are traveling companions Wallace Wade head coach University of Alabama The above quotes were excerpted from Criswell Freemans The Wisdom of Southern Football As football season creeps ever closer the avid enthusiast finds it difficult to contain the unbridled excitement and anticipation that bubbles like summertime sweat within their pigskinthirsty souls Football season is that special time of year that not only means the beginning of another healthy slate of competitive gridiron contests filled with spectacular plays and high dramaits also the definitive rallying point for the onslaught of all the expected pomp pageantry and circumstance that goes handinhand with the college game In no conference in the country is this statement more true than the traditionrich Southeastern Conference The ongoing rivalries the colorful histories and traditions the premier tailgating the coquettish southern bells in their gameday garb the reunion of lasting friendships and the competitive fire and spirit that accompany the game all make the entire SEC football experience a very real and visceral oneeven to the most casual observer The Southeastern Conference is unequivocally the paragon of the college football conferences and the season figures not to disappoint the thousands of rabid fans that flock to the stadiums each week throughout the southeast as well as the millions more who tune in from home on the tube to follow their respective teams Quite frankly SEC football has never been bigger or better The southern cultural phenomenon only continues to grow with each passing season The number of fans and the competition that they long for each and every weekend of the football season has never been bigger or better In the SEC again set attendance records for its games and with the many recent expansions to existing stadiums in the conference those records should again fall at the end of this season Five Reasons Tiger Fans Can Be Excited About the Football Season Lou Tepper is no longer in Tiger Town Heralded by professional defensive coaches as a guru and a defensive genius prior to his arrival at LSU the former Illinois head coach led the LSU defense to its worst twoyear performance in the history of the school If you are interested in immortalizing the Tepper legacy at LSU for your scrapbook copies of his book Complete Linebacking can still be obtained at a discounted price no less at most local book outlets In Teppers absence maybe the Tigers will return to the days of coach Charlie Mac and the standout defensive units that were his trademark while at the Ole War Skule Speaking of Coach Mac I caught up with him last week at his home and he sounded as spry as a spring chicken He told me that he is doing great and that he enjoys cycling in the mornings to stay in shape Coach told me that he hopes that the LSU players have fun this year because he said having fun is what its all about If you cant have any fun youre in big trouble Contrary to popular belief the Tigers are deep at quarterback Preseason prognosticators have cited the injury to Rohan Davey as a core reason why the Tigers will have trouble at the quarterback position They all opined early that both Booty and Nall had difficulties leading the offense and that the injury to Davey was a major setback to the Tiger offense However reports from summer camp indicate that Rohan is now within percent of his normal range of motion on his knee and in light of this it would appear that the Tigers are again threedeep at the quarterback position The resurgence of Rohan is a tremendous boost to the team Known for his leadership ability both on and off the field Rohan possesses the true grit that wins ball games I caught up with former LSU AllAmerican and coach Gaynell Tinsley at his Highland Road home a few weeks ago and he told me that he thought that Rohans performance against Arkansas was the best he had ever seen by an LSU quarterback True frosh Marcus Randall impressed in the LA High School AllStar game last week but he is a likely redshirt with the logjam of experienced competition ahead of him Nick Saban Derided unfairly early by most SEC media outlets as being incompatible with Louisianians unique culture and high football expectations Saban is easily the best thing to happen to LSU football since Kevin Faulk A consummate professional Saban exudes confidence and paints a clear vision for the future of the program His presence in Red Stick has made an immediate impact on the program evidenced by the recent glowing comments at media days by seniors Louis William and Fred Booker Saban was also unfairly chastised heavily by the media for his inability to bring any assistants with him to LSU from his previous staff at Michigan State However Coach Saban recently aptly stated at the SEC media days that only a couple of his previous staff members had ever been south of the MasonDixon line That notwithstanding you cannot argue with the fact that Saban has compiled a great staff of southern coaches Tiger fans should find further solace in the fact that coach Saban has never had a losing record as a football coach Trev Faulk Bradie James at Linebacker All good defenses have a common traitgreat linebacking play and youll be hardpressed to find two better young horses than these two Outside linebacker and pass rushing specialist Jeremy Lawrence is another super sophomore to keep your eyes on These guys all have good wheels and will put the leather on you when they get the chance James number Faulks recent acquisition of Mealeys lucky will undoubtedly prompt many fans and commentators to make countless puns and jokes related to LSUs linebacking duo Predictions Dont Mean Diddly The other day I was scouring through the many rolls of microfilm in the basement of Middleton Library at LSU and I stumbled upon this most interesting fact In August LSU was picked to finish th out of SEC teams Auburn which had won the national championship the year prior with Shug Jordan was picked to repeat as conference champs followed by Ole Miss and Mississippi State Of course in spite of the dismal preseason ranking by the SEC sportswriters the Bengal Tigers went on to record their only unblemished season and national college football championship to date This story should only serve to encourage fans that are despondent over the outcome of the past two seasons in Tigertown Anything can happen in the SEC and remember the old adage says that history repeats itself Keep the faith Tigerfans Until next time

got invited to this year between the two of us and also sometime this summer Celeste and I are going to California to visit Alex and Kelly Ill let everyone know about the invite but it may be easier for you to let me know next time you come in town Send me your phone numbers again when you get a chance Val Val Generes eCommerce Technology Consultant Houston Trahan Don To Val ccenture cc Subject Re Congrats PM Florval Hows married life I wanted to congratulate you and Celeste Again sorry we were not able to make it down for the wedding I think it is safe to assume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the First Communion we went to that Saturday I hope there are some good stories I am guessing you are back from the honeymoon at this point and you guys had a great time Hopefully you will hold off on populating the earth with any more Florvals At least give everyone a few more years to begin preparations I hope we can somehow try to get together in the near future I may try to get down there sometime late summer or fall Also there is always an open invitation at the Casa De Trahan here in DC actually Northern VA And to think in my st years all I thought existed was the Westbank There is so much more Thought you might get a kick out of that comment This invitation is good if anyone is passing through or would like to visit our nations capitol Its such a better place now that the White Trash that was living in the White House has moved out I know it not as cool as Melancon living blocks from Wrigley but you know The invite holds good not only for Mr Mrs Louis Florval
