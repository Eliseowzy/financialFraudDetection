Heights and have lived in the Heights for the past years I love it for the very reasons Jeff Balke has stated I also love not having to get on the freeway to drive to work every day I used to live in Kingwood I dont want to see huge townhomes built on every available property because ten years from architectural styles will change again and some of this new construction will appear even more ugly than it is now Just my opinion Diane Garbutt National City Mortgage Buffalo Speedway Suite Houston Texas Fax ationalCitymortgagecom Original Message From Zero Zero Productions Jeff Balke SMTP Sent Wednesday December AM To HEBERT TRENT A JSCCB USA Subject Re Protect Your Most Important Investment with Deed Restrictions Well this isnt Kingwood thank God It is one thing to eliminate businesses that create a significant problem for traffic noise or whatever else It is another altogether to eliminate the existence of businesses This is a community and by definition requires a little bit of everything I personally would hate to lose places where I can walk to eat like Java Java or pick up some gardening supplies like Buchanans or shop for some antiques Those businesses are part of the charm of the community that is the Heights Without them we are just another deed restricted suburb of Houston Jeff Zero Zero Productions Music Digital Audio Web Design From HEBERT TRENT A JSCCB USA ReplyTo Date Wed Dec To HEBERT TRENT A JSCCB USA Subject RE Protect Your Most Important Investment with Deed Restrictions So Bob Are you saying that if I sign a Deed Restriction on my home that does not limit me to opening a low traffic business there What is the limit cars per day cars per hour or what What is the definition of low traffic Some could submit that a tire repair shop only gets to customers per day That sounds low traffic to me However I bet that with employees and customers a law office real estate or mortgage office gets about that same amount of traffic The reality is that neither a law office nor a tire shop have a vested interest in the community as would a private residence This all started with HHA asking folks to sign deed restrictions on our property My issue is that they are making a big deal about folks singing deed restrictions but out of the other side of their mouth they are not doing anything about the businesses that are coming into the community It seems there is always a lot of effort to beautify the Blvd and I ask why make the Blvd so beautiful for all the businesses If that is the case then lets say lets beautify the business park So what I hear you saying is that it would be okay if Perry Homes opened a model home office on Heights Blvd as this would be low traffic the same as our law office or mortgage company Personally I think that either we live in a business park or a neighborhood Allowing some businesses and not all businesses is not an option Trent Hebert Astronaut Office Flight Crew Engineering EMail Phone Pager Fax

been an objection to professional offices on Heights Blvd We have a number that fit in very well these include law offices real estate offices and other low traffic businesses The objection has been to high traffic retail establishments such as the Churchs Fried Chicken Another point to answer The Heights was designed to be a mix of large houses for the wealthy and modest bungalows for the rest of us The early developers had no problem putting a Victorian mansion next to a Craftsman bungalow For the person that though Perry Homes would be improving the neighborhood I say hog wash As I stated at the Land Use Committee Monday night there is nothing more dangerous than the it is better than what was there approach I gave the example of the ugly almost townhouses going up at th and Oxford Yes there was a used tire shop there previously but we didnt get rid of it it just moved across the street Now we have both the tire shop and the townhouses A lot of the emails in this thread seem to be from newcomers and it is gratifying to see them interested but they need to take the time to learn the nuances of the Heights A good place to start is the book History of Houston Heights by Sister Agatha It is no longer in print but it is available at the library Bob Pearson Original Message From Hatcher Melissa Melissa BRcom To Sent Wednesday December AM Subject RE Protect Your Most Important Investment with Deed Restrictions I agree with Mr Trent I remember being horrified when I heard about the lawyers buying it I was so disappointed but then again I thought something along those lines would happen as I heard about the price for the home getting higher and higher Most families would be hard pressed to afford such a house However having the choice of the apartments that were there and the lawyers offices in the Victorian style building I would chose the lesser evil the new construction anytime Should HHA spend more time working with or against some of the owners who possess multiple properties I hate to use the term slumlords but then again I want to call it as I see it Some owners of rental properties in the Heights seem to be squeezing every last penny out of their rentals and not putting any of that back into maintaining their holdings As a result houses fall into disarray their ability to attract people who take pride in their homes diminishes and a spiral of destruction begins Surely there is some set of codes in existence for which these owners can be held accountable I agree we should be concerned with the demolition of some of the homes but if the properties had been maintained in the first place maybe demolition would not have been the only answer I guess my point is why are we creating so much grief for people who want to bring money into the Heights and allowing those who simply want to take the money out to continue on with their neglect Original Message From HEBERT TRENT A JSCCB USA mailto Sent Tuesday December PM To Subject RE Protect Your Most Important Investment with Deed Restrictions Debbie I was curious as to what the HHA did to try and prevent the Lawyers office from buying the property at th and Heights Blvd I believe it is the one designed after the Cooley house I was very very upset when I learned that the house of which so much attention was paid and so much publicity was made about returning the Cooley house to the Blvd that in fact what has happened is that it is an office building I know for the moment there is grass in the front and side yard but I can already tell that a parking lot will be coming soon as there is no place to park Did HHA do anything before the house was built or during construction to try and convince the builderowner to sign a deed restriction on that property What happened I guess I am having a hard time with keeping Perry Homes out when we let such a situation occur on Heights Blvd Especially on the west side of Heights Blvd where there is still much room for improvement Dont get me wrong I hate those big box style town homes but if money talks as it appears it did at th and Heights then I cannot help but believe that my property value will increase if new constructed town homes are built to the west of Heights Blvd If you would like to discuss this further please feel free to email me back or call me at home My number at home is I look forward to hearing from you on this matter Trent Trent Hebert Astronaut Office Flight Crew Engineering EMail Phone Pager Fax Original Message From Debbie Markey mailto Sent Monday December PM To Subject Protect Your Most Important Investment with Deed Restrictions Deed Restrictions are the best tool that the property owners in the Houston Heights have to curb overdevelopment and the encroachment of commercial businesses A signed deed restriction document protects the investment you have made in your property by restricting undesirable development These restrictions do not restrict you from painting your house any color you like putting up fences adding garage apartments or remodeling your property in any way Once signed a deed restriction applies only to the specified property to which it applies and is an effective tool ensuring future protection despite changes in future ownership More important even if your entire block is not deed restricted the existence of deed restricted properties within a block can often benefit the entire neighborhood by limiting developers choices in future construction on not only that specific lot but also adjacent properties The Houston Heights Association HHA is not a homeowners association The HHA is prohibited from assessing maintenance fees and cannot put a lien against your home Why As a volunteerbased c charitable organization the HHA is dependent upon volunteers to donate time and effort to maintain community assets and services that improve our quality of life these include Donovan Park Marmion Park the Fire Station at th and Yale and the esplanade of Heights Boulevard Volunteers coordinate all the fundraisers for these properties and the projects that the HHA supports HHAs four biggest fundraisers are the Spring Home Tour the Fun Run the Heights Festival and the Holiday Home Tour Monies raised by these fundraisers go right back into your Houston Heights Neighborhood The Deed Restriction effort initially started when concerned residents saw their property values plummet in the late s Volunteers crafted a document that would enable our neighborhood to slow down andor prevent commercial development Large businesses were moving in and depleting the historical housing stock by destroying the houses or turning the houses into businesses that were not desirable for the neighborhood With Houstons absence of zoning deed restrictions in the Houston Heights were their only method of preventing commercial encroachment While the restrictions spurned businesses that invited wheel truck traffic unsightly dumpsters that were emptied at early morning hours and the use of paved front yards as parking lots the restrictions did allow small businesses and arts and crafts enthusiasts to coexist with the neighborhood Currently there are approximately Heights properties protected by deed restrictions and HHA volunteers make themselves available to answer questions and attend deed restriction signups and other Civic Association meetings to talk about the positive results of deed restricting a neighborhood The HHA recently revised the restrictions to protect the neighborhood from dense townhouse construction and encourage preservation of some of the few remaining larger lots in the Houston Heights By early the revised restrictions will be voted on by those properties that are currently restricted Their passage is vitally important to encourage development that suits the character of the Houston Heights Their need is immediate and severe In the fall of Perry Homes purchased large tracts of land on the West Side of Heights Boulevard Its plan is to build townhouses rather than singlefamily homes Representatives from the HHA have thus far unsuccessfully met with Perry Homes to encourage them to build periodstyle singlewall constructed homes The passage of amended deed restrictions and their ongoing wide spread adoption is the most significant tool our neighborhood has to stop over development and the mass construction of townhouses For more information please phone mailbox or visit the website at wwwhoustonheightsorg
