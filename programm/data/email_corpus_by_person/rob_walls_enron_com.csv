PM John NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Rebecca McDonaldENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT James A HughesENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Rob nron Bruce LundstromENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Enron project Maharashtra State Electricity Board paying Rs cr for unbought power Mahesh Vijapurkar FYI Although clearly slanted the following is rather astute local coverage of the issue John The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire MUMBAI DEC Strange as it may sound the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB would be paying less for the energy it buys from the Enronsponsored Dabhol Power Company if it buys more If it buys only half of the present capacity the state owned power utility would pay as it does now around Rs crores per month towards unbought power That is its entrapment signed and sealed with Enron Under the contract between the MSEB and the Dabhol based independent power producer the pricing of its output has two components capacity charges and the variable or fuel charge If it buys power it pays a combination of the two and if it does not MSEB has to fork out the capacity charges which is almost a penalty for not picking up the energy At present MSEB is allowed to buy only million units which is about half the Dabhol plants capacity during its currently operating Phase I because the Electricity Regulatory Commission has stipulated that only cheaply sourced power should be on its shopping list and if it has to draw from Dabhol then the ceiling is million units That means when the MSEB pays for half the power that would be available it is also paying some Rs crores towards the capacity charges and which is loaded on what has been bought This arithmetic has pushed the price in addition to the weakened rupee against the US dollar plus the per barrel of oil in the international market to hover at close to Rs per unit Arguably it would have been cheaper to buy the entire output from the present Phase I capacity of mw but the problem is that MSEB does not have money to pay for that Therefore it would like to evaluate its options as advised by the Maharashtra Government so that the right ways and means could be found to handle this issue One is to appeal to the MERC to allow all the power to be bought as it is produced since the IPP is all set to activate a part of its Phase II capacity which is pegged at MW and then get energy at a lower average price That means it can avoid paying the capacity charges it can illafford Says an official it is throwing good money behind the bad Let us look at the prices paid hitherto when the US currency had a different parity with the rupee When it was Rs to a dollar the MSEB was billed at Rs per unit in May Then it was tossed upwards to reach Rs now and next month move to about Rs per unit If the rupee slides further we pay more an official explained There is a nice little twist to the Enron story If the Power Purchase Agreement as renegotiated by the Shiv Sena BJP Government had not made the mw Phase II mandatory as against only an option to either pick up or reject in the earlier PPA this need a relook at the Phase II or the entire project may not have arisen Those in the know of the economics of the situation explain If it was an option we could have taken a hard look at the experience with the Phase I and decided on our steps But the millstone was tied around the MSEB neck in itself by the previous Government There seems to be no escape route except to ask the IPP to lower its prices by managing its cost of funds That is now being done Some FIs like IDBI have offered to lower its interest rate provided the lowered burden is transferred to the MSEB in the tariff This is yet to become a widespread offer from FIs but the MSEB may with the Maharashtra Governments help quietly lobby towards that objective That would not mean a lot but in the payouts a few paise per unit less When the first block of Phase II is activated by June at present dollarrupee parity with the price of petroleum products being the same the price of power from Dabhol is estimated at about Rs per unit but that too to a financially crippled power board is stiff But it can do little because of the take or pay deal with Enron If the petroleum prices remain steady and the rupee does not slide and when the second block of Phase II is operational the price of power could dip but we are talking of a situation which we can guess at This is on the basis that MSEB can buy all the power and not merely end up paying capacity charges for not buying energy According to present estimates outgo towards power bought and not bought would be Rs crores per month June onward Rs crores per month October onward when the current realisation for the MSEB is only Rs crores per month from all power sold from all sources it accesses its own and others That is unlikely to go up substantially not in the near future Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights

PM John NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Rebecca McDonaldENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT James A HughesENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Rob nron Bruce LundstromENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Enron project Maharashtra State Electricity Board paying Rs cr for unbought power Mahesh Vijapurkar FYI Although clearly slanted the following is rather astute local coverage of the issue John The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire MUMBAI DEC Strange as it may sound the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB would be paying less for the energy it buys from the Enronsponsored Dabhol Power Company if it buys more If it buys only half of the present capacity the state owned power utility would pay as it does now around Rs crores per month towards unbought power That is its entrapment signed and sealed with Enron Under the contract between the MSEB and the Dabhol based independent power producer the pricing of its output has two components capacity charges and the variable or fuel charge If it buys power it pays a combination of the two and if it does not MSEB has to fork out the capacity charges which is almost a penalty for not picking up the energy At present MSEB is allowed to buy only million units which is about half the Dabhol plants capacity during its currently operating Phase I because the Electricity Regulatory Commission has stipulated that only cheaply sourced power should be on its shopping list and if it has to draw from Dabhol then the ceiling is million units That means when the MSEB pays for half the power that would be available it is also paying some Rs crores towards the capacity charges and which is loaded on what has been bought This arithmetic has pushed the price in addition to the weakened rupee against the US dollar plus the per barrel of oil in the international market to hover at close to Rs per unit Arguably it would have been cheaper to buy the entire output from the present Phase I capacity of mw but the problem is that MSEB does not have money to pay for that Therefore it would like to evaluate its options as advised by the Maharashtra Government so that the right ways and means could be found to handle this issue One is to appeal to the MERC to allow all the power to be bought as it is produced since the IPP is all set to activate a part of its Phase II capacity which is pegged at MW and then get energy at a lower average price That means it can avoid paying the capacity charges it can illafford Says an official it is throwing good money behind the bad Let us look at the prices paid hitherto when the US currency had a different parity with the rupee When it was Rs to a dollar the MSEB was billed at Rs per unit in May Then it was tossed upwards to reach Rs now and next month move to about Rs per unit If the rupee slides further we pay more an official explained There is a nice little twist to the Enron story If the Power Purchase Agreement as renegotiated by the Shiv Sena BJP Government had not made the mw Phase II mandatory as against only an option to either pick up or reject in the earlier PPA this need a relook at the Phase II or the entire project may not have arisen Those in the know of the economics of the situation explain If it was an option we could have taken a hard look at the experience with the Phase I and decided on our steps But the millstone was tied around the MSEB neck in itself by the previous Government There seems to be no escape route except to ask the IPP to lower its prices by managing its cost of funds That is now being done Some FIs like IDBI have offered to lower its interest rate provided the lowered burden is transferred to the MSEB in the tariff This is yet to become a widespread offer from FIs but the MSEB may with the Maharashtra Governments help quietly lobby towards that objective That would not mean a lot but in the payouts a few paise per unit less When the first block of Phase II is activated by June at present dollarrupee parity with the price of petroleum products being the same the price of power from Dabhol is estimated at about Rs per unit but that too to a financially crippled power board is stiff But it can do little because of the take or pay deal with Enron If the petroleum prices remain steady and the rupee does not slide and when the second block of Phase II is operational the price of power could dip but we are talking of a situation which we can guess at This is on the basis that MSEB can buy all the power and not merely end up paying capacity charges for not buying energy According to present estimates outgo towards power bought and not bought would be Rs crores per month June onward Rs crores per month October onward when the current realisation for the MSEB is only Rs crores per month from all power sold from all sources it accesses its own and others That is unlikely to go up substantially not in the near future Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights

Hughes James A Walls Jr Rob Lundstrom Bruce CcMcGregor Neil SubjectRenegotiation thoughts Below is an email I worked up on my renegotiation thoughts for your readin g pleasure Since this idea came up on our Thursday call I will go ahead a nd send the email out for feedback We can discuss any thoughts you have o n this either Friday or on a subsequent call Regards Col Travis The thoughts below are not for our meeting on Friday but they represent so mething that I think we need to be prepared for at some point after Friday I ask your patience in presenting some thoughts on a possible renegotiatio n strategy Background We are going down a termination path which we are willing to go all the wa y on We also are aiming for a buyout option at some point Lenders are concerned about the path as we all are and are taking some ti me to get comfortable with the steps This has led to a delay in approval f or PTN and perhaps a delayed approval after PTN for a Transfer Notice Whil e the lenders may know the ultimate resolution is a termination or buyout the lenders are concerned that DPC has not done all in its power to find an amicable solution through negotiation Given hundreds of published comment s the Godbole Committee report our understanding of GOM finances politic al party differences weak coalition govts etc we know that renegotiati on is going to be almost impossible But the lenders are not there yet and in this period we dont want to lose the lenders completely We need lend ers and their approval for a buyout as well as a termination Plus we don t want to upset lenders completely to a point they ask what value is DPC EnronGEBechtel bringing to the project and thus decide to cut the equi ty out and to seek some other solution without the current equity Government parties MSEB GOM GOI are concerned about this path as they d ont fully appreciate what it means for them or DPC In addition this hard ball tactic is not their normal style although they are capable of being f airly rough when they get pinned down This is especially true since our as sets and people are on their home turf The hardball while we are used to it and believe it is the proper strategy is leading to hardening of positi ons by government and will make subsequent discussions whether on transfe r amount buyout option or any renegotiation more difficult We also shoul d be thinking of keeping doors open if only a slight bit with government as we will need some level of cooperation for buyout transfer amount or a ny renegotiation I think we should develop a renegotiation option that is a combination of t hings First something that if our plans go out of control we have someth ing we can fallback on as a last option While renegotiation and the conseq uent reduction in equity returns might be an unattractive option I think w e can make it more attractive than it currently is as you can see from the list below This provides some facesaving option for the government if they choose to go this route Second it is something that shows the lende rs who we have to care about and the government who we care less about but still care somewhat due to need for their approvals and cooperation th at we are not slamming the door shut on any further discussions Third it is something that will be very difficult for the government and perhaps the lenders fuel supplier and shipowners to agree to and thus we will probab ly get to the goal of termination regardless Right now the lenders are our immediate hurdle with the challenge of getti ng them over the hump of a quick PTN and a simultaneous or shortly thereaft er Transfer Notice So I would recommend we discuss the plan below internal ly and modify it as needed Before we would show it to anyone we would dec ide what is our minimum I propose the attached be our minimum and we will beef it up as needed If required we will have it ready to show to lender s at an appropriate time or to have a senior Enron executive such as Ken o r Rebecca or a Houstonapproved emissary get it to GOI We would say this i s what we are willing to do to avoid final termination we still will proce ed with PTN and Transfer Notice as soon as lender consent obtained but g overnment and other counterparties must agree to obligations contained in t he list This shows the lenders that we are willing to at least play the re negotiation game Heres the Dabhol Wishlist in short bulletpoints These need work and furth er scrubbing but before spending significant time on this I want to get i nput from management if this is something they would want us to explore Ag ain I think these are our minimum worst case things so we could beef it up accordingly Dabhol agrees to not terminate project In light of recent events and h igh level concerns meetings being held in Maharashtra and Delhi we should not understimate the value this concession provides to GOI and GOM Dabhol agrees to tariff reduction from ECS of Phase II on LNG of pais e for st years up to Rs for the remaining years This is done primarily through a debt reschedulement granting liquidity relief in firs t years to MSEB and recovery through GOM bonds and ROE reduction by conv erting to part tariff Equity reduction by eliminating MSEBs equity in p roject GOI agrees to backstop purchase or credit support power blocks and G OMMSEB takes one Note I think we should ask for GOI to backstop all but I think is the most possible GOI or GOM or Indian Financial Institutions IFIs or combination there of takes enough equity at par to reduce Enron to All additional funding requirements for the project including additiona l funds for development cost recovery cost overruns for capital costs wor king capital customs commissioning fuel etc to be funded by additional loans or equity to DPC from IFIs This also includes any cost overruns due to construction stoppage and delay we are currently facing We should even ask to eliminate existing Phase II sponsor Project Completion Support and r eplace it with IFI loans That last point may be a bit much since we have a lready committed to this but if the option is that we will walk from this project the IFIs with appropriate pressure from government could support t his Negotiate to eliminate liquidity LC obligation LNG Supply LC obligati on and ship LC obligation If funding support is needed to cover these sho rtfalls it will come from IFIs Recall that this project has significant cashflow in later years and the I FI debt raised in and above could be repaid during that time All equity hold restrictions on Enron GE and Bechtel are lifted includ ed those in project documents for example GOI guarantee and PPA and loan documents Enrons internal plans would be to exit after deal signed up MSEB to drop existing misdeclaration claims and take steps in PPA to en sure this is not an issue going forward There are many other items that can be included including approvals from R BI to recover all sponsors development costs which would be funded by IFIs under above fuel hedging ability for MSEB clearances for Metgas to ma ximize value we can get in sale of the Metgas TARA etc Alternatively we could give Metgas contractual rights and existing permits and contracts to GOI in exchange for their agreeing to items above However I wanted to foc us on the bigger picture and have a discussion with management first on the concept before we put the extensive list together I know its a wish list but if parties government IFIs other counterpar ties do not want this deal to terminate and equity to pull out and if they agree to points above the sponsors would get the project done with limite d additional funding by sponsors This could be only transactional costs as sociated with restructuring which while significant do not approach cost of going forward as is And it may include existing MM Project Completi on Support although we would negotiate hard to replace that with IFI debt or equity We should still continue down PTN and Transfer Notice path but we should a lso consider how we give lenders and govt some indication that we are stil l adding value to the deal by showing some willingness to talk on changes t o deal Wade

SentFriday May AM ToMcDonald Rebecca Hughes James A Walls Jr Rob Lundstrom Bruce CcMcGregor Neil SubjectFriday Renegotiation Committee meeting and other events Here is overview of day Ive tried to summarize most of what happened Mohan and I met early in morning with the lenders observers to the meeting Mr Kharkanis and Abhay Ahuja Both are attorneys who work for the same l awfirm India Legal Advisors previously affiliated with White Case Thi s firm has represented Dabhol lenders in the past Mr Kharkanis is former chief legal counsel at IDBI Very pleasant meeting Three points they made a very difficult to resolve unless someone is willing to take all the power b this committee is probably not a proper committee to be renegoti ating with as it is comprised of all Review Committee members who are alre ady biased in their conclusions and c they asked about the misdeclaratio n issue I told them we felt we had a strong case and were willing to go al l the way in arbitration or assuming a big picture renegotiation could wor k resolve it in context of that renegotiation But I pointed out a renegot iation while possible was going to be difficult and it would be an absol ute nonstarter unless GOI stood up and said they could take power At Renegotiation Committee RC meeting only of members from their sid e were present Dr Godbole chair Mr Lal Energy Secretary and Ms Bans al MSEB chair Notably absent was any GOI representative Their offered ra tionale for this absence was that Mr Gaukak not Mr Harish Salve as earli er reported had been appointed only last night and could not make it It i s clear to me that a GOI is still taking a handsoff approach and they de layed appointment until late enough so they could not make meeting and b GOIs commitment to finding workable solution is in question as they dont seem to be giving this any type of serious consideration based on who they appoint Mr Gaukak is former secretary in Telecom Dept The press was allowed in at the beginning of the meeting only to take photo s They left and the meeting began We agreed after the meeting that neithe r party would discuss with the press about the meeting As we left we were absolutely mobbed and we no commented our way through the mob and left The mob was quite large and the walking space was small and going downstair s so there were a couple of reporters who tripped and fell and dropped cam eras Hopefully the headlines will not read Enron stomps Journalist The meeting lasted almost hours The RC opened up by saying their positio n was on the table through the Godbole Committee Report and wanted us to re spond I read from my prepared notes and told them we were open minded wi lling to listen but we had serious constraints My key points from my notes were a who was going to buy the power from this MW baseload plant th at had to operate at high PLF for it to be economical b our project was out of money and would probably have to shut down absent further funding fr om lenders which depended on favorable govt response to lender letter th is did not seem to bother them at all c the main problem was their fail ure I told them I felt it was major issue that GOI was not present and not engaging in this dialogue I said the absence of GOI meant that very little would be accomplished today as the key to any solution involved GOI involv ement and we needed to know what GOIs position was The RC responded by s aying they were disappointed that we did not have representatives from shar eholders lenders and they objected here to the lenders observer role ver sus an active participant role fuel suppliers and others here and they di d not know whether to interpret that as lack of seriousnesscommitment or n ot The most disturbing thing to me was the Dr Godbole was very clear to the point of stating this and repeating it again that the original project was a mistake and DPC should pay for that mistake He said that DPC proposed a MW LNG facility with high PLF and thus now that such a project is no t working it is DPCs fault his rationale being that without DPC proposin g the idea originally it never would have come about and we should pay W hen I asked him what tariff he thought should be appropriate he quoted fro m the Godbole Committee report the lowest tariff available to any gasba sed plant in the country with no ToP Since the whole LNG idea was DPCs we should bear of any LNG costs except for a reasonable per MMbtu pric e that MSEB would pay as if they had a natural gas pipeline running already in place and running by their plant Yes folks it was that ludicrous Its clear that among the people there Dr Godbole was the firmest in hi s extreme positions And he is firm in those positions Mr Lal and Mr Ban sal were more conciliatory and trying to find some middle ground although since they only represent MSEBGOM their ability to do this is limited to only one power block and even on that they are looking for tariff relief and ToP relief beyond our ability to handle But they are trying to move to the middle whereas the chairman is not Even in absence of GOI we talked at length about the fact that they had to play a role The RC said they were not sure if GOI was willing to play a r ole other than counterguarantor and even if they were the GOI could not be expected to pay more than a market price whatever a SEB in India is willing to pay Currently that ranges around Rs It is clear that D r Godbole feels no responsibility whatsoever for power blocks and he th inks DPC should take responsibility including convincing GOI to buy some a mount of this at the market price On this market price issue I made it clear that it was not our problem that the market price in India was an unr ealistically low price influenced by subsidies lack of tariff rationalizat ion etc and we would not be able to meet their demands We discussed the need for having a creditworthy buyer for power from DPC at PLF before we could talk any tariff relief and even then tariff relief expectations had to be reasonable not the they are asking for but less than LNG terminal separation from power plant They asked if an LNG terminal spl it was possible and we asked what did they think that would get them They said tariff relief and absence of ToP We pointed out tariff relief had be en given in renegotiations when LNG terminal had been originally split and even when the terminal was included added back the tariff relief had remained to MSEBs favor We stated that the ToP would remain with the ult imate customer even if the terminal was split They said why should the po wer plant pay for all excess capacity in LNG terminal and we reminded them again that the LNG terminal capacity was built solely for the power station as MSEB had required and that separate independent consultants had conf irmed this RC asked for various proposals on what our tariff would be at various PLFs assuming a certain reduced tariff We told them that since the project o nly made sense at a high PLF the key was for them and GOI to identif y buyers for and then tariff is known Conclusion they wanted to meet again and have a further discussion We agr eed to meet on May but agreed that in interim we had to know what the role of the GOI was We agreed that we would both go back and think about w hat had been said and see if solutions were there but we said that key was where were the buyers for this power

Rebecca Hughes James A Walls Jr Rob Lundstrom Bruce Ben CT Dutt Ranabir McGregor Neil Subject Weekend UpdateNext Week Thoughts Here is an update plus my thoughts on what we should consider this week I hope to be able to discuss this on Mondays call As this involves some press updates and thoughts regarding the lenders I am sending this to Ben and Ranabir as well I Press Reports in Weekend Newspapers after Friday Renegotiating Meeting reports were mixed on Renegotiation Meeting and possibility of success to find a solution More Credible papers Times of India DPC Phase II should be scrapped panel tells Enron Economic Times Enron panel meet fails to make breakthrough State weighs termination notice to DPC Other papers who follow DPC closely Financial Express DPC to meet panel on May Renegotiation is only way out for DPC Cut in tariff likely Business Standard Dabhol not averse to tariff renegotiation So the press is all over the map on the outcome of Fridays meeting II Press reports from Delhi with GOI reaction Summary GOI hopeful that solution can be found between DPC and GOM BUT GOI makes clear in Sunday papers the GOI position While GOI not opposed to allowing DPC power sale to rd parties neither GOI nor NTPC will purchase power from DPC III MESSAGE TO LENDERS Lenders want to know we are serious about finding solutions We are and are willing to engage in dialogue so long as willing buyers of power are at table This was made clear in Fridays meeting But Renegotiating Committee is not serious about realistic solutions Evidence of this is Chairmans view that DPC and thus its lenders and shareholders should get no recovery for the LNG infrastructure Rather he strongly believes tariff should be as reported in Godbole Committee Report the lowest of any gasbased power plant in country including those few with pipeline gas Second GOI is not serious yet as they did not even bother to send someone to meeting IV STEPS FORWARD for consideration A Issue PTN whether to do it with or without Transfer Notice to be discussed separately on Monday B When PTN issued press statement to be issued to cover after several months of meetings and proposals no serious response by MSEB GOM and GOI parties are still not meeting their contractual obligations even after both Indian and intl lenders have written to GOI thus we are taking steps to protect contractual rights by issuing PTN Regarding future meetings to discuss project project was designed as baseload to meet MSEB requirements and approved by GOM and GOI project must have buyers for power to have serious negotiations Renegotiating Committee position which is reiteration of Godbole Committee report is unrealistic If MSEB GOM and GOI are not willing to meet their contractual obligations to offtake power then not feasible to discuss any changes to deal thus prior to any further meetings DPC awaits specific proposal from MSEBGOMGOI on who they propose to substitute for MSEB as the party who is contractually obligated to purchase the power from DPC the prior point is important in that we need to a set the going forward agenda with respect to any further meetings and b manage expectations regarding such future meetings and who will deliver what proposals if any not us C Bring in senior management ASAP after PTN Rationale is to both feed our ideas into the GOI as well let lenders know we are committed to finding solution including bringing our senior management to India for meetings I recommend we bring Ken Lay with Rebecca to meet in Delhi with Prime Minister Finance Minister and Power Minister along with Sonia Gandhi Other meetings can be scheduled as well and we will want to include some addl meetings in Delhi and Mumbai But above are the key meetings Key message to be delivered or options face the project Terminate and we are willing to go that route rather than have to invest significant additional money into a project in the India power sector that does not currently work Buyout of foreign debt and equity and allow an Indian solution to be found Renegotiate on our terms including GOI taking power blocks and IFIs funding all additional project costs My earlier email on renegotiation possibilities might provide some ideas here The reason I mention this option here is that if we ever think we might have to table a renegotiation option having Ken Rebecca do it at the highest level is the way to go The solution regardless of which of options will be chosen must be handled at the highest level and I think it is now right after PTN or never to bring in Ken and Rebecca to see if the solution is there as well as let our lenders know we are seriously taking one more run to try and find a solution After we bring in Ken and Rebecca if the GOI still remains on the sidelines and does not step up the Phase I lenders should realize we have done everything we can and give us the Transfer Notice approval The quicker we bring in Ken and Rebecca the quicker we should have the strongest argument for the Transfer Notice approval One logistical point I do think it is very important to bring in Ken and Rebecca very quickly after the PTN is issued But we will need some advance time to set up these high level meetings as well as get Indian approvals to bring Kens plane into India This will take about a full business week so I think we should schedule this trip as soon as we can perhaps during week of May D At same time as senior management comes in have senior contacts from Wash DC contact political leaders in Delhi to request a solution be found quickly to avoid any implications on improving IndiaUS relations E Finally I also think it is time for Enron to strongly consider an approach directly to some possible buyers There are Indian corporates who would be leading candidates There are also some international majors that would be possible Enron could consider a joint asset package of DPC Metgas the TARA is the real value here Depending on the appropriate Enron internal approvals other assets could be considered Offshore oil gas assets Data center On the last items I know that one of the Indian corporates would be interested in the oil gas assets and both would be interested in the data center We could arrange meetings with senior management of potential purchasers when Ken Rebecca are in India or to avoid press we might want to schedule these either in lowkey India locations or even outside India Dubai or Singapore We can discuss these thoughts on Monday Wade

Walls Jr Rob Subject Indian Counsel Rob Id really like to take this up today with you Bruce Forwarded by Bruce LundstromENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Paul Kraske AM To Bruce LundstromENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Indian Counsel Bruce I think Wade spoke to you last night about some concerns I have with our Indian litigation team Principally I am a bit disappointed with Atul Setalvad You and I have discussed this a little in the past and Ive shared some of my frustrations Ultimately and notwithstanding my grumbling to you and Gail I would be willing to put up with arrogance overbilling criticism of Enron and the project and even grudgingly the disrespect with which he treats me and the other DPC lawyers if I thought he could get the job done But I dont think he can He may still have some good ideas And he does have history with the project But hes slow And hes unresponsive to our schedule our priorities and our instructions One reason we had to ask for more time from the MERC is that he simply wasnt prepared to argue yesterday Im still not sure hes read MSEBs petition and Im quite sure he has no idea what the substantive argument about misdeclaration is Under the glare of TV cameras and under pressure at yesterdays MERC hearing I thought he choked In contrast MSEBs advocate spoke persuasively about the PPA and the MERC I figure if he could get up to speed on the PPA and on misdeclaration we can bring someone else up to speed as well We shouldnt be hiring the best lawyers in the UK and the States and then settling for the B team in India especially when MSEB has collected three of the best lawyers from Delhi and Bombay Im not looking to totally dump the guy Even from a prudence perspective we should have more than one senior lawyer ready to go If we are going to be waging court wars on multiple fronts and on different issues it would be irresponsible to stick with only one counsel Weve identified three guys to approach and I think we should get them all up to speed and involved going forward When we need to deploy someone in a particular matter we can choose among the three of them and Atul S and pick the individual most likely to be successful Im meeting with P Chidambaram here in Bombay today Hes opined for us on the misdeclaration issue in the past Very smart guy Former Finance Minister of India Well respected and someone I definitely want on our team Weve also approached Ashok Desai in the past Former Attorney General of India and the mentor of MSEBs lawyer the Advocate General of Maharashtra who appeared at the MERC yesterday Walker thought Desai would be particularly useful given the possible effect on MSEBs lawyer of having to argue against his former boss Were not sure hes still available but I intend to find that out I understand he is out of the country at the moment But we want to approach him in Early July when he gets back Last guy is a fellow named Parasaran Reputed to be one of the two best lawyers in India the number one guy Fali Nariman is already working against us We have not spoken to him yet He may already have accepted a brief from MSEB GOM or GOI If not we will try to approach him Finally although less urgently I think we need more litigation support Shoban is terribly smart and has the same depth of experience of Atul R and Atul S But hes ill equipped to support the fight were undertaking He has no associates He has no secretaries He cant research case law Hes only available from When we need to prepare submissions to court inevitably he calls us up and sheepishly asks whether we can do it ourselves Which weve stayed here late at night in the past and done But Im not sure we can handle procedural litigation support on top of everything else were doing Again Im not proposing we replace him And Im not even sure we have a firm in mind to help out with this stuff right at the moment were considering Desai Diwanji Amarchand and A firm called Doijode Phartephekar But I do think were going to need a firm to back us up with junior associates willing to pull cases and crunch out filings hours a day Again no point in putting together a crack legal team from the States and England when we cant deliver the goods here in Bombay I realize the risk of suggesting new players If we tank the first thing Jim and Rob will ask is Why did we ever change from Setalvad Who are these new guys quickly followed by Paul Kraske has left Enron to pursue other interests But I would be remiss not to bring my reservations to your attention and to strongly suggest that we add more guys to the team Im also willing to have this discussion with Rob and if necessary with Jim Atul R is still preparing the writ petition but I want to act a little quickly on the Senior Counsel front so we can line up either Ashok Desai or Chidambaram to argue the writ before the High Court Let me know what you think Paul Embedded Picture Device Independent Bitmap

MIMEVersion XMailer Internet Mail Service ContentType textplain charsetiso ContentLength Jim In answer to your points The method of challenge to the main Petition before MERC is by Writ Petition under Articles and of the Constitution of India This is the procedural means by which the High Court controls and supervises the activities of lower Courts and administrative tribunals It isstrictlya public law proceeding rather than a private law proceeding Againstrictlywe cannot use a Writ Petition as a means of asserting a right to have these proceedings stayed under section of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act That is a private law application We could only get that inot the High Court by first making that application to the MERChaving it refused and then proceeding by way of statutory appeal Clearlya stay application presumes that the MERC has jurisdiction The way to tackle the injunction is to apply to have it discharged or modified If perhaps when MERC says nothere is a statutory right of appeal to the High Court The Writ Petition is an all or nothing excercise Realisticallyif DPC succeeds in the Writ Petitionthe MERC is dead and so ultimately will be the MSEB I think that I can fairly safely predict that in front of any halfdecent tribunal in Londonthe recission claim is going to go nowhere IfhoweverDPC does not succeed on jurisdictionI cannot see a stay application succeeding in front of the MERC If the Court says that the MERC has jurisdictionyou can bet your bottom dollar on the fact that it will be excercised No doubt DPC could file a statutory appeal to the High Court against a refusal to grant a staybut that will take a very long time to get heard in these circumstances The prcedural stroke which requires to be played right in the High Court is getting the Court to deal with this Writ Petition urgently Should that occurwe should get home sooner rather than later working on Indian timethat is Ifcontrary to my expectationthe Court sits on the matterthen we are in difficulties It is going to be hard to appeal when the decision is that there is no decision I do not think that DPC can prudently disregard the MERCs order Aside from the invocation of contempt procedures against DPCthe MSEB would simply apply to the High Court for an injunction directly Alsowill our Lenders really allow DPC to serve a Termination Notice in these circumstances given that the Phase I dollar Lenders require to get to the GOI Guarantee I personally doubt it As a practical matter I believe that we have to comply with the MERCs orders unless and until the High Court says that MERC has no jurisdiction The more practical approach is this Having filed our Writ Petitionnothing prevents us from applying to MERC to vary its current order If it refuseswe file a stautory appeal against its order and apply to the Chief Justice to have both matters conjoined That is what we ought to be doing I do not know enough about our PRI coverage certainly the OPIC cover to say with certainty Howeverthe Lloyds Policy has the better coverage subject to whatever right the underwriters may have to avoid for nondisclosure on placing That policy requires that DPC obtains an arbitral award I think that we should be doing all that we can to preserve the position vizaviz that policy This seems to dictate that we comply with the MERCs ordersat least for the time being One remedy for contempt by a corporate body is the appointment of a receiver The implications of that for obtaining any arbitral award are obvious Original Message From Jim Mccartney mailto Sent May To Cc Subject dpc chris is there any established procedure under indian procedural or substantive law on how we challenge the merc injunction if we lose before the bombay high court eg they decline to consider the matter or just sit on it what then appeal to the sct mandamus since we would have to rely on the indian courts to enforce an arbitration award as i recall what good would it do to disregard the mercs order and the courts and proceed with the arbitration a high risk venturecould it help us with our political risk coverage or other extraindia protections we would

PM John NRONDEVELOPMENT AM To Rebecca McDonaldENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT James A HughesENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Rob nron Bruce LundstromENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Wade ClineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Enron project Maharashtra State Electricity Board paying Rs cr for unbought power Mahesh Vijapurkar FYI Although clearly slanted the following is rather astute local coverage of the issue John The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire MUMBAI DEC Strange as it may sound the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB would be paying less for the energy it buys from the Enronsponsored Dabhol Power Company if it buys more If it buys only half of the present capacity the state owned power utility would pay as it does now around Rs crores per month towards unbought power That is its entrapment signed and sealed with Enron Under the contract between the MSEB and the Dabhol based independent power producer the pricing of its output has two components capacity charges and the variable or fuel charge If it buys power it pays a combination of the two and if it does not MSEB has to fork out the capacity charges which is almost a penalty for not picking up the energy At present MSEB is allowed to buy only million units which is about half the Dabhol plants capacity during its currently operating Phase I because the Electricity Regulatory Commission has stipulated that only cheaply sourced power should be on its shopping list and if it has to draw from Dabhol then the ceiling is million units That means when the MSEB pays for half the power that would be available it is also paying some Rs crores towards the capacity charges and which is loaded on what has been bought This arithmetic has pushed the price in addition to the weakened rupee against the US dollar plus the per barrel of oil in the international market to hover at close to Rs per unit Arguably it would have been cheaper to buy the entire output from the present Phase I capacity of mw but the problem is that MSEB does not have money to pay for that Therefore it would like to evaluate its options as advised by the Maharashtra Government so that the right ways and means could be found to handle this issue One is to appeal to the MERC to allow all the power to be bought as it is produced since the IPP is all set to activate a part of its Phase II capacity which is pegged at MW and then get energy at a lower average price That means it can avoid paying the capacity charges it can illafford Says an official it is throwing good money behind the bad Let us look at the prices paid hitherto when the US currency had a different parity with the rupee When it was Rs to a dollar the MSEB was billed at Rs per unit in May Then it was tossed upwards to reach Rs now and next month move to about Rs per unit If the rupee slides further we pay more an official explained There is a nice little twist to the Enron story If the Power Purchase Agreement as renegotiated by the Shiv Sena BJP Government had not made the mw Phase II mandatory as against only an option to either pick up or reject in the earlier PPA this need a relook at the Phase II or the entire project may not have arisen Those in the know of the economics of the situation explain If it was an option we could have taken a hard look at the experience with the Phase I and decided on our steps But the millstone was tied around the MSEB neck in itself by the previous Government There seems to be no escape route except to ask the IPP to lower its prices by managing its cost of funds That is now being done Some FIs like IDBI have offered to lower its interest rate provided the lowered burden is transferred to the MSEB in the tariff This is yet to become a widespread offer from FIs but the MSEB may with the Maharashtra Governments help quietly lobby towards that objective That would not mean a lot but in the payouts a few paise per unit less When the first block of Phase II is activated by June at present dollarrupee parity with the price of petroleum products being the same the price of power from Dabhol is estimated at about Rs per unit but that too to a financially crippled power board is stiff But it can do little because of the take or pay deal with Enron If the petroleum prices remain steady and the rupee does not slide and when the second block of Phase II is operational the price of power could dip but we are talking of a situation which we can guess at This is on the basis that MSEB can buy all the power and not merely end up paying capacity charges for not buying energy According to present estimates outgo towards power bought and not bought would be Rs crores per month June onward Rs crores per month October onward when the current realisation for the MSEB is only Rs crores per month from all power sold from all sources it accesses its own and others That is unlikely to go up substantially not in the near future Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights

NRONDEVELOPMENT cc James L CT Subject Re Re FA Issues For your info we have contacted Medway a plant in the UK which has had similar compressor blade failures on the FAs This problem seems to be a type fault and along that line we have sounded out the Insurers and Medway whether they would be interested in taking a joint action against GE on the basis that the GTs GE has supplied are not fit for purpose The response was a resounding yes with the insurers wanting to set up a meeting between the affected parties This was done on a confidential basis and I have not pulled the trigger on setting this up Jim Boullion the insurance contact was David Way Our legal advice is that it would be very difficult to take this kind of action given the extent of the no consequentials language in the contract under NY law However this point may be a reasonable Hammer over GE if they cut up rough and give us a bad deal I think a joint action in the market could severely affect GEs sales position of the FA product range whether we have a strong case or not Gordon Grimes and the litigation team are tasked with trying to find us an angle on which to sue Further points to take note of below are Medway got stiffed by GE with the cost of repairs and extended warranty whereas we got these covered in our last deal The insurance market dried up in the UK on the insurability of these rotors Final insurance costs rose and their deductable went over days Ours is currently days We negotiated it down from days last year on our insurance renewal programme Insurabiltiy of the GTs including phase is going to be a challenge and MSEB is going to resist paying any increase in premium Insurance cost is a pass through to MSEB We need to be cognisant of these facts when dealing with

experienced two compressor failures the first one on CT in November when an R tip broke off and resulted in a major compressor failure The rotor was replaced with their spare one The second failure was more recent in July on CT when five of the R blade tips broke off and caused secondary damages to rows R and R In this case though GE advocated site repair of the rotor the insurance company refused to accept it Medway had to send the rotor for refurbishment to the GE repair facility before they could get reinsure this turbine The costs of repair were borne by Medway and all warranties had run out Both gas turbines had the old design of compressor blades Subsequent to the failure robust compressor blades were installed in row and on both compressors CT is running with the new compressor blades since December A September CI and boroscope inspection on this unit revealed minor burring of R stage blades CT is running with robust blades since October Though Tim Sharp was a bit

Agreement Bruce After a couple of go arounds below is the Indian counsels Mr Talwar opinion with respect to Enron Fuels Internationals EFI claim as to the Fixed Fee as provided in the Fuel Management Agreement FMA I am sure Doug Leach has mentioned to you the marktomarket and accrual income exposure of million should the FMA also were rescinded or parlayed in the final resolution EFI is continuing to invoice for the Fixed Fee every month although the plant is not operating as is DPC to MSEB Mr Talwars view is that as long as the PPA is valid EFI has the right to collect the fee If however the PPA is declared to be invalid as per MSEBs claim then EFI would not be entitled to the fee I just want to point out that as DPC and Enron is working for a resolution EFIs role should also be considered And along those lines EFI should take an active role in pursuing that its interest is protected Please call me at to discuss Tushar Original Message From Edison Andrew Sent Saturday

answers the questions we posed to Indian counsel Lets talk at your convenience Andy Original Message From suresh talwar ENRON Sent Sat AM To Edison Andrew Cc Subject RE Fuel Management Agreement Dear Andy The answers to each of your questions is as follows There is no theory under Indian law that Enron could use to make an enforceable claim against MSEB in the context of the facts placed before us The concept of agency relationships does exist under Indian Contract Law The concept of third party beneficiary claims does not exist under Indian Contract Law However Enron cannot make use of the agency relationship theory as the Agreement has not apart from stating that DPC will be Enrons agent stated that DPC will be acting under the Agreement as agent for Enron for all purposes Yes our view is that Enron has no enforceable claim against MSEB on the basis of the facts placed before us and the provisions of the Agreement However if DPC makes a claim against MSEB and a judgment is awarded to DPC for recovery of the Fixed Fee either as such or by way of damage then Enron would have a right to attach the amount that may be payable by MSEB to DPC Kind regards Suresh Original Message From SMTP Sent Friday September PM To Cc Subject RE Fuel Management Agreement I am a little bit confused Is there any theory under Indian law we could use to make a claim against MSEB In America we might have a claim under an agency relationship or a third party beneficiary claim Is there any such creature under Indian law Is your advice that we have no claim whatsoever Original Message From suresh talwar ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESsureshtalwarCsureshEtalwarcrawfordbayleyEcomE NRONcom Sent Friday September AM To Edison Andrew Cc Subject Fuel Management Agreement Hello Andy I refer to your email of th September seeking clarification in respect of the advice we gave you on the th of September on the Fuel Management Agreement Agreement You wish to know whether Enron Fuels International Inc EnronFuel Manager could make a claim under Indian law against MSEB on any potential theories such as agency relationship third party beneficiary claims etc MSEB has to discharge certain functions under the Agreement These include amongst others approving of the Fuel Management Plan proposed by the Fuel Manager providing copies to the Fuel Manager of notices issued by MSEB to DPC pursuant to certain clauses in the PPA etc There is no provision in the Agreement to suggest that Enron has entered into the Agreement relying on the continued subsistence of the PPA and no commitment has been made by MSEB under the Agreement in that behalf Enrons right to the Fixed Fee from DPC under the Agreement is contingent upon DPC being paid the corresponding PPA Fuel Management Fee by MSEB I assume that the only parties to the PPA are DPC and MSEB The payment of the PPA Fuel Management Fee by MSEB to DPC is governed by the provisions of the PPA to which Enron is not a party Therefore there is no privity of contract between Enron and MSEBDPC as regards the PPA As a result Enron has no claim against MSEB for nonpayment of the PPA Fuel Management Fee to DPC and therefore has no claim against MSEB under the Agreement as there is no breach by MSEB of its functions under the Agreement I trust I have answered your query adequately Please feel free to call for any questions that you may have Kind regards

NRONDEVELOPMENT cc James L CT Subject Re Re FA Issues For your info we have contacted Medway a plant in the UK which has had similar compressor blade failures on the FAs This problem seems to be a type fault and along that line we have sounded out the Insurers and Medway whether they would be interested in taking a joint action against GE on the basis that the GTs GE has supplied are not fit for purpose The response was a resounding yes with the insurers wanting to set up a meeting between the affected parties This was done on a confidential basis and I have not pulled the trigger on setting this up Jim Boullion the insurance contact was David Way Our legal advice is that it would be very difficult to take this kind of action given the extent of the no consequentials language in the contract under NY law However this point may be a reasonable Hammer over GE if they cut up rough and give us a bad deal I think a joint action in the market could severely affect GEs sales position of the FA product range whether we have a strong case or not Gordon Grimes and the litigation team are tasked with trying to find us an angle on which to sue Further points to take note of below are Medway got stiffed by GE with the cost of repairs and extended warranty whereas we got these covered in our last deal The insurance market dried up in the UK on the insurability of these rotors Final insurance costs rose and their deductable went over days Ours is currently days We negotiated it down from days last year on our insurance renewal programme Insurabiltiy of the GTs including phase is going to be a challenge and MSEB is going to resist paying any increase in premium Insurance cost is a pass through to MSEB We need to be cognisant of these facts when dealing with GE next week Neil Forwarded by Neil McGregorENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM V S NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Neil McGregorENRON NRON CT cc Ken BladesENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Re FA Issues Medway has experienced two compressor failures the first one on CT in November when an R tip broke off and resulted in a major compressor failure The rotor was replaced with their spare one The second failure was more recent in July on CT when five of the R blade tips broke off and caused secondary damages to rows R and R In this case though GE advocated site repair of the rotor the insurance company refused to accept it Medway had to send the rotor for refurbishment to the GE repair facility before they could get reinsure this turbine The costs of repair were borne by Medway and all warranties had run out Both gas turbines had the old design of compressor blades Subsequent to the failure robust compressor blades were installed in row and on both compressors CT is running with the new compressor blades since December A September CI and boroscope inspection on this unit revealed minor burring of R stage blades CT is running with robust blades since October Though Tim Sharp was a bit

for MONTHS now but the company is not even responding to my requests for information I would highly appreciate it if you advised me on the best way to handle this ie WHO do I need to talk to who has

well with you I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron which have now become urgent from my standpoint These payments refer to contractual obligations between ECI one of my affiliate companies and Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself The payments have been invoiced and they are months late now After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments after leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South America I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler who I believe works with you informing me that I would have to wait until early November maybe even until late November as the changes in management at Enron require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee which would convene in early or late November As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this email to make sure that my position is clear These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation Committee These payments are already significantly late and I have been extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron up to now Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these payments otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions that I have I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday October Please
