friends including addresses and phone numbers of those who have knowledge of this situation especially your mom and sister and anyone who had firsthand knowledge not just things youve told them but things they knew or experienced of the issues in this case For instance a coworker might know things youve told while all this has been going on but a common friend or neighbor would have more significant knowledge Also if you would go through the Interrogatories and take a stab at answering the questions that you have answers to it will save you a lot of attorney fee time Thanks Jonda
