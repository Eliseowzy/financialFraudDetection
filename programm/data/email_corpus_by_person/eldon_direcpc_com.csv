computer show There is one that goes to Vallejo Concord and Santa Rosa that I know of and if you go this route I recommend that you ask other people at the show who they think the most reliable people are The prices are really good and you find a lot of Asus Intel and AMD stuff plus name brand products and software Its a good idea to know the specs ahead of time so you can make sure youre getting what you need Go to the website marketprocom to get more information if youre interested Original Message From Dasovich Jeff mailtoJeff NRONcom Sent Tuesday November PM To Avram Siegel Subject RE Online Computer Component Info Suffice to say Avram youve explained it a helluvalot better than I did I think I got as far as he wants to build a computerbased digital recording extravaganza Anyway Im responding because you replied only to me instead of reply to all Rory Eldon heres the dope I can hardly wait to hear the response Best to all Jeff Original Message From Avram Siegel Sent Tue PM To Dasovich Jeff Cc Subject Re Online Computer Component Info Hey Jeff Thanks for getting the word out there and hi to everyone checking in So heres the deal I want to build a DAW digital audio workstation a computer for multitrack audio recording and mixing etc Ive been researching this for a while but have just gotten more serious about it in the last couple of weeks partly because I lucked into a nice piece of hardware indefinate loan from a friend An to channel interface called a Delta which gives me a nice head start From what I have read so far it seems that there are some specific requirements for a machine to be solid and reliable It needs to be fast not so hard these days but the faster the better within my budget It needs to be paired down anything running in the background like powermanagement schemes can cause pops and clicks while youre recording and extraneous hareware uses system resources And it should have a seperate fast and large hard drive just for the audio data typically a SCSI drive Im finding a lot of recomendations against buying something off the shelf like a Dell or whatever Mostly I think to have more control over the specific components and also to cut down on a lot of the unnecessary to audio recording integrated accessories that those computers tend to have Also Im kind of looking forward to building it myself I like that kind of thing and it would mean I know how the thing works Heres the plan Im formulating at this point Im thinking of putting together a dual processor system with the fastest pentium IIIs I can afford There doesnt seem to be all that big a price range between the different speeds just now probably because theyre yesterdays news with the Ps out there By the way the Pentium s have not been getting the best reviews in the audio world from what I can tell and I dont think theres a dual processor motherboard for them yet Also I think they are more expensive For this I need to come up with a motherboard The one that Ive come up with so far is an Asus Tek CUVXD but Im new to all this and I dont even know what I dont know as far as whats out there so any suggestions are welcome Also I know I need a fast SCSI ideally rpm or better data trasnsfer rate of MB per second sustained transfer rate of at least MB per second or better and a seek time of ms or less as quoted in one of my sources Of course I need a pile of memory but I understand that its pretty cheap right now There also seems to be a debate going on about AMDs CPUs these days Hopefully I can save some money going low end on stuff like the monitor the keyboard and anything else that doesnt directly pertain to audio recording because I actually am on a budget Maybe there are some elements that I can even save for an upgrade I am willing to spend what I need to though because if this works well it could make for a more affordable way to record True Blues upcoming cd than going into a regular studio So there you have it in a rambling kind of way I appreciate any info you all can offer For instance I really dont know what the cheapest source for all this stuff is and there are probably plenty of issues that Im totally ignorant of Clearly all this points to the old saying about a little knowledge being a dangerous thing Avram Original Message From Dasovich Jeff mailto To Dasovich Jeff mailto Avram Siegel mailto
