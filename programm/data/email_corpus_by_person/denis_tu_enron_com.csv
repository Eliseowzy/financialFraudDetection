many changes to be made to the current Foothills economic model Many assumptions in the current model were challenged by the participant co mpanies Foothills agreed to reflect the suggested changes to the model An dy is supposed to send out a summary of the discussion and provided an ele ctronic copy of the model for withdrawn partners review Withdrawn partner s agreed to give their commentsfeedback on the model to Foothills until and another meeting to reach an agreement on economic modeltoll was scheduled for or The data from economictoll model will be used in commercial proposalpresentation to the ANS producers which ANN GTC intends to have by Tim and I will review Foothills cash flow and COS model and prepare comments Overall the participants though that the current Foothills model MM Btu toll for Alaska section has very aggressive assumptions in many ways and it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after a ll the appropriate revisions are made The following are the main discussio n points of the meeting Item and are expected to have a very large imp act on the toll Capex and Opex need to have annualmonthly escalation current model has escalation For example Foothills sensitivity analysis shows that Capex escalation would increase the toll by Numbers such as f or Capex and for Opex were thrown during the meeting but more reviews need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates Do you have any op inion on this Bryan Foothills is using Flowthrough method using cash taxes in COS calculati on to calculate income taxes that go into the Cost of Service and might be underestimating Cost of Service Tim thought that the Flowthrough method w ill not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed by IRS and FERC Foothills said that they can still have same toll under No rmalized tax method by changing the depreciation number but Tim was concer ned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation Fo othills declined our request to share their Cost of Service model and insis ted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the ca sh flow model They agreed to provide a hard copy of their Cost of Service model in the end but Tim and I were under impression that Foothills was tr ying to lower the toll as much as they can Tim was also concerned about le velized toll approach because of FERC might lower allowed return in the lat er rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this Please correc t me if I am wrong here Tim OM A is currently estimated to be of Capex but this might be too lo w OMA in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx of total Capex The Withdrawn Partners historical contributions million will be added to the Rate Base but this might be dropped if necessary Success fee of million should be included in the project budget Working Capital will be added to the project cost The Line Pack cost Bcf for the whole section was assumed to be borne by ANS producers but some participants highly doubted that that would be the case The Line Pac k gas might have to be bought by the Partnership or the Producers will at l east demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for year s For Return on Capital and AFUDC ROE and Interest on Debt assumin g capital structure is likely to be kept However the current drawdo wn schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginnin g which will not be true Certain assumptions should be made on the financ ial close date and commercial agreementpreliminary determination date to c alculate AFUDC more accurately Current financing assumption in the model is a year bank loan with ba lloon amortization and DSCR of In reality the initial bank loans will be of shorter maturity years and certain rollover financing will b e unavoidable It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches with different terms interest rate seniority etc There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of t he ANGTS considering that some sources of capital revenues and part of ope rating expenses will be in Canadian dollars A mechanis to mitigate currenc y risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it Property taxes of in Alaska seems high but Property taxes during con struction period should be added Lastly there is about million difference between ETS c urrent cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model excludi ng IDC and AFUDC Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for la rger pipe size or inch as noted in Bryans email Thanks JB Jebong Lee office cell

Email Walter Revell Email Subject Panel okays energy plan St Petersburg Times November Panel okays energy plan The governors panel on energy endorses opening the states power market to competition but few expect it to be tackled next year By STEVE HUETTEL St Petersburg Times published November TALLAHASSEE The governors energy study commission Thursday endorsed a plan backed by the states big utilities to open Floridas wholesale electricity market to competition The page report will frame the debate on deregulating the states power business But commission members acknowledged its unlikely legislators will tackle the complex plan next year when they are struggling with a budget shortfall and redrawing their electoral districts Some members of the panel wanted to recommend that the Legislature act first on the part of deregulation that the entrenched state utilities have long fought giving their outofstate competitors free rein to build power plants in the Florida This plan was designed to be so weighty it will never get anywhere in the Legislature said state Sen Tom Lee RBrandon If that happens the status quo wins Lees proposal to let in the outsiders first was narrowly defeated Opponents argued it wasnt fair to permit such merchant plants unless Florida utilities also were allowed to sell their existing plants to unregulated affiliates Commission chairman Walter Revell defended the reports complexity and said no one expects legislators to turn it into law quickly Energy is big technical complex controversial and capitalintensive said Revell who oversaw the panels months of work There are no short simple solutions for a strategic plan for energy for Florida Gov Jeb Bush appointed the Florida Energy Study Commission after outofstate companies were blocked from building merchant power plants by the Legislature and the state Supreme Court Florida is the only state that bans merchants from building the most efficient natural gasfired plants Bush argued that the state needed to attract more power plants to meet Floridas growing appetite for electricity and avoid Californiastyle power shortages The panel sent legislators a plan earlier this year that would have let merchants in and allowed state utilities to sell their plants to unregulated affiliates at depreciated values Critics charged the proposal would let utilities spin off the plants paid for by their Florida customers at bargainbasement prices That initial plan died in the Legislature Commission members tried to fix the problem in the new deregulation plan Ratepayers should get half of any profits utilities reaped from selling their plants the report recommends while company shareholders should eat any loss from a sale But Department of Environmental Protection secretary David Struhs said the provision wouldnt benefit ratepayers because there wont be any profits to share when utilities sell their plants at the depreciated value The energy commission had originally proposed taking away the authority of the state Public Service Commission the governor and Cabinet to reject unpopular power plant projects But environmentalists strongly opposed the plan The final report proposed eliminating the PSCs review of new plants but left it up the Legislature to decide the role of the governor and Cabinet Wednesday most panel members insisted the report was full of intertwined compromises that wouldnt work on their own It would be a tragic mistake to unsettle the balance by taking segments out said Stephen Mitchell a Tampa attorney But Lee suggested state utilities helped make the plan overly complicated by design If it failed he said established players such as Florida Power and Tampa Electric would get to keep their monopoly over the electricity business A top Florida Power executive said afterward that the way it turned out was a winwin The current system functions well said Vincent Dolan vice president for regulatory and public affairs Now weve got a report that could make the system better Steve Huettel can be reached at mailto or
