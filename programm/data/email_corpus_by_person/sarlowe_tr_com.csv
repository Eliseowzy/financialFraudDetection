WASHINGTON WUTC sets hearing on telecom operations rule changes WIRELESS PENNSYLVANIA State court says FCC should hear privacy claim against Sprint A threejudge panel of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania the states intermediate appeals court has rejected an appeal by two Sprint Spectrum LP customers who want their invasion of privacy claim to be heard in state court The opinion penned by Judge John T J Kelly found that the trial court properly dismissed the claim for lack of jurisdiction The customers brought the claim in alleging their privacy had been infringed because their personal account information could be accessed easily by anyone with a Sprint network wireless phone or anyone who called Sprints tollfree customer service number While Internet access to account information was protected by a personal identification number the customers claimed anyone who knew a customers zip code could access account information for a Sprint phone number using the tollfree number or a wireless phone The trial court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction The customers argued the trial court had jurisdiction because the state Public Utility Commission regulates Sprint They said Pennsylvania law gives the states courts jurisdiction over claims against PUCregulated entities The Superior Court rejected the customers reasoning finding that although the PUC regulates Sprints wireline operations it doesnt regulate its wireless service provider arm The court said A wireless telephone service provider does not become a regulated public utility simply because the commission regulates a related entity The court said section c of the federal Telecommunications Act of requires specific telecom privacy standards It concluded Although couched in terms of a state law cause of action for invasion of privacy the customers claim falls squarely within the conduct prohibited by section of the Act The court added that the customers may wish to raise the matter in a complaint with the FCC Judge Kelly also noted that the customers cant rely solely on the state law privacy claim because they havent shown that their particular private information has been disseminated to the public at large and that they have suffered harm by this dissemination Judges John L Musmanno and Joan Orie Melvin joined Judge Kellys opinion Case no WDA Mark

Committee OKs bill closing cell tower zoning loop hole The Senate Energy Natural Resources and Agriculture Committee has approved SB to close a loophole regarding the placement of an unmanned telecom microwave fiber optic or electrical facility If citizens choose to place such a facility on their property the property wouldnt be considered a subdivision under the states zoning laws the bills sponsor Sen Ron Allen D District explained to TR The legislative staff further explained that people sometimes try to subdivide their property to receive a tax break She added that closing this loophole probably wouldnt act as a deterrent for anyone looking to place a cell tower on their property because of the large sums of money most landowners receive from companies for renting out their land The staff also said the bill would help keep the matter out of the courts Because there was no strict rule regarding the issue of whether these facilities subdivided property the matter has been

slamming complaint WIRELESS PENNSYLVANIA Appellate court upholds Nextel wireless tower permit The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania has upheld a decision by the Newlin Township Zoning Board to allow Nextel Communications Inc to build a telecommunications tower in Newlin The opinion written by President Judge Joseph T Doyle upheld a trial court decision to defer to the towns zoning board The citizens opposing the tower said the board erred when it defined Nextels proposed tower as a radio transmitter The Newlin Township zoning ordinance limits the types of buildings that can be constructed but allows the board to grant a special exemption to authorize the construction of a radio or television transmitter The ordinance however doesnt define radio transmitter The citizens asserted that the radio transmitter component of the facility is but a minor element and said the foot tower falls far outside any commonly understood definition of radio transmitter They argued that because the tower doesnt fit into any other category the zoning ordinance doesnt permit it to be constructed within the township Judge Doyle ruled that the record supported the boards decision The judge noted that testimony by a Nextel engineer demonstrated that the tower was an integral part of the facility He concluded that the entire system operates together in order to transmit the necessary information for the cellular network to function Senior Judge William J Lederer and Judge Bonnie B Leadbeter joined Judge Doyles opinion Case no CD Robert and Loren Pearson v Zoning Hearing Board of Newlin Township and Nextel Communications of the Mid Atlantic Inc CUSTOMERAFFECTING MICHIGAN PSC approves Ameritech identity theft protection procedures The Public Service Commission today approved procedures proposed by AmeritechMichigan to protect customers from identity theft The commission had ordered Ameritech to file the proposed procedures when it fined the company million for identity theftrelated violations of the Michigan Telecommunications Act pm The PSCs decision responded to a complaint filed by customer Patricia Nelski In July Nelski discovered that a fraudulent Ameritech telephone account had been opened in her name She contacted Ameritech and was told she wouldnt be held responsible for charges to the account She subsequently learned that she had been denied credit and employment because Ameritech failed to clear her credit record as promised Under the procedures approved today Ameritech must accurately verify the identity of persons ordering service ensure that accounts referred to collection agencies and credit reporting bureaus are attributed to the responsible parties and keep records on accounts referred to collection agencies and credit bureaus for the duration of any adverse credit reports that result The company also must ensure that all negative credit information is removed from credit reports when an account has been deemed fraudulent and it must respond in a timely manner to customer complaints about fraudulent accounts or identity theft Case no U SECTION MICHIGAN PSC OKs revised Ameritech recip comp rates The Public Service Commission today approved AmeritechMichigans proposed revisions to its reciprocal compensation rate structure Ameritech had proposed a bifurcated rate structure that reduces the current charges applied to minutes of use and shifts recovery to a setup charge applied to each call without regard to duration The commission noted that Ameritechs showing that a rate structure predicated on separate percall setup and perminute usage charges better reflects cost causation wasnt rebutted by any of the other carriers participating in the case Moreover the PSC said the revenue effects of the Ameritech plan are largely neutral to the extent that the traffic being exchanged reflects the average holding time used to set the charges The PSC rejected Ameritechs request to exempt foreign exchange service from payment of reciprocal compensation The commission said Ameritech failed to explain whether or how the means of routing a call placed by one local exchange carriers LECs customer to another LECs point of interconnection affects the costs that the second LEC necessarily incurs to terminate the call Historically the PSC said the routing of a call hasnt depended on whether its a local call or a toll call Moreover the commission said the discretion that competitive local exchange carriers exercise in designing their local calling areas is a competitive innovation that enables them to provide valuable alternatives to an ILECs traditional service The PSC saw no reason to change these standards particularly when the result would be an unnecessary restriction on the services the customers want and need Case no U In the matter of the application of Ameritech Michigan to revise its reciprocal compensation rates and rate structure and to exempt foreign exchange service from payment of reciprocal compensation CUSTOMERAFFECTING HAWAII Legislators to examine telemarketing fraud Sen Brian Kanno D District has introduced SB to make telemarketing fraud a criminal offense An

ALJ found that Advantage Plus had performed an unauthorized switch of a residential customers telecom service provider and billed unauthorized charges to that same customers business Advantage Plus is a reseller of Qwest Corps services The ALJ also found that Accutel had charged the same business for a service for which the telecom service provider hadnt received an initial affirmative order Case no U ADVANCED SERVICES UTAH Bill would increase telecom access in rural schools Sen Beverly Ann Evans R District has sponsored a bill to require the Utah Education Network UEN to work with rural county governments to establish education resource centers in their counties The UEN maintains an education microwave distribution system data network and other telecom service distribution systems appropriate for providing video audio and data services for public schools and colleges SB would require the UEN to set up such centers in at least Beaver Daggett Garfield Juab Kane Morgan Piute Rich

Telecommunications Act of nearly five years ago according to a new report from the Consumer Federation of America CFA CFA DirectorResearch Mark Cooper who wrote the study says of Floridas local residential market is still under the control of the incumbentsBellSouth Telecommunications Inc Sprint Corp and Verizon Communications Inc The study recommends several steps the Public Service

reasonable prices for network access and ensure that operation support systems can accommodate the demands of new competitors Local competition can begin to thrive in Florida as it has in New York and

Axces Inc Slamming is the unauthorized switch of a customers telecom carrier Earlier this month the PUC staff asked the commission to fine Axces up to for slamming customers The staff said the proposed fine amounted to per violation It said the penalty was appropriate because the PUC views slamming as one of the most serious violations that a telecom provider can commit The staff also said stiff fines were warranted to deter Axces from committing future violations The staff pointed out that Axces pattern of slamming has continued despite the fact that the company paid a penalty to the PUC in for alleged slamming activities am The ALJ determined that prehearing conferences should be held every three weeks to resolve any outstanding discovery issues and preliminary matters The

Rep Sertich takes aim at drivers using mobile telephones MICHIGAN Ameritech study says consumers overpay long distance companies ALASKA GCI to offer cable modem access in Valdez SECTION PENNSYLVANIA ALJ recommends splitting Verizon into wholesale retail affiliates Public Utility Commission Administrative Law Judge Wayne L Weismandel has recommended that the commission give Verizon Pennsylvania Inc one year to create a separate retail affiliate The retail affiliate would have to operate independently from Verizons wholesale operations in the state In April the PUC initiated a proceeding to determine the details of the split which it had required in its global order on telecom competition in the state The PUCs global order determined that such a structural separation is the most efficient tool to ensure local telephone competition Under protest and after lengthy litigation and settlement negotiations failed to head off the PUC proceeding Verizon filed its separation plan June ALJ Weismandel found that Verizons plan doesnt propose a full separation In October after Verizon suggested that the spilt could cost the company more than billion the PUC ruled that Verizon could present testimony regarding the economic costs and benefits of a full structural separation but couldnt present testimony directly advocating that there is no need for structural separation pm The ALJ found that Verizon couldnt support sufficiently its claim that full separation would cost billion and concluded that Verizons own separation plan simply did not comply with the commissions orders Verizon proposed the creation of a separate advanced services affiliate adherence to a PUCapproved code of conduct and the provision of wholesale service subject to PUC performance standards and remedies But it never produced a detailed plan of structural separation according to the ALJ The ALJ also recommended rejecting plans proposed by ATT Corp WorldCom Inc the Office of the Consumer Advocate and other carriers and consumer groups The plans included the possibility of forcing migration of some Verizons current retail customers to competitive local exchange carriers CLECs and requiring the newly created Verizon retail unit to have significant minority shareholder interests The recommended decision concluded that the commission is left with no choice but to direct structural separation of specific elements as the commission deems appropriate as it said it would do in the Global Order Wiesmandel proposed giving Verizon days to begin a oneyear transition period to split into separate affiliates and to file a detailed plan allocating and identifying sufficient personnel equipment and facilities in each of its operations units to use to create the retail affiliate Weismandel also recommended ordering the retail affiliate to maintain separate books and records have separate officers directors and employees be prohibited from obtaining credit under any arrangement that would give a creditor recourse to the wholesale affiliate upon default and conduct all transactions with the wholesale affiliate at arms length in writing and subject to public inspection Verizon Pennsylvania President Daniel J Whelan said the recommended decision was totally unwarranted and would stop a quickmoving industry in its tracks Whelan said that if the PUC adopts order the cost of operating as separate companies would range from to per year for each phone line and ultimately would be passed on to businesses and consumers Verizon also said the split could threaten about positions A PUC spokesman told TR the commission may take up the recommended decision as early as March or April Docket no M CUSTOMERAFFECTING TEXAS PUC to take up slamming rulemaking

staff authority to suspend advice letters The Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to consider a resolution during its Feb meeting that would authorize its staff to suspend advice letters on behalf of the commission Regulated companies usually file advice letters to make routine changes to their tariffs The commission said it was considering the resolution because on occasion its unable

services to every resident of the city Michael Mower Provos director of community and governmental relations told TR Mower said ATT only provides services to select businesses and portions of the city

legislative staff member told TR The existing definitions of telephone solicitation provide too many loopholes for telemarketers the staff member said Under present law telephone solicitation doesnt include calls from any entity with which a consumer had contact with for business purposes during the past days The proposed legislation would sweep in such calls if the caller encouraged the consumer

administrative law judges recommended decision that the Public Utility Commission proceed with plans to require Verizon Pennsylvania Inc to separate its wholesale and retail operations in the state

proposed separation plan and also refused to follow suggestions by competing carriers and other parties Instead the ALJ recommended several specific separation requirements such as appointing separate corporate officers and maintaining separate books pm H Russell Frisby Jr president of CompTel said We are generally pleased with the ALJs decision and the fact that it recognizes that the only way to achieve true competition is through structural separation CompTel said the ALJs proposal encourages the commission to adopt additional safeguards and to consider prohibitions against joint marketing activities and product packaging between the wholesale and retail affiliates ATT said the recommended decision is a step closer to local phone choice Jim Ginty president of ATTPennsylvania said it recognizes the need to implement full structural separation He said strong medicine is neededwith competitors in New York exiting the market the possibility of Verizon remonopolizing the local and long distance market is clearly very real and could happen very quickly A WorldCom Inc spokesperson said that since the PUCs global order Verizon has been using scare tactics and confusion to try to prevent regulators from implementing the split The judge was righton when he said Verizon needs to stop whining about not wanting to comply with the order and turn its attention to how its going to separate its retail and wholesale divisions the WorldCom spokesperson said According to a PUC spokesperson the commission could take up the recommended decision as early as March or April Docket no M

wont receive recip comp at tandem rate from Verizon The Public Service Commission has ruled that WorldCom Inc has failed to demonstrate that it deserves reciprocal compensation from Verizon New York Inc at Verizons tandem rate In the commission issued an order addressing whether traffic including Internet service provider ISPbound traffic is convergent with lower termination costs and whether it therefore should be compensated at a lower rate am The solution was to create a rebuttable presumption that a substantial portion of a carriers traffic is convergent if its incomingtooutgoing traffic ratio exceeds threetoone for the most recent threemonth period If a competitive local exchange carrier CLEC exceeds the set ratio the PSC determined it should be compensated at the lower Verizon endoffice rates not the higher tandem rate To rebut this presumption a CLEC must show that its network and service are such that the higher tandem rate is appropriate despite exceeding the ratio On July WorldCom filed a petition asserting that its network and services qualify it for the higher rate WorldCom asserted that the networks of its New York operating companiesMCI Metroaccess Transmission Service LLC Brooks Communications of New York Inc and MCI WorldCom Communications Incwhen taken as a whole more than qualify for tandem reciprocal compensation WorldCom said its combined network doesnt exceed the threetoone incomingtooutgoing traffic ratio Even if it does exceed the ratio WorldCom asserted the network meets the requirements to rebut the presumption because it has tandemlike functionality in both the transmission and receipt of traffic The PSC however agreed with Verizons position that WorldCom cant aggregate all of its operations to rebut the presumption that it should receive the lower endoffice rates The PSC said that because WorldCom didnt identify the facilities or operating territory of the individual companies or indicate whether the operating entities are integrated the PSC had no basis to decide whether the companies individually offer efficient tandemlike interconnection despite their overwhelmingly convergent traffic ratios Case no C

PSC nearly consumers in the past two months have asked the commission to help curb telemarketing SB and HB would assist the consumers to greatly reduce or eliminate unwanted telemarketing calls PSC Chairman Nielsen Cochran said He urged consumers who support the measures to ask their legislators to vote in favor of the bills While critics argue that the bills are antibusiness Cochran said a nocall list actually could help telemarketers by screening out consumers who wouldnt be receptive to the calls Similar legislation is already in place in states including Alabama Arkansas Florida

Connect Illinois a group that counts AmeritechIllinois as a member backs the legislation ICCTs membership includes ATT Corp the Cable Television and Communications Association of Illinois and Focal

additional services to residential customers This means that for the next two years there will still be caps on rates for one basic phone line per household but Ameritech will be free to make unlimited rate hikes on common services such as a second line call waiting and voice mail ICCT said Gary Mack executive director of ICCT said The fact that Ameritech had the audacity to propose this

Chicago LONG DISTANCE CALIFORNIA CLECs ask PUC to refresh record on Pacific Bell interLATA service bid The Office of Ratepayer Advocates several trade associations representing competitive local exchange carriers CLECs and nine individual CLECs have asked the Public Utilities Commission to take the time to refresh its record on Pacific Bells compliance with federally mandated marketopening standards before deciding whether the telco has met those standards In a joint petition filed Feb they argued that the record in the proceeding was too stale for the PUC to be able to reach credible conclusions about Pacific Bells compliance by May the date the commission is scheduled to issue its final decision Compliance with a point competitive checklist outlined in section of the federal Telecommunications Act of is a prerequisite to Bell companies receiving FCC authorization to provide inregion interLATA local access and transport area service The FCC is required to consult with the relevant state commissions and the US Department of Justice before reaching a decision on a Bell companys section application and the Bell companies typically try to convince the state regulators of their compliance before submitting an application to the FCC The joint petitioners told the PUC that the record could be supplemented in a relatively prompt and efficient manner They asked that if Pacific Bell intends to include updated or other additional information in its application to be filed with the FCC then it should make that information available to the PUC and the parties to this proceeding now consistent with the FCCs goal that the state commission be the principal forum for resolving factual disputes in the first instance rather than require the PUC and the parties to address Pacific Bells showing for the first time after being thrust into an expedited review process before the federal agency in Washington DC In addition to the Office of Ratepayer Advocates the

California Inc Docket R ALTERNATIVE REGULATION ARIZONA ALJ recommends adopting proposed rate settlement with minor changes A state Corporation Commission administrative law judge has issued a proposed order to approve in part a settlement reached by Qwest Corp and the ACC staff in a Qwest rate case am The proposed decision which was released late Friday is subject to review by the full commission during an open meeting No date has been set yet Under the proposed decision Qwest would be able to recover million of its revenue requirement through a combination of rate increases and decreases It also could recover million in revenue from flexibly priced competitive services The proposed decision would provide that Qwests fair value rate base for the test year ending Dec is about million and a reasonable rateofreturn on that base is The ALJ recommended deleting one provision section g from the settlement that would allow Qwest to attain flexible pricing for all services offered within a particular wire center provided there were other competitors within the wire center The ALJ said the provision could open the door for Qwest to price a competitive service very aggressively in a targeted area but be able to price the same service or package much higher in areas where it doesnt face competition The ALJ approved the settlements provision placing Qwests services into three different baskets Basket one would include basic noncompetitive services basket two would include wholesale services and basket three would include competitive services The ALJ also approved a portion of the settlement that allowed new services and service packages to be included in basket three without having to meet all of the requirements contained in the commissions rules If Qwest asks to combine a basket one service with a basket three service all the commission rules would apply Under the proposed decision basket one services could be combined with other services and placed in basket three provided that the basket one service remain available as a basket one service The Department of Defense the Communications Workers of America and the Arizona Payphone Association support the proposed settlement The Residential Utility Consumer Office the Arizona Consumers Council ATT Corp and Cox Communications Inc oppose it The commissioners previously discussed holding additional public

advance ARIZONA Bill would change excise tax that funds emergency telecom services COMPETITIVE LOCAL ENTRY ARIZONA Bill would end antitrust exemption for competitive services The Arizona Legislature is considering a bill that would remove any competitive telecom service from an exemption of the Uniform State Antitrust Act Current law exempts any conduct or activity of a public service corporation holding a certification of public convenience and necessity from the Act The staff of the Democratic Caucus explained to TR that HB would apply only to competitive services not to the companies as a whole For example the bill would affect services like Caller ID call waiting and threeway calling The staff added that a similar bill that passed last year that removed competitive electricity generation service from the antitrust exemption HB which was introduced by Rep Bill Brotherton D District awaits consideration by the House Energy Utilities and Technology Committee the House Commerce and Economic Development Committee and the House Rules Committee ALTERNATIVE REGULATION CONNECTICUT DPUC nixes service reclassification OKs rest of Verizon alt reg plan The Department of Public Utility Control has approved Verizon New York Incs revised proposed alternative regulation plan on the condition that the company remove certain service reclassification provisions Connecticut law requires an incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs services to be classified as competitive noncompetitive or emergingcompetitive Verizon had proposed that all new services and new service packages offered during the plan would be proposed as competitive subject to the departments acceptance Verizon also suggested designating its toll service offerings as competitive because the department already has classified such services as competitive for the Southern New England Telephone Co SNET the states other ILEC The DPUC said the statute requires specific notice and hearing procedures before it can change the classification of an ILECs service The department decided it couldnt roll the statutory reclassification procedure into its tariff procedures Turning to the reclassification of toll services the department said that although Verizons presence in Connecticut is dwarfed by SNETs presence Verizon is the incumbent telco in its two territories and arguably maintains the same presence as SNET when compared to competitive local exchange companies The DPUC concluded that Verizon cant use its revised alt reg plan to circumvent the statutory reclassification requirements It also concluded that Verizon hadnt provided any evidence detailing the status and level of competition in its territories The department found the rest of the plan acceptable including the elimination of the touch tone charge for residential customers representing a revenue reduction over the year life of the plan The revised plan also commits Verizon to previously established servicequality requirements The department told Verizon to resubmit the plan minus the service reclassification provisions by Feb Docket no Application of the New York Telephone Co for Alternative Regulation STATE

larger for Ameritech Verizon customers The Public Service Commission yesterday determined that local calling area should be defined as the home exchange to which a customers local access line is assigned as specified in the maps and boundary descriptions of the incumbent local telephone service providers tariffs The commission adopted the definition pursuant to a provision of a recent amendment to the Michigan Telecommunications Act pm The provision requires calls made to calling areas adjacent to the callers local calling area to be considered and billed as local calls The PSC determined that the statutory provision doesnt create a new service and thus prohibits setting a rate for expanded local calling as a new service Carriers must charge the same rate that they have been

is considering a bill that would remove any competitive telecom service from an exemption of the Uniform State Antitrust Act Current law exempts any conduct or activity of a public service corporation holding a certification of public convenience and necessity from the Act The staff of the Democratic Caucus explained to TR that HB would apply only to competitive services not to the companies as a whole For example the bill would affect services like Caller ID call waiting and threeway calling The staff added that a similar bill that passed last year that removed competitive electricity generation service from the antitrust exemption HB which was introduced by Rep Bill Brotherton D District awaits consideration by the House Energy Utilities and Technology Committee the House Commerce and Economic Development Committee and the House Rules Committee ALTERNATIVE REGULATION CONNECTICUT DPUC nixes service reclassification OKs rest of Verizon alt reg plan The Department of Public

requires an incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs services to be classified as competitive noncompetitive or emergingcompetitive Verizon had proposed that all new services and new service packages offered during the plan would be proposed as competitive subject to the departments acceptance Verizon also suggested designating its toll service offerings as competitive because the department already has classified such services as competitive for the Southern New England Telephone Co SNET the states other ILEC The DPUC said the statute requires specific notice and hearing procedures before it can change the classification of an ILECs service The department decided it couldnt roll the statutory reclassification procedure into its tariff procedures Turning to the reclassification of toll services the department said that although Verizons presence in Connecticut is dwarfed by SNETs presence Verizon is the incumbent telco in its two territories and arguably maintains the same presence as SNET when compared to competitive local exchange companies The DPUC concluded that Verizon cant use its revised alt reg plan to circumvent the statutory reclassification requirements It also concluded that Verizon hadnt provided any evidence detailing the status and level of competition in its territories The department found the rest of the plan acceptable including the elimination of the touch tone charge for residential customers representing a revenue reduction over the year life of the plan The revised plan also commits Verizon to previously established servicequality requirements The department told Verizon to resubmit the plan minus the service reclassification provisions by Feb Docket no Application of the New York Telephone Co for Alternative Regulation STATE

amendment to the Michigan Telecommunications Act pm The provision requires calls made to calling areas adjacent to the callers local calling area to be considered and billed as local calls The PSC

exchange carriers CLECs and nine individual CLECs have asked the Public Utilities Commission to take the time to refresh its record on Pacific Bells compliance with federally mandated marketopening standards before deciding whether the telco has met those standards In a joint petition filed Feb they argued that the record in the proceeding was too stale for the PUC to be able to reach credible conclusions about Pacific Bells compliance by May the date the commission is scheduled to issue its final decision Compliance with a point competitive checklist outlined in section of the federal Telecommunications Act of is a prerequisite to Bell companies receiving FCC authorization to provide inregion interLATA local access and transport area service The FCC is required to consult with the relevant state commissions and the US Department of Justice before reaching a decision on a Bell companys section application and the Bell companies typically try to convince the state regulators of their compliance before submitting an application to the FCC The joint petitioners told the PUC that the record could be supplemented in a relatively prompt and efficient manner They asked that if Pacific Bell intends to include updated or other additional information in its application to be filed with the FCC then it should make that information available to the PUC and the parties to this proceeding now consistent with the FCCs goal that the state commission be the principal forum for resolving factual disputes in the first instance rather than require the PUC and the parties to

order to approve in part a settlement reached by Qwest Corp and the ACC staff in a Qwest rate case am The proposed decision which was released late Friday is subject to review by the full commission during an open meeting No date has been set yet Under the proposed decision Qwest would be able to recover million of its revenue requirement through a combination of rate increases and decreases It also could recover million in revenue from flexibly priced competitive services The proposed decision would provide that Qwests fair value rate base for the test year ending Dec is about million and a reasonable rateofreturn on that base is The ALJ recommended deleting one provision section g from the settlement that would allow Qwest to attain flexible pricing for all services offered within a particular wire center provided there were other competitors within the wire center The ALJ said the provision could open the door for Qwest to price a competitive service very aggressively in a targeted area but be able to price the same service or package much higher in areas where it doesnt face competition The ALJ approved the settlements provision placing Qwests services into three different baskets Basket one would include basic noncompetitive services basket two would include wholesale services and basket three would include competitive services The ALJ also approved a portion of the settlement that allowed new services and service packages to be included in basket three without having to meet all of the requirements contained in the commissions rules If Qwest asks to combine a basket one service with a basket three service all the commission rules would apply Under the proposed decision basket one services could be combined with other services and placed in basket three provided that the basket one service remain available as a basket one service The Department of Defense the Communications Workers of America and the Arizona Payphone Association support the proposed settlement The Residential Utility Consumer Office the Arizona Consumers Council ATT Corp and Cox Communications Inc oppose it The commissioners previously discussed holding additional public

wont receive recip comp at tandem rate from Verizon The Public Service Commission has ruled that WorldCom Inc has failed to demonstrate that it deserves reciprocal compensation from Verizon New York Inc at Verizons tandem rate In the commission issued an order addressing whether traffic including Internet service provider ISPbound traffic is convergent with lower termination costs and whether it therefore should be compensated at a lower rate am The solution was to create a rebuttable presumption that a substantial portion of a carriers traffic is convergent if its incomingtooutgoing traffic ratio exceeds threetoone for the most recent threemonth period If a competitive local exchange carrier CLEC exceeds the set ratio the PSC determined it should be compensated at the lower Verizon endoffice rates not the higher tandem rate To rebut this presumption a CLEC must show that its network and service are such that the higher tandem rate is appropriate despite exceeding the ratio On July WorldCom filed a petition asserting that its network and services qualify it for the higher rate WorldCom asserted that the networks of its New York operating companiesMCI Metroaccess Transmission Service LLC Brooks Communications of New York Inc and MCI WorldCom Communications Incwhen taken as a whole more than qualify for tandem reciprocal compensation WorldCom said its combined network doesnt exceed the threetoone incomingtooutgoing traffic ratio Even if it does exceed the ratio WorldCom asserted the network meets the requirements to rebut the presumption because it has tandemlike functionality in both the transmission and receipt of traffic The PSC however agreed with Verizons position that WorldCom cant aggregate all of its operations to rebut the presumption that it should receive the lower endoffice rates The PSC said that because WorldCom didnt identify the facilities or operating territory of the individual companies or indicate whether the operating entities are integrated the PSC had no basis to decide whether the companies individually offer efficient tandemlike interconnection despite their overwhelmingly convergent traffic ratios Case no C

consumers who joined a nocall list SB sponsored by Sen Thomas E Robertson R District and HB introduced by Rep Les Barnett R District would require the PSC to maintain the nocall list According to the PSC nearly consumers in the past two months have asked the commission to help curb telemarketing SB and HB would assist the consumers to greatly reduce or eliminate unwanted telemarketing calls PSC Chairman Nielsen Cochran said He urged consumers who support the measures to ask their legislators to vote in favor of the bills While critics argue that the bills are antibusiness Cochran said a nocall list actually could help telemarketers by screening out consumers who wouldnt be receptive to the calls Similar legislation is already in place in states including Alabama Arkansas Florida

Connect Illinois a group that counts AmeritechIllinois as a member backs the legislation ICCTs membership includes ATT Corp the Cable Television and Communications Association of Illinois and Focal Communications Corp ICCT noted that one of the more interesting parts of HB SB is that it retains regulation over the most basic residential service for two years but immediately deregulates additional services to residential customers This means that for the next two years there will still be caps on rates for one basic phone line per household but Ameritech will be free to make unlimited rate hikes on common services such as a second line call waiting and voice mail ICCT said Gary Mack executive director of ICCT said The fact that Ameritech had the audacity to propose this bill after months and month of skyrocketing customer complaints is just further proof that the General Assembly needs to take strong action when it rewrites the states telecommunications law this year

administrative law judges recommended decision that the Public Utility Commission proceed with plans to require Verizon Pennsylvania Inc to separate its wholesale and retail operations in the state

proposed separation plan and also refused to follow suggestions by competing carriers and other parties Instead the ALJ recommended several specific separation requirements such as appointing separate corporate officers and maintaining separate books pm H Russell Frisby Jr president of CompTel said We are generally pleased with the ALJs decision and the fact that it recognizes that the only way to achieve true competition is through structural separation CompTel said the ALJs proposal encourages the commission to adopt additional safeguards and to consider prohibitions against joint marketing activities and product packaging between the wholesale and retail affiliates ATT said the recommended decision is a step closer to local phone choice Jim Ginty president of ATTPennsylvania said it recognizes the need to implement full structural separation He said strong medicine is neededwith competitors in New York exiting the market the possibility of Verizon remonopolizing the local and long distance market is clearly very real and could happen very quickly A WorldCom Inc spokesperson said that since the PUCs global order Verizon has been using scare tactics and confusion to try to prevent regulators from implementing the split The judge was righton when he said Verizon needs to stop whining about not wanting to comply with the order and turn its attention to how its going to

Rep Sertich takes aim at drivers using mobile telephones MICHIGAN Ameritech study says consumers overpay long distance companies ALASKA GCI to offer cable modem access in Valdez SECTION PENNSYLVANIA ALJ recommends splitting Verizon into wholesale retail affiliates Public Utility Commission Administrative Law Judge Wayne L Weismandel has recommended that the commission give Verizon Pennsylvania Inc one year to create a separate retail affiliate The retail affiliate would have to operate independently from Verizons wholesale operations in the state In April the PUC initiated a proceeding to determine the details of the split which it had required in its global order on telecom competition in the state The PUCs global order determined that such a structural separation is the most efficient tool to ensure local telephone competition Under protest and after lengthy litigation and settlement negotiations failed to head off the PUC proceeding Verizon filed its separation plan June ALJ Weismandel found that Verizons plan doesnt propose a full separation In October after Verizon suggested that the spilt could cost the company more than billion the PUC ruled that Verizon could present testimony regarding the economic costs and benefits of a full structural separation but couldnt present testimony directly advocating that there is no need for structural separation pm The ALJ found that Verizon couldnt support sufficiently its claim that full separation would cost billion and concluded that Verizons own separation plan simply did not comply with the commissions orders Verizon proposed the creation of a separate advanced services affiliate adherence to a PUCapproved code of conduct and the provision of wholesale service subject to PUC performance standards and remedies But it never produced a detailed plan of structural separation according to the ALJ The ALJ also recommended rejecting plans proposed by ATT Corp WorldCom Inc the Office of the Consumer Advocate and other carriers and consumer groups The plans included the possibility of forcing migration of some Verizons current retail customers to competitive local exchange carriers CLECs and requiring the newly created Verizon retail unit to have significant minority shareholder interests The recommended decision concluded that the commission is left with no choice but to direct structural separation of specific elements as the commission deems appropriate as it said it would do in the Global Order Wiesmandel proposed giving Verizon days to begin a oneyear transition period to split into separate affiliates and to file a detailed plan allocating and identifying sufficient personnel equipment and facilities in each of its operations units to use to create the retail affiliate Weismandel also recommended ordering the retail affiliate to maintain separate books and records have separate officers directors and employees be prohibited from obtaining credit under any arrangement that would give a creditor recourse to the wholesale affiliate upon default and conduct all transactions with the wholesale affiliate at arms length in writing and subject to public inspection Verizon Pennsylvania President Daniel J Whelan said the recommended decision was totally unwarranted and would stop a quickmoving industry in its tracks Whelan said that if the PUC adopts order the cost of operating as separate companies would range from to per year for each phone line and ultimately would be passed on to businesses and consumers Verizon also said the split could threaten about positions A PUC spokesman told TR the commission may take up the recommended decision as early as March or April Docket no M CUSTOMERAFFECTING TEXAS PUC to take up slamming rulemaking

initiating unauthorized carrier changes and the responsibilities of the original utilities Substantive rule section f The commission decided to take the issue up after the Texas Statewide Telephone Cooperative Inc TSTCI said the states rules werent consistent with federal law According to TSTCI the Texas rules depart from federal rules in two ways under the federal rules the authorized carrier is required to make refunds to customers while under the state rules the unauthorized carrier has this responsibility and the federal and state rules calculate refunds differently The PUC decided to wait until the summer to begin the rulemaking so that any changes made by the Legislature related to slamming could be included Project no FUTURE OF REGULATION CALIFORNIA Resolution would give PUC staff authority to suspend advice letters The Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to consider a resolution during its Feb meeting that would authorize its staff to suspend advice letters on

to complete its review and disposition of the proposed tariff changes within the prescribed notice period In the draft resolution the PUC characterized the volume of advice letter filings as substantial and said it would be impractical for the commission itself to issue a decision suspending each advice letter on an individual basis The resolution would allow the directors of the energy telecom and water divisions or their designated representatives and the executive director or his designee to suspend an advice letter The staff initially could suspend an advice letter for a maximum

slamming complaint WIRELESS PENNSYLVANIA Appellate court upholds Nextel wireless tower permit The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania has upheld a decision by the Newlin Township Zoning Board to allow Nextel Communications Inc to build a telecommunications tower in Newlin The opinion written by President Judge Joseph T Doyle upheld a trial court decision to defer to the towns zoning board The citizens opposing the tower said the board erred when it defined Nextels proposed tower as a radio transmitter The Newlin Township zoning ordinance limits the types of buildings that can be constructed but allows the board to grant a special exemption to authorize the construction of a radio or television transmitter The ordinance however doesnt define radio transmitter The citizens asserted that the radio transmitter component of the facility is but a minor element and said the foot tower falls far outside any commonly understood definition of radio transmitter They argued that because the tower doesnt fit into any other category the zoning ordinance doesnt permit it to be constructed within the township Judge Doyle ruled that the record supported the boards decision The judge noted that testimony by a Nextel engineer demonstrated that the tower was an integral part of the facility He concluded that the entire system operates together in order to transmit the necessary information for the cellular network to function Senior Judge William J Lederer and Judge Bonnie B Leadbeter joined Judge Doyles opinion Case no CD Robert and Loren Pearson v Zoning Hearing Board of Newlin Township and Nextel Communications of the Mid Atlantic Inc CUSTOMERAFFECTING MICHIGAN PSC approves Ameritech identity theft protection procedures The Public Service Commission today approved procedures proposed by AmeritechMichigan to protect customers from identity theft The commission had ordered Ameritech to file the proposed procedures when it fined the company million for identity theftrelated violations of the Michigan Telecommunications Act pm The PSCs decision responded to a complaint filed by customer Patricia Nelski In July Nelski discovered that a fraudulent Ameritech telephone account had been opened in her name She contacted Ameritech and was told she wouldnt be held responsible for charges to the account She subsequently learned that she had been denied credit and employment because Ameritech failed to clear her credit record as promised Under the procedures approved today Ameritech must accurately verify the identity of persons ordering service ensure that accounts referred to collection agencies and credit reporting bureaus are attributed to the responsible parties and keep records on accounts referred to collection agencies and credit bureaus for the duration of any adverse credit reports that result The company also must ensure that all negative credit information is removed from credit reports when an account has been deemed fraudulent and it must respond in a timely manner to customer complaints about fraudulent accounts or identity theft Case no U SECTION MICHIGAN PSC OKs revised Ameritech recip comp rates The Public Service Commission today approved AmeritechMichigans proposed revisions to its reciprocal compensation rate structure Ameritech had proposed a bifurcated rate structure that reduces the current charges applied to minutes of use and shifts recovery to a setup charge applied to each call without regard to duration The commission noted that Ameritechs showing that a rate structure predicated on separate percall setup and perminute usage charges better reflects cost causation wasnt rebutted by any of the other carriers participating in the case Moreover the PSC said the revenue effects of the Ameritech plan are largely neutral to the extent that the traffic being exchanged reflects the average holding time used to set the charges The PSC rejected Ameritechs request to exempt foreign exchange service from payment of reciprocal compensation The commission said Ameritech failed to explain whether or how the means of routing a call placed by one local exchange carriers LECs customer to another LECs point of interconnection affects the costs that the second LEC necessarily incurs to terminate the call Historically the PSC said the routing of a call hasnt depended on whether its a local call or a toll call Moreover the commission said the discretion that competitive local exchange carriers exercise in designing their local calling areas is a competitive innovation that enables them to provide valuable alternatives to an ILECs traditional service The PSC saw no reason to change these standards particularly when the result would be an unnecessary restriction on the services the customers want and need Case no U In the matter of the application of Ameritech Michigan to revise its reciprocal compensation rates and rate structure and to exempt foreign exchange service from payment of reciprocal compensation CUSTOMERAFFECTING HAWAII Legislators to examine telemarketing fraud Sen Brian Kanno D District has introduced SB to make telemarketing fraud a criminal offense An

WUTC sets hearing on telecom operations rule changes WIRELESS PENNSYLVANIA State court says FCC should hear privacy claim against Sprint A threejudge panel of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania the states intermediate appeals court has rejected an appeal by two Sprint Spectrum LP customers who want their invasion of privacy claim to be heard in state court The opinion penned by Judge John T J Kelly found that the trial court properly dismissed the claim for lack of jurisdiction The customers brought the claim in alleging their privacy had been infringed because their personal account information could be accessed easily by anyone with a Sprint network wireless phone or anyone who called Sprints tollfree customer service number While Internet access to account information was protected by a personal identification number the customers claimed anyone who knew a customers zip code could access account information for a Sprint phone number using the tollfree number or a wireless phone The trial court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction The customers argued the trial court had jurisdiction because the state Public Utility Commission regulates Sprint They said Pennsylvania law gives the states courts jurisdiction over claims against PUCregulated entities The Superior Court rejected the customers reasoning finding that although the PUC regulates Sprints wireline operations it doesnt regulate its wireless service provider arm The court said A wireless telephone service provider does not become a regulated public utility simply because the commission regulates a related entity The court said section c of the federal Telecommunications Act of requires specific telecom privacy standards It concluded Although couched in terms of a state law cause of action for invasion of privacy the customers claim falls squarely within the conduct prohibited by section of the Act The court added that the customers may wish to raise the matter in a complaint with the FCC Judge Kelly also noted that the customers cant rely solely on the state law privacy claim because they havent shown that their particular private information has been disseminated to the public at large and that they have suffered harm by this dissemination Judges John L Musmanno and Joan Orie Melvin joined Judge Kellys opinion Case no WDA Mark B Aronson and

sponsor Sen Ron Allen D District explained to TR The legislative staff further explained that people sometimes try to subdivide their property to receive a tax break She added that closing this
