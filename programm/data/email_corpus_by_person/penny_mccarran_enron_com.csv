head stuck in the garbage disposal I knew at the time that the experience would be funny if the cat survived so let me tell you right up front that the cat is fine Getting him out wasnt easy though and the process included numerous home remedies a plumber two cops an emergency overnight veterinary clinic a case of mistaken identity five hours of panic and fifteen minutes of fame My husband Rich and I had just returned from a day vacation in the Cayman Islandswhere I had been sick as a dog the whole time We arrived home at pm a day and a half later than we had planned because of airline problems I still had illnessrelated vertigo and because of the flight delays had not been able to prepare for the class I was supposed to teach at the next morning I sat down at my desk to think about William Carlos Williams and around ten oclock I heard Rich hollering from the kitchen I raced over to see what was wrong and spied Rich frantically rooting around under the kitchen sink and Rudyor rather Rudys headless bodyscrambling around in the sink his claws clicking in panic on the metal and his head stuck in the garbage disposal Rich had just ground up the skin of some smoked salmon in the disposal and when he left the room Rudy who always was a pinhead had gone in after it It is very disturbing to see the headless body of your cat in the sink This is an animal that I have slept with nightly for ten years who burrows under the covers and purrs against my side and who now looked like a furcovered turkey carcass defrosting in the sink while its still alive and kicking It was also disturbing to see Rich Mr CalminanyEmergency at his wits end trying to simultaneously soothe Rudy and undo the garbage disposal and failing at both and basically freaking out Adding to the chaos was Rudys twin brother Lowell also upset racing around in circles jumping onto the kitchen counter and alternately licking Rudys butt for comfort and biting it out of fear Clearly I had to do something First we tried to ease Rudy out of the disposal by lubricating his head and neck with Johnsons baby shampoo kept on hand for my nieces visits and butterflavored Crisco Both failed and a nowgreasy Rudy kept struggling Rich then decided to take apart the garbage disposal which was a good idea but he couldnt do it Turns out the thing is constructed like a metal onion you peel off one layer and another one appears with Rudys head still buried deep inside stuck in a hard plastic collar My job during this process was to sit on the kitchen counter petting Rudy trying to calm him with the room spinning vertigo Lowell howling hes part Siamese and Rich clattering around under the sink with his tools When all our efforts failed we sought professional help I called our regular plumber who actually called me back quickly even at oclock at night thanks Dave He talked Rich through further layers of disposal dismantling but still we couldnt reach Rudy I called the number for Insinkerator no response a pest removal service that advertises hour service no response an allnight emergency veterinary clinic who had no experience in this matter and finally in desperation I could see that Rudys normally pink paw pads were turning blue The fire department I figured gets cats out of trees maybe they could get one out of a garbage disposal The dispatcher had other ideas and offered to send over two policemen The cops arrived close to midnight and turned out to be quite nice More importantly they were also able to think rationally which we were not They were of course astonished by the situation Ive never seen anything like this Officer Mike kept saying The unusual circumstances helped us get quickly on a first name basis with our cops Officer Tom who expressed immediate sympathy for our plight Ive had cats all my life he said also had an idea Evidently we needed a certain tool a tiny circular rotating saw that could cut through the heavy plastic flange encircling Rudys neck without hurting Rudy Officer Tom happened to own one I live just five minutes from here he said Ill go get it He soon returned and the three of themRich and the two policemengot under the sink together to cut through the garbage disposal I sat on the counter holding Rudy and trying not to succumb to the surrealness of the scene with the weird middleofthenight lighting the rooms occasional spinning Lowells spooky sound effects an apparently headless cat in my sink and six disembodied legs poking out from under it One good thing came of this the guys did manage to get the bottom off the disposal so we could now see Rudys face and knew he could breathe But they couldnt cut the flange without risking the cat Stumped Officer Tom had another idea You know he said I think the reason we cant get him out is the angle of his head and body you can see where this is going cant you If we could just get the sink out he continued and lay it on its side Ill bet we could slip him out That sounded like a good ideaat this point ANYTHING would have sounded like a good ideaand as it turned out Officer Mike runs a plumbing business on weekends he knew how to take out the sink Again they went to work the three pairs of legs sticking out from under the sink surrounded by an everincreasing pile of tools and sink parts They cut the electrical supply capped off the plumbing lines unfastened the metal clamps unscrewed all the pipes and about an hour later viola The sink was lifted gently out of the countertop with one guy holding the garbage disposal which contained Rudys head up close to the sink which contained Rudys body We laid the sink on its side but even at this more favorable angle Rudy stayed stuck Officer Toms radio beeped calling him away on some kind of real police business As he was leaving though he had another good idea You know he said I dont think we can get him out while hes struggling so much We need to get the cat sedated If he were limp we could slide him out And off he went regretfully a cat lover still worried about Rudy The remaining three of us decided that getting Rudy sedated was a good idea but Rich and I were new to the area We knew that the overnight emergency veterinary clinic was only a few minutes away but we didnt know exactly how to get there I know where it is declared Officer Mike Follow me So Mike got into his patrol car Rich got into the drivers seat of our car and I got into the back carrying the kitchen sink what was left of the garbage disposal and Rudy It was now about am We followed Officer Mike for a few blocks when I decided to put my hand into the garbage disposal to pet Rudys face hoping I could comfort him Instead my sweet gentle bedfellow chomped down on my finger really hard and wouldnt let go My scream reflex kicked into gear Rich slammed on the brakes hollering What What happened Should I stop No I managed to get out between screams just keep driving Rudys biting me but weve got to get to the vet Just go Rich turned his attention back to the road where Officer Mike took a turn we hadnt expected and we followed After a few minutes Rudy let go and as I stopped screaming I looked up to discover that we were wandering aimlessly through an industrial park in and out of empty parking lots past little streets that didnt look at all familiar Wheres he taking us I asked We should have been there ten minutes ago Rich was as mystified as I was but all we knew to do was follow the police car until finally he pulled into a church parking lot and we pulled up next to him As Rich rolled down the window to ask Officer Mike where are were going the cop who was not Mike rolled down his window and asked Why are you following me Once Rich and I recovered from our shock at having tailed the wrong cop car and the policeman from his pique at being stalked he led us quickly to the emergency vet where Mike greeted us by holding open the door exclaiming Where were you guys It was lucky that Mike got to the vets ahead of us because we hadnt thought to call and warn them about what was coming Clearly by this time we werent really thinking at all We brought in the kitchen sink containing Rudy and the garbage disposal containing his head and the clinic staff was ready They took his temperature which was down degrees and his oxygen level which was half of normal and the vet declared This cat is in serious shock Weve got to sedate him and get him out of there immediately When I asked if it was OK to sedate a cat in shock the vet said grimly We dont have a choice With that he injected the cat Rudy went limp and the vet squeezed about half a tube of KY jelly onto the cats neck and pulled him free Then the whole team jumped into code blue mode I know this from watching a lot of ER They laid Rudy on a cart where one person hooked up IV fluids another put little socks on his paws Youd be amazed how much heat they lose through their footpads she said one covered him with hot water bottles and a blanket and another took a blowdryer to warm up Rudys now very gunky head The fur on his head dried in stiff little spikes making him look pathetically punk as he lay there limp and motionless At this point they sent Rich Mike and me to sit in the waiting room while they tried to bring Rudy back to life I told Mike he didnt have to stay but he just stood there shaking his head Ive never seen anything like this he said again and again At about am the vet came in to tell us that the prognosis was good for a full recovery They needed to keep Rudy overnight to rehydrate him and give him something for the brain swelling they assumed he had but if all went well we could take him home the following night Just in time to hear the good news Officer Tom rushed in finished with his real police work and concerned about Rudy Rich and I got back home about We hadnt unpacked from our trip I was still intermittently dizzy and I still hadnt prepared for my class I need a vacation I said and while I called the office to leave a message canceling my class Rich made us a pitcher of martinis I slept late the next day and then badgered the vet about Rudys condition until he said that Rudy could come home later that day I was working on the suitcases when the phone rang Hi this is Steve Huskey from the Norristown TimesHerald a voice said Listen I was just going through the police blotter from last night Um do you have a cat So I told Steve the whole story which interested him immensely A couple hours later he called back to say that his editor was interested too did I have a picture of Rudy The next day Rudy was frontpage news under the ridiculous headline Catch of the Day Lands Cat in Hot Water There were some noteworthy repercussions to the newspaper article Mr Huskey had somehow inferred that I called because I thought Rich my husband was going into shock although how he concluded this from my comment that his pads were turning blue I dont quite understand So the first thing I had to do was call Rich at workRich who had worked tirelessly to free Rudyand swear that I had been misquoted When I arrived at work myself I was famous people had been calling my secretary all morning to inquire about Rudys health When I called our regular vet whom I had met only once to make a followup appointment for Rudy the receptionist asked Is this the famous Rudys mother When I took my car in for routine maintenance a few days later Dave my mechanic said We read about your cat Is he OK When I called a tree surgeon about my dying red oak he asked if I knew the person on that street whose cat had been in the garbage disposal And when I went to get my hair cut the shampoo person told me the funny story her grandma had read in the paper about a cat that got stuck in the garbage disposal Even today over a year later people ask about Rudy which a yearold neighbor had always called the Adventure Cat because he used to climb on the roof of her house and peer in the secondstory window at her I dont know what the moral of this story is but I do know that this adventure cost me in emergency vet bills follow up vet care new sink new plumbing new electrical wiring and new garbage disposalone with a cover The vet can no longer say hes seen everything but the kitchen sink I wanted to thank Officers Tom and Mike by giving them gift certificates to the local hardware store but was told that they couldnt accept gifts that I would put them in a bad position if I tried So I wrote a letter to the Police Chief praising their good deeds and sent individual thank you notes to Tom and Mike complete with pictures of Rudy so they could see what he looks like with his head on And Rudy whom we originally got for free or so we thought still sleeps with meunder the covers on cold nights and unaccountably still sometimes prowls the sink hoping for fish
