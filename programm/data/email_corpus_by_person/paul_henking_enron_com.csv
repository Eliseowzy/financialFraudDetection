notify our suppliers in view that if there is a problem as a result of the bugs we will have to proceed against them they would want to have a rep to view the testing as well i would think re joint testing pls copy eric tan on what needs to be done once a decision is made on wherewhen the testing will be done re freight payment before offering to just pay the do you think we should propose it be paid to an interest bearing escrow account pending the results of the joint testing or whatever other pending limitation you think might help us rgds From Britt NRON on PST To Paul CT cc Alan CT Harry M CT Michael A CT Richard B CT James P CT Subject Re In re MV PACIFIC VIRGO Paul Thanks for your email Parenthetically Id be happy to explain how we got to where we are on our strategy maybe a telephone call would be best Let me know when you are available I can call you early am or late pm Re the bug issue we were aware of this although I am interested to hear that SGS raised it with you and Eric in midOctober I have discussed this in the past with David Best and spoke with him on the telephone this morning about what SGS told you We dont think we should put anyone on notice about the bug issue unless and until it appears and is confirmed at the joint testing Otherwise we may be raising an inherent vice argument for both Mitsubishi and our own cargo underwriters Let me know if you have a different view on this or anything else I put in this email Re Mitsubishis response to our settlement demand David Best has just spoken with Sian Heard Mitsubishis lead London solicitor It is clear from her that Mitsubishi will not be settling prior to instituting arbitration It is also clear that Mitsubishi will not consider any substantial settlement without Heards advice Best believes that Heard will recommend that the joint testing take place before giving Mitsubishi an exposure evaluation In sum while our attempt at settlement prior to joint testing was a worthwhile effort to avoid the risk and expense of the problematic joint survey it now appears to David and me to be at a dead end Re the joint testing Again David and I believe that the joint testing should proceed as quickly as it can be arranged Neither our cargo underwriters nor Mitsubishi will move off dead center unless we do so Given the problems with SGSs lab in Singapore the bug issue that SGS in Subic Bay has raised again and that SGS did the prepurchase of product for ECT that proved offspec I have asked David to revisit with Steve Jones our chemist the logistics and cost of having the testing done in the UK I have also asked him to consider whether Heard might be amenable to splitting the costs of transporting the samples from Singapore to the UK I would like to get ECTs authority quickly to authorize the joint testing to go forward Re the selection of arbitrators David has discussed three QCs that he and Neale agreed were appropriate with Hearn Of those three Hearn likes Nicholas Hamblin who will charge pounds an hour and pounds per day She will be conferring with Mitsubishi about using him as the sole arbitrator Given that we have initiated a goodfaith discussion of the choice of arbitrators with Mitsubishi David advises that we do not need to worry about sending Mitsubishi a letter tomorrow with our choices of arbitrator on it We can wait for Hearn to respond then I will make a formal request for your authority to agree to one arbitrator who has already been accepted by Mitsubishi Re the withoutprejudice settlement of Mitsubishis freight and demurrage I read you loud and clear and thanks for making clear that the freight claim is only about not as I had inadvertantly indicated in my last email As I previously mentioned David and I are on board with this idea given the difficult circumstances of this case Let me know if I have inadvertantly mischaracterized anything you said Britt Paul CT AM To Britt NRON cc Alan CT Harry M CT Michael A CT Richard B CT James P CT Subject Re In re MV PACIFIC VIRGO britt thanks your reply which is noted you will notice i have excluded david best and ngregson preferring to keep my comments in house as privileged info unless you feel this msg should be forwarded to them later firstly i am getting nowhere with mitsubishi on the settlement front i have gone so far as to mention this morning to mitsuru that if this does goes to arbitration and should mitsubishi succeed in their position this will only serve to increase our claim by a similar amount since these costs would then become part of our contamination claim he seems quite content to let this go to arbitration as an example he was suppose to call me back this afternoon but did not secondly with regards to your comments i would just respondadd the following information i dont know if i am switching tactics so much as following what should have been done in the beginning ie submit the claim to our insurance company and let them proceed against the owners i honestly feel the arbitrators will say pay the freight and possibly the demurrage now and settle the contamination claim as a separate issue clearly the cp says that freight is due without deduction once the vessel has completed discharge on the issue of the presale survey i have discussed this matter internally with eric tan seems our position is that singapore considered the sample that was drawn as a bad sample as well as we were not sure that the test methods used conformed with the testing methods required for first gas this position is proved by the loading of the pacific virgo when the product subsequently tested onspec for first gas granted it might still become an issue but as you say it could become an issue in either proceeding i am getting a little confused on the matter of the joint testing verbally i was advised that enron did not want to have the joint testing at least not on a prompt basis your msg now says that we do want to test the product and it should be done as soon as possible as mitsubishi and your advices that the underwriters and hear owners p and i club would want i assume this change is the result of the arbitration be that as it may i do have a bit of information that you may or may not be aware of or find relevant when eric tan and i visited first gas in midoct to meet the personnel at first gas and witness one of the cargoes being discharged at the plant we also took the opportunity to meet with sgs in subic bay to see their facilities and meet their personnel during the conversation the subject of the elang cargo came up and the comment from sgs is that they were fairly certain it was offspec due to bugs this may sound silly but i have heard of this before and is a problem with petroleum products it seems sgs even went so far as to test the product themselves for these bugs and got a positive result this test was not requested by enron or first gas and was done some time later in this process i understand there may be some concern on our part over our subsequent sales to third parties if we knew there were bugs in the product i would have to say that this was not known at the time and even today is only conjecture based on sgs advices midoct well after these sales sgs also described changes to the product which would fit with the cargo having bugs ie a strong sulphur smell and change in colour if the testing is now done i do not know if these bugs will be detected or not however if they are in the ships samples they may have changed the sample sufficiently that even a visual observation may detect the problem the next problem becomes proving from where the bugs originated were they in the previous cargo tanks that were not cleaned properly or were they in the condensate when the cargo was loaded obviously testing of the shore sample prior to loading will determine the answer if the shore sample is ok then they had to come from the ship if the shore sample also has bugs then we should be claiming against our suppliers this of course assumes the suggestion put forth by sgs is in fact correct just something else to be considered i am not saying that we pay the full amount immediately but only the freight portion about we then advise mitsubishi or their lawyers that we will now review the demurrage claim about and revert by say end nov the demurrage claim has been sent to our london offices demurrage department and i have asked them for their comments on the claim after all there may be issues with the ships pumping performance or simple laytime errors which may reduce the demurrage claim they will try to get me a response before the weekend in this manner we pay part of the money but still have a smaller portion which we may apply against our claim once the test results are known i will leave this to legal as to decide how the approach to mitsubishi or their lawyers should be made rgds
