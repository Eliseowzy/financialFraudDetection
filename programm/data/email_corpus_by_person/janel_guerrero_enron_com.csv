to avoid a Californiatype power shortage this summer Right now the odds look pretty good A lot depends right now on whether Mayor Giuliani can keep his mouth shut Last week the mayor departed from his Republican principles for a moment to advocate temporary price controls on wholesale electricity in the Northeast The doubledigit price increases that New Yorkers had to pay last summer are just unacceptable said Giuliani at a press conference Deregulation should not be abandoned it should be completed The problem is when we deregulated we didnt think it would affect us so quickly We need a little adjustment right now Ah yes just a teenyweenie little adjustment just to get us through the next few months right Just like rent control a temporary wartime measure imposed in Price controls are never temporary They just make things worse by producing shortages And the more shortages they produce the more people agitate for more regulations Its a vicious cycle that eventually becomes almost impossible to escape California is having blackouts right now because until this week at least the public and political officials were unwilling to accept a rate increase Before last week Gov Gray Davis major powerconservation achievement was having energy savings tips printed on McDonalds placemats Rate hikes do two essential things encourage people to conserve and bring in more supply Thats exactly whats needed Mayor Giulianis price controls would only anaesthetize the public to the need for conservation and discourage supply a perfect prescription for Californiatype blackouts Whats even more important than avoiding rotating blackouts however is convincing people that environmental amenities dont come free If everybody is going to oppose power plants in their neighborhood then nobody is going to have enough electricity California got itself into its mess by refusing to build power plants over the last years The state didnt want nuclear too dangerous it didnt want coal

electricity consumption It also gets percent of its energy from renewables geothermal windmills biomass solar electric as opposed to percent for the rest of the country Yet the state still finds itself woefully short of power There isnt any substitute for large generating stations Contrary to public opinion electricity is not produced by sticking the plug in the wall New York faces the same longrange problems The city has not built a new power plant since Nobody upstate wants power plants either They argue it would reindustrialize the Hudson Right now residents of Rockland County are furiously resisting a clean new mega watt power station in an already industrialized area Yet even building in Rockland wont help New York City because nobody wants the transmission lines either The final verdict from the laws of supplyanddemand is simple If demand goes up and supply doesnt respond then prices will go up as well Even mainstream environmental groups now acknowledge this Were all

an upstate town and village lives comfortably with prisons or power plants because they lower property taxes and provide jobs for the community We can have both adequate power and a clean environment

prices are going to spike in the near term And it will be tempting to define the results as an emergency warranting government intervention But todays emergency becomes tomorrows entitlement Temporary

orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published March Sacramentos electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PGEs command So do a lot of other utilities Theyve been writing letters lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co to get off the hook before summer Who dodges the blackout bullet is going to play out as a political hot button around the state said George Fraser head of the Northern California Power Agency a coalition of municipal utilities In Sacramento the next volley is expected soon with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PGE that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utilitys command We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area said Linda Davis one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors Saying they dont want to be dragged down by somebody elses problems two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PGEs or Southern California Edisons financial woes But in PGEs view California is in an energy crisis and were all in this together said spokesman John Nelson The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer Although Gov Gray Davis has said conservation new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts officials at the Independent System Operator which runs much of Californias grid expect frequent rotating outages One consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates predicts hours of rolling blackouts during July and August and about hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks Before blackouts hit the jockeying over just whose lights air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing The outcome could affect millions of people statewide The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the forprofit utilities it regulates including PGE and Edison A PUC analysis has suggested that PGEs program which currently exempts about percent of its customers should spread the burden more broadly For example it said million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed essential But notforprofit utilities such as SMUD which answer to their own elected boards or city councils have other worries Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer Some have raised rates or are considering raising rates Some have taken extra conservation steps They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with PGE SMUD general manager Jan Schori is going to use every avenue any avenue to put pressure on including lobbying the ISO the governor and others said utility director Davis The Northern California Power Agency a jointpowers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities has begun informal negotiations with PGE to change blackout rules according to Fraser its top executive It is preparing to write PGE asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether Failing that it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power he said At SMUD the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies under terms of the interconnection contract that links SMUDs lines to PGEs The contracts are being inspected with a finetooth comb said SMUD director Howard Posner Schori declined to comment on any specifics Sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying PGE that because of changed circumstances SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests Other options being explored include renegotiating existing agreements with PGE Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January constituents have been asking him Why are we participating when were not the problem And I dont have a good answer to that Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money and is considering percent rate increases to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers summer demands They believe PGE should do the same Were almost like a David against Goliath here said board vice president Genevieve Shiroma The huge investorowned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control In addition SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its Peak Corps program which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households it has already done its part without rotating outages director Davis said PGE believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities ties to its transmission lines have benefits and burdens to both sides said Nelson It wouldnt be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract he said Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies Sometimes reducing demand called load shedding can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails Its been around in the electrical fabric forever said Jim Pope head of Silicon Valley Power Santa Claras cityrun utility In addition to legal requirements you have a moral obligation so you dont bring the system to collapse Like other cityrun utilities Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PGE that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency But its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand so no one has to be completely shut off Such agreements formed long before deregulation when PGE ran the north states grid now are complicated by the creation of the state Independent System Operator The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by PGE Edison and San Diego Gas Electric Co If it believes power use is about to surge past supply potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western United States the ISO notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts The big utilities meet that requirement two ways They cut circuits to some of their own customers and they tell smaller connected utilities to cut a proportionate share In Northern California about percent of the outages are borne by PGE customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts In one sense we are all in this together If SMUD were in danger of going down we would hope others would help us out said SMUDs Posner But thats if were in danger from circumstances beyond our control not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal It is unclear what penalties if any a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement In the long run the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grid officials said As a practical matter in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest if one utility refused to shed load the ISO would probably solve to problem by calling on PGE Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks they said

orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published March Sacramentos electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PGEs command So do a lot of other utilities Theyve been writing letters lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co to get off the hook before summer Who dodges the blackout bullet is going to play out as a political hot button around the state said George Fraser head of the Northern California Power Agency a coalition of municipal utilities In Sacramento the next volley is expected soon with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PGE that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utilitys command We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area said Linda Davis one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors Saying they dont want to be dragged down by somebody elses problems two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PGEs or Southern California Edisons financial woes But in PGEs view California is in an energy crisis and were all in this together said spokesman John Nelson The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer Although Gov Gray Davis has said conservation new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts officials at the Independent System Operator which runs much of Californias grid expect frequent rotating outages One consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates predicts hours of rolling blackouts during July and August and about hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks Before blackouts hit the jockeying over just whose lights air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing The outcome could affect millions of people statewide The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the forprofit utilities it regulates including PGE and Edison A PUC analysis has suggested that PGEs program which currently exempts about percent of its customers should spread the burden more broadly For example it said million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed essential But notforprofit utilities such as SMUD which answer to their own elected boards or city councils have other worries Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer Some have raised rates or are considering raising rates Some have taken extra conservation steps They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with PGE SMUD general manager Jan Schori is going to use every avenue any avenue to put pressure on including lobbying the ISO the governor and others said utility director Davis The Northern California Power Agency a jointpowers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities has begun informal negotiations with PGE to change blackout rules according to Fraser its top executive It is preparing to write PGE asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether Failing that it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power he said At SMUD the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies under terms of the interconnection contract that links SMUDs lines to PGEs The contracts are being inspected with a finetooth comb said SMUD director Howard Posner Schori declined to comment on any specifics Sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying PGE that because of changed circumstances SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests Other options being explored include renegotiating existing agreements with PGE Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January constituents have been asking him Why are we participating when were not the problem And I dont have a good answer to that Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money and is considering percent rate increases to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers summer demands They believe PGE should do the same Were almost like a David against Goliath here said board vice president Genevieve Shiroma The huge investorowned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control In addition SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its Peak Corps program which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households it has already done its part without rotating outages director Davis said PGE believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities ties to its transmission lines have benefits and burdens to both sides said Nelson It wouldnt be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract he said Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies Sometimes reducing demand called load shedding can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails Its been around in the electrical fabric forever said Jim Pope head of Silicon Valley Power Santa Claras cityrun utility In addition to legal requirements you have a moral obligation so you dont bring the system to collapse Like other cityrun utilities Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PGE that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency But its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand so no one has to be completely shut off Such agreements formed long before deregulation when PGE ran the north states grid now are complicated by the creation of the state Independent System Operator The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by PGE Edison and San Diego Gas Electric Co If it believes power use is about to surge past supply potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western United States the ISO notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts The big utilities meet that requirement two ways They cut circuits to some of their own customers and they tell smaller connected utilities to cut a proportionate share In Northern California about percent of the outages are borne by PGE customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts In one sense we are all in this together If SMUD were in danger of going down we would hope others would help us out said SMUDs Posner But thats if were in danger from circumstances beyond our control not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal It is unclear what penalties if any a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement In the long run the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grid officials said As a practical matter in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest if one utility refused to shed load the ISO would probably solve to problem by calling on PGE Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks they said

to avoid a Californiatype power shortage this summer Right now the odds look pretty good A lot depends right now on whether Mayor Giuliani can keep his mouth shut Last week the mayor departed from his Republican principles for a moment to advocate temporary price controls on wholesale electricity in the Northeast The doubledigit price increases that New Yorkers had to pay last summer are just unacceptable said Giuliani at a press conference Deregulation should not be abandoned it should be completed The problem is when we deregulated we didnt think it would affect us so quickly We need a little adjustment right now Ah yes just a teenyweenie little adjustment just to get us through the next few months right Just like rent control a temporary wartime measure imposed in Price controls are never temporary They just make things worse by producing shortages And the more shortages they produce the more people agitate for more regulations Its a vicious cycle that eventually becomes almost impossible to escape California is having blackouts right now because until this week at least the public and political officials were unwilling to accept a rate increase Before last week Gov Gray Davis major powerconservation achievement was having energy savings tips printed on McDonalds placemats Rate hikes do two essential things encourage people to conserve and bring in more supply Thats exactly whats needed Mayor Giulianis price controls would only anaesthetize the public to the need for conservation and discourage supply a perfect prescription for Californiatype blackouts Whats even more important than avoiding rotating blackouts however is convincing people that environmental amenities dont come free If everybody is going to oppose power plants in their neighborhood then nobody is going to have enough electricity California got itself into its mess by refusing to build power plants over the last years The state didnt want nuclear too dangerous it didnt want coal too dirty so it formulated a makebelieve strategy of conservation and renewables In fact the Golden State has done a heroic job in both California ranks dead last among the states in percapita electricity consumption It also gets percent of its energy from renewables geothermal windmills biomass solar electric as opposed to percent for the rest of the country Yet the state still finds itself woefully short of power There isnt any substitute for large generating stations Contrary to public opinion electricity is not produced by sticking the plug in the wall New York faces the same longrange problems The city has not built a new power plant since Nobody upstate wants power plants either They argue it would reindustrialize the Hudson Right now residents of Rockland County are furiously resisting a clean new mega watt power station in an already industrialized area Yet even building in Rockland wont help New York City because nobody wants the transmission lines either The final verdict from the laws of supplyanddemand is simple If demand goes up and supply doesnt respond then prices will go up as well Even mainstream environmental groups now acknowledge this Were all in favor of building new gas generators says Ashok Gupta senior economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council which is not opposing the peaking generators proposed for the city The new plants are twice as efficient and much cleaner Every time we build a clean new gas plant we back out two dirty older ones The Sierra Club is also backing new naturalgas power plants in California Whats needed is a system for compensating people who live in the immediate vicinity There are dozens of possibilities Property taxes could be lowered people could be paid cash rewards or given free electricity Many an upstate town and village lives comfortably with prisons or power plants because they lower property taxes and provide jobs for the community We can have both adequate power and a clean environment says Gupta who lives and works in Manhattan The technology for improvements both on supply and demand The only thing lacking is consensus and leadership Its a small price to pay for avoiding a California debacle RUDYS ELECTRIC ERROR MondayApril The energy crisis now building nationally is serious but its no cause for panic Mayor Giuiliani for one needs to rethink a key element in his own approach to New Yorks incipient energy woes For sure Hizzoner last week included some commonsense pronouncements in his prescription such as forcefully telling the environmentalists and not in my backyard crowds that more energyproducing plants are essential if New York is to avoid a Californiastyle crisis However in one area Mayor Giuliani is wrong He wants energy price controls Yes energy prices are going to spike in the near term And it will be tempting to define the results as an emergency warranting government intervention But todays emergency becomes tomorrows entitlement Temporary actions acquire constituencies that fight tooth and nail to keep them permanently in place For example take rent control please It was a wartime World War II provision instituted in Two years later the war ended Fiftyeight years later the emergency controls remain And affordable New York City apartments are nearly nonexistent The rent controls give landlords little incentive to maintain existing buildings New construction goes only to pricey luxury apartments Thus it has become nearly impossible for the middleclass to live in Manhattan If you like what rent control has wrought in the Big Apples housing market youll love what price controls will do for the energy market Rudolph Giulianis legacy is assured It is undeniably a positive one having among other things made the city safe and livable once again What a pity to tar that by being the mayor who saddled succeeding city leaders with price controls that would cause energy shortages far into the future

orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published March Sacramentos electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PGEs command So do a lot of other utilities Theyve been writing letters lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co to get off the hook before summer Who dodges the blackout bullet is going to play out as a political hot button around the state said George Fraser head of the Northern California Power Agency a coalition of municipal utilities In Sacramento the next volley is expected soon with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PGE that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utilitys command We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area said Linda Davis one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors Saying they dont want to be dragged down by somebody elses problems two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PGEs or Southern California Edisons financial woes But in PGEs view California is in an energy crisis and were all in this together said spokesman John Nelson The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer Although Gov Gray Davis has said conservation new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts officials at the Independent System Operator which runs much of Californias grid expect frequent rotating outages One consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates predicts hours of rolling blackouts during July and August and about hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks Before blackouts hit the jockeying over just whose lights air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing The outcome could affect millions of people statewide The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the forprofit utilities it regulates including PGE and Edison A PUC analysis has suggested that PGEs program which currently exempts about percent of its customers should spread the burden more broadly For example it said million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed essential But notforprofit utilities such as SMUD which answer to their own elected boards or city councils have other worries Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer Some have raised rates or are considering raising rates Some have taken extra conservation steps They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with PGE SMUD general manager Jan Schori is going to use every avenue any avenue to put pressure on including lobbying the ISO the governor and others said utility director Davis The Northern California Power Agency a jointpowers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities has begun informal negotiations with PGE to change blackout rules according to Fraser its top executive It is preparing to write PGE asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether Failing that it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power he said At SMUD the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies under terms of the interconnection contract that links SMUDs lines to PGEs The contracts are being inspected with a finetooth comb said SMUD director Howard Posner Schori declined to comment on any specifics Sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying PGE that because of changed circumstances SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests Other options being explored include renegotiating existing agreements with PGE Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January constituents have been asking him Why are we participating when were not the problem And I dont have a good answer to that Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money and is considering percent rate increases to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers summer demands They believe PGE should do the same Were almost like a David against Goliath here said board vice president Genevieve Shiroma The huge investorowned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control In addition SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its Peak Corps program which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households it has already done its part without rotating outages director Davis said PGE believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities ties to its transmission lines have benefits and burdens to both sides said Nelson It wouldnt be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract he said Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies Sometimes reducing demand called load shedding can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails Its been around in the electrical fabric forever said Jim Pope head of Silicon Valley Power Santa Claras cityrun utility In addition to legal requirements you have a moral obligation so you dont bring the system to collapse Like other cityrun utilities Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PGE that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency But its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand so no one has to be completely shut off Such agreements formed long before deregulation when PGE ran the north states grid now are complicated by the creation of the state Independent System Operator The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by PGE Edison and San Diego Gas Electric Co If it believes power use is about to surge past supply potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western United States the ISO notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts The big utilities meet that requirement two ways They cut circuits to some of their own customers and they tell smaller connected utilities to cut a proportionate share In Northern California about percent of the outages are borne by PGE customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts In one sense we are all in this together If SMUD were in danger of going down we would hope others would help us out said SMUDs Posner But thats if were in danger from circumstances beyond our control not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal It is unclear what penalties if any a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement In the long run the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grid officials said As a practical matter in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest if one utility refused to shed load the ISO would probably solve to problem by calling on PGE Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks they said

Republican principles for a moment to advocate temporary price controls on wholesale electricity in the Northeast The doubledigit price increases that New Yorkers had to pay last summer are just unacceptable said Giuliani at a press conference Deregulation should not be abandoned it should be completed The problem is when we deregulated we didnt think it would affect us so quickly We need a little adjustment right now Ah yes just a teenyweenie little adjustment just to get us through the next few months right Just like rent control a temporary wartime measure imposed in Price controls are never temporary They just make things worse by producing shortages And the more shortages they produce the more people agitate for more regulations Its a vicious cycle that eventually becomes almost impossible to escape California is having blackouts right now because until this week at least the public and political officials were unwilling to accept a rate increase Before last week Gov Gray Davis major powerconservation achievement was having energy savings tips printed on McDonalds placemats Rate hikes do two essential things encourage people to conserve and bring in more supply Thats exactly whats needed Mayor Giulianis price controls would only anaesthetize the public to the need for conservation and discourage supply a perfect prescription for Californiatype blackouts Whats even more important than avoiding rotating blackouts however is convincing people that environmental amenities dont come free If everybody is going to oppose power plants in their neighborhood then nobody is going to have enough electricity California got itself into its mess by refusing to build power plants over the last years The state didnt want nuclear too dangerous it didnt want coal too dirty so it formulated a makebelieve strategy of conservation and renewables In fact the Golden State has done a heroic job in both California ranks dead last among the states in percapita electricity consumption It also gets percent of its energy from renewables geothermal windmills biomass solar electric as opposed to percent for the rest of the country Yet the state still finds itself woefully short of power There isnt any substitute for large generating stations Contrary to public opinion electricity is not produced by sticking the plug in the wall New York faces the same longrange problems The city has not built a new power plant since Nobody upstate wants power plants either They argue it would reindustrialize the Hudson Right now residents of Rockland County are furiously resisting a clean new mega watt power station in an already industrialized area Yet even building in Rockland wont help New York City because nobody wants the transmission lines either The final verdict from the laws of supplyanddemand is simple If demand goes up and supply doesnt respond then prices will go up as well Even mainstream environmental groups now acknowledge this Were all in favor of building new gas generators says Ashok Gupta senior economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council which is not opposing the peaking generators proposed for the city The new plants are twice as efficient and much cleaner Every time we build a clean new gas plant we back out two dirty older ones The Sierra Club is also backing new naturalgas power plants in California Whats needed is a system for compensating people who live in the immediate vicinity There are dozens of possibilities Property taxes could be lowered people could be paid cash rewards or given free electricity Many an upstate town and village lives comfortably with prisons or power plants because they lower property taxes and provide jobs for the community We can have both adequate power and a clean environment says Gupta who lives and works in Manhattan The technology for improvements both on supply and demand The only thing lacking is consensus and leadership Its a small price to pay for avoiding a California debacle RUDYS ELECTRIC ERROR MondayApril The energy crisis now building nationally is serious but its no cause for panic Mayor Giuiliani for one needs to rethink a key element in his own approach to New Yorks incipient energy woes For sure Hizzoner last week included some commonsense pronouncements in his prescription such as forcefully telling the environmentalists and not in my backyard crowds that more energyproducing plants are essential if New York is to avoid a Californiastyle crisis However in one area Mayor Giuliani is wrong He wants energy price controls Yes energy prices are going to spike in the near term And it will be tempting to define the results as an emergency warranting government intervention But todays emergency becomes tomorrows entitlement Temporary actions acquire constituencies that fight tooth and nail to keep them permanently in place For example take rent control please It was a wartime World War II provision instituted in Two years later the war ended Fiftyeight years later the emergency controls remain And affordable New York City apartments are nearly nonexistent The rent controls give landlords little incentive to maintain existing buildings New construction goes only to pricey luxury apartments Thus it has become nearly impossible for the middleclass to live in Manhattan If you like what rent control has wrought in the Big Apples housing market youll love what price controls will do for the energy market Rudolph Giulianis legacy is assured It is undeniably a positive one having among other things made the city safe and livable once again What a pity to tar that by being the mayor who saddled succeeding city leaders with price controls that would cause energy shortages far into the future

to the meeting we had last week with the IPPNY PR Working Group Background As you know our efforts to form a PR campaign as the Empire State Energy Suppliers fell apart at the end of May Since then I have been working with Sharon Stewart at Brown Olson and Wilson in order to pay SSK for their services from April to May We are waiting for one last invoice May expenses from SSK Once we receive this invoice Brown Olson Wilson will send a lumpsum payment to SSK I will get you the total cost of SSKs services for AprilMay but is an approximate number This comes to about per each of the companies that participated in the effort As you will recall we each sent K to the Escrow account IPPNY PR Working Group Given the high profile of energy issues in NY and the increasing dialogue taking place there a coordinated PR effoert can certainly be justified Those of us who participated in ESES whose companies are also members of IPPNY met last week in Albany to discuss whether IPPNY would be willing to expand their PR efforts if we joined forces Thanks to all of you who were able to attend and participate in the meeting Since last week Gavin Donohue and the IPPNY Board of Directors have given their full support to this expanded effort and we are moving foward with a comprehensive NYfocused communications effort I am working as liaison between IPPNY and SSK and the following is a summary of how we are proceeding A meeting between SSK and Gavin and myself is scheduled to take place in NYC next week We intend to cover the following We are targeting July th as our launch date A press release will go out explaining IPPNYs point Energy Solutions Program ESP for New York A QA Fact Sheet and other supporting documents for a press kit will be reviewed We will discuss the scheduling of meetings with press outlets and thirdparty allies We will also go over website issues and other elements of the comprehensive plan Essentially the SSK comprehensive PR plan has been tweaked for IPPNYs purposes and will be implemented going foward Given our late start SSK and IPPNY have been working extremely closely on all of the abovementioned documents so that we can meet a July th launch date However I dont want anyone to be out of the loop It is our intention to provide all of the members of the IPPNY PR Working Group with the documents prior to launching on July th The messages are in line with what we agreed to all along as part of ESES The difference is that we actually have a spokesperson Gavin Donohue Budget Issues This is an extremely important issue and I am appealing to each of you to respond to me asap regarding the following As ESES we agreed to put forth K to our PR effort with the first K going into the Escrow Account managed by Brown Olson Wilson Once SSK is paid for AprilMay services there will be some extra money in the Escrow Account I would like to proceed as follows with your approval Coordinate with Brown Olson Wilson and pay SSK for AprilMay services with Escrow Account funds Wire the remaining Escrow Account funds to IPPNYs PR Working Group Account also to be coordinated with Peter Brown if the Escrow Agreement allows and with your approval Work with IPPNY and have them invoice each of us for the additional K assuming we are all still in for the original K Remaining Escrow Account funds K will go toward SSK services going foward These funds in addition to the funds that IPPNY has already received from their PR Working Group members shall cover SSKs work beginning on June through the extend of the contract Additional costs such as advertising will have to be considered after we get the funds deposited into the PR Account and have an idea of how much were working with and whether advertising is a possibility Enron is willing to contribute additional funds on top of the K to this effort if necessary You and your respective organizations may want to consider this as well IPPNYSSK Contract Issues As you may recall a contract between ESES and SSK was never signed Contract discussions took almost months and SSK continues to work with us in good faith considering they still have not been paid a dime Gavin is unwilling to sign a contract with SSK until he has funds in the PR Account to pay for SSKs services As you can see we must expedite payment to IPPNY so that we can launch on July th and so that IPPNY and SSK can agree on contract terms within the next two weeks Gavin is reviewing the ESESSSK contract with IPPNYs lawyers Once the funds are deposited into the IPPNY PR Account Gavin will sign a contract with SSK We will provide everyone with a copy of the contract if you choose to review it although most of you should be familiar with it I think this covers the progress weve made since our meeting in Albany Please call me if you have any questions about the budget contract or the comprehensive plan Im interested in youre input so please weigh in with your comments Lastly I want to emphasize that I need your feedback regarding budget issues asap I am in Houston all week and can be reached at the following numbers Direct Dial Cell Phone THANKS

knewthought you might want to read WSJcom jopinemaowsj OpinionJournal PEGGY NOONAN His Delicious MansardRoofed World Faith effort and love will get us through this trying time I found the words on a yellow PostIt Id stuck on the side of the bookcase in my office about a year ago It had gotten covered up by phone numbers and pictures and doctors appointment cards and yesterday looking for a number I found ita piece of yellow paper with the words His delicious mansardroofed world It took me aback And I remembered what it was That night I had been out with friendsit was last falland it was fun and I got home thinking simply of something we all should think of more and I dont think of enough how wonderful it is to be alive the joy of it the beauty And as I thought itthis is the part I remember most sharplya scene came into my mind of a little French town with cobblestone streets and sharply slanting roofs on thcentury buildings Which made me think in turn in a blink of New York and its older architecture uptown and off the park the old mansions off Fifth Avenue with sloping mansard roofs and how this is the world we live in And I thought at that moment with those pictures in my head His delicious mansardroofed world He being God I wrote down the words on a PostIt and put it on the bookcase thinking some day Id use them in writing about something Maybe joy Maybe us Or maybe Id just see them and think That was a nice moment Anyway the words captured for me a moment of thought And last night I found them and thought Ohthey speak of a moment in time imagesstoryenddingbatgif Yesterday afternoon I was with a teenage friend taking a cab down Park Avenue It was a brilliant day clear and sparkling and as the cab turned left at th Street the sun hit the windows in one of those flashes of bright goldyellow that can on certain days or at certain times pierce your heart We had been quiet not talking on the way to see a friend when I said Do you find yourself thinking at all of the ways in which you might be feeling differently about the future if September th had never happened Oh yes she said softly Every day And she meant it And neither of us said any more and neither of us had to imagesstoryenddingbatgif There are a lot of quiet moments going on Have you noticed A lot of quiet transformations a lot of quiet action and quiet conversations People are realigning themselves I know people who are undergoing religious conversions and changes of faith And people who are holding on in a new way with a harder grip to what they already have and believe in Some people have quietly come to terms with the most soulchilling thoughts A young man I know said to me last week as we chatted in passing on the street I have been thinking about the end of the American empire And I thought Oh my boy do you know the import the weight of the words you are saying And then I thought Yes he does Hes been thinking quietly Some people are quietly defining and redefining things I am one of them We are trying to define or paint or explain what the old world was and what the new world is and how the break between themthe exact spot where the stick broke cracked splinteredcould possibly have been an hour in early September imagesstoryenddingbatgif One thing that passes through our minds is what to call the Old WorldThe Lost World or The Golden Age or Then We dont have to know yet what to call the New World and cannot anyway because it hasnt fully revealed itself and so cannot be named But if we can name the Old World well at least know exactly what it is we think weve lost And this is a funny little problem because if you go out onto your street right now if you live anyplace but downtown Manhattan or Arlington Va the world outside looks exactlyexactlylike the one that existed a year ago The pumpkins in the stores the merry kids the guy who owns the butcher shop outside smoking in his apron Everything looks the same Same people same stores same houses And yet we all feel everything has changed And were right People say things like We have lost a sense of certainty and I nod for it is true But on the other hand I didnt feel so certain about the future last year Did you People say we have lost the assumption that what we had would continue Or this being America get better Certainly people who were carefree have lost their carefreeness And with no irony I think Thats a shame Carefreeness is good imagesstoryenddingbatgif Lately when I think of the Old World I think of an insult that I mean as a tribute It is the phrase the narcissism of small differences In the world that has just passed careless peoplenot carefree carelessspent their time deconstructing the reality of the text as opposed to reading the book You could do that then The world seemed so peaceful that you could actively look for new things to argue about just to keep things lively You could be on a faculty and argue over where Jane Austen meant to put the comma or how her landholding fathers contextually objective assumptions regarding colonialism impacted her work You could have real arguments about stupid things Those were the days Its great when life is so nice you have to invent arguments But the big thing I remember as we approached the end of the Old World the thing I had been thinking for years and marveled over and also felt mildly anxious about was this You could go out and order and eat anything in a restaurant And I had a sense that this wouldnt last forever and some day wed look back on these days fondly I would actually think that It actually seemed to me marvelous that we could order anything we wanted Raspberries in February Bookstores shoe stores computer stores food stores We could order anything Wwwdotgimmedotcom I think the general feeling was a lovely optimism which was captured in a great s phrase The futures so bright I gotta wear shades This was the thing abundance Not only of food but of potential of hope of the kid from the projects dream of being the next J Lo or West Point cadet or millionaire Every middleclass kid in the suburbs thought it absolutely within his grasp to be the next Steven Spielberg or Russell Crowe or to play Martin Sheens assistant on The West Wing or run the record industry or direct commercials Abundant dreams There was peacecrime down for the first time in a generation the world relatively quiet and in the suburbs they were starting to sleep with the windows open again And material goods things from the factory and the farm As Kevin Spacey says in the commercial for his new movie Your produce alone has been worth the trip God it was the age of abundance Or maybe just The Abundance imagesstoryenddingbatgif I know people who are feeling a sense of betrayal at the big change as if they thought history were a waiter in a crisp white jacket and though they ordered two more of the same insteadinsteadhe brought them on a pretty silver platter something quite dreadful They feel betrayed because they thought what we have been living through the past four decades or so was life But it wasnt it was Superlife In the long ribbon of history life has been one long stained and tangled mess full of famine horror war and disease We must have thought we had it better because man had improved But man doesnt really improve does he Man is man Human nature is human nature the impulse to destroy coexists with the desire to build and create and make better Theyve both been with us since the beginning Man hasnt improved the weapons have improved In the early th century the future was so bright they had to invent shades They had everythingpeace prosperity medical and scientific breakthroughs political progress fashion glamour harmless tasty scandals The Gilded Age And then all of a sudden they were hit by the most terrible war in all of European history the most terrible plague in all of modern history the Spanish flu and on top of it all the most terrible political revolution in the history of man And that was just the first years imagesstoryenddingbatgif People always think good news will continue I guess its in our nature to think that whatever is around us while were here is what will continue until were not And then things change and youre surprised I guess surprise is in our nature too And then after the surprise we burrow down into ourselves and pull out what we need to survive and go on and endure But theres something else and I am thinking of it I knew for many years a handsome and intelligent woman of middle years who had everything anyone could dream ofhome children good marriage career wealth She was secure And she and her husband had actually gotten these good things steadily over years of effort and in that time they had suffered no serious reverses or illnesses no tragedies or bankruptcies or dark stars Each year was better than the previous It was wonderful to see But as I came to know her I realized that she didnt think she had what she had because she was lucky or blessed She thought she had them because she was better She had lived a responsible effortful life of course it had come together She had what she had because she was good and prudent She deserved it She was better than the messy people down the block She forgot she was lucky and blessed You forget youre lucky when your luck is so consistent that it confounds the very idea of luck You begin to think your good fortune couldnt be luck it must have been talent Or effort Or superiority The consistency of Americas luck may have fooled many of us into forgetting we were all lucky to be born here lucky to be living now lucky to have hospitals and operas and a film industry and a good electrical system We were born into it We were lucky We were blessed We thought we were the heirs of John Adams Ulysses S Grant Thomas Edison Jonas Salk Mr Levitt of Levittown And we are But still every generation ya gotta earn it It doesnt mean youre better it means youre lucky and ya gotta earn it imagesstoryenddingbatgif How did our luck turn bad our blessings thin out Great books will be written about that But maybe from this point on we should acknowledge what we quietly know inside It was a catastrophic systems failure a catastrophic toptobottom failure of the systems on which we rely for safety and peace Another way to say it The people of the West were the past years or so on an extended pleasure cruise sailing blithely on smooth watersbut through an iceberg field We thought those in charge of the ship commanding it and steering it and seeing to its supplies wouldcouldhandle any problems We paid our fare that is our taxes and assumed the crew would keep us safe We thought our luck would hold too The peopleus you and me the sensuous man on the deckspent a lot of time strolling along wondering What shall I pursue today gold or romance Romance or gold I shall ponder this over a good merlot We were not serious We were not morally serious We were not dark We banished darkness The American people knew or at least those paying attention knew that something terrible might happen But they knew the government had probably done what governments do to protect us The people did not demand this the government did not do it Bad men were allowed in bad men flourished here fit right in planned their deeds They brought more bad men in after them They are here among us now they send anthrax through the mail and watch our reaction predicating their next move perhaps upon our response Our intelligence system failedbut then for a quarter century we had been denying it resources destroying its authority dismantling its mystique Our immigration system failedbut then in many ways it had been encouraged to fail Our legal system failed One of our greatest institutions American journalism failed When the editors and publishers of our great magazines and networks want you to worry about somethingchild safety seats the impact of air bags drunken driving insecticides on applesthey know how to make you worry They know exactly how to capture your attention Mathew Shepard and hate crimes Rodney King and racism The networks and great newspapers know how to hit Drive and go from zero to the American Consciousness in seconds And the networks can do it on free airwaves a gift from our government Did the networks and great newspapers make us worry about what we know we should have worried about No Did they bang the drums No Did they hit this story like they know how to hit a story No In January the Homeland Security report which declared flatly that international terrorism would inevitably draw blood on American soil was unveiled They called a news conference in a huge Senate office building Congressmen came and a senator Pat Roberts of Kansas Only a half dozen reporters showed up and one from the greatest newspaper in the nation walked out halfway through It was boring Every magazine and newspaper had over the past years a frontpage story and a cover on the madmen in the world and the weapons they could seize and get and fashion But they never beat the drum never insisted that this become a cause Why In part I think for the same reason our political figures didnt do anything It would have been bad for ratings The people dont want serious things at oclock on a Tuesday night they want Sela Ward falling in love I will never ever forget the important Democrat who told me over lunch why Bill Clinton president of the United States January through January had never moved and would never move in a serious way to deal with the potential of nuclear and biological terrorism Because it doesnt show up in the polls he said Because it doesnt show up in the focus groups imagesstoryenddingbatgif It was a catastrophic systems failure top to bottom And we all share in it some more than others Except Except those who did the remarkable things that day Sept the firemen who charged like the Light Brigade the businessmen who said Lets roll Which is in part why we keep talking about them To remind ourselves who we are in the midst of the systems failure They did the right thing just by being what they were which gave us inspiration just when we needed it most And now we have to turn it all around Great books as I said will be written about these days and the war on which we are embarked on how it began and why America slept and what America did when it awoke Much awaits to be learned and told And what we must do now in our anger and defensiveness is support assist and constructively criticize the systems that so catastrophically failed For those systems still reign and we still need them And they are trying to function now and trying to protect us with the same sense of loss we all share and the added burden of a mindbending sense of remorse frustration anger and pain imagesstoryenddingbatgif Where are we right now We have reached the point in the story where the original trauma is wearing off except in our dreams where its newly inflicted where expressions of solidarity and patriotism are true but tired and questions about exactly how well our institutions are handling thisnot in the past but right noware rising It all began days ago We know who did the bombings because they were on the planes and they left receipts But we do not know who their confederates here were do not know who is spreading the anthrax that has hit Florida New York and Washington do not know the dimensions of the threat at home Authority figures are doubted The letter carriers dont trust their superiors to take care of them and how they feel is legitimate and understandable The workers in the newsrooms reassured by the boss that if they were going to get anthrax they would have had it by now do not trust what theyre being told or the tellers And that is legitimate and understandable We are reading anxious reports Yesterday I read that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had admitted it kept nuclear plant vulnerability studies out and about and available for any citizen to see in their libraries Q What were they thinking A They werent thinking they were feeling and what they were feeling was lucky More and more one senses were going to have to be taking as much responsibility for ourselvesand on ourselvesas we can Doing our own research taking our own actions making our own decisions and acting on our own guts A week after Sept I was on a TV show where I said Id been thinking about Mrs Miniver the movie with Greer Garson as the doughty British matron who saw her familyand thus her countrythrough the Blitz I said that we were all going to have to be Mrs Minivers now were going to have to keep the home front going I keep waiting for some talk show or news show to do the Mrs Miniver segment telling us what to do in case of real and terrible trouble And no one is doing it So we must all be doing it ourselves I am researching and talking to experts Next week I will talk about How to Be Mr and Mrs Miniverfrom how much water to buy to where to put it and how to get everyone in your ambit together I will share everything Im told and hear And let me tell you why I think in all this mess we must gather together and talk about how to get through it together as citizens Because our systems are not fully working yet Its a murky time Were all feeling a little bit lonely and all of us at one moment or another have the existential willies Those who have kids and grandchildren are feeling as alone as those who are actually all alone Wed all best handle as much as we can ourselves in and with our own little units It may become a terrifically tough time But we are not alone as you well know God loves faith and effort and he loves love He will help us get through this and to enjoy Paris and New York again and to breathe deep of his delicious mansardroofed world Amen Ms Noonan is a contributing editor of

<8135465.1075852002155.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,janel.guerrero@enron.com,2001-06-20 03:59:00,Update on IPPNY PR Working Groupeveryone I thought it would be useful to send you this email as a follow up to the meeting we had last week with the IPPNY PR Working Group Background As you know our efforts to form a PR campaign as the Empire State Energy Suppliers fell apart at the end of May Since then I have been working with Sharon Stewart at Brown Olson and Wilson in order to pay SSK for their services from April to May We are waiting for one last invoice May expenses from SSK Once we receive this invoice Brown Olson Wilson will send a lumpsum payment to SSK I will get you the total cost of SSKs services for AprilMay but is an approximate number This comes to about per each of the companies that participated in the effort As you will recall we each sent K to the Escrow account IPPNY PR Working Group Given the high profile of energy issues in NY and the increasing dialogue taking place there a coordinated PR effoert can certainly be justified Those of us who participated in ESES whose companies are also members of IPPNY met last week in Albany to discuss whether IPPNY would be willing to expand their PR efforts if we joined forces Thanks to all of you who were able to attend and participate in the meeting Since last week Gavin Donohue and the IPPNY Board of Directors have given their full support to this expanded effort and we are moving foward with a comprehensive NYfocused communications effort I am working as liaison between IPPNY and SSK and the following is a summary of how we are proceeding A meeting between SSK and Gavin and myself is scheduled to take place in NYC next week We intend to cover the following We are targeting July th as our launch date A press release will go out explaining IPPNYs point Energy Solutions Program ESP for New York A QA Fact Sheet and other supporting documents for a press kit will be reviewed We will discuss the scheduling of meetings with press outlets and thirdparty allies We will also go over website issues and other elements of the comprehensive plan Essentially the SSK comprehensive PR plan has been tweaked for IPPNYs purposes and will be implemented going foward Given our late start SSK and IPPNY have been working extremely closely on all of the abovementioned documents so that we can meet a July th launch date However I dont want anyone to be out of the loop It is our intention to provide all of the members of the IPPNY PR Working Group with the documents prior to launching on July th The messages are in line with what we agreed to all along as part of ESES The difference is that we actually have a spokesperson Gavin Donohue Budget Issues This is an extremely important issue and I am appealing to each of you to respond to me asap regarding the following As ESES we agreed to put forth K to our PR effort with the first K going into the Escrow Account managed by Brown Olson Wilson Once SSK is paid for AprilMay services there will be some extra money in the Escrow Account I would like to proceed as follows with your approval Coordinate with Brown Olson Wilson and pay SSK for AprilMay services with Escrow Account funds Wire the remaining Escrow Account funds to IPPNYs PR Working Group Account also to be coordinated with Peter Brown if the Escrow Agreement allows and with your approval Work with IPPNY and have them invoice each of us for the additional K assuming we are all still in for the original K Remaining Escrow Account funds K will go toward SSK services going foward These funds in addition to the funds that IPPNY has already received from their PR Working Group members shall cover SSKs work beginning on June through the extend of the contract Additional costs such as advertising will have to be considered after we get the funds deposited into the PR Account and have an idea of how much were working with and whether advertising is a possibility Enron is willing to contribute additional funds on top of the K to this effort if necessary You and your respective organizations may want to consider this as well IPPNYSSK Contract Issues As you may recall a contract between ESES and SSK was never signed Contract discussions took almost months and SSK continues to work with us in good faith considering they still have not been paid a dime Gavin is unwilling to sign a contract with SSK until he has funds in the PR Account to pay for SSKs services As you can see we must expedite payment to IPPNY so that we can launch on July th and so that IPPNY and SSK can agree on contract terms within the next two weeks Gavin is reviewing the ESESSSK contract with IPPNYs lawyers Once the funds are deposited into the IPPNY PR Account Gavin will sign a contract with SSK We will provide everyone with a copy of the contract if you choose to review it although most of you should be familiar with it I think this covers the progress weve made since our meeting in Albany Please call me if you have any questions about the budget contract or the comprehensive plan Im interested in youre input so please weigh in with your comments Lastly I want to

<11502797.1075852021378.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,janel.guerrero@enron.com,2001-06-20 03:59:00,Update on IPPNY PR Working Groupeveryone I thought it would be useful to send you this email as a follow up to the meeting we had last week with the IPPNY PR Working Group Background As you know our efforts to form a PR campaign as the Empire State Energy Suppliers fell apart at the end of May Since then I have been working with Sharon Stewart at Brown Olson and Wilson in order to pay SSK for their services from April to May We are waiting for one last invoice May expenses from SSK Once we receive this invoice Brown Olson Wilson will send a lumpsum payment to SSK I will get you the total cost of SSKs services for AprilMay but is an approximate number This comes to about per each of the companies that participated in the effort As you will recall we each sent K to the Escrow account IPPNY PR Working Group Given the high profile of energy issues in NY and the increasing dialogue taking place there a coordinated PR effoert can certainly be justified Those of us who participated in ESES whose companies are also members of IPPNY met last week in Albany to discuss whether IPPNY would be willing to expand their PR efforts if we joined forces Thanks to all of you who were able to attend and participate in the meeting Since last week Gavin Donohue and the IPPNY Board of Directors have given their full support to this expanded effort and we are moving foward with a comprehensive NYfocused communications effort I am working as liaison between IPPNY and SSK and the following is a summary of how we are proceeding A meeting between SSK and Gavin and myself is scheduled to take place in NYC next week We intend to cover the following We are targeting July th as our launch date A press release will go out explaining IPPNYs point Energy Solutions Program ESP for New York A QA Fact Sheet and other supporting documents for a press kit will be reviewed We will discuss the scheduling of meetings with press outlets and thirdparty allies We will also go over website issues and other elements of the comprehensive plan Essentially the SSK comprehensive PR plan has been tweaked for IPPNYs purposes and will be implemented going foward Given our late start SSK and IPPNY have been working extremely closely on all of the abovementioned documents so that we can meet a July th launch date However I dont want anyone to be out of the loop It is our intention to provide all of the members of the IPPNY PR Working Group with the documents prior to launching on July th The messages are in line with what we agreed to all along as part of ESES The difference is that we actually have a spokesperson Gavin Donohue Budget Issues This is an extremely important issue and I am appealing to each of you to respond to me asap regarding the following As ESES we agreed to put forth K to our PR effort with the first K going into the Escrow Account managed by Brown Olson Wilson Once SSK is paid for AprilMay services there will be some extra money in the Escrow Account I would like to proceed as follows with your approval Coordinate with Brown Olson Wilson and pay SSK for AprilMay services with Escrow Account funds Wire the remaining Escrow Account funds to IPPNYs PR Working Group Account also to be coordinated with Peter Brown if the Escrow Agreement allows and with your approval Work with IPPNY and have them invoice each of us for the additional K assuming we are all still in for the original K Remaining Escrow Account funds K will go toward SSK services going foward These funds in addition to the funds that IPPNY has already received from their PR Working Group members shall cover SSKs work beginning on June through the extend of the contract Additional costs such as advertising will have to be considered after we get the funds deposited into the PR Account and have an idea of how much were working with and whether advertising is a possibility Enron is willing to contribute additional funds on top of the K to this effort if necessary You and your respective organizations may want to consider this as well IPPNYSSK Contract Issues As you may recall a contract between ESES and SSK was never signed Contract discussions took almost months and SSK continues to work with us in good faith considering they still have not been paid a dime Gavin is unwilling to sign a contract with SSK until he has funds in the PR Account to pay for SSKs services As you can see we must expedite payment to IPPNY so that we can launch on July th and so that IPPNY and SSK can agree on contract terms within the next two weeks Gavin is reviewing the ESESSSK contract with IPPNYs lawyers Once the funds are deposited into the IPPNY PR Account Gavin will sign a

<9046047.1075858702084.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,janel.guerrero@enron.com,2001-06-20 13:59:00,Update on IPPNY PR Working GroupGreetings everyone I thought it would be useful to send you this email as a follow up to the meeting we had last week with the IPPNY PR Working Group Background As you know our efforts to form a PR campaign as the Empire State Energy Suppliers fell apart at the end of May Since then I have been working with Sharon Stewart at Brown Olson and Wilson in order to pay SSK for their services from April to May We are waiting for one last invoice May expenses from SSK Once we receive this invoice Brown Olson Wilson will send a lumpsum payment to SSK I will get you the total cost of SSKs services for AprilMay but is an approximate number This comes to about per each of the companies that participated in the effort As you will recall we each sent K to the Escrow account IPPNY PR Working Group Given the high profile of energy issues in NY and the increasing dialogue taking place there a coordinated PR effoert can certainly be justified Those of us who participated in ESES whose companies are also members of IPPNY met last week in Albany to discuss whether IPPNY would be willing to expand their PR efforts if we joined forces Thanks to all of you who were able to attend and participate in the meeting Since last week Gavin Donohue and the IPPNY Board of Directors have given their full support to this expanded effort and we are moving foward with a comprehensive NYfocused communications effort I am working as liaison between IPPNY and SSK and the following is a summary of how we are proceeding A meeting between SSK and Gavin and myself is scheduled to take place in NYC next week We intend to cover the following We are targeting July th as our launch date A press release will go out explaining IPPNYs point Energy Solutions Program ESP for New York A QA Fact Sheet and other supporting documents for a press kit will be reviewed We will discuss the scheduling of meetings with press outlets and thirdparty allies We will also go over website issues and other elements of the comprehensive plan Essentially the SSK comprehensive PR plan has been tweaked for IPPNYs purposes and will be implemented going foward Given our late start SSK and IPPNY have been working extremely closely on all of the abovementioned documents so that we can meet a July th launch date However I dont want anyone to be out of the loop It is our intention to provide all of the members of the IPPNY PR Working Group with the documents prior to launching on July th The messages are in line with what we agreed to all along as part of ESES The difference is that we actually have a spokesperson Gavin Donohue Budget Issues This is an extremely important issue and I am appealing to each of you to respond to me asap regarding the following As ESES we agreed to put forth K to our PR effort with the first K going into the Escrow Account managed by Brown Olson Wilson Once SSK is paid for AprilMay services there will be some extra money in the Escrow Account I would like to proceed as follows with your approval Coordinate with Brown Olson Wilson and pay SSK for AprilMay services with Escrow Account funds Wire the remaining Escrow Account funds to IPPNYs PR Working Group Account also to be coordinated with Peter Brown if the Escrow Agreement allows and with your approval Work with IPPNY and have them invoice each of us for the additional K assuming we are all still in for the original K Remaining Escrow Account funds K will go toward SSK services going foward These funds in addition to the funds that IPPNY has already received from their PR Working Group members shall cover SSKs work beginning on June through the extend of the contract Additional costs such as advertising will have to be considered after we get the funds deposited into the PR Account and have an idea of how much were working with and whether advertising is a possibility Enron is willing to contribute additional funds on top of the K to this effort if necessary You and your respective organizations may want to consider this as well IPPNYSSK Contract Issues As you may recall a contract between ESES and SSK was never signed Contract discussions took almost months and SSK continues to work with us in good faith considering they still have not been paid a dime Gavin is unwilling to sign a contract with SSK until he has funds in the PR Account to pay for SSKs services As you can see we must expedite payment to IPPNY so that we can launch on July th and so that IPPNY and SSK can agree on contract terms within the next two weeks Gavin is reviewing the ESESSSK contract with IPPNYs lawyers Once the funds are deposited into the IPPNY PR Account Gavin will sign a contract with SSK We will provide everyone with a copy of the contract if you choose to review it although most of you should be familiar with it I think this covers the progress weve made since our meeting in Albany Please call me if you have any questions about the budget contract or the comprehensive plan Im interested in youre input so please weigh in with your comments Lastly I want to emphasize that I need your feedback regarding budget issues asap I am in Houston all week and can be reached at the following numbers Direct Dial Cell Phone THANKS
