nron Derick nron Warren nron Judy CT Leslie CT Judy CT cc Subject A Visitors Guide to Houston TX Forwarded by Angela BarnettHOUECT on PM Mary Westbrook on PM To Mabel Abrasley cc Subject A Visitors Guide to Houston TX A VISITORS GUIDE TO HOUSTON TX To enable our many visitors to cope with life in Americas Fourth Largest City First you must learn to pronounce the city name It is YEWSTUN and it does not matter how people pronounce it in other places Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere Houston has its own version of traffic rules Never forget that downtown Houston is composed entirely of one way streets The only way to get out of center of town is to turn around and start over when you reach Dallas Texas All directions start with Go down Westheimer Westheimer has no beginning and no end Its impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street you started on The Chamber of Commerce calls this a scenic drive The am rush hour is from to am The pm rush hour is from to pm Fridays rush hour starts on Thursday morning If you actually stop at a yellow light you cannot be from Houston Reversible Lanes are not understood by anybody Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native so do not attempt the phonetic pronunciation People will simply tilt their heads to the right and stare at you The falling of one raindrop or God forbid one snowflake causes all traffic to immediately cease so will daylight savings time and a girl applying eye shadow across the street or a flat tire three lanes over Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life and a permanent form of entertainment Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phraseOh were in Montrose Construction crews arent doing their job properly unless they close down all lanes except one during rush hour If someone actually has their turn signal on it was probably left on at the factory where the car was made Understand that the pound woman driving the Ford Excursion the largest vehicle ever produced absolutely MUST come to a complete stop then proceed at mph over any railroad track Whats the deal This vehicle was built to invade small countries and shes worried about the railroad tracks All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln Continentals have the right of way The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a legal right to turn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right lane YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey any known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop signs Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since there is absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to avoid major road construction Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since the termination or continuation of any street is entirely at the discretion of the Streets Department of the City It has been determined that the length of any street on any given day is a mystery known only to Higher Powers in the department and it is rumored that they do not speak to mere mortals Asking directions will help you get acquainted with the numerous recent residents of an amazing ethnic diversity It will be not help at all for finding the address you seek If searching for a street on the southwest side of Houston a knowledge of Chinese Korean or Vietnamese is somewhere between helpful and mandatory since the street signs are printed in one of these languages along with English However often the English name for the street has been removed Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered species list The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled environment for their own safety Sir and Maam are used by the person speaking to you if theres a remote possibility that youre at least minutes older than they are You can safely address anyone as Sir or Maam in Houston as in other southern cities Sugar is a more common form of address than Miss So is Honey Do not take offence This is how southerners address grown women In Houston we drink Coca Cola and Dr Pepper It is rumored that other soft drinks are sold here but no one will admit to knowing anyone who actually drinks them So dont ask for any other soft drink What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental Airport Your arrival gate is at least miles away from the Main Concourse of any terminal Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes are advised Wherever you are going will be on the other side of town When attempting to cross Houston assume the trip will take a minimum of hours and can take as long as hours If attempting to cross Houston via the freeway system it is advisable to carry a supply of Coca Cola water a few sandwiches and something to read while waiting on the freeway for the traffic jam to clear Some moderately fast readers have been known to read a page novel during the course of one traffic jam If attempting to cross Houston during rush hour additional provisions are advisable Never get on a Houston freeway without taking a restroom break first It may be a long time to the next break Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic The bumpersticker that reads Keep honking Im reloading is considered fair warning Do You Yahoo Get Yahoo Mail Free email you can access from anywhere

LGMCOM cc Subject Tear jerker Get a tissue Like any good mother when Karen found out that another baby was on the way she did what she could o help her yearold son Michael prepare for a new sibling They found out that the new baby was going to be a girl and day after day night after night Michael sang to his sister in Mommys tummy He was building a bond of love with his little sister before he even met her The pregnancy progressed normally for Karen of Morristown Tennessee In time the labor pains came Soon it was every five minutes every three every minute But serious complications arose during delivery and Karen found herself in hours of labor Would a Csection be required Finally after a long struggle Michaels little sister was born But she was in very serious condition With a siren howling in the night the ambulance rushed the infant to the neonatal intensive care unit at St Marys Hospital Knoxville Tennessee The days inched by The little girl got worse The pediatrician had to tell the parents There is very little hope Be prepared for the worst Karen and her husband contacted a local cemetery about a burial plot They had fixed up a special room in their house for their new baby but now they found themselves having to plan for a funeral Michael however kept begging his parents to let him see his sister I want to sing to her he kept saying Week two in intensive care looked as if a funeral would come before the week was over Michael kept nagging about singing to his sister but kids are never allowed in Intensive Care Karen made up her mind though She would take Michael whether they liked it or not If he didnt see his sister right then he may never see her alive She dressed him in an oversized scrub suit and marched him into ICU He looked like a walking laundry basket But the head nurse recognized him as a child and bellowed Get that kid out of here now No children are allowed The mother rose up strong in Karen and the usually mildmannered lady glared steeleyed right into the head nurses face her lips a firm line He is not leaving until he sings to his sister Karen towed Michael to his sisters bedside He gazed at the tiny infant losing the battle to live After a moment he began to sing In the purehearted voice of a yearold Michael sang You are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are gray Instantly the baby girl seemed to respond The pulse rate began to calm down and become steady Keep on singing Michael encouraged Karen with tears in her eyes You never know dear how much I love you Please dont take my sunshine away As Michael sang to his sister the babys ragged strained breathing became as smooth as a kittens purr Keep on singing Sweetheart The other night dear as I lay sleeping I dreamed I held you in my arms Michaels little sister began to relax as rest healing restseemed to sweep over her Keep on singing Michael Tears had now conquered the face of the bossy head nurse Karen glowed You are my sunshine my only Sunshine Please dont take my sunshine away The next daythe very next daythe little girl was well enough to go home Womans Day Magazine called it The Miracle of a Brothers Song The medical staff just called it a miracle Karen called it a miracle of Gods love NEVER GIVE UP ON THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE LOVE IS SO INCREDIBLY POWERFUL Life is good Have a Wonderful Day This is the power of prayer at work Lets continue to pray for one another PRAYER May today there be peace within you May you trust God that you are exactly where you are meant to be May you not forget the infinite possibilities that are born of faith May you use those gifts that you have received and pass on the love that has been given to you May you be content knowing that you are a child of God Let His presence settle into your bones and allow your soul the freedom to sing dance and to bask in the sun It is there for each and every one of you Send this to others and witness the awesome power of

job with you In my job I review criminal and psychiatric files of imprisoned sex offenders who are approaching their release date I decide if they are likely to reoffend based on certain criteria and then civilly commit them to a sex offender treatment facility if I decide that they are at significant risk to reoffend I have read hundreds and hundreds of files and have taken note of some of the mistakes women make Let me preface this by saying that a woman is NEVER EVER EVER at fault for being raped or attacked but there are definitely ways to reduce your risk of being a victim Here are the most common mistakes women make that could result in them getting kidnapped attacked andor raped Getting into the attackers car when he pulls a gun and orders you to get into his vehicle Most attackers dont want to shoot you they want you to get into the car so that they can drive you to a deserted place and torture you Dont comply Run screaming It is MUCH more likely than not that he will just move on to an easier target Pulling over when a man drives alongside of you pointing at your car pretending something is wrong If this happens drive to the nearest welllit and populated gas station and look the car over yourself or ask an attendant Never pull over Believe it or not many women have fallen for this for fear of their car spontaneously exploding in the middle of the road Not likely Not locking your doors while driving I have read several cases where the attacker simply walks up to a womans car while shes at a traffic light and jumps in with his gun or knife drawn Opening your front door when you have not positively identified who is there If you dont have a peep hole get one Ive seen countless cases where the attacker gains access to his victims simply by knocking on their door Dont let an attacker get into your home He then has a private relatively soundproof place to attack you Not being alert in parking lots If you go to the grocery store at night dont be shy about asking for an escort to your car Too many women are abducted from parking lots or even raped in the parking lot Look in your back seat before entering your car Cars provide endless hiding places for attackers both inside them and in between them Be aware of your surroundings by looking to the left and right and behind you with your head up all the time You may appear paranoid and look funny to others but an attacker will think twice about approaching someone who appears so aware of whats going on Trusting a clean cut honest looking stranger I see mug shots of every sex offender in the state of Florida They do not look like monsters They often look like they could be your friendly grocer bank teller waiter neighbor clergy doctor etc They are every age between and and probably beyond Only a small minority actually look scary I just read a case yesterday of a man with only one leg who beat up his victim with his crutch before he raped her Who would have ever thought that a onelegged man could be a rapist Trusting people to be alone with your children This is a difficult one because child molesters end up being the LAST person the parents would believe is the molester Most of the child molesting cases I see involve the stepfather the uncle the sisters boyfriend the mothers boyfriend the grandfather the babysitter the neighbor the family friend the youth camp director day care worker etc Although rare even women can be molesters In every case the perpetrator is a nice guy trusting good with children and the family is baffled or even in disbelief that the person could be abusing their child When it comes to your children and grandchildren be suspicious of everyone no matter who they are And pay attention to what your child says and how heshe reacts to the mention of different people in their lives I didnt mean to make anyone uncomfortable with this but I am at work right now reviewing files and realized that this email is a way I can reach many women at one time I have the dirty job of reading all these files and it makes me feel good to know that I can share some inferences from what I have learned This is not an exhaustive list of what not to do but just some things that I have observed more than just a few times Pass this on to the women in your lives

you probably already know about the pitfalls traps and predators on the internet but this is something to consider for your children and families This story is something those of you with children who are home alone andor enjoy chat rooms talk groups buddy lists etc should be aware of Share this with others you think would benefit Thanks Shannon could hear the footsteps behind her as she walked toward home The thought of being followed made her heart beat faster Youre being silly she told herself no one is following you To be safe she began to walk faster but the footsteps kept up with her pace She was afraid to look back and she was glad she was almost home Shannon said a quick prayer God please get me home safe She saw the porch light burning and ran the rest of the way to her house Once inside she leaned against the door for a moment relieved to be in the safety of her home She glanced out the window to see if anyone was there The sidewalk was empty After tossing her books on the sofa she decided to grab a snack and get online She logged on under her screen name ByAngel She checked her Buddy List and saw GoTo was on She sent him an instant message ByAngel Hi Im glad you are on I thought someone was following me home today It was really weird GoTo LOL You watch too much TV Why would someone be following you Dont you live in a safe neighborhood ByAngel Of course I do LOL I guess it was my imagination cuz I didnt see anybody when I looked out GoTo Unless you gave your name out online You havent done that have you ByAngel Of course not Im not stupid you know GoTo Did you have a softball game after school today ByAngel Yes and we won GoTo Thats great Who did you play ByAngel We played the Hornets LOL Their uniforms are so gross They look like bees LOL GoTo What is your team called ByAngel We are the Canton Cats We have tiger paws on our uniforms They are really kewl GoTo Did you pitch ByAngel No I play second base I got to go My homework has to be done before my parents get home I dont want them mad at me Bye GoTo Catch you later Bye Meanwhile GoTo went to the member menu and began to search for her profile When it came up he highlighted it and printed it out He took out a pen and began to write down what he knew about Angel so far Her name Shannon Birthday Jan Age State where she lived North Carolina Hobbies softball chorus skating and going to the mall Besides this information he knew she lived in Canton because she had just told him He knew she stayed by herself until pm every afternoon until her parents came home from work He knew she played softball on Thursday afternoons on the school team and the team was named the Canton Cats Her favorite number was printed on her jersey He knew she was in the seventh grade at the Canton Junior High School She had told him all this in the conversations they had online He had enough information to find her now Shannon didnt tell her parents about the incident on the way home from the ball park that day She didnt want them to make a scene and stop her from walking home from the softball games Parents were always overreacting and hers were the worst It made her wish she was not an only child Maybe if she had brothers and sisters her parents wouldnt be so overprotective By Thursday Shannon had forgotten about the footsteps following her Her game was in full swing when suddenly she felt someone staring at her It was then that the memory came back She glanced up from her second base position to see a man watching her closely He was leaning against the fence behind first base and he smiled when she looked at him He didnt look scary and she quickly dismissed the fear she had felt After the game he sat on a bleacher while she talked to the coach She noticed his smile once again as she walked past him He nodded and she smiled back He noticed her name on the back of her shirt He knew he had found her Quietly he walked a safe distance behind her It was only a few blocks to Shannons home and once he saw where she lived he quickly returned to the park to get his car Now he had to wait He decided to get a bite to eat until the time came to go to Shannons house He drove to a fast food restaurant and sat there until time to make his move Shannon was in her room later that evening when she heard voices in the living room Shannon come here her father called He sounded upset and she couldnt imagine why She went into the room to see the man from the ballpark sitting on the sofa Sit down her father began this man has just told us a most interesting story about you Shannon moved cautiously to a chair across from the man How could he tell her parents anything She had never seen him before today Do you know who I am Shannon The man asked No Shannon answered I am a police officer and your online friend GoTo Shannon was stunned Thats impossible GoTo is a kid my age Hes and he lives in Michigan The man smiled I know I told you all that but it wasnt true You see Shannon there are people on line who pretend to be kids I was one of them But while others do it to find kids and hurt them I belong to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from predators I came here to find you to teach you how dangerous it is to give out too much information to people online You told me enough about yourself to make it easy for me to find you Your name the school you went to the name of your ball team and the position you played The number and name on your jersey just made finding you a breeze Shannon was stunned You mean you dont live in Michigan He laughed No I live in Raleigh It made you feel safe to think I was so far away didnt it She nodded I had a friend whose daughter was like you Only she wasnt as lucky The guy found her and murdered her while she was home alone Kids are taught not to tell anyone when they are alone yet they do it all the time online The wrong people trick you into giving out information a little here and there online Before you know it you have told them enough for them to find you without even realizing you have done it I hope youve learned a lesson from this and wont do it again I wont Shannon promised solemnly Will you tell others about this so they will be safe too Its a promise

daughter Kathleen was too young to seriously date but she had a boyfriend One evening when I was leaving to pick up my son Paul from baseball practice she asked if she could just go with her boyfriend to pick up his little brother at a friends house She said they would come right back I said All right just make sure you wear your seat belt and come right home It was my fathers birthday and my youngest daughterTherese was already at my fathers house waiting for us to come over with the cake I had yet to pick up at the store I left to pick Paul up at school but decided to take the highway rather than the shortcut along the back roads After leaving the school Paul and I ran in the store for the cake and some last minute goodies As we were getting into the car we heard and saw paramedics fire trucks three ambulances and of course a multitude of police cars I got a sick feeling in my stomach and said to Paul Somebody needs our prayers quick I wondered if there was a fire or a bad car accident At one of the intersections I had to stop to let more emergency vehicles through and prayed Lord those people need you right now go to them and place your protective hand over them We stopped at my parents to drop off the food before going home to pick up Kathleen but my father met me at the car and told us to postpone the Party because Therese had fallen asleep Which way did you go to the school he asked Because there was a bad accident on the back road I heard someone was killed It happened just about the time you had to pick up Paul at the school and I know you always go that way I was so happy to see you pull in I had a gut feeling it was you As Paul and I drove the short distance home I could see our house was dark and when Kathleen is home alone she always burned every light As I turned off the ignition tears fell It was Kathleen I told Paul I know it I ran in the house and checked our answering machine no one had called I breathed a sigh of relief thinking that someone would have called by now Paranoid thats what Kathleen always called me and thats what I was telling myself Youre just paranoid Then the phone rang It was her friends mother who worked in the emergency room of our local hospital She only told me that the three of them were in an accident and were being transported to the hospital I didnt call my husband at work or my parents Paul and I just left for the hospital As I pulled into the parking lot one of the paramedics someone we have known for years met us at our car Im sorry Im so sorry he said with tears streaming down his face The next thing I remember after was talking to the doctor in the hallway of the ER He asked me if I believed in God and with that my knees gave way No he said you dont understand do you believe in divine intervention I stammered a weak Yes Not having a clue what he was talking about He smiled at me and asked Do you know what shirt your daughter was wearing tonight Nodding no he told me to go down the hall and look Your daughter is blessed with angels and so are you From what the emergency personnel told me there is no way that your daughter should be alive let alone only have a few scratches Kathleen was laying on a cart waiting for more xrays When I got to her we both sobbed As I was hugging her I had the urge to check her shirt unzipping her jacket I read the words Jesus Saves I knew then what the doctor had meant All three were treated and released On the way home that night Kathleen told this story It was really weird about a quarter of a mile before the accident I said Wait we forgot to put our seatbelts on my Mother will kill me Then a car was coming towards us in our lane he swerved and I knew we got hit on the passenger side of the car where I was sitting We got hit a total of three times because the car kept spinning in a circle I felt his little brothers hand on my shoulder holding me lightly in place But Mom after it was all over I could still feel the hand on my shoulder I looked and his little brother had flown out the back window of the car as we later found out on the first spin It was an angelMomI know it I knew it too especially when we went the next day to look at the car it had been split in half right underneath my daughters seat The driver of the other car witnesses said was traveling miles Per hour and the point of impact at that speed was directly at Kathleens door The police report stated that the car door was found fifty feet away from the accident scene with the seat belt attached So when the door broke loose the hand was the only thing that saved my daughters life The Lord knew long before I did that my child was in trouble and I will always praise Him for saving her life and restoring mine I have been meaning to write this story for the past couple years Kathleen just turned While I was writing this I smiled and cried its all true Father I ask you to bless my friend reading this right now Lord show them a new revelation of Your love and

you probably already know about the pitfalls traps and predators on the internet but this is something to consider for your children and families This story is something those of you with children who are home alone andor enjoy chat rooms talk groups buddy lists etc should be aware of Share this with others you think would benefit Thanks Shannon could hear the footsteps behind her as she walked toward home The thought of being followed made her heart beat faster Youre being silly she told herself no one is following you To be safe she began to walk faster but the footsteps kept up with her pace She was afraid to look back and she was glad she was almost home Shannon said a quick prayer God please get me home safe She saw the porch light burning and ran the rest of the way to her house Once inside she leaned against the door for a moment relieved to be in the safety of her home She glanced out the window to see if anyone was there The sidewalk was empty After tossing her books on the sofa she decided to grab a snack and get online She logged on under her screen name ByAngel She checked her Buddy List and saw GoTo was on She sent him an instant message ByAngel Hi Im glad you are on I thought someone was following me home today It was really weird GoTo LOL You watch too much TV Why would someone be following you Dont you live in a safe neighborhood ByAngel Of course I do LOL I guess it was my imagination cuz I didnt see anybody when I looked out GoTo Unless you gave your name out online You havent done that have you ByAngel Of course not Im not stupid you know GoTo Did you have a softball game after school today ByAngel Yes and we won GoTo Thats great Who did you play ByAngel We played the Hornets LOL Their uniforms are so gross They look like bees LOL GoTo What is your team called ByAngel We are the Canton Cats We have tiger paws on our uniforms They are really kewl GoTo Did you pitch ByAngel No I play second base I got to go My homework has to be done before my parents get home I dont want them mad at me Bye GoTo Catch you later Bye Meanwhile GoTo went to the member menu and began to search for her profile When it came up he highlighted it and printed it out He took out a pen and began to write down what he knew about Angel so far Her name Shannon Birthday Jan Age State where she lived North Carolina Hobbies softball chorus skating and going to the mall Besides this information he knew she lived in Canton because she had just told him He knew she stayed by herself until pm every afternoon until her parents came home from work He knew she played softball on Thursday afternoons on the school team and the team was named the Canton Cats Her favorite number was printed on her jersey He knew she was in the seventh grade at the Canton Junior High School She had told him all this in the conversations they had online He had enough information to find her now Shannon didnt tell her parents about the incident on the way home from the ball park that day She didnt want them to make a scene and stop her from walking home from the softball games Parents were always overreacting and hers were the worst It made her wish she was not an only child Maybe if she had brothers and sisters her parents wouldnt be so overprotective By Thursday Shannon had forgotten about the footsteps following her Her game was in full swing when suddenly she felt someone staring at her It was then that the memory came back She glanced up from her second base position to see a man watching her closely He was leaning against the fence behind first base and he smiled when she looked at him He didnt look scary and she quickly dismissed the fear she had felt After the game he sat on a bleacher while she talked to the coach She noticed his smile once again as she walked past him He nodded and she smiled back He noticed her name on the back of her shirt He knew he had found her Quietly he walked a safe distance behind her It was only a few blocks to Shannons home and once he saw where she lived he quickly returned to the park to get his car Now he had to wait He decided to get a bite to eat until the time came to go to Shannons house He drove to a fast food restaurant and sat there until time to make his move Shannon was in her room later that evening when she heard voices in the living room Shannon come here her father called He sounded upset and she couldnt imagine why She went into the room to see the man from the ballpark sitting on the sofa Sit down her father began this man has just told us a most interesting story about you Shannon moved cautiously to a chair across from the man How could he tell her parents anything She had never seen him before today Do you know who I am Shannon The man asked No Shannon answered I am a police officer and your online friend GoTo Shannon was stunned Thats impossible GoTo is a kid my age Hes and he lives in Michigan The man smiled I know I told you all that but it wasnt true You see Shannon there are people on line who pretend to be kids I was one of them But while others do it to find kids and hurt them I belong to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from predators I came here to find you to teach you how dangerous it is to give out too much information to people online You told me enough about yourself to make it easy for me to find you Your name the school you went to the name of your ball team and the position you played The number and name on your jersey just made finding you a breeze Shannon was stunned You mean you dont live in Michigan He laughed No I live in Raleigh It made you feel safe to think I was so far away didnt it She nodded I had a friend whose daughter was like you Only she wasnt as lucky The guy found her and murdered her while she was home alone Kids are taught not to tell anyone when they are alone yet they do it all the time online The wrong people trick you into giving out information a little here and there online Before you know it you have told them enough for them to find you without even realizing you have done it I hope youve learned a lesson from this and wont do it again I wont Shannon promised solemnly Will you tell others about this so they will be safe too Its a promise

daughter Kathleen was too young to seriously date but she had a boyfriend One evening when I was leaving to pick up my son Paul from baseball practice she asked if she could just go with her boyfriend to pick up his little brother at a friends house She said they would come right back I said All right just make sure you wear your seat belt and come right home It was my fathers birthday and my youngest daughterTherese was already at my fathers house waiting for us to come over with the cake I had yet to pick up at the store I left to pick Paul up at school but decided to take the highway rather than the shortcut along the back roads After leaving the school Paul and I ran in the store for the cake and some last minute goodies As we were getting into the car we heard and saw paramedics fire trucks three ambulances and of course a multitude of police cars I got a sick feeling in my stomach and said to Paul Somebody needs our prayers quick I wondered if there was a fire or a bad car accident At one of the intersections I had to stop to let more emergency vehicles through and prayed Lord those people need you right now go to them and place your protective hand over them We stopped at my parents to drop off the food before going home to pick up Kathleen but my father met me at the car and told us to postpone the Party because Therese had fallen asleep Which way did you go to the school he asked Because there was a bad accident on the back road I heard someone was killed It happened just about the time you had to pick up Paul at the school and I know you always go that way I was so happy to see you pull in I had a gut feeling it was you As Paul and I drove the short distance home I could see our house was dark and when Kathleen is home alone she always burned every light As I turned off the ignition tears fell It was Kathleen I told Paul I know it I ran in the house and checked our answering machine no one had called I breathed a sigh of relief thinking that someone would have called by now Paranoid thats what Kathleen always called me and thats what I was telling myself Youre just paranoid Then the phone rang It was her friends mother who worked in the emergency room of our local hospital She only told me that the three of them were in an accident and were being transported to the hospital I didnt call my husband at work or my parents Paul and I just left for the hospital As I pulled into the parking lot one of the paramedics someone we have known for years met us at our car Im sorry Im so sorry he said with tears streaming down his face The next thing I remember after was talking to the doctor in the hallway of the ER He asked me if I believed in God and with that my knees gave way No he said you dont understand do you believe in divine intervention I stammered a weak Yes Not having a clue what he was talking about He smiled at me and asked Do you know what shirt your daughter was wearing tonight Nodding no he told me to go down the hall and look Your daughter is blessed with angels and so are you From what the emergency personnel told me there is no way that your daughter should be alive let alone only have a few scratches Kathleen was laying on a cart waiting for more xrays When I got to her we both sobbed As I was hugging her I had the urge to check her shirt unzipping her jacket I read the words Jesus Saves I knew then what the doctor had meant All three were treated and released On the way home that night Kathleen told this story It was really weird about a quarter of a mile before the accident I said Wait we forgot to put our seatbelts on my Mother will kill me Then a car was coming towards us in our lane he swerved and I knew we got hit on the passenger side of the car where I was sitting We got hit a total of three times because the car kept spinning in a circle I felt his little brothers hand on my shoulder holding me lightly in place But Mom after it was all over I could still feel the hand on my shoulder I looked and his little brother had flown out the back window of the car as we later found out on the first spin It was an angelMomI know it I knew it too especially when we went the next day to look at the car it had been split in half right underneath my daughters seat The driver of the other car witnesses said was traveling miles Per hour and the point of impact at that speed was directly at Kathleens door The police report stated that the car door was found fifty feet away from the accident scene with the seat belt attached So when the door broke loose the hand was the only thing that saved my daughters life The Lord knew long before I did that my child was in trouble and I will always praise Him for saving her life and restoring mine I have been meaning to write this story for the past couple years Kathleen just turned While I was writing this I smiled and cried its all true Father I ask you to bless my friend reading this right now Lord show them a new revelation of Your love and power Holy Spirit I ask You to minister to their spirit at this very moment Where there is pain give them Your peace mercy Where there is selfdoubting release a renewed confidence in Your ability to

nron Derick nron Warren nron Judy CT Leslie CT Judy CT cc Subject A Visitors Guide to Houston TX Forwarded by Angela BarnettHOUECT on PM Mary Westbrook on PM To Mabel Abrasley cc Subject A Visitors Guide to Houston TX A VISITORS GUIDE TO HOUSTON TX To enable our many visitors to cope with life in Americas Fourth Largest City First you must learn to pronounce the city name It is YEWSTUN and it does not matter how people pronounce it in other places Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere Houston has its own version of traffic rules Never forget that downtown Houston is composed entirely of one way streets The only way to get out of center of town is to turn around and start over when you reach Dallas Texas All directions start with Go down Westheimer Westheimer has no beginning and no end Its impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street you started on The Chamber of Commerce calls this a scenic drive The am rush hour is from to am The pm rush hour is from to pm Fridays rush hour starts on Thursday morning If you actually stop at a yellow light you cannot be from Houston Reversible Lanes are not understood by anybody Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native so do not attempt the phonetic pronunciation People will simply tilt their heads to the right and stare at you The falling of one raindrop or God forbid one snowflake causes all traffic to immediately cease so will daylight savings time and a girl applying eye shadow across the street or a flat tire three lanes over Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life and a permanent form of entertainment Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phraseOh were in Montrose Construction crews arent doing their job properly unless they close down all lanes except one during rush hour If someone actually has their turn signal on it was probably left on at the factory where the car was made Understand that the pound woman driving the Ford Excursion the largest vehicle ever produced absolutely MUST come to a complete stop then proceed at mph over any railroad track Whats the deal This vehicle was built to invade small countries and shes worried about the railroad tracks All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln Continentals have the right of way The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a legal right to turn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right lane YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey any known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop signs Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since there is absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to avoid major road construction Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since the termination or continuation of any street is entirely at the discretion of the Streets Department of the City It has been determined that the length of any street on any given day is a mystery known only to Higher Powers in the department and it is rumored that they do not speak to mere mortals Asking directions will help you get acquainted with the numerous recent residents of an amazing ethnic diversity It will be not help at all for finding the address you seek If searching for a street on the southwest side of Houston a knowledge of Chinese Korean or Vietnamese is somewhere between helpful and mandatory since the street signs are printed in one of these languages along with English However often the English name for the street has been removed Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered species list The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled environment for their own safety Sir and Maam are used by the person speaking to you if theres a remote possibility that youre at least minutes older than they are You can safely address anyone as Sir or Maam in Houston as in other southern cities Sugar is a more common form of address than Miss So is Honey Do not take offence This is how southerners address grown women In Houston we drink Coca Cola and Dr Pepper It is rumored that other soft drinks are sold here but no one will admit to knowing anyone who actually drinks them So dont ask for any other soft drink What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental Airport Your arrival gate is at least miles away from the Main Concourse of any terminal Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes are advised Wherever you are going will be on the other side of town When attempting to cross Houston assume the trip will take a minimum of hours and can take as long as hours If attempting to cross Houston via the freeway system it is advisable to carry a supply of Coca Cola water a few sandwiches and something to read while waiting on the freeway for the traffic jam to clear Some moderately fast readers have been known to read a page novel during the course of one traffic jam If attempting to cross Houston during rush hour additional provisions are advisable Never get on a Houston freeway without taking a restroom break first It may be a long time to the next break Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic The bumpersticker that reads Keep honking Im reloading is considered fair warning Do You Yahoo Get Yahoo Mail Free email you can access from anywhere

LGMCOM cc Subject Tear jerker Get a tissue Like any good mother when Karen found out that another baby was on the way she did what she could o help her yearold son Michael prepare for a new sibling They found out that the new baby was going to be a girl and day after day night after night Michael sang to his sister in Mommys tummy He was building a bond of love with his little sister before he even met her The pregnancy progressed normally for Karen of Morristown Tennessee In time the labor pains came Soon it was every five minutes every three every minute But serious complications arose during delivery and Karen found herself in hours of labor Would a Csection be required Finally after a long struggle Michaels little sister was born But she was in very serious condition With a siren howling in the night the ambulance rushed the infant to the neonatal intensive care unit at St Marys Hospital Knoxville Tennessee The days inched by The little girl got worse The pediatrician had to tell the parents There is very little hope Be prepared for the worst Karen and her husband contacted a local cemetery about a burial plot They had fixed up a special room in their house for their new baby but now they found themselves having to plan for a funeral Michael however kept begging his parents to let him see his sister I want to sing to her he kept saying Week two in intensive care looked as if a funeral would come before the week was over Michael kept nagging about singing to his sister but kids are never allowed in Intensive Care Karen made up her mind though She would take Michael whether they liked it or not If he didnt see his sister right then he may never see her alive She dressed him in an oversized scrub suit and marched him into ICU He looked like a walking laundry basket But the head nurse recognized him as a child and bellowed Get that kid out of here now No children are allowed The mother rose up strong in Karen and the usually mildmannered lady glared steeleyed right into the head nurses face her lips a firm line He is not leaving until he sings to his sister Karen towed Michael to his sisters bedside He gazed at the tiny infant losing the battle to live After a moment he began to sing In the purehearted voice of a yearold Michael sang You are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are gray Instantly the baby girl seemed to respond The pulse rate began to calm down and become steady Keep on singing Michael encouraged Karen with tears in her eyes You never know dear how much I love you Please dont take my sunshine away As Michael sang to his sister the babys ragged strained breathing became as smooth as a kittens purr Keep on singing Sweetheart The other night dear as I lay sleeping I dreamed I held you in my arms Michaels little sister began to relax as rest healing restseemed to sweep over her Keep on singing Michael Tears had now conquered the face of the bossy head nurse Karen glowed You are my sunshine my only Sunshine Please dont take my sunshine away The next daythe very next daythe little girl was well enough to go home Womans Day Magazine called it The Miracle of a Brothers Song The medical staff just called it a miracle Karen called it a miracle of Gods love NEVER GIVE UP ON THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE LOVE IS SO INCREDIBLY POWERFUL Life is good Have a Wonderful Day This is the power of prayer at work Lets continue to pray for one another PRAYER May today there be peace within you May you trust God that you are exactly where you are meant to be May you not forget the infinite possibilities that are born of faith May you use those gifts that you have received and pass on the love that has been given to you May you be content knowing that you are a child of God Let His presence settle into your bones and allow your soul the freedom to sing dance and to bask in the sun It is there for each and every one of you Send this to others and witness the awesome power of

job with you In my job I review criminal and psychiatric files of imprisoned sex offenders who are approaching their release date I decide if they are likely to reoffend based on certain criteria and then civilly commit them to a sex offender treatment facility if I decide that they are at significant risk to reoffend I have read hundreds and hundreds of files and have taken note of some of the mistakes women make Let me preface this by saying that a woman is NEVER EVER EVER at fault for being raped or attacked but there are definitely ways to reduce your risk of being a victim Here are the most common mistakes women make that could result in them getting kidnapped attacked andor raped Getting into the attackers car when he pulls a gun and orders you to get into his vehicle Most attackers dont want to shoot you they want you to get into the car so that they can drive you to a deserted place and torture you Dont comply Run screaming It is MUCH more likely than not that he will just move on to an easier target Pulling over when a man drives alongside of you pointing at your car pretending something is wrong If this happens drive to the nearest welllit and populated gas station and look the car over yourself or ask an attendant Never pull over Believe it or not many women have fallen for this for fear of their car spontaneously exploding in the middle of the road Not likely Not locking your doors while driving I have read several cases where the attacker simply walks up to a womans car while shes at a traffic light and jumps in with his gun or knife drawn Opening your front door when you have not positively identified who is there If you dont have a peep hole get one Ive seen countless cases where the attacker gains access to his victims simply by knocking on their door Dont let an attacker get into your home He then has a private relatively soundproof place to attack you Not being alert in parking lots If you go to the grocery store at night dont be shy about asking for an escort to your car Too many women are abducted from parking lots or even raped in the parking lot Look in your back seat before entering your car Cars provide endless hiding places for attackers both inside them and in between them Be aware of your surroundings by looking to the left and right and behind you with your head up all the time You may appear paranoid and look funny to others but an attacker will think twice about approaching someone who appears so aware of whats going on Trusting a clean cut honest looking stranger I see mug shots of every sex offender in the state of Florida They do not look like monsters They often look like they could be your friendly grocer bank teller waiter neighbor clergy doctor etc They are every age between and and probably beyond Only a small minority actually look scary I just read a case yesterday of a man with only one leg who beat up his victim with his crutch before he raped her Who would have ever thought that a onelegged man could be a rapist Trusting people to be alone with your children This is a difficult one because child molesters end up being the LAST person the parents would believe is the molester Most of the child molesting cases I see involve the stepfather the uncle the sisters boyfriend the mothers boyfriend the grandfather the babysitter the neighbor the family friend the youth camp director day care worker etc Although rare even women can be molesters In every case the perpetrator is a nice guy trusting good with children and the family is baffled or even in disbelief that the person could be abusing their child When it comes to your children and grandchildren be suspicious of everyone no matter who they are And pay attention to what your child says and how heshe reacts to the mention of different people in their lives I didnt mean to make anyone uncomfortable with this but I am at work right now reviewing files and realized that this email is a way I can reach many women at one time I have the dirty job of reading all these files and it makes me feel good to know that I can share some inferences from what I have learned This is not an exhaustive list of what not to do but just some things that I have observed more than just a few times Pass this on to the women in your lives

some things I have learned in my job with you In my job I review criminal and psychiatric files of imprisoned sex offenders who are approaching their release date I decide if they are likely to reoffend based on certain criteria and then civilly commit them to a sex offender treatment facility if I decide that they are at significant risk to reoffend I have read hundreds and hundreds of files and have taken note of some of the mistakes women make Let me preface this by saying that a woman is NEVER EVER EVER at fault for being raped or attacked but there are definitely ways to reduce your risk of being a victim Here are the most common mistakes women make that could result in them getting kidnapped attacked andor raped Getting into the attackers car when he pulls a gun and orders you to get into his vehicle Most attackers dont want to shoot you they want you to get into the car so that they can drive you to a deserted place and torture you Dont comply Run screaming It is MUCH more likely than not that he will just move on to an easier target Pulling over when a man drives alongside of you pointing at your car pretending something is wrong If this happens drive to the nearest welllit and populated gas station and look the car over yourself or ask an attendant Never pull over Believe it or not many women have fallen for this for fear of their car spontaneously exploding in the middle of the road Not likely Not locking your doors while driving I have read several cases where the attacker simply walks up to a womans car while shes at a traffic light and jumps in with his gun or knife drawn Opening your front door when you have not positively identified who is there If you dont have a peep hole get one Ive seen countless cases where the attacker gains access to his victims simply by knocking on their door Dont let an attacker get into your home He then has a private relatively soundproof place to attack you Not being alert in parking lots If you go to the grocery store at night dont be shy about asking for an escort to your car Too many women are abducted from parking lots or even raped in the parking lot Look in your back seat before entering your car Cars provide endless hiding places for attackers both inside them and in between them Be aware of your surroundings by looking to the left and right and behind you with your head up all the time You may appear paranoid and look funny to others but an attacker will think twice about approaching someone who appears so aware of whats going on Trusting a clean cut honest looking stranger I see mug shots of every sex offender in the state of Florida They do not look like monsters They often look like they could be your friendly grocer bank teller waiter neighbor clergy doctor etc They are every age between and and probably beyond Only a small minority actually look scary I just read a case yesterday of a man with only one leg who beat up his victim with his crutch before he raped her Who would have ever thought that a onelegged man could be a rapist Trusting people to be alone with your children This is a difficult one because child molesters end up being the LAST person the parents would believe is the molester Most of the child molesting cases I see involve the stepfather the uncle the sisters boyfriend the mothers boyfriend the grandfather the babysitter the neighbor the family friend the youth camp director day care worker etc Although rare even women can be molesters In every case the perpetrator is a nice guy trusting good with children and the family is baffled or even in disbelief that the person could be abusing their child When it comes to your children and grandchildren be suspicious of everyone no matter who they are And pay attention to what your child says and how heshe reacts to the mention of different people in their lives I didnt mean to make anyone uncomfortable with this but I am at work right now reviewing files and realized that this email is a way I can reach many women at one time I have the dirty job of reading all these files and it makes me feel good to know that I can share some inferences from what I have learned This

LGMCOM cc Subject Tear jerker Get a tissue Like any good mother when Karen found out that another baby was on the way she did what she could o help her yearold son Michael prepare for a new sibling They found out that the new baby was going to be a girl and day after day night after night Michael sang to his sister in Mommys tummy He was building a bond of love with his little sister before he even met her The pregnancy progressed normally for Karen of Morristown Tennessee In time the labor pains came Soon it was every five minutes every three every minute But serious complications arose during delivery and Karen found herself in hours of labor Would a Csection be required Finally after a long struggle Michaels little sister was born But she was in very serious condition With a siren howling in the night the ambulance rushed the infant to the neonatal intensive care unit at St Marys Hospital Knoxville Tennessee The days inched by The little girl got worse The pediatrician had to tell the parents There is very little hope Be prepared for the worst Karen and her husband contacted a local cemetery about a burial plot They had fixed up a special room in their house for their new baby but now they found themselves having to plan for a funeral Michael however kept begging his parents to let him see his sister I want to sing to her he kept saying Week two in intensive care looked as if a funeral would come before the week was over Michael kept nagging about singing to his sister but kids are never allowed in Intensive Care Karen made up her mind though She would take Michael whether they liked it or not If he didnt see his sister right then he may never see her alive She dressed him in an oversized scrub suit and marched him into ICU He looked like a walking laundry basket But the head nurse recognized him as a child and bellowed Get that kid out of here now No children are allowed The mother rose up strong in Karen and the usually mildmannered lady glared steeleyed right into the head nurses face her lips a firm line He is not leaving until he sings to his sister Karen towed Michael to his sisters bedside He gazed at the tiny infant losing the battle to live After a moment he began to sing In the purehearted voice of a yearold Michael sang You are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are gray Instantly the baby girl seemed to respond The pulse rate began to calm down and become steady Keep on singing Michael encouraged Karen with tears in her eyes You never know dear how much I love you Please dont take my sunshine away As Michael sang to his sister the babys ragged strained breathing became as smooth as a kittens purr Keep on singing Sweetheart The other night dear as I lay sleeping I dreamed I held you in my arms Michaels little sister began to relax as rest healing restseemed to sweep over her Keep on singing Michael Tears had now conquered the face of the bossy head nurse Karen glowed You are my sunshine my only Sunshine Please dont take my sunshine away The next daythe very next daythe little girl was well enough to go home Womans Day Magazine called it The Miracle of a Brothers Song The medical staff just called it a miracle Karen called it a miracle of Gods love NEVER GIVE UP ON THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE LOVE IS SO INCREDIBLY POWERFUL Life is good Have a Wonderful Day This is the power of prayer at work Lets continue to pray for one another PRAYER May today there be peace within you May you trust God that you are exactly where you are meant to be May you not forget the infinite possibilities that are born of faith May you use those gifts that you have received and pass on the love that has been given to you May you be content knowing that you are a child of God Let His presence settle into your bones and allow your soul the freedom to sing dance and to bask in the sun It is there for each and every one of you Send this to others and witness the awesome power of prayer Also read Phil

nron Derick nron Warren nron Judy CT Leslie CT Judy CT cc Subject A Visitors Guide to Houston TX Forwarded by Angela BarnettHOUECT on PM Mary Westbrook on PM To Mabel Abrasley cc Subject A Visitors Guide to Houston TX A VISITORS GUIDE TO HOUSTON TX To enable our many visitors to cope with life in Americas Fourth Largest City First you must learn to pronounce the city name It is YEWSTUN and it does not matter how people pronounce it in other places Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere Houston has its own version of traffic rules Never forget that downtown Houston is composed entirely of one way streets The only way to get out of center of town is to turn around and start over when you reach Dallas Texas All directions start with Go down Westheimer Westheimer has no beginning and no end Its impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street you started on The Chamber of Commerce calls this a scenic drive The am rush hour is from to am The pm rush hour is from to pm Fridays rush hour starts on Thursday morning If you actually stop at a yellow light you cannot be from Houston Reversible Lanes are not understood by anybody Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native so do not attempt the phonetic pronunciation People will simply tilt their heads to the right and stare at you The falling of one raindrop or God forbid one snowflake causes all traffic to immediately cease so will daylight savings time and a girl applying eye shadow across the street or a flat tire three lanes over Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life and a permanent form of entertainment Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phraseOh were in Montrose Construction crews arent doing their job properly unless they close down all lanes except one during rush hour If someone actually has their turn signal on it was probably left on at the factory where the car was made Understand that the pound woman driving the Ford Excursion the largest vehicle ever produced absolutely MUST come to a complete stop then proceed at mph over any railroad track Whats the deal This vehicle was built to invade small countries and shes worried about the railroad tracks All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln Continentals have the right of way The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a legal right to turn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right lane YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey any known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop signs Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since there is absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to avoid major road construction Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since the termination or continuation of any street is entirely at the discretion of the Streets Department of the City It has been determined that the length of any street on any given day is a mystery known only to Higher Powers in the department and it is rumored that they do not speak to mere mortals Asking directions will help you get acquainted with the numerous recent residents of an amazing ethnic diversity It will be not help at all for finding the address you seek If searching for a street on the southwest side of Houston a knowledge of Chinese Korean or Vietnamese is somewhere between helpful and mandatory since the street signs are printed in one of these languages along with English However often the English name for the street has been removed Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered species list The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled environment for their own safety Sir and Maam are used by the person speaking to you if theres a remote possibility that youre at least minutes older than they are You can safely address anyone as Sir or Maam in Houston as in other southern cities Sugar is a more common form of address than Miss So is Honey Do not take offence This is how southerners address grown women In Houston we drink Coca Cola and Dr Pepper It is rumored that other soft drinks are sold here but no one will admit to knowing anyone who actually drinks them So dont ask for any other soft drink What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental Airport Your arrival gate is at least miles away from the Main Concourse of any terminal Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes are advised Wherever you are going will be on the other side of town When attempting to cross Houston assume the trip will take a minimum of hours and can take as long as hours If attempting to cross Houston via the freeway system it is advisable to carry a supply of Coca Cola water a few sandwiches and something to read while waiting on the freeway for the traffic jam to clear Some moderately fast readers have been known to read a page novel during the course of one traffic jam If attempting to cross Houston during rush hour additional provisions are advisable Never get on a Houston freeway without taking a restroom break first It may be a long time to the next break Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic The bumpersticker that reads Keep honking Im reloading is considered fair warning Do You Yahoo Get Yahoo Mail Free email you can access from anywhere

daughter Kathleen was too young to seriously date but she had a boyfriend One evening when I was leaving to pick up my son Paul from baseball practice she asked if she could just go with her boyfriend to pick up his little brother at a friends house She said they would come right back I said All right just make sure you wear your seat belt and come right home It was my fathers birthday and my youngest daughterTherese was already at my fathers house waiting for us to come over with the cake I had yet to pick up at the store I left to pick Paul up at school but decided to take the highway rather than the shortcut along the back roads After leaving the school Paul and I ran in the store for the cake and some last minute goodies As we were getting into the car we heard and saw paramedics fire trucks three ambulances and of course a multitude of police cars I got a sick feeling in my stomach and said to Paul Somebody needs our prayers quick I wondered if there was a fire or a bad car accident At one of the intersections I had to stop to let more emergency vehicles through and prayed Lord those people need you right now go to them and place your protective hand over them We stopped at my parents to drop off the food before going home to pick up Kathleen but my father met me at the car and told us to postpone the Party because Therese had fallen asleep Which way did you go to the school he asked Because there was a bad accident on the back road I heard someone was killed It happened just about the time you had to pick up Paul at the school and I know you always go that way I was so happy to see you pull in I had a gut feeling it was you As Paul and I drove the short distance home I could see our house was dark and when Kathleen is home alone she always burned every light As I turned off the ignition tears fell It was Kathleen I told Paul I know it I ran in the house and checked our answering machine no one had called I breathed a sigh of relief thinking that someone would have called by now Paranoid thats what Kathleen always called me and thats what I was telling myself Youre just paranoid Then the phone rang It was her friends mother who worked in the emergency room of our local hospital She only told me that the three of them were in an accident and were being transported to the hospital I didnt call my husband at work or my parents Paul and I just left for the hospital As I pulled into the parking lot one of the paramedics someone we have known for years met us at our car Im sorry Im so sorry he said with tears streaming down his face The next thing I remember after was talking to the doctor in the hallway of the ER He asked me if I believed in God and with that my knees gave way No he said you dont understand do you believe in divine intervention I stammered a weak Yes Not having a clue what he was talking about He smiled at me and asked Do you know what shirt your daughter was wearing tonight Nodding no he told me to go down the hall and look Your daughter is blessed with angels and so are you From what the emergency personnel told me there is no way that your daughter should be alive let alone only have a few scratches Kathleen was laying on a cart waiting for more xrays When I got to her we both sobbed As I was hugging her I had the urge to check her shirt unzipping her jacket I read the words Jesus Saves I knew then what the doctor had meant All three were treated and released On the way home that night Kathleen told this story It was really weird about a quarter of a mile before the accident I said Wait we forgot to put our seatbelts on my Mother will kill me Then a car was coming towards us in our lane he swerved and I knew we got hit on the passenger side of the car where I was sitting We got hit a total of three times because the car kept spinning in a circle I felt his little brothers hand on my shoulder holding me lightly in place But Mom after it was all over I could still feel the hand on my shoulder I looked and his little brother had flown out the back window of the car as we later found out on the first spin It was an angelMomI know it I knew it too especially when we went the next day to look at the car it had been split in half right underneath my daughters seat The driver of the other car witnesses said was traveling miles Per hour and the point of impact at that speed was directly at Kathleens door The police report stated that the car door was found fifty feet away from the accident scene with the seat belt attached So when the door broke loose the hand was the only thing that saved my daughters life The Lord knew long before I did that my child was in trouble and I will always praise Him for saving her life and restoring mine I have been meaning to write this story for the past couple years Kathleen just turned While I was writing this I smiled and cried its all true Father I ask you to bless my friend reading this right now Lord show them a new revelation of Your love and power Holy Spirit I ask You to minister to their spirit at this very moment Where there is pain give them Your peace mercy Where there is selfdoubting release a renewed confidence in Your ability to work through them Where there is tiredness or exhaustion I ask You to give them understanding patience strength as they learn submission to Your leading Where there is spiritual stagnation I ask You to renew them by revealing Your nearness and by drawing them into greater intimacy with You Where there is fear reveal Your love and release to them Your courage Where there is a sin blocking them reveal it and break its hold over my friends life Bless their finances give them greater vision and raise up leaders and friends to support and encourage them Give each of them discernment to recognize the demonic forces around them and reveal to them the power they have in You to defeat it I ask You to do these things in Jesusname In Christian love Your Friend in Jesus Passing this on to

toward home The thought of being followed made her heart beat faster Youre being silly she told herself no one is following you To be safe she began to walk faster but the footsteps kept up with her pace She was afraid to look back and she was glad she was almost home Shannon said a quick prayer God please get me home safe She saw the porch light burning and ran the rest of the way to her house Once inside she leaned against the door for a moment relieved to be in the safety of her home She glanced out the window to see if anyone was there The sidewalk was empty After tossing her books on the sofa she decided to grab a snack and get online She logged on under her screen name ByAngel She checked her Buddy List and saw GoTo was on She sent him an instant message ByAngel Hi Im glad you are on I thought someone was following me home today It was really weird GoTo LOL You watch too much TV Why would someone be following you Dont you live in a safe neighborhood ByAngel Of course I do LOL I guess it was my imagination cuz I didnt see anybody when I looked out GoTo Unless you gave your name out online You havent done that have you ByAngel Of course not Im not stupid you know GoTo Did you have a softball game after school today ByAngel Yes and we won GoTo Thats great Who did you play ByAngel We played the Hornets LOL Their uniforms are so gross They look like bees LOL GoTo What is your team called ByAngel We are the Canton Cats We have tiger paws on our uniforms They are really kewl GoTo Did you pitch ByAngel No I play second base I got to go My homework has to be done before my parents get home I dont want them mad at me Bye GoTo Catch you later Bye Meanwhile GoTo went to the member menu and began to search for her profile When it came up he highlighted it and printed it out He took out a pen and began to write down what he knew about Angel so far Her name Shannon Birthday Jan Age State where she lived North Carolina Hobbies softball chorus skating and going to the mall Besides this information he knew she lived in Canton because she had just told him He knew she stayed by herself until pm every afternoon until her parents came home from work He knew she played softball on Thursday afternoons on the school team and the team was named the Canton Cats Her favorite number was printed on her jersey He knew she was in the seventh grade at the Canton Junior High School She had told him all this in the conversations they had online He had enough information to find her now Shannon didnt tell her parents about the incident on the way home from the ball park that day She didnt want them to make a scene and stop her from walking home from the softball games Parents were always overreacting and hers were the worst It made her wish she was not an only child Maybe if she had brothers and sisters her parents wouldnt be so overprotective By Thursday Shannon had forgotten about the footsteps following her Her game was in full swing when suddenly she felt someone staring at her It was then that the memory came back She glanced up from her second base position to see a man watching her closely He was leaning against the fence behind first base and he smiled when she looked at him He didnt look scary and she quickly dismissed the fear she had felt After the game he sat on a bleacher while she talked to the coach She noticed his smile once again as she walked past him He nodded and she smiled back He noticed her name on the back of her shirt He knew he had found her Quietly he walked a safe distance behind her It was only a few blocks to Shannons home and once he saw where she lived he quickly returned to the park to get his car Now he had to wait He decided to get a bite to eat until the time came to go to Shannons house He drove to a fast food restaurant and sat there until time to make his move Shannon was in her room later that evening when she heard voices in the living room Shannon come here her father called He sounded upset and she couldnt imagine why She went into the room to see the man from the ballpark sitting on the sofa Sit down her father began this man has just told us a most interesting story about you Shannon moved cautiously to a chair across from the man How could he tell her parents anything She had never seen him before today Do you know who I am Shannon The man asked No Shannon answered I am a police officer and your online friend GoTo Shannon was stunned Thats impossible GoTo is a kid my age Hes and he lives in Michigan The man smiled I know I told you all that but it wasnt true You see Shannon there are people on line who pretend to be kids I was one of them But while others do it to find kids and hurt them I belong to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from predators I came here to find you to teach you how dangerous it is to give out too much information to people online You told me enough about yourself to make it easy for me to find you Your name the school you went to the name of your ball team and the position you played The number and name on your jersey just made finding you a breeze Shannon was stunned You mean you dont live in Michigan He laughed No I live in Raleigh It made you feel safe to think I was so far away didnt it She nodded I had a friend whose daughter was like you Only she wasnt as lucky The guy found her and murdered her while she was home alone Kids are taught not to tell anyone when they are alone yet they do it all the time online The wrong people trick you into giving out information a little here and there online Before you know it you have told them enough for them to find you without even realizing you have done it I hope youve learned a lesson from this and wont do it again I wont Shannon promised solemnly Will you tell others about this so they will be safe too Its a promise

Guide to Houston TX A VISITORS GUIDE TO HOUSTON TX To enable our many visitors to cope with life in Americas Fourth Largest City First you must learn to pronounce the city name It is YEWSTUN and it does not matter how people pronounce it in other places Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere Houston has its own version of traffic rules Never forget that downtown Houston is composed entirely of one way streets The only way to get out of center of town is to turn around and start over when you reach Dallas Texas All directions start with Go down Westheimer Westheimer has no beginning and no end Its impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street you started on The Chamber of Commerce calls this a scenic drive The am rush hour is from to am The pm rush hour is from to pm Fridays rush hour starts on Thursday morning If you actually stop at a yellow light you cannot be from Houston Reversible Lanes are not understood by anybody Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native so do not attempt the phonetic pronunciation People will simply tilt their heads to the right and stare at you The falling of one raindrop or God forbid one snowflake causes all traffic to immediately cease so will daylight savings time and a girl applying eye shadow across the street or a flat tire three lanes over Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life and a permanent form of entertainment Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phraseOh were in Montrose Construction crews arent doing their job properly unless they close down all lanes except one during rush hour If someone actually has their turn signal on it was probably left on at the factory where the car was made Understand that the pound woman driving the Ford Excursion the largest vehicle ever produced absolutely MUST come to a complete stop then proceed at mph over any railroad track Whats the deal This vehicle was built to invade small countries and shes worried about the railroad tracks All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln Continentals have the right of way The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a legal right to turn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right lane YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey any known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop signs Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since there is absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to avoid major road construction Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money since the termination or continuation of any street is entirely at the discretion of the Streets Department of the City It has been determined that the length of any street on any given day is a mystery known only to Higher Powers in the department and it is rumored that they do not speak to mere mortals Asking directions will help you get acquainted with the numerous recent residents of an amazing ethnic diversity It will be not help at all for finding the address you seek If searching for a street on the southwest side of Houston a knowledge of Chinese Korean or Vietnamese is somewhere between helpful and mandatory since the street signs are printed in one of these languages along with English However often the English name for the street has been removed Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered species list The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled environment for their own safety Sir and Maam are used by the person speaking to you if theres a remote possibility that youre at least minutes older than they are You can safely address anyone as Sir or Maam in Houston as in other southern cities Sugar is a more common form of address than Miss So is Honey Do not take offence This is how southerners address grown women In Houston we drink Coca Cola and Dr Pepper It is rumored that other soft drinks are sold here but no one will admit to knowing anyone who actually drinks them So dont ask for any other soft drink What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental Airport Your arrival gate is at least miles away from the Main Concourse of any terminal Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes are advised Wherever you are going will be on the other side of town When attempting to cross Houston assume the trip will take a minimum of hours and can take as long as hours If attempting to cross Houston via the freeway system it is advisable to carry a supply of Coca Cola water a few sandwiches and something to read while waiting on the freeway for the traffic jam to clear Some moderately fast readers have been known to read a page novel during the course of one traffic jam If attempting to cross Houston during rush hour additional provisions are advisable Never get on a Houston freeway without taking a restroom break first It may be a long time to the next break Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic The bumpersticker that reads Keep honking Im reloading is considered fair warning Do You Yahoo Get Yahoo Mail Free email you can access from anywhere

LGMCOM cc Subject Tear jerker Get a tissue Like any good mother when Karen found out that another baby was on the way she did what she could o help her yearold son Michael prepare for a new sibling They found out that the new baby was going to be a girl and day after day night after night Michael sang to his sister in Mommys tummy He was building a bond of love with his little sister before he even met her The pregnancy progressed normally for Karen of Morristown Tennessee In time the labor pains came Soon it was every five minutes every three every minute But serious complications arose during delivery and Karen found herself in hours of labor Would a Csection be required Finally after a long struggle Michaels little sister was born But she was in very serious condition With a siren howling in the night the ambulance rushed the infant to the neonatal intensive care unit at St Marys Hospital Knoxville Tennessee The days inched by The little girl got worse The pediatrician had to tell the parents There is very little hope Be prepared for the worst Karen and her husband contacted a local cemetery about a burial plot They had fixed up a special room in their house for their new baby but now they found themselves having to plan for a funeral Michael however kept begging his parents to let him see his sister I want to sing to her he kept saying Week two in intensive care looked as if a funeral would come before the week was over Michael kept nagging about singing to his sister but kids are never allowed in Intensive Care Karen made up her mind though She would take Michael whether they liked it or not If he didnt see his sister right then he may never see her alive She dressed him in an oversized scrub suit and marched him into ICU He looked like a walking laundry basket But the head nurse recognized him as a child and bellowed Get that kid out of here now No children are allowed The mother rose up strong in Karen and the usually mildmannered lady glared steeleyed right into the head nurses face her lips a firm line He is not leaving until he sings to his sister Karen towed Michael to his sisters bedside He gazed at the tiny infant losing the battle to live After a moment he began to sing In the purehearted voice of a yearold Michael sang You are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are gray Instantly the baby girl seemed to respond The pulse rate began to calm down and become steady Keep on singing Michael encouraged Karen with tears in her eyes You never know dear how much I love you Please dont take my sunshine away As Michael sang to his sister the babys ragged strained breathing became as smooth as a kittens purr Keep on singing Sweetheart The other night dear as I lay sleeping I dreamed I held you in my arms Michaels little sister began to relax as rest healing restseemed to sweep over her Keep on singing Michael Tears had now conquered the face of the bossy head nurse Karen glowed You are my sunshine my only Sunshine Please dont take my sunshine away The next daythe very next daythe little girl was well enough to go home Womans Day Magazine called it The Miracle of a Brothers Song The medical staff just called it a miracle Karen called it a miracle of Gods love NEVER GIVE UP ON THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE LOVE IS SO INCREDIBLY POWERFUL Life is good Have a Wonderful Day This is the power of prayer at work Lets continue to pray for one another PRAYER May today there be peace within you May you trust God that you are exactly where you are meant to be May you not forget the infinite possibilities that are born of faith May you use those gifts that you have received and pass on the love that has been given to you May you be content knowing that you are a child of God Let His presence settle into your bones and allow your soul the freedom to sing dance and to bask in the sun It is there for each and every one of you Send this to others and witness the awesome power of prayer Also read Phil

job with you In my job I review criminal and psychiatric files of imprisoned sex offenders who are approaching their release date I decide if they are likely to reoffend based on certain criteria and then civilly commit them to a sex offender treatment facility if I decide that they are at significant risk to reoffend I have read hundreds and hundreds of files and have taken note of some of the mistakes women make Let me preface this by saying that a woman is NEVER EVER EVER at fault for being raped or attacked but there are definitely ways to reduce your risk of being a victim Here are the most common mistakes women make that could result in them getting kidnapped attacked andor raped Getting into the attackers car when he pulls a gun and orders you to get into his vehicle Most attackers dont want to shoot you they want you to get into the car so that they can drive you to a deserted place and torture you Dont comply Run screaming It is MUCH more likely than not that he will just move on to an easier target Pulling over when a man drives alongside of you pointing at your car pretending something is wrong If this happens drive to the nearest welllit and populated gas station and look the car over yourself or ask an attendant Never pull over Believe it or not many women have fallen for this for fear of their car spontaneously exploding in the middle of the road Not likely Not locking your doors while driving I have read several cases where the attacker simply walks up to a womans car while shes at a traffic light and jumps in with his gun or knife drawn Opening your front door when you have not positively identified who is there If you dont have a peep hole get one Ive seen countless cases where the attacker gains access to his victims simply by knocking on their door Dont let an attacker get into your home He then has a private relatively soundproof place to attack you Not being alert in parking lots If you go to the grocery store at night dont be shy about asking for an escort to your car Too many women are abducted from parking lots or even raped in the parking lot Look in your back seat before entering your car Cars provide endless hiding places for attackers both inside them and in between them Be aware of your surroundings by looking to the left and right and behind you with your head up all the time You may appear paranoid and look funny to others but an attacker will think twice about approaching someone who appears so aware of whats going on Trusting a clean cut honest looking stranger I see mug shots of every sex offender in the state of Florida They do not look like monsters They often look like they could be your friendly grocer bank teller waiter neighbor clergy doctor etc They are every age between and and probably beyond Only a small minority actually look scary I just read a case yesterday of a man with only one leg who beat up his victim with his crutch before he raped her Who would have ever thought that a onelegged man could be a rapist Trusting people to be alone with your children This is a difficult one because child molesters end up being the LAST person the parents would believe is the molester Most of the child molesting cases I see involve the stepfather the uncle the sisters boyfriend the mothers boyfriend the grandfather the babysitter the neighbor the family friend the youth camp director day care worker etc Although rare even women can be molesters In every case the perpetrator is a nice guy trusting good with children and the family is baffled or even in disbelief that the person could be abusing their child When it comes to your children and grandchildren be suspicious of everyone no matter who they are And pay attention to what your child says and how heshe reacts to the mention of different people in their lives I didnt mean to make anyone uncomfortable with this but I am at work right now reviewing files and realized that this email is a way I can reach many women at one time I have the dirty job of reading all these files and it makes me feel good to know that I can share some inferences from what I have learned This is not an exhaustive list of what not to do but just some things that I have observed more than just a few times Pass this on to the women in your lives

you probably already know about the pitfalls traps and predators on the internet but this is something to consider for your children and families This story is something those of you with children who are home alone andor enjoy chat rooms talk groups buddy lists etc should be aware of Share this with others you think would benefit Thanks Shannon could hear the footsteps behind her as she walked toward home The thought of being followed made her heart beat faster Youre being silly she told herself no one is following you To be safe she began to walk faster but the footsteps kept up with her pace She was afraid to look back and she was glad she was almost home Shannon said a quick prayer God please get me home safe She saw the porch light burning and ran the rest of the way to her house Once inside she leaned against the door for a moment relieved to be in the safety of her home She glanced out the window to see if anyone was there The sidewalk was empty After tossing her books on the sofa she decided to grab a snack and get online She logged on under her screen name ByAngel She checked her Buddy List and saw GoTo was on She sent him an instant message ByAngel Hi Im glad you are on I thought someone was following me home today It was really weird GoTo LOL You watch too much TV Why would someone be following you Dont you live in a safe neighborhood ByAngel Of course I do LOL I guess it was my imagination cuz I didnt see anybody when I looked out GoTo Unless you gave your name out online You havent done that have you ByAngel Of course not Im not stupid you know GoTo Did you have a softball game after school today ByAngel Yes and we won GoTo Thats great Who did you play ByAngel We played the Hornets LOL Their uniforms are so gross They look like bees LOL GoTo What is your team called ByAngel We are the Canton Cats We have tiger paws on our uniforms They are really kewl GoTo Did you pitch ByAngel No I play second base I got to go My homework has to be done before my parents get home I dont want them mad at me Bye GoTo Catch you later Bye Meanwhile GoTo went to the member menu and began to search for her profile When it came up he highlighted it and printed it out He took out a pen and began to write down what he knew about Angel so far Her name Shannon Birthday Jan Age State where she lived North Carolina Hobbies softball chorus skating and going to the mall Besides this information he knew she lived in Canton because she had just told him He knew she stayed by herself until pm every afternoon until her parents came home from work He knew she played softball on Thursday afternoons on the school team and the team was named the Canton Cats Her favorite number was printed on her jersey He knew she was in the seventh grade at the Canton Junior High School She had told him all this in the conversations they had online He had enough information to find her now Shannon didnt tell her parents about the incident on the way home from the ball park that day She didnt want them to make a scene and stop her from walking home from the softball games Parents were always overreacting and hers were the worst It made her wish she was not an only child Maybe if she had brothers and sisters her parents wouldnt be so overprotective By Thursday Shannon had forgotten about the footsteps following her Her game was in full swing when suddenly she felt someone staring at her It was then that the memory came back She glanced up from her second base position to see a man watching her closely He was leaning against the fence behind first base and he smiled when she looked at him He didnt look scary and she quickly dismissed the fear she had felt After the game he sat on a bleacher while she talked to the coach She noticed his smile once again as she walked past him He nodded and she smiled back He noticed her name on the back of her shirt He knew he had found her Quietly he walked a safe distance behind her It was only a few blocks to Shannons home and once he saw where she lived he quickly returned to the park to get his car Now he had to wait He decided to get a bite to eat until the time came to go to Shannons house He drove to a fast food restaurant and sat there until time to make his move Shannon was in her room later that evening when she heard voices in the living room Shannon come here her father called He sounded upset and she couldnt imagine why She went into the room to see the man from the ballpark sitting on the sofa Sit down her father began this man has just told us a most interesting story about you Shannon moved cautiously to a chair across from the man How could he tell her parents anything She had never seen him before today Do you know who I am Shannon The man asked No Shannon answered I am a police officer and your online friend GoTo Shannon was stunned Thats impossible GoTo is a kid my age Hes and he lives in Michigan The man smiled I know I told you all that but it wasnt true You see Shannon there are people on line who pretend to be kids I was one of them But while others do it to find kids and hurt them I belong to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from predators I came here to find you to teach you how dangerous it is to give out too much information to people online You told me enough about yourself to make it easy for me to find you Your name the school you went to the name of your ball team and the position you played The number and name on your jersey just made finding you a breeze Shannon was stunned You mean you dont live in Michigan He laughed No I live in Raleigh It made you feel safe to think I was so far away didnt it She nodded I had a friend whose daughter was like you Only she wasnt as lucky The guy found her and murdered her while she was home alone Kids are taught not to tell anyone when they are alone yet they do it all the time online The wrong people trick you into giving out information a little here and there online Before you know it you have told them enough for them to find you without even realizing you have done it I hope youve learned a lesson from this and wont do it again I wont Shannon promised solemnly Will you tell others about this so they will be safe too Its a promise

daughter Kathleen was too young to seriously date but she had a boyfriend One evening when I was leaving to pick up my son Paul from baseball practice she asked if she could just go with her boyfriend to pick up his little brother at a friends house She said they would come right back I said All right just make sure you wear your seat belt and come right home It was my fathers birthday and my youngest daughterTherese was already at my fathers house waiting for us to come over with the cake I had yet to pick up at the store I left to pick Paul up at school but decided to take the highway rather than the shortcut along the back roads After leaving the school Paul and I ran in the store for the cake and some last minute goodies As we were getting into the car we heard and saw paramedics fire trucks three ambulances and of course a multitude of police cars I got a sick feeling in my stomach and said to Paul Somebody needs our prayers quick I wondered if there was a fire or a bad car accident At one of the intersections I had to stop to let more emergency vehicles through and prayed Lord those people need you right now go to them and place your protective hand over them We stopped at my parents to drop off the food before going home to pick up Kathleen but my father met me at the car and told us to postpone the Party because Therese had fallen asleep Which way did you go to the school he asked Because there was a bad accident on the back road I heard someone was killed It happened just about the time you had to pick up Paul at the school and I know you always go that way I was so happy to see you pull in I had a gut feeling it was you As Paul and I drove the short distance home I could see our house was dark and when Kathleen is home alone she always burned every light As I turned off the ignition tears fell It was Kathleen I told Paul I know it I ran in the house and checked our answering machine no one had called I breathed a sigh of relief thinking that someone would have called by now Paranoid thats what Kathleen always called me and thats what I was telling myself Youre just paranoid Then the phone rang It was her friends mother who worked in the emergency room of our local hospital She only told me that the three of them were in an accident and were being transported to the hospital I didnt call my husband at work or my parents Paul and I just left for the hospital As I pulled into the parking lot one of the paramedics someone we have known for years met us at our car Im sorry Im so sorry he said with tears streaming down his face The next thing I remember after was talking to the doctor in the hallway of the ER He asked me if I believed in God and with that my knees gave way No he said you dont understand do you believe in divine intervention I stammered a weak Yes Not having a clue what he was talking about He smiled at me and asked Do you know what shirt your daughter was wearing tonight Nodding no he told me to go down the hall and look Your daughter is blessed with angels and so are you From what the emergency personnel told me there is no way that your daughter should be alive let alone only have a few scratches Kathleen was laying on a cart waiting for more xrays When I got to her we both sobbed As I was hugging her I had the urge to check her shirt unzipping her jacket I read the words Jesus Saves I knew then what the doctor had meant All three were treated and released On the way home that night Kathleen told this story It was really weird about a quarter of a mile before the accident I said Wait we forgot to put our seatbelts on my Mother will kill me Then a car was coming towards us in our lane he swerved and I knew we got hit on the passenger side of the car where I was sitting We got hit a total of three times because the car kept spinning in a circle I felt his little brothers hand on my shoulder holding me lightly in place But Mom after it was all over I could still feel the hand on my shoulder I looked and his little brother had flown out the back window of the car as we later found out on the first spin It was an angelMomI know it I knew it too especially when we went the next day to look at the car it had been split in half right underneath my daughters seat The driver of the other car witnesses said was traveling miles Per hour and the point of impact at that speed was directly at Kathleens door The police report stated that the car door was found fifty feet away from the accident scene with the seat belt attached So when the door broke loose the hand was the only thing that saved my daughters life The Lord knew long before I did that my child was in trouble and I will always praise Him for saving her life and restoring mine I have been meaning to write this story for the past couple years Kathleen just turned While I was writing this I smiled and cried its all true Father I ask you to bless my friend reading this right now Lord show them a new revelation of Your love and power Holy Spirit I ask You to minister to their spirit at this very moment Where there is pain give them Your peace mercy Where there is selfdoubting release a renewed confidence in Your ability to work through them Where there is tiredness or exhaustion I ask You to give them understanding patience strength as they learn submission to Your leading Where there is spiritual stagnation I ask You to renew them by revealing Your nearness and by drawing them into greater intimacy with You Where there is fear reveal Your love and release to them Your courage Where there is a sin blocking them

choice and your advice to me was right as the party finally ended and the kids drove out of sight I got into my car sure to get home in one piece I never knew what was coming Mom something I expected least Now Im lying on the pavement And I hear the policeman say The kid that caused this wreck was drunk Mom His voice seems far away My own bloods all around me as I try hard not to cry I can hear the paramedic say This girl is going to die Im sure the guy had no idea while he was flying high because he chose to drink and drive now I would have to die So why do people do it Mom Knowing that it ruins lives And now the pain is cutting me like a hundred stabbing knives Tell sister not to be afraid Mom tell daddy to be brave and when I go to heaven put Daddys Girl on my grave Someone should have taught him that its wrong to drink and drive Maybe if his parents had Id still be alive My breath is getting shorter Mom Im getting really scared These are my final moments and Im so unprepared I
