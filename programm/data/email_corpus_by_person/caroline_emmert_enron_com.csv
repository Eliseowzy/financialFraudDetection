Deviation and discovered that the change made did not solve the rate problem I then analyzed all of the formulas that calculate the volume and the associated rate to use retrieved some sample Load Schedules and Meter data to use in testing and have made the right corrections to a copy of SettleTenMinutexls SettleTenMinuteupdatecmexls I ran a test day and verified that the Load Deviation piece is now using the correct volume and applying the appropriate rate I have also verified that we have the right formulas in place for Import Deviation for both volume and rate These correct formulas are in the copied workbook Since these were incorrect I researched the results that we obtain using SettleSupplemental and discovered that the formula that determines which rate is applied had the cell references backwards where the result should have been the Inc it returned the Dec instead and vice versa I reversed them in a copy of SettleSupp SettleSupplementalIncDecreversalcmexls ran a test day and confirmed that the resulting volumes and rates are correct I also took a quick look into the formulas for SettleAncillary and found no inconsistencies Fortunately since that is the tool that created all of the SCL charges I have all of these documented if you want to go over them The upshot is that in order to restate our actualization for and hence total I need to rerun Settle for the month of September for charge types and only as well as SettleSupplemental I will be using the copied workbooks until everyone has tested them and they are changed to the originals I am going to kick
