attached of interest Michael Matthews Salomon Smith Barney First Vice President Investments Portfolio Manager International Drive Suite Memphis TN Words cannot begin to describe our feelings at this moment or our concern for the safety of so many of our friends and colleagues placed at risk in the recent terrorist attacks We know that all of our thoughts hopes and prayers go out to all the victims and their families At this time we are cautiously relieved to hear that there have been no reported injuries to Citigroup employees As you may have seen in media reports our facilities located at Seven World Trade Center were destroyed We have been told by Citigroup Asset Management senior management that preexisting business continuation plans for offices located in lower Manhattan have been put in place They expect to resume operations as the exchanges and markets reopen Displaced staff has already been relocated to designated Citigroup offices in midtown Manhattan New Jersey and Connecticut Please rest assured that your assets are safe and that they will be properly and continuously managed by the portfolio managers of Smith Barney Asset Management and Salomon Brothers Asset Management The days ahead for all of us will be difficult Please feel free to call us with any questions you may have As always we appreciate the opportunity to be of service to you Best Regards Jerrold Graber Michael Matthews Scott Notowich Sr Vice PresInvestments st Vice PresInvestments st Vice PresInvestments Financial Consultant Financial Consultant Financial Consultant We thought you would be interested in seeing Equity Strategist view for the markets As we await the reopening of the US equity markets it seems to be a good time to reflect on some of the fundamental and technical issues we will have to confront in the weeks ahead To say that the future is unclear is to state the obvious We must examine the information currently available make suppositions about the likelihood of future events and structure our portfolios in a way most likely to exploit short term market inefficiencies and take advantage of our long term strategic views To us there are at least five issues which will influence the course of the economy and markets in the time ahead The effects of global liquidity consumer confidence and energy prices should determine a great deal of the equity markets direction and internal dynamics In addition the fundamental and market performance of the Technology and Financial sectors should have an impact beyond their normal sphere of influence Global Liquidity We believe that the Government will try to make individuals and institutions as whole as possible Clearly Washington does not want a financial panic to exacerbate the physical damage already done We believe that the Federal Reserve will effectively make unlimited liquidity available to the system as they have done during prior crises Additionally the Executive and Legislative branches appear ready to provide fiscal assistance as needed We should assume that the Government will behave rationally and apply the techniques used successfully in the past These actions would tend to be supportive to the markets While the European Central Bank has stated that no easing is imminent they obviously are ready to inject liquidity on an asneeded basis Consumer Confidence Clearly the Consumer will be negatively impacted in the short run by recent events Obviously air travel and lodging will feel an immediate impact However the key questions are how much will the consumer be effected and for how long We note that following the Crash of Wall Street predicted a dramatic consumer slowdown which did not materialize We do not intend to draw direct analogies to but would merely point out that predictions of Consumer collapse have proved to be unreliable While some slowdown will inevitably result from the catastrophe one must remain aware of the Consumers inherent resilience and the potential offset of the fiscal and monetary stimulus discussed above While we do not wish to minimize this potential problem we believe that it must be viewed in a broader historical context Oil Prices Early indications are that responsible oil producing nations will not move to seriously curtail production or shipments While nothing can be ruled out it is hard to say that the perceived risk to worldwide oil supplies will necessarily result in higher oil prices This is important The absence of a price spike would significantly differentiate today from the precedent Then the risk of inflation affected the Feds ability to rapidly lower rates and offset the price rises In higher energy prices undoubtedly contributed to the subsequent recession and the Feds decision not to immediately cut rates adversely impacted the Consumer We must indeed ask ourselves if the risk to the worlds oil supplies is significantly greater today than it was a week ago Technology and Communication Services Surprisingly Technology was one of the better performing areas in the European markets in the days immediately after the tragedy While one does not want to read too much into this a logical progression of events could help the groups fundamentals in the months ahead Initially much of the infrastructure damage done will have to be undone After any disaster the first response is to replace or repair that which has been damaged This could provide a shortterm boost in spending Longerterm there will likely be a need for increased spending on bandwidth backup recovery systems storage and communications systems In recent months many corporations have deferred technology expenditures This weeks events may accelerate the resumption of meaningful technology spending lending a much needed boost to the group Financials Financial Services companies are obviously adversely affected by recent developments Existing concerns have been heightened by these events Insurers face the potential of massive claims Banks and brokers face potential credit concerns and the impact of distracted capital markets However as mentioned earlier we anticipate that the Fed will be injecting needed liquidity It would be rare indeed for Financials to fare poorly while such an easing is underway A healthy financial system is essential to our country as well as the world Investors while recognizing the damage done should also be aware of the potential benefits of impending remedies OLEObj Michael Matthews Salomon Smith Barney First Vice President Investments Portfolio Manager
