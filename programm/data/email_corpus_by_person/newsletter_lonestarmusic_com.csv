Artist of the Month The Groobees The Groobees are a Texas music band in just about every sense of the term as well as the words within it First of all they are one of those musical units that is genuinely a band One can hear the interplay and feel the unity in the melodies and grooves they create together When it comes to being musical The Groobees not only offer a vast range of instrumental accents lacing accordion mandolin and banjo over guitarsboth electric and acoustic keyboards bass and drums but create songs that carry stories imagery emotions and meaning in the lyrics along with giving each player the room to shine And while they may not sing about such overworked Lone Star State subjects as beer dancehalls and twostepping The Groobees do reflect the breadth and depth of the music found in Texas flavoring their songs with elements of rock country folk pop blues and more And getting back to just how much The Groobees are a genuine band that fact is also revealed in how all

Gathering Labor Day Weekend Tell a friend about LoneStarMusiccom Support LoneStarMusiccom Artist of the Month Ray Wylie Hubbard Written by Richard Skanse The guitar had seen better days when Ray Wylie Hubbard happened upon it It was an old Regal far from a top of the line brand even its day but surely it deserved better than this reduced to a planter in the back corner of a little store somewhere in Arkansas They had plants in it Hubbard laughs because the whole bottom part of it was curled up and gone because itd been washed away in a flood Nonetheless Hubbard thought it was pretty neat and when the shop owner asked him if wanted it he said yeah The owner shipped it to Hubbard who with the help of a friend brought the instrument back to life Ill be amazed if the things not incredible marvels Hubbard over the phone from his log cabin home in Wimberley Regals were kind of the bottom end of guitars back then pretty cheap but its funky its real warm and its got a great neck on it It had to have belonged to a blind musician because on the neck there are these notches on the third fifth seventh and ninth fret and the only thing we could figure out was that if you were blind that way you would know what fret you were on Im getting ready to paint the top of it black and put a rose decal on it and then it will be done Hubbard is a man who knows a thing or two about remarkable resurrections After a wild run through the heyday of the Austinbased progressive country movement of the Seventies during which time he penned the immortal outlaw anthem Up Against the Wall Redneck Mother and performed at the front of a reckless outfit dubbed the Cowboy Twinkies Hubbard hit the brakes at the beginning of the Eighties and spent eight years reevaluating not only his career but more importantly his life Inspired by Stevie Ray Vaughans successful eradication of his drug and alcohol addictions Hubbard followed suit and returned in with the independently released Lost Train of Thought The excellent Loco Gringos Lament came two years later with the increasingly sophisticated and poetic Dangerous Spirits a cracklin live album and s devilishly good Crusades of the Restless Nights following in short order His winning streak continues this month with the release of the Gurf Morlixproduced Eternal and Lowdown a gritty bluesy collection of songs that plays like an aural map down the rough and tumble road to redemption and second chances In another life not too long ago Hubbard might have been written off as a onehitwonder Albums like Eternal and Lowdown prove otherwise marking him as a Texas songwriter on the order of Townes Van Zandt and Butch Hancock You better believe Hubbard belongs in that company every bit as much as that funky old Regal guitar deserved to be rescued an ignoble retirement and thrust back to work in the hands of a serious song poet Read Richard Skanses interview with Ray Wylie Hubbard raywylieasp Winner of the Autographed Jerry Jeff Walker
