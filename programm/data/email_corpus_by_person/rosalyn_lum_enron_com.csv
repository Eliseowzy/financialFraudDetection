<5714920.1075861234792.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,rosalyn.lum@enron.com,2001-10-31 15:17:20,WSJ Enron Price Target With growing revenue a dominant position in major energytrading markets and a depressed stock price Enron Corp would logically be prime takeover bait But in the topsyturvy world of Enron what constitutes logic anymore Takeover speculation has swirled around Wall Street and the energy markets in recent days as Enron shares have plummeted by about twothirds to their lowest level in a decade a selloff sparked by a loss of investor confidence in the Houston energytrading company following big thirdquarter writedowns and the disclosure of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into transactions involving its former chief financial officer Among the names bandied about as potential buyers of all or at least a substantial chunk of Enron are General Electrics GE Capital unit Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway and Royal DutchShell GE and Berkshire had no comment A spokesman for Shell couldnt be reached Meanwhile Enron has approached at least one major institutional investor seeking a capital infusion according to a person familiar with the matter But Enron was turned down because of uncertainties over its financial condition this person says While Enron shares which are trading at about book value look cheap by historical standards and even compared with two weeks ago it isnt clear whether history is much guide when evaluating Enron these days say analysts and others Even fans of the stock have long complained about difficulty understanding how Enron operates because of its enormously complex financial structure and relatively sparse disclosure For years while Enrons stock price was soaring much of Wall Street didnt seem to care about such issues Moodys Downgrades Enrons Debt Maintains Review Stock Drops Oct Enron Is in Discussions With Banks for Credit Line of up to Billion Oct Enron Taps Billion From Bank Lines in PreEmptive Move to Ensure Liquidity Oct Enron Replaces Fastow as Finance Chief Move Follows Concerns Over Partnerships Oct Now with Enrons stock dropping that lack of understanding is haunting the company How bad could Enron get Thats really the question says Prudential Securities analyst Carole Coale Tuesday Ms Coale reduced her price target for Enron shares to and maintained the sell recommendation she recently put on the stock At pm Tuesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Enron shares were down or to down from nearly a year ago When a business like this starts a down cycle theyve got to stop it and stabilize before anyone will be willing to have a really intelligent conversation with them says Peter J Solomon head of Peter J Solomon Co an investmentbanking boutique An Enron spokesman says the company wont comment on takeover speculation nor will it comment on whether it had approached potential investors about a possible capital infusion However the continued plunge in Enron shares and turmoil surrounding the company are a significant overreaction in the marketplace Our core businesses are strong he says The company has said that it is taking steps to restore investor confidence For example Enron is trying to negotiate a new credit line with its major banks Late Tuesday Enrons bankers were putting the final touches on a new credit line of more than billion according to people familiar with the discussions Analysts and other observers say that one uncertainty surrounding Enron is the condition of its vast energytrading operation As the nations biggest energy trader Enron is a principal in onequarter of all electricity and naturalgas trades Enrons EnronOnline Internetbased trading platform has transacted more than billion of trades since it was created in November and does about billion a day in transactions One worry is that Enrons trading partners edgy about the turmoil swirling around the company will start demanding much tougher credit terms from the Houston company or simply cut back doing business Such a trend if it picked up enough momentum could have troubling consequences for Enron We are all in suspense It all depends on how the market reacts says Susan Abbott a managing director at Moodys Investors Service On Monday Moodys downgraded Enrons longterm debt There were some warning signs of unease among trading partners even before the companys thirdquarter earnings release set the stage for the huge drop in the stock price About six to seven weeks ago Entergy Corp became worried about its level of exposure in Enronrelated deals says Wayne Leonard chairman and chief executive officer of the big New Orleans energy company Since then Entergy has cut its Enron exposure to about million to million from million to million he says Mr Leonard didnt specify what prompted the worries which appear to have arisen after the surprise August announcement by Jeffrey Skilling that he was resigning as Enron president and chief executive Mr Skilling cited personal reasons as well as his concerns over the falling stock price While the Enron spokesman says the company doesnt comment on specific trading arrangements he adds that Entergy is one of his companys smaller trading partners He says major trading partners are doing business with Enron on essentially the same terms and conditions and that overall our trading operations are as strong as ever The company spokesman adds that a few smaller trading partners in Europe are seeking revised credit terms from Enron We are working to put together credit terms which they are more comfortable with says the spokesman who declines to be more specific In an effort to bolster its liquidity and position in the marketplace Enron last week drew down some billion accounting for the bulk of its existing credit lines While it used most of that money to buy its outstanding commercial paper a shortterm corporate IOU the company retained about billion of the borrowings as cash A friendly takeover of all or part of Enron would be likelier than a hostile one Among the most obvious candidates would be other companies with big trading operations and experience in risk management Two possible deterrents to a wouldbe buyer a flurry of recent shareholder lawsuits filed against Enron and the continuing SEC probe This message is for the designated recipient only and may contain
