NEW TRICKS VIA THE INTERNET The concept of Elearning is basically an old idea that has come ba ck into vogue with the neverending possibilities offered by the World Wide Web From training employees to

Internets next killer applicati on Pabrai is a longtime webwatcher having founded Net Guru Technologies in and having created the first webmaster certification standardCertified Internet Webmaster He

top companies have taken the plunge to hire Internet professionals to develop their own virtual training programs Equiva Services LLC a joint venture company formed by Texaco Inc Shell Oil Company and Saudi Refining Inc ABB Vetco Gray and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company have all recently jumped on the elearning bandwagon All three companies have created webbased platforms or ecommerce hubs tha t enable employees to quickly and conveniently get necessary training from preselected suppliers This type of innovative application of information technology will help us to work smarter and faster for our internal clients said Mari Duarte senior human resources generalist for ABB Vetco Gray We expect to low er costs and improve efficiency by reducing the time of administrative transactions related to registration and by improving reporting of information related to training activities to management For the energy industry Elearning can involve both the automation of training management systems as well as the transmission and delivery of learning to individuals through use of the Internet Through this technology training information previously available through classroom instruction can be delivered directly to employees desktops in differen t forms ranging from basic presentationstyle courses to highly interactive courses with digitized video transmissions and online discussions Elearning can encompass training employees and it can be used to share important knowledge across the organization and with outside business partners said Dennis McMullin energy industry consultant at Proxicom a leading Internet consulting firm in Houston Texas McMullin says that mor e companies are increasing the amount of training they offer online to help employees stay current on market trends and personal skills There can be a significant cost savings involved in using technology for learning but a companys success ultimately depends on how effectively it can bring the technology into the organization and how well they use it Elearning technology can also ease the administrative burden on an organizations human resources department and lower the perunit cost of training employees Additionally management has the ability to better analyze training needs and how to best deploy the information Webbas ed training is extremely flexible and offers employees convenience in scheduling courses when they need and want them said McMullin It also allows them the opportunity to go back and revisit course material if the need a refresher or a resource It is a selfteaching method that lets individuals learn at their own pace and based on their own needs Internet companies such as VerticalNet Inc in Horsham PA offer companie s the ability to manage training programs through an Internet interface that directly links the company with training suppliers Taken one stop further VerticalNets Training Intelligence Portals enable companies to centralize their personnel training programs and literally outsource administration an d other backoffice transactions such as invoice management utilization reporting course evaluation and quality assurance According to Walter Rogers VerticalNets eBusiness training services se nior director and general manager the energy industry is becoming more aggressive in moving from office administration and classroom learning to webbased technology for training Were seeing a lot more demand f rom the energy sector for elearning technology said Rogers whose firm is currently working with several large energy companies Weve found that the energy industry doesnt typically lead the way in the use of technol ogy It tends to want to see it working and proven in other areas before they tr y it But now they are getting more involved Since the industry is driven to reduce operating costs it finds this technology to be very cost effective In addition to hiring Internet experts to develop and manage a training site Dennis McMullin points out that there is a large variety of existing training opportunities for online learning Most of the technology companies offer online training for technical products while numerous web sites offer free information and opportunities for elearning he said In the end however McMullin believes that acceptance of the Internet is more than a technological issue for many companies rather it requires a cultural adjustment It really is an issue of adjusting the company culture to accept and benefit from Internet technology It requires companies to be more open and less fearful of sharing
