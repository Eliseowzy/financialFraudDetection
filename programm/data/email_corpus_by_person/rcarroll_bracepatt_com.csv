Cc Aryeh Fishman Andrea Settanni Charles Ingebretson Charles Shoneman Deanna King Jeffrey Watkiss Gene Godley Kimberly Curry Michael Pate Paul Fox Ronald Carroll Subject House Energy Subcommittee May Propose CA Emergency Options MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetUSASCII ContentDisposition inline This was published in Electric Power Alerts PowerPlus Service House Energy Subcommittee May Propose CA Emergency Options House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton RTX is predicting an emergency energy bill for California may be presented early next week to mitigate the states power crisis through the summer Among the hotly debated topics that may appear in a compromise bill were wholesale price caps the possibility of granting federal regulators authority to site new power generation and transmission mandatory demand side mitigation and the removal of retail price caps for ratepayers While the state faced a second straight day of rolling blackouts subcommittee members quizzed the three Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioners March about the California situation According to Barton at Republican leadership meetings taking place at the same time the California crisis was at the top of the agenda Barton said he plans to discuss possible legislation with Subcommittee Ranking Member Rick Boucher DVA after another panel is heard on March and ideas will be considered over the weekend But while he said it remains unclear whether anything will be presented uncertain time was of the essence he insisted that proposals would have to be introduced early next week The remarks are another sign that the enormity of this summers potential crisis is sinking in with legislators There seemed to be an uneasy acceptance during the hearing that California will inevitably come up short by several thousand megawatts this summer and the need for unpleasant temporary mitigation measures has become urgent Last week in the Senate Senator Gordon Smith ROR offered a compromise with Sen Dianne Feinstein DCA in which he would accept temporary price caps as long as the state abandoned its steadfast refusal to pass wholesale rates onto consumers One of the more surprising suggestions came from Commissioner Linda Breathitt D who has been the most reserved FERC member throughout the crisis She suggested that FERCs role in siting new transmission and generation facilities ought to be reconsidered Under the Federal Power Act the commission has no role in the permitting and siting of these new facilities she said in her prepared statement I am beginning to believe this may need to be changed FERC may need to have a greater role in the siting of new infrastructure because shortages of generation and transmission likely will no longer be just single state issues I believe these shortages could become interstate commerce issues that must be addressed by the Federal government In a frank exchange with Barton the Commissioners all seemed in varying degrees amenable to the idea I think it is an intriguing idea said Commissioner William Massey D FERC Chairman Curt Hebert R seemed cautiously approving of the idea but only after noting that siting is done by the states for very good reasons He warned not to hardwire it and acknowledged some sort of onestop shopping is a good idea While Breathitt asked for Congressional authority for siting Barton wondered about some measure that would give the state a time limit to do its own permitting before stepping in But he added that something probably needs to happen I think it is the federal role to step in temporarily he said Among the more contentious issues raised was temporary wholesale price caps Arguing that FERC needed to call a time out from this broken western electricity market Commissioner Massey called for such caps calculated on a generatorbygenerator basis with a per megawatt addition a firm sunset provision and an exemption for new generation He argued that without such protection during a grueling summer a voter backlash could emerge and threaten the entire concept of electric competition in the region But the Subcommittee seemed decidedly hostile to the idea Indeed several Republican members pointed out throughout the debate that FERC only has ratemaking jurisdiction over percent of the western market which would limit their effectiveness Additionally many expressed the concern that it would effectively cut off potential power imports from Mexico and Canada It also appears increasingly unlikely FERC would put any such authority into use Hebert as he did before a Senate committee the previous week warned that price caps have a dubious history and added that they provide no incentive to move into the forward market Breathitt also hesitated suggesting that other options should be pursued first and that price caps would only work if state regulators approved and public power authorities could be brought into the scheme Democratic Subcommittee members grilled the Commissioners about their recent refund orders for January and February that were calculated from proxy market prices Boucher wanted to know why findings of unjust and unreasonable prices were limited to Stage emergencies We deserve a more complete answer he said Hebert argued that to investigate further would stray outside their jurisdiction as set out by last years California orders and that the Commission did a thorough job of examining a wide range of transactions In dissenting from this view Massey expressed concern that FERC was limiting its scope particularly in light of evidence from the states own market monitors and scholars that market power abuse was likely Rep Mary Bono RCA applauded FERCs recent efforts While I believe that wholesale price caps are not beneficial for our longterm needs she said I do believe and further encourage FERC to exercise its authority to call into question wholesale rates Rep Edward Markey DMA insisted that possible market gaming was detrimental to everyone Markets are built on public confidence he said And right now the public has little reason to have confidence in the dysfunctional market that has been permitted to develop in California He pressured the Commissioners to consider investigations of other companies under section of the Federal Power Act beyond the recently announced investigations into Williams Energy and AES Some GOP members criticized the Democratic fervor to paint generators as unethical profiteers Rep Steve Largent ROK who represents Williams home state raised doubts about the validity of any such investigation He demanded to know how exactly FERC established just and reasonable rates When the Commissioners failed to present a satisfactory answer he complained how can you hold someone accountable to a standard you dont know and suggested the investigation was unconstitutional

Is Alleged MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetUSASCII ContentDisposition inline The California ISO has leaked to the press that it is filing a study at FERC today presumably this will be part of the ISOs comments regarding FERC Staffs Market Mitigation and Monitoring Plan that shows that five major instate power suppliers Reliant Energy Dynegy WilliamsAES Duke Energy and Mirant formerly Southern Energy plus power importers have overcharged for power The ISOs finger appears to be pointed primarily at the five major instate generators Thursday March Energy Overcharge of Billion Is Alleged Power Money should be refunded to taxpayers and utilities the state grid operator says citing evidence of market manipulation Suppliers deny the accusation By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS Times Staff Writers Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California by about billion between May and last month and that money should be refunded to the states taxpayers and financially strapped utilities the state power grid operator said Wednesday Generators engaged in market manipulation and consistent patterns of bidding far above costs in the deregulated energy market the California Independent System Operator found in a study of pricing data The findings support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additional revenue by manipulating the market Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation The study prepared for a filing with federal regulators today is central to CalISOs efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the states energy crisis This might be the first time we told them the total impact and magnitude of the overcharging said Anjali Sheffrin CalISOs director of market analysis We think the entire amount deserves consideration for refunds Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity sales CalISO found that five companies that together supply about of the power delivered to customers of the states investorowned utilities engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices even though they could have made some money selling more electricity Less frequently they had power generation available but did not bid at all The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their electricity at twice their cost For example Sheffrin said the average markup in August was during peak hours A spokeswoman at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees wholesale electricity pricing across the country declined to comment Wednesday saying This is part of an ongoing proceeding FERC member William L Massey who has considered previous commission actions on refunds to be inadequate said it would be improper for him to comment on a report that has not yet been filed But when told of the billion total Massey said That doesnt shock me in any way Prices over the past months in California have greatly exceeded the federal standards of just and reasonable prices and I think they have exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars he said CalISO which oversees grid operations and an emergency energy market previously detailed million in alleged overcharges for December and January and asked FERC for refunds But the commission has proposed refunds of only a tiny fraction of that amount The study covered five major instate power suppliersReliant Energy Dynegy WilliamsAES Duke Energy and Mirant formerly Southern Energyplus power importers all of which deliver power to customers of Pacific Gas Electric Co Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric Co All overcharged but some excessively and some by moderate amounts Sheffrin said CalISOs public filing will quantify the alleged overcharging by each company but the companies will be identified only by a number The code will be provided to FERC Sheffrin said and CalISO lawyers will determine how much information about the companies will be made public State US Investigations California electricity markets and the companies that buy and sell power in the state have been the subject of several investigations by state and federal authorities since wholesale electricity prices first skyrocketed in May Electricity suppliers have repeatedly denied manipulating the California market in any way whether through abovecost bidding in spot markets or through physical withholding of electricity to drive up prices Reliant Energy is cooperating with FERCs requests for more data and is confident the commission will conclude that prices charged by Reliant were justified said Joe Bob Perkins president of the Houstonbased company Perkins also bitterly disputed charges that Reliant has shut down units so that it can earn bigger profits on the power sold by the remaining plants These charges have been leveled against all of the powerplant owners in the state Reliant Vice President John Stout said CalISOs calculations typically dont include such fixed costs as salaries taxes and the interest on bonds they sold to finance their power plants which they acquired under terms of the states landmark deregulation law In addition he said many highpriced power days have resulted from buyers bidding against each other for scarce supplies rather than sellers charging excessive amountslike a house price being driven far above the listing price in a hot real estate market Williams Energy Services a trading company that markets most of the power produced by plants owned by AES also says it will be exonerated by FERC once the commission examines documentation being submitted said Paula HillCollins spokeswoman for the Tulsa Okla company FERC has the obligation to investigate when these accusations are made HillCollins said This is just a process of justification not necessarily proof of guilt WilliamsAES was recently ordered by FERC to prove that it did not take generating units out of service last year to drive up electricity prices or refund million to California utilities During the period studied suppliers sold electricity in the California Power Exchange to Southern California Edison PGE and San Diego Gas Electric Co and in a backup market for lastminute electricity operated by CalISO But skyhigh prices plunged Edison and PGE deeply into debt and most suppliers stopped selling to them in January forcing the state Department of Water Resources to step in as the primary electricity buyer for the three big utilities million customers The CalISO study first summarized at an energy conference last week at UC Berkeley but not otherwise publicized concluded that the companies exercised socalled market power to pump up electricity prices Severin Borenstein director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley said CalISOs study is consistent with his research examining pricing practices in We found several billion dollars in departures from competitive pricing he said When the market was tight this summer they were able to push up prices and they did The early warning signs of electricity price spikes the study found appeared in May after two years of relatively stable prices of to per megawatthour under deregulation Prices went up during the summer dipped in September and October with lower demand then took off in November and December as weather turned cold and the price of natural gas which is used to generate much of the states electricity reached record levels There were plant outages and demand and supply became close Sheffrin said Whatever price they bid had to be taken and market power asserted itself CalISO found that billion of the alleged overcharges occurred between May and November On Friday federal regulators ordered six wholesale power suppliers to refund million to California if they cannot justify prices charged in February The refund was limited to power sold that month in excess of per megawatthour during Stage power alerts when supplies are so tight that rolling blackouts are threatened One megawatthour is enough electricity to supply typical homes for an hour The previous week FERC ordered suppliers to justify or refund million for power sold in January at prices above per megawatthour Massey opposed the potential refunds as too low because they were limited to hours in which a Stage power emergency was in place and because the benchmark price set for each month was too highcombining to exempt more than transactions from scrutiny Were still looking for our lost wallet under the lamppost which is Stage alerts said Massey one of three commissioners on the fivemember board two seats are vacant Generators have been given the free and clear he said These tinkling little refunds they have come out with recently are almost a joke said CalISO board member Mike Florio senior attorney at the Utility Reform Network Resisting Price Caps CalISO contends that the last months have proved that generators can no longer be allowed to receive electricity prices that are dictated by what the market will bear FERC granted marketbased rate authority on each of these suppliers own showing that they could not manipulate prices yet their actions have shown the contrary Sheffrin said We feel FERC needs to look at the premise of allowing these generators to continue selling at marketbased rates The commission is responsible for ensuring just and reasonable electricity rates Although it has called Californias power market dysfunctional and vulnerable to manipulation the agency has resisted setting firm price caps sought by Californias congressional delegation Chairman Curt L Hebert Jr strongly opposes caps while Massey wants to use caps across the West as a temporary timeout Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham in a New York news conference Wednesday reiterated his opposition to electricity price caps as a way to cope with Californias energy crisis If we put price caps in place there will be more blackouts and theyll be worse Abraham said CalISO is filing its market study as part of its comments on FERC staff recommendations on ways to thwart market manipulation FERCs proposal includes strict coordination of power plant outages by CalISO with reporting of suspicious closures to FERC and generatorbygenerator bid caps tied to costs Reiterman reported from San Francisco Rivera Brooks from Los Angeles Times staff writer Thomas S Mulligan in New York contributed to this story Copyright Los Angeles Times

was published Thursday in the Los Angeles Times All overcharged but some excessively and some by moderate amounts said Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs director of market analysis The Times said the ISO

Commission news web sites will determine their prices were justified The commission has recently stepped up its scrutiny of power companies behavior during Californias power crisis asking suppliers to justify million in sales during the first two months of the year or refund the money Critics claim thousands of additional questionable sales are not being challenged The ISO study alleges the wholesalers manipulated the market by bidding at excessive prices effectively withholding supplies or by not bidding at all when they had generation capability available California has been spending about million a day billion since January to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co news web sites and Southern California Edison news web sites Both utilities the states largest have been cut off by electricity wholesalers because their credit is almost worthless State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the states powerbuying is gutting its budget surplus Since the state

Reliant Energy Services to continue selling to California despite its fear that it will not be paid US District Judge Frank C Damrell Jr said Californians were at risk of irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the ISO which buys it at the last minute on behalf of utilities to bolster supplies and try to fend off rolling blackouts Such blackouts hit the state twice this week On

and chastised Gov Gray Davis news web sites the Legislature and state regulators for not taking more aggressive steps to make sure the utilities can pay their bills Edison and PGE say they are nearly billion in debt due to soaring wholesale power costs The states deregulation law blocks them from recovering the costs from customers Connell ordered an audit of the states powerbuying saying Davis is withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature She said she would refuse to transfer billion into a rainy day fund she said was set up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue billion in revenue bonds to cover its power buys Transferring the money would leave the state general fund billion in debt Connell said She called the scope of the proposed transfer unprecedented and said it amounted to a shell game that disguises the power purchases effect on the state budget Sandy Harrison spokesman for the state Department of Finance and Keely Bosler of the Legislative Analysts Office said such transfers are routine and required by law They put the states budget surplus at billion The law says she has to do it The law does not give her the power to demand that kind of audit information Harrison said Harrison said the states budget isnt in danger because it will be repaid with the revenue bonds Connells criticism of Davis a fellow Democrat won support from Assembly Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who may challenge Davis next year Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the states energy woes but cant unless Davis releases more financial details Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism Political grandstanding doesnt generate one more kilowatt of energy for California in this time of emergency he said Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it can without jeopardizing negotiations for longterm power contracts with wholesalers

Pacific Gas and Electric Co the utility whose losses last year triggered the refund By turning over the refund to its subsidiary PGE is following the suggestion of a stateordered audit released in January The holding company hasnt always been so generous with its utility PGE pocketed a million overpayment that the utility made on its taxes according to the audit by the BarringtonWellesley Group Inc With the refund Pacific Gas and Electrics cash reserves rose to billion but the utility still doesnt have enough money to pay hundreds of increasingly testy creditors The utility has been on the financial ropes for months because wholesale electricity prices have been far higher than retail prices since last May As of Jan Pacific Gas and Electric said it had run up an billion debt buying electricity Pacific Gas and Electric plans to use some of the tax refund to maintain the operations that enable the utility to continue delivering power to its customers Friday March pm Eastern Time Giant Calif Utility Gets Cash Lifeline By Andrew Quinn SAN FRANCISCO Reuters Californias largest utility shoved to the brink of bankruptcy by the states power crisis received a billion lifeline on Friday as its parent company turned over a massive federal tax refund to keep operations going Pacific Gas Electrics financial boost from parent PGE Corp NYSEPCG news will provide the giant utility with desperately needed funds to keep serving its million customers as the states political leaders struggle over a bailout package In a glimmer of optimism corporate executives said on Friday that a bailout deal might be edging closer But the cash infusion and bailout progress came amid growing concern over the financial health of Californias two major utilities amid a crisis fueled by the disastrous state electricity deregulation law that forced the utilities to buy power on the spot market but refused them the right to pass the higher prices on to consumers On Friday Pacific Gas Electric said it would make good on only a segment of debt payments due on April adding to the mountain of unpaid paper the utility has stacked up Southern California Edison the states number two utility said it would fight any effort to push it into involuntary bankruptcy In Washington meanwhile federal regulators ordered six generators to either justify why their prices were so high or refund million to California utilities for overpriced wholesale power sales in February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC move followed a similar million refund order against the same six generators last week for their January sales boosting California critics who have alleged that outofstate profiteers have exacerbated the states critical energy shortages The crisis led power managers to impose rolling blackouts across parts of the state twice in January and federal Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said on Thursday he believed more blackouts appeared inevitable this summer as air conditioning pushes power demand sharply higher in the state PGE VOICES OPTIMISM Both Pacific Gas Electric and its No rival Edison International NYSEEIX news unit Southern California Edison have been fighting a losing financial battle because the power deregulation law blocks them from passing along soaring wholesale energy costs to consumers As a result the utilities are well over billion in debt and say they simply do not have the money to continue purchasing power for their customers California Gov Gray Davis facing one of the worst economic crises ever to hit the nations richest and most populous state has crafted a rescue package which involves both emergency state purchases of power and an elaborate bailout for the utilities But that bailout hinging on the state buying the utilities vast network of transmission lines has run into trouble as negotiations bog down over the price of the deal On Friday however PGE Corp Chief Financial Officer Peter Darbee told a teleconference with investors that the talks were on track We are making pretty good progress and have moved to the point where a greater level of detail is being negotiated with Davis he said adding that he was cautiously optimistic a deal could be reached Darbee also said the talks had taken on a quickening pace of activity as pressure builds to find a solution to the states power emergency The income tax refund raised the utilitys cash on hand to billion but officials said that once all of the utilitys debts were tallied it would still be billion in the red PGE said on Friday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission it would make quarterly interest payments on its commercial paper due April but would deferring a quarterly payment on preferred securities CONTINUED CONCERN AT SOCAL EDISON Concern this week focused on Southern California Edison where a number of unsecured creditors mostly small power generators who rely heavily on income from the utility began considering plans to push the utility into involuntary bankruptcy Officials at the utilitys parent company said on Friday they believed Southern California Edison was in a strong position to fight involuntary bankruptcy which they said would cause the states power crisis to spin out of control We believe we have solid grounds on which to oppose said Barbara Mathews an assistant general counsel for SoCal Edison in an investor conference call We believe that bankruptcy court intervention isnt necessary or in anyones best interest right now Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver said the solution to the utilities woes is very much tied up in the political process but said it should come soon Peoples patience is getting short We really need a solution and we need it soon he said Wall Street which has been watching Californias lurching efforts to resolve its energy crisis clearly agrees Edison International shares closed on the New York Stock Exchange down or percent at less than half their week high of PGE shares closed on the Big Board down or percent at compared to their week high of Friday March pm Eastern Time Judge delays ruling on Calif emergency power sales SACRAMENTO Calif March Reuters A federal judge on Friday delayed until next week his decision on whether to extend an order requiring four independent energy companies to sell electricity to the California power grid operator US District Court Judge Frank Damrell put the case on hold until March following a lengthy hearing Friday in which lawyers for Reliant Energy Inc NYSEREI news Williams Cos Inc NYSEWMB news AES Corp NYSEAES news and Dynegy Inc NYSEDYN news argued their companies should be released from an order to sell power to the California Independent System Operator ISO citing fears of not being paid Utility industry and government officials said Damrell was widely expected to extend the order a move that would keep in place a Feb restraining order requiring Reliant to continue emergency sales to the ISO The order was later expanded to include the other suppliers on the strength of state lawyers arguments that the power was needed to avoid blackouts Back in January when a severe lack of electricity triggered two days of rolling blackouts the ISO was thrust into the position of securing emergency power on a daily basis to close the gap between surging demand and scant supplies The four energy merchants have repeatedly argued before Judge Damrell that deals with the ISO poses a major credit risk The ISOs credit rating was badly damaged when two of its biggest customers the utility subsidiaries of PGE Corp NYSEPCG news and Edison International NYSEEIX news ran out of cash earlier this year buying electricity in the regions volatile spot market Facing a combined billion debt the two utilities now depend on the longterm contracts negotiated on their behalf by the states Department of Water Resources and spot market purchases by the ISO to supplement power generated at their own plants The Department of Water Resources does not pose the same thorny problem for the energy merchants as the ISO since it draws on the states still solid credit rating Meanwhile the ISO which oversees about percent of the California transmission grid is currently buying up to megawatts of power a day enough to supply four million homes to make up for what has not already been secured through contracts At todays hearing lawyers for AES Williams and Dynegy told the court the three companies had volunteered to extend their sales to the ISO prior to Fridays hearing Houstonbased Reliant said it was willing to abide by an extended interim agreement with the ISO through May Friday March pm Eastern Time SoCal Edison says ready to fight any forced bankruptcy By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK March Reuters Southern California Edison one of the two utilities struggling to survive Californias power crisis said on Friday it is in a strong position to fight off a push by some of its creditors to force it into involuntary bankruptcy The utilitys parent Edison International NYSEEIX news made its statements late on Friday a day its shares fell almost percent The decline follows a federal court ruling this week that Caithness Energy one of SoCal Edisons unsecured power providers could place a lien on the utilitys Mojave power plant It also came after reports surfaced that Coram Energy another provider is circulating a petition among five other providers to push SoCal Edison into bankruptcy involuntarily so that it can get paid for power it has already provided The push comes at a time California legislature is reportedly stalled on talks to allow SoCal Edison the states No utility and No utility Pacific Gas Electric Co to recoup more than billion of wholesale power costs they cannot collect because of a rate freeze imposed under Californias failed utility deregulation The cash crunch has already triggered periodic rolling blackouts in the nations most populous state We believe we have solid grounds on which to oppose an involuntary bankruptcy filing said Barbara Mathews an assistant general counsel for SoCal Edison in an investor conference call conducted by Rosemead Califbased Edison International We believe that bankruptcy court intervention isnt necessary or in anyones best interest right now A bankruptcy filing would cause Californias power crisis to spin out of control said Ted Craver Edison Internationals chief financial officer in the call The solution is very much tied up in the political process he said Peoples patience is getting short We really need a solution and we need it soon SoCal Edison which serves million Californians and Pacific GE which serves million and their parents have already missed a variety of payments or are otherwise in default of various agreements POWER GENERATORS ORDERED TO REFUND MILLION Pacific GE said on Friday in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission it intends on April to make quarterly interest payments on its commercial paper but is deferring a quarterly payment on preferred securities PGE said in another filing it had transferred billion of its billion tax refund to the utility Meanwhile the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday ordered six power generators to refund million to the utilities for overpriced February wholesale power sales Edison International shares closed on the New York Stock Exchange down or percent at PGE shares closed on the Big Board down or percent at In the conference call Craver also questioned an article from Dow Jones News Service suggesting that negotiations with California legislators are going nowhere The article quoted an unnamed senior SoCal Edison executive as saying negotiations by California with its three investorowned utilities to buy their power lines will never see the light of day The executive also reportedly said SoCal Edison which agreed in principle last month to sell its part of Californias power grid to the state for billion is nowhere closer to a final agreement The pace of negotiations has certainly slowed down Craver said but added I dont think that a number of those statements there accurately reflect whats going on We are in active discussions with the Governors office Were scratching our heads to determine who this mysterious person is who made these comments Craver said SoCal Edison meanwhile decided on Friday to make an million payment on first mortgage bonds it had missed days ago in order to avoid having to repay million of principal immediately Separately he said Edison International and its utility unit remain in discussions with bankers who had agreed to forbear or not act upon defaults on three credit lines through Wednesday Our bank forbearance agreement expired two days ago said Craver We have initiated discussions with the banks earlier this week Those discussions continue

multipartmixed boundaryDDBCAD A copy of FERCs March Notice regarding the proxy price for Feb is attached This refund notice requires Duke Energy Trading and Marketing Dynegy Power Marketing Portland General Electric Company Reliant Energy Services the Mirant Corporation and Williams Energy Services to either provide the identified refund amounts million or defend the prices charged Below is the New York Times article about this latest action by FERC March US Orders Power Suppliers to Justify Prices in California By JOSEPH KAHN WASHINGTON March Federal regulators told power suppliers in Californias volatile electricity market today to refund million to sta te utilities unless they could justify prices that regulators called excessive The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued the refund notice which affected six leading electricity generators to cover the month of February Last Friday it issued a similar order reviewing sales in January In that action the agency asked generators either to justify or refund million in sales The refund mandates are part of a new push by the commission to intervene i n Californias troubled electricity market State and national political leaders have put pressure on the agency to use its authority it has the obligation to insure just and reasonable electricity rates nationwide to limit skyrocketing prices while the state tries to unravel its failed effor t at deregulation The agency has indicated that it will also scrutinize electricity transactions in March and April possibly forcing refunds if it finds that generators have charged rates above what the agency determines to be their highest costs of production While the intervention has won support from some California officials and t he Bush administration the agencys orders have been criticized as too narrow by some California market watchers and one of the federal agencys commissioners The agency decided to apply a so called rate screen effectively a price cap to electricity transactions that occur during Californias Stage emergencies Emergencies are declared when electricity supplies fall to within percent of demand The agency has said that generators are most likely to charge excessive prices when supplies are tightest But California has seen similarly high prices even when it is not forced to declare a Stage emergency California officials say They have criticized the agency for effectively blessing the profits generators have made during those nonemergency periods by excluding them from the universe of potential refunds The agency has also imposed a relatively high rate screen a proxy nu mber intended to simulate the operating costs of the states most inefficient generating plants on all sellers of electricity during crisis hours California officials had urged the agency to investigate the actual costs o f individual generators and compare them to the prices they charged tailorin g penalties to the behavior of each generator In January the commission set the rate screen at per megawatt hour In February the screen rose to per megawatthour The commission said in a statement that higher natural gas prices accounted for some of the increase This sounds like a step backward instead of the aggressive action we need from FERC said Senator Dianne Feinstein Democrat of California referrin g to the agency Before the energy crisis started in California electricity was selling at an average wholesale cost of a megawatthour Senator Feinstein said And now FERC is saying a baseline of a megawatthour is a reasonable cost Something is really wrong here Agency officials declined to comment on the rationale behind their order The refunds to date are a small fraction of total electricity sales in the state California officials using a different methodology and a different time frame to calculate price abuses had asked the agency to force refunds of million for December and January California utility executives have estimated that unless prices are abated much more aggressively in coming months the state could end up paying a billion electricity bill in compared with billion last year The latest refund notice named Duke Energy Trading and Marketing Dynegy Power Marketing Portland General Electric Company Reliant Energy Services the Mirant Corporation and Williams Energy Services six of the countrys largest power marketers Dynegy was asked to justify or refund millio n in sales and Williams was asked to defend or rebate million Spokesmen for the companies named have said that their

General Electric Company Reliant Energy Services the Mirant Corporation and Williams Energy Services to either provide the identified refund amounts million or defend the prices charged Below is the New York Times article about this latest action by FERC March US Orders Power Suppliers to Justify Prices in California By JOSEPH KAHN WASHINGTON March Federal regulators told power suppliers in Californias volatile electricity market today to refund million to sta te utilities unless they could justify prices that regulators called excessive The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued the refund notice which affected six leading electricity generators to cover the month of February Last Friday it issued a similar order reviewing sales in January In that action the agency asked generators either to justify or refund million in sales The refund mandates are part of a new push by the commission to intervene i n Californias troubled electricity market State and national political leaders have put pressure on the agency to use its authority it has the obligation to insure just and reasonable electricity rates nationwide to limit skyrocketing prices while the state tries to unravel its failed effor t at deregulation The agency has indicated that it will also scrutinize electricity transactions in March and April possibly forcing refunds if it finds that generators have charged rates above what the agency determines to be their highest costs of production While the intervention has won support from some California officials and t he Bush administration the agencys orders have been criticized as too narrow by some California market watchers and one of the federal agencys commissioners The agency decided to apply a so called rate screen effectively a price cap to electricity transactions that occur during Californias Stage emergencies Emergencies are declared when electricity supplies fall to within percent of demand The agency has said that generators are most likely to charge excessive prices when supplies are tightest But California has seen similarly high prices even when it is not forced to declare a Stage emergency California officials say They have criticized the agency for effectively blessing the profits generators have made during those nonemergency periods by excluding them from the universe of potential refunds The agency has also imposed a relatively high rate screen a proxy nu mber intended to simulate the operating costs of the states most inefficient generating plants on all sellers of electricity during crisis hours California officials had urged the agency to investigate the actual costs o f individual generators and compare them to the prices they charged tailorin g penalties to the behavior of each generator In January the commission set the rate screen at per megawatt hour In February the screen rose to per megawatthour The commission said in a statement that higher natural gas prices accounted for some of the increase This sounds like a step backward instead of the aggressive action we need from FERC said Senator Dianne Feinstein Democrat of California referrin g to the agency Before the energy crisis started in California electricity was selling at an average wholesale cost of a megawatthour Senator Feinstein said And now FERC is saying a baseline of a megawatthour is a reasonable cost Something is really wrong here Agency officials declined to comment on the rationale behind their order The refunds to date are a small fraction of total electricity sales in the state California officials using a different methodology and a different time frame to calculate price abuses had asked the agency to force refunds of million for December and January California utility executives have estimated that unless prices are abated much more aggressively in coming months the state could end up paying a billion electricity bill in compared with billion last year The latest refund notice named Duke Energy Trading and Marketing Dynegy Power Marketing Portland General Electric Company Reliant Energy Services the Mirant Corporation and Williams Energy Services six of the countrys largest power marketers Dynegy was asked to justify or refund millio n in sales and Williams was asked to defend or rebate million Spokesmen for the companies named have said that their

bailout deal might be edging closer But the cash infusion and bailout progress came amid growing concern over the financial health of Californias two major utilities amid a crisis fueled by the disastrous state electricity deregulation law that forced the utilities to buy power on the spot market but refused them the right to pass the higher prices on to consumers On Friday Pacific Gas Electric said it would make good on only a segment of debt payments due on April adding to the mountain of unpaid paper the utility has stacked up Southern California Edison the states number two utility said it would fight any effort to push it into involuntary bankruptcy In Washington meanwhile federal regulators ordered six generators to either justify why their prices were so high or refund million to California utilities for overpriced wholesale power sales in February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC move followed a similar million refund order against the same six generators last week for their January sales boosting California critics who have alleged that outofstate profiteers have exacerbated the states critical energy shortages The crisis led power managers to impose rolling blackouts across parts of the state twice in January and federal Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said on Thursday he believed more blackouts appeared inevitable this summer as air conditioning pushes power demand sharply higher in the state PGE VOICES OPTIMISM Both Pacific Gas Electric and its No rival Edison International NYSEEIX news unit Southern California Edison have been fighting a losing financial battle because the power deregulation law blocks them from passing along soaring wholesale energy costs to consumers As a result the utilities are well over billion in debt and say they simply do not have the money to continue purchasing power for their customers California Gov Gray Davis facing one of the worst economic crises ever to hit the nations richest and most populous state has crafted a rescue package which involves both emergency state purchases of power and an elaborate bailout for the utilities But that bailout hinging on the state buying the utilities vast network of transmission lines has run into trouble as negotiations bog down over the price of the deal On Friday however PGE Corp Chief Financial Officer Peter Darbee told a teleconference with investors that the talks were on track We are making pretty good progress and have moved to the point where a greater level of detail is being negotiated with Davis he said adding that he was cautiously optimistic a deal could be reached Darbee also said the talks had taken on a quickening pace of activity as pressure builds to find a solution to the states power emergency The income tax refund raised the utilitys cash on hand to billion but officials said that once all of the utilitys debts were tallied it would still be billion in the red PGE said on Friday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission it would make quarterly interest payments on its commercial paper due April but would deferring a quarterly payment on preferred securities CONTINUED CONCERN AT SOCAL EDISON Concern this week focused on Southern California Edison where a number of unsecured creditors mostly small power generators who rely heavily on income from the utility began considering plans to push the utility into involuntary bankruptcy Officials at the utilitys parent company said on Friday they believed Southern California Edison was in a strong position to fight involuntary bankruptcy which they said would cause the states power crisis to spin out of control We believe we have solid grounds on which to oppose said Barbara Mathews an assistant general counsel for SoCal Edison in an investor conference call We believe that bankruptcy court intervention isnt necessary or in anyones best interest right now Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver said the solution to the utilities woes is very much tied up in the political process but said it should come soon Peoples patience is getting short We really need a solution and we need it soon he said Wall Street which has been watching Californias lurching efforts to resolve its energy crisis clearly agrees Edison International shares closed on the New York Stock Exchange down or percent at less than half their week high of PGE shares closed on the Big Board down or percent at compared to their week high of Friday March pm Eastern Time Judge delays ruling on Calif emergency power sales SACRAMENTO Calif March Reuters A federal judge on Friday delayed until next week his decision on whether to extend an order requiring four independent energy companies to sell electricity to the California power grid operator US District Court Judge Frank Damrell put the case on hold until March following a lengthy hearing Friday in which lawyers for Reliant Energy Inc NYSEREI news Williams Cos Inc NYSEWMB news AES Corp NYSEAES news and Dynegy Inc NYSEDYN news argued their companies should be released from an order to sell power to the California Independent System Operator ISO citing fears of not being paid Utility industry and government officials said Damrell was widely expected to extend the order a move that would keep in place a Feb restraining order requiring Reliant to continue emergency sales to the ISO The order was later expanded to include the other suppliers on the strength of state lawyers arguments that the power was needed to avoid blackouts Back in January when a severe lack of electricity triggered two days of rolling blackouts the ISO was thrust into the position of securing emergency power on a daily basis to close the gap between surging demand and scant supplies The four energy merchants have repeatedly argued before Judge Damrell that deals with the ISO poses a major credit risk The ISOs credit rating was badly damaged when two of its biggest customers the utility subsidiaries of PGE Corp NYSEPCG news and Edison International NYSEEIX news ran out of cash earlier this year buying electricity in the regions volatile spot market Facing a combined billion debt the two utilities now depend on the longterm contracts negotiated on their behalf by the states Department of Water Resources and spot market purchases by the ISO to supplement power generated at their own plants The Department of Water Resources does not pose the same thorny problem for the energy merchants as the ISO since it draws on the states still solid credit rating Meanwhile the ISO which oversees about percent of the California transmission grid is currently buying up to megawatts of power a day enough to supply four million homes to make up for what has not already been secured through contracts At todays hearing lawyers for AES Williams and Dynegy told the court the three companies had volunteered to extend their sales to the ISO prior to Fridays hearing Houstonbased Reliant said it was willing to abide by an extended interim agreement with the ISO through May Friday March pm Eastern Time SoCal Edison says ready to fight any forced bankruptcy By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK March Reuters Southern California Edison one of the two utilities struggling to survive Californias power crisis said on Friday it is in a strong position to fight off a push by some of its creditors to force it into involuntary bankruptcy The utilitys parent Edison International NYSEEIX news made its statements late on Friday a day its shares fell almost percent The decline follows a federal court ruling this week that Caithness Energy one of SoCal Edisons unsecured power providers could place a lien on the utilitys Mojave power plant It also came after reports surfaced that Coram Energy another provider is circulating a petition among five other providers to push SoCal Edison into bankruptcy involuntarily so that it can get paid for power it has already provided The push comes at a time California legislature is reportedly stalled on talks to allow SoCal Edison the states No utility and No utility Pacific Gas Electric Co to recoup more than billion of wholesale power costs they cannot collect because of a rate freeze imposed under Californias failed utility deregulation The cash crunch has already triggered periodic rolling blackouts in the nations most populous state We believe we have solid grounds on which to oppose an involuntary bankruptcy filing said Barbara Mathews an assistant general counsel for SoCal Edison in an investor conference call conducted by Rosemead Califbased Edison International We believe that bankruptcy court intervention isnt necessary or in anyones best interest right now A bankruptcy filing would cause Californias power crisis to spin out of control said Ted Craver Edison Internationals chief financial officer in the call The solution is very much tied up in the political process he said Peoples patience is getting short We really need a solution and we need it soon SoCal Edison which serves million Californians and Pacific GE which serves million and their parents have already missed a variety of payments or are otherwise in default of various agreements POWER GENERATORS ORDERED TO REFUND MILLION Pacific GE said on Friday in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission it intends on April to make quarterly interest payments on its commercial paper but is deferring a quarterly payment on preferred securities PGE said in another filing it had transferred billion of its billion tax refund to the utility Meanwhile the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday ordered six power generators to refund million to the utilities for overpriced February wholesale power sales Edison International shares closed on the New York Stock Exchange down or percent at PGE shares closed on the Big Board down or percent at In the conference call Craver also questioned an article from Dow Jones News Service suggesting that negotiations with California legislators are going nowhere The article quoted an unnamed senior SoCal Edison executive as saying negotiations by California with its three investorowned utilities to buy their power lines will never see the light of day The executive also reportedly said SoCal Edison which agreed in principle last month to sell its part of Californias power grid to the state for billion is nowhere closer to a final agreement The pace of negotiations has certainly slowed down Craver said but added I dont think that a number of those statements there accurately reflect whats going on We are in active discussions with the Governors office Were scratching our heads to determine who this mysterious person is who made these comments Craver said SoCal Edison meanwhile decided on Friday to make an million payment on first mortgage bonds it had missed days ago in order to avoid having to repay million of principal immediately Separately he said Edison International and its utility unit remain in discussions with bankers who had agreed to forbear or not act upon defaults on three credit lines through Wednesday Our bank forbearance agreement expired two days ago said Craver We have initiated discussions with the banks earlier this week Those discussions continue

charsetUSASCII ContentDisposition inline Apparently the ISO gave the LA Times a copy of the study being filed with FERC today The LA Times published it Thursday March AM ET Report Calif Overcharged for Power By DON THOMPSON Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO Calif AP Electricity wholesalers overcharged California billion over the past months according to a report by managers of the states power grid The five companies among other things frequently offered electricity at prices double what it cost them to produce concludes the California Independent System Operator news web sites study which was published Thursday in the Los Angeles Times All overcharged but some excessively and some by moderate amounts said Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs director of market analysis The Times said the ISO planned to file the study with federal regulators Thursday and are demanding that the money be paid back The companies denied the allegations adding they expect the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission news web sites will determine their prices were justified The commission has recently stepped up its scrutiny of power companies behavior during Californias power crisis asking suppliers to justify million in sales during the first two months of the year or refund the money Critics claim thousands of additional questionable sales are not being challenged The ISO study alleges the wholesalers manipulated the market by bidding at excessive prices effectively withholding supplies or by not bidding at all when they had generation capability available California has been spending about million a day billion since January to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co news web sites and Southern California Edison news web sites Both utilities the states largest have been cut off by electricity wholesalers because their credit is almost worthless State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the states powerbuying is gutting its budget surplus Since the state started making emergency power buys the surplus has fallen from billion to about billion she said A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major electricity wholesaler Reliant Energy Services to continue selling to California despite its fear that it will not be paid US District Judge Frank C Damrell Jr said Californians were at risk of irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the ISO which buys it at the last minute on behalf of utilities to bolster supplies and try to fend off rolling blackouts Such blackouts hit the state twice this week On Wednesday cooling temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed the state to avoid blackouts Standard Poors has put the state on a credit watch due to its power purchases and chastised Gov Gray Davis news web sites the Legislature and state regulators for not taking more aggressive steps to make sure the utilities can pay their bills Edison and PGE say they are nearly billion in debt due to soaring wholesale power costs The states deregulation law blocks them from recovering the costs from customers Connell ordered an audit of the states powerbuying saying Davis is withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature She said she would refuse to transfer billion into a rainy day fund she said was set up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue billion in revenue bonds to cover its power buys Transferring the money would leave the state general fund billion in debt Connell said She called the scope of the proposed transfer unprecedented and said it amounted to a shell game that disguises the power purchases effect on the state budget Sandy Harrison spokesman for the state Department of Finance and Keely Bosler of the Legislative Analysts Office said such transfers are routine and required by law They put the states budget surplus at billion The law says she has to do it The law does not give her the power to demand that kind of audit information Harrison said Harrison said the states budget isnt in danger because it will be repaid with the revenue bonds Connells criticism of Davis a fellow Democrat won support from Assembly Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who may challenge Davis next year Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the states energy woes but cant unless Davis releases more financial details Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism Political grandstanding doesnt generate one more kilowatt of energy for California in this time of emergency he said Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it can without jeopardizing negotiations for longterm power contracts with wholesalers

Is Alleged MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetUSASCII ContentDisposition inline The California ISO has leaked to the press that it is filing a study at FERC today presumably this will be part of the ISOs comments regarding FERC Staffs Market Mitigation and Monitoring Plan that shows that five major instate power suppliers Reliant Energy Dynegy WilliamsAES Duke Energy and Mirant formerly Southern Energy plus power importers have overcharged for power The ISOs finger appears to be pointed primarily at the five major instate generators Thursday March Energy Overcharge of Billion Is Alleged Power Money should be refunded to taxpayers and utilities the state grid operator says citing evidence of market manipulation Suppliers deny the accusation By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS Times Staff Writers Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California by about billion between May and last month and that money should be refunded to the states taxpayers and financially strapped utilities the state power grid operator said Wednesday Generators engaged in market manipulation and consistent patterns of bidding far above costs in the deregulated energy market the California Independent System Operator found in a study of pricing data The findings support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additional revenue by manipulating the market Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation The study prepared for a filing with federal regulators today is central to CalISOs efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the states energy crisis This might be the first time we told them the total impact and magnitude of the overcharging said Anjali Sheffrin CalISOs director of market analysis We think the entire amount deserves consideration for refunds Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity sales CalISO found that five companies that together supply about of the power delivered to customers of the states investorowned utilities engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices even though they could have made some money selling more electricity Less frequently they had power generation available but did not bid at all The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their electricity at twice their cost For example Sheffrin said the average markup in August was during peak hours A spokeswoman at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees wholesale electricity pricing across the country declined to comment Wednesday saying This is part of an ongoing proceeding FERC member William L Massey who has considered previous commission actions on refunds to be inadequate said it would be improper for him to comment on a report that has not yet been filed But when told of the billion total Massey said That doesnt shock me in any way Prices over the past months in California have greatly exceeded the federal standards of just and reasonable prices and I think they have exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars he said CalISO which oversees grid operations and an emergency energy market previously detailed million in alleged overcharges for December and January and asked FERC for refunds But the commission has proposed refunds of only a tiny fraction of that amount The study covered five major instate power suppliersReliant Energy Dynegy WilliamsAES Duke Energy and Mirant formerly Southern Energyplus power importers all of which deliver power to customers of Pacific Gas Electric Co Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric Co All overcharged but some excessively and some by moderate amounts Sheffrin said CalISOs public filing will quantify the alleged overcharging by each company but the companies will be identified only by a number The code will be provided to FERC Sheffrin said and CalISO lawyers will determine how much information about the companies will be made public State US Investigations California electricity markets and the companies that buy and sell power in the state have been the subject of several investigations by state and federal authorities since wholesale electricity prices first skyrocketed in May Electricity suppliers have repeatedly denied manipulating the California market in any way whether through abovecost bidding in spot markets or through physical withholding of electricity to drive up prices Reliant Energy is cooperating with FERCs requests for more data and is confident the commission will conclude that prices charged by Reliant were justified said Joe Bob Perkins president of the Houstonbased company Perkins also bitterly disputed charges that Reliant has shut down units so that it can earn bigger profits on the power sold by the remaining plants These charges have been leveled against all of the powerplant owners in the state Reliant Vice President John Stout said CalISOs calculations typically dont include such fixed costs as salaries taxes and the interest on bonds they sold to finance their power plants which they acquired under terms of the states landmark deregulation law In addition he said many highpriced power days have resulted from buyers bidding against each other for scarce supplies rather than sellers charging excessive amountslike a house price being driven far above the listing price in a hot real estate market Williams Energy Services a trading company that markets most of the power produced by plants owned by AES also says it will be exonerated by FERC once the commission examines documentation being submitted said Paula HillCollins spokeswoman for the Tulsa Okla company FERC has the obligation to investigate when these accusations are made HillCollins said This is just a process of justification not necessarily proof of guilt WilliamsAES was recently ordered by FERC to prove that it did not take generating units out of service last year to drive up electricity prices or refund million to California utilities During the period studied suppliers sold electricity in the California Power Exchange to Southern California Edison PGE and San Diego Gas Electric Co and in a backup market for lastminute electricity operated by CalISO But skyhigh prices plunged Edison and PGE deeply into debt and most suppliers stopped selling to them in January forcing the state Department of Water Resources to step in as the primary electricity buyer for the three big utilities million customers The CalISO study first summarized at an energy conference last week at UC Berkeley but not otherwise publicized concluded that the companies exercised socalled market power to pump up electricity prices Severin Borenstein director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley said CalISOs study is consistent with his research examining pricing practices in We found several billion dollars in departures from competitive pricing he said When the market was tight this summer they were able to push up prices and they did The early warning signs of electricity price spikes the study found appeared in May after two years of relatively stable prices of to per megawatthour under deregulation Prices went up during the summer dipped in September and October with lower demand then took off in November and December as weather turned cold and the price of natural gas which is used to generate much of the states electricity reached record levels There were plant outages and demand and supply became close Sheffrin said Whatever price they bid had to be taken and market power asserted itself CalISO found that billion of the alleged overcharges occurred between May and November On Friday federal regulators ordered six wholesale power suppliers to refund million to California if they cannot justify prices charged in February The refund was limited to power sold that month in excess of per megawatthour during Stage power alerts when supplies are so tight that rolling blackouts are threatened One megawatthour is enough electricity to supply typical homes for an hour The previous week FERC ordered suppliers to justify or refund million for power sold in January at prices above per megawatthour Massey opposed the potential refunds as too low because they were limited to hours in which a Stage power emergency was in place and because the benchmark price set for each month was too highcombining to exempt more than transactions from scrutiny Were still looking for our lost wallet under the lamppost which is Stage alerts said Massey one of three commissioners on the fivemember board two seats are vacant Generators have been given the free and clear he said These tinkling little refunds they have come out with recently are almost a joke said CalISO board member Mike Florio senior attorney at the Utility Reform Network Resisting Price Caps CalISO contends that the last months have proved that generators can no longer be allowed to receive electricity prices that are dictated by what the market will bear FERC granted marketbased rate authority on each of these suppliers own showing that they could not manipulate prices yet their actions have shown the contrary Sheffrin said We feel FERC needs to look at the premise of allowing these generators to continue selling at marketbased rates The commission is responsible for ensuring just and reasonable electricity rates Although it has called Californias power market dysfunctional and vulnerable to manipulation the agency has resisted setting firm price caps sought by Californias congressional delegation Chairman Curt L Hebert Jr strongly opposes caps while Massey wants to use caps across the West as a temporary timeout Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham in a New York news conference Wednesday reiterated his opposition to electricity price caps as a way to cope with Californias energy crisis If we put price caps in place there will be more blackouts and theyll be worse Abraham said CalISO is filing its market study as part of its comments on FERC staff recommendations on ways to thwart market manipulation FERCs proposal includes strict coordination of power plant outages by CalISO with reporting of suspicious closures to FERC and generatorbygenerator bid caps tied to

Propose CA Emergency Options House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton RTX is predicting an emergency energy bill for California may be presented early next week to mitigate the states power crisis through the summer Among the hotly debated topics that may appear in a compromise bill were wholesale price caps the possibility of granting federal regulators authority to site new power generation and transmission mandatory demand side mitigation and the removal of retail price caps for ratepayers While the state faced a second straight day of rolling blackouts subcommittee members quizzed the three Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioners March about the California situation According to Barton at Republican leadership meetings taking place at the same time the California crisis was at the top of the agenda Barton said he plans to discuss possible legislation with Subcommittee Ranking Member Rick Boucher DVA after another panel is heard on March and ideas will be considered over the weekend But while he said it remains unclear whether anything will be presented uncertain time was of the essence he insisted that proposals would have to be introduced early next week The remarks are another sign that the enormity of this summers potential crisis is sinking in with legislators There seemed to be an uneasy acceptance during the hearing that California will inevitably come up short by several thousand megawatts this summer and the need for unpleasant temporary mitigation measures has become urgent Last week in the Senate Senator Gordon Smith ROR offered a compromise with Sen Dianne Feinstein DCA in which he would accept temporary price caps as long as the state abandoned its steadfast refusal to pass wholesale rates onto consumers One of the more surprising suggestions came from Commissioner Linda Breathitt D who has been the most reserved FERC member throughout the crisis She suggested that FERCs role in siting new transmission and generation facilities ought to be reconsidered Under the Federal Power Act the commission has no role in the permitting and siting of these new facilities she said in her prepared statement I am beginning to believe this may need to be changed FERC may need to have a greater role in the siting of new infrastructure because shortages of generation and transmission likely will no longer be just single state issues I believe these shortages could become interstate commerce issues that must be addressed by the Federal government In a frank exchange with Barton the Commissioners all seemed in varying degrees amenable to the idea I think it is an intriguing idea said Commissioner William Massey D FERC Chairman Curt Hebert R seemed cautiously approving of the idea but only after noting that siting is done by the states for very good reasons He warned not to hardwire it and acknowledged some sort of onestop shopping is a good idea While Breathitt asked for Congressional authority for siting Barton wondered about some measure that would give the state a time limit to do its own permitting before stepping in But he added that something probably needs to happen I think it is the federal role to step in temporarily he said Among the more contentious issues raised was temporary wholesale price caps Arguing that FERC needed to call a time out from this broken western electricity market Commissioner Massey called for such caps calculated on a generatorbygenerator basis with a per megawatt addition a firm sunset provision and an exemption for new generation He argued that without such protection during a grueling summer a voter backlash could emerge and threaten the entire concept of electric competition in the region But the Subcommittee seemed decidedly hostile to the idea Indeed several Republican members pointed out throughout the debate that FERC only has ratemaking jurisdiction over percent of the western market which would limit their effectiveness Additionally many expressed the concern that it would effectively cut off potential power imports from Mexico and Canada It also appears increasingly unlikely FERC would put any such authority into use Hebert as he did before a Senate committee the previous week warned that price caps have a dubious history and added that they provide no incentive to move into the forward market Breathitt also hesitated suggesting that other options should be pursued first and that price caps would only work if state regulators approved and public power authorities could be brought into the scheme Democratic Subcommittee members grilled the Commissioners about their recent refund orders for January and February that were calculated from proxy market prices Boucher wanted to know why findings of unjust and unreasonable prices were limited to Stage emergencies We deserve a more complete answer he said Hebert argued that to investigate further would stray outside their jurisdiction as set out by last years California orders and that the Commission did a thorough job of examining a wide range of transactions In dissenting from this view Massey expressed concern that FERC was limiting its scope particularly in light of evidence from the states own market monitors and scholars that market power abuse was likely Rep Mary Bono RCA applauded FERCs recent efforts While I believe that wholesale price caps are not beneficial for our longterm needs she said I do believe and further encourage FERC to exercise its authority to call into question wholesale rates Rep Edward Markey DMA insisted that possible market gaming was detrimental to everyone Markets are built on public confidence he said And right now the public has little reason to have confidence in the dysfunctional market that has been permitted to develop in California He pressured the Commissioners to consider investigations of other companies under section of the Federal Power Act beyond the recently announced investigations into Williams Energy and AES Some GOP members criticized the Democratic fervor to paint generators as unethical profiteers Rep Steve Largent ROK who represents Williams home state raised doubts about the validity of any such investigation He demanded to know how exactly FERC established just and reasonable rates When the Commissioners failed to present a satisfactory answer he complained how can you hold someone accountable to a standard you dont know and suggested the investigation was unconstitutional

Billion Is Alleged MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetUSASCII ContentDisposition inline The California ISO has leaked to the press that it is filing a study at FERC today presumably this will be part of the ISOs comments regarding FERC Staffs Market Mitigation and Monitoring Plan that shows that five major instate power suppliers Reliant Energy Dynegy WilliamsAES Duke Energy and Mirant formerly Southern Energy plus power importers have overcharged for power The ISOs finger appears to be pointed primarily at the five major instate generators Thursday March Energy Overcharge of Billion Is Alleged Power Money should be refunded to taxpayers and utilities the state grid operator says citing evidence of market manipulation Suppliers deny the accusation By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS Times Staff Writers Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California by about billion between May and last month and that money should be refunded to the states taxpayers and financially strapped utilities the state power grid operator said Wednesday Generators engaged in market manipulation and consistent patterns of bidding far above costs in the deregulated energy market the California Independent System Operator found in a study of pricing data The findings support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additional revenue by manipulating the market Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation The study prepared for a filing with federal regulators today is central to CalISOs efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the states energy crisis This might be the first time we told them the total impact and magnitude of the overcharging said Anjali Sheffrin CalISOs director of market analysis We think the entire amount deserves consideration for refunds Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity sales CalISO found that five companies that together supply about of the power delivered to customers of the states investorowned utilities engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices even though they could have made some money selling more electricity Less frequently they had power generation available but did not bid at all The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their electricity at twice their cost For example Sheffrin said the average markup in August was during peak hours A spokeswoman at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which oversees wholesale electricity pricing across the country declined to comment Wednesday saying This is part of an ongoing proceeding FERC member William L Massey who has considered previous commission actions on refunds to be inadequate said it would be improper for him to comment on a report that has not yet been filed But when told of the billion total Massey said That doesnt shock me in any way Prices over the past months in California have greatly exceeded the federal standards of just and reasonable prices and I think they have exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars he said CalISO which oversees grid operations and an emergency energy market previously detailed million in alleged overcharges for December and January and asked FERC for refunds But the commission has proposed refunds of only a tiny fraction of that amount The study covered five major instate power suppliersReliant Energy Dynegy WilliamsAES Duke Energy and Mirant formerly Southern Energyplus power importers all of which deliver power to customers of Pacific Gas Electric Co Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric Co All overcharged but some excessively and some by moderate amounts Sheffrin said CalISOs public filing will quantify the alleged overcharging by each company but the companies will be identified only by a number The code will be provided to FERC Sheffrin said and CalISO lawyers will determine how much information about the companies will be made public State US Investigations California electricity markets and the companies that buy and sell power in the state have been the subject of several investigations by state and federal authorities since wholesale electricity prices first skyrocketed in May Electricity suppliers have repeatedly denied manipulating the California market in any way whether through abovecost bidding in spot markets or through physical withholding of electricity to drive up prices Reliant Energy is cooperating with FERCs requests for more data and is confident the commission will conclude that prices charged by Reliant were justified said Joe Bob Perkins president of the Houstonbased company Perkins also bitterly disputed charges that Reliant has shut down units so that it can earn bigger profits on the power sold by the remaining plants These charges have been leveled against all of the powerplant owners in the state Reliant Vice President John Stout said CalISOs calculations typically dont include such fixed costs as salaries taxes and the interest on bonds they sold to finance their power plants which they acquired under terms of the states landmark deregulation law In addition he said many highpriced power days have resulted from buyers bidding against each other for scarce supplies rather than sellers charging excessive amountslike a house price being driven far above the listing price in a hot real estate market Williams Energy Services a trading company that markets most of the power produced by plants owned by AES also says it will be exonerated by FERC once the commission examines documentation being submitted said Paula HillCollins spokeswoman for the Tulsa Okla company FERC has the obligation to investigate when these accusations are made HillCollins said This is just a process of justification not necessarily proof of guilt WilliamsAES was recently ordered by FERC to prove that it did not take generating units out of service last year to drive up electricity prices or refund million to California utilities During the period studied suppliers sold electricity in the California Power Exchange to Southern California Edison PGE and San Diego Gas Electric Co and in a backup market for lastminute electricity operated by CalISO But skyhigh prices plunged Edison and PGE deeply into debt and most suppliers stopped selling to them in January forcing the state Department of Water Resources to step in as the primary electricity buyer for the three big utilities million customers The CalISO study first summarized at an energy conference last week at UC Berkeley but not otherwise publicized concluded that the companies exercised socalled market power to pump up electricity prices Severin Borenstein director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley said CalISOs study is consistent with his research examining pricing practices in We found several billion dollars in departures from competitive pricing he said When the market was tight this summer they were able to push up prices and they did The early warning signs of electricity price spikes the study found appeared in May after two years of relatively stable prices of to per megawatthour under deregulation Prices went up during the summer dipped in September and October with lower demand then took off in November and December as weather turned cold and the price of natural gas which is used to generate much of the states electricity reached record levels There were plant outages and demand and supply became close Sheffrin said Whatever price they bid had to be taken and market power asserted itself CalISO found that billion of the alleged overcharges occurred between May and November On Friday federal regulators ordered six wholesale power suppliers to refund million to California if they cannot justify prices charged in February The refund was limited to power sold that month in excess of per megawatthour during Stage power alerts when supplies are so tight that rolling blackouts are threatened One megawatthour is enough electricity to supply typical homes for an hour The previous week FERC ordered suppliers to justify or refund million for power sold in January at prices above per megawatthour Massey opposed the potential refunds as too low because they were limited to hours in which a Stage power emergency was in place and because the benchmark price set for each month was too highcombining to exempt more than transactions from scrutiny Were still looking for our lost wallet under the lamppost which is Stage alerts said Massey one of three commissioners on the fivemember board two seats are vacant Generators have been given the free and clear he said These tinkling little refunds they have come out with recently are almost a joke said CalISO board member Mike Florio senior attorney at the Utility Reform Network Resisting Price Caps CalISO contends that the last months have proved that generators can no longer be allowed to receive electricity prices that are dictated by what the market will bear FERC granted marketbased rate authority on each of these suppliers own showing that they could not manipulate prices yet their actions have shown the contrary Sheffrin said We feel FERC needs to look at the premise of allowing these generators to continue selling at marketbased rates The commission is responsible for ensuring just and reasonable electricity rates Although it has called Californias power market dysfunctional and vulnerable to manipulation the agency has resisted setting firm price caps sought by Californias congressional delegation Chairman Curt L Hebert Jr strongly opposes caps while Massey wants to use caps across the West as a temporary timeout Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham in a New York news conference Wednesday reiterated his opposition to electricity price caps as a way to cope with Californias energy crisis If we put price caps in place there will be more blackouts and theyll be worse Abraham said CalISO is filing its market study as part of its comments on FERC staff recommendations on ways to thwart market manipulation FERCs proposal includes strict coordination of power plant outages by CalISO with reporting of suspicious closures to FERC and generatorbygenerator bid caps tied to costs Reiterman reported from San Francisco Rivera Brooks from Los Angeles Times staff writer Thomas S Mulligan in New York contributed to this story Copyright

charsetUSASCII ContentDisposition inline Apparently the ISO gave the LA Times a copy of the study being filed with FERC today The LA Times published it Thursday March AM ET Report Calif Overcharged for Power By DON THOMPSON Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO Calif AP Electricity wholesalers overcharged California billion over the past months according to a report by managers of the states power grid The five companies among other things frequently offered electricity at prices double what it cost them to produce concludes the California Independent System Operator news web sites study which was published Thursday in the Los Angeles Times All overcharged but some excessively and some by moderate amounts said Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs director of market analysis The Times said the ISO planned to file the study with federal regulators Thursday and are demanding that the money be paid back The companies denied the allegations adding they expect the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission news web sites will determine their prices were justified The commission has recently stepped up its scrutiny of power companies behavior during Californias power crisis asking suppliers to justify million in sales during the first two months of the year or refund the money Critics claim thousands of additional questionable sales are not being challenged The ISO study alleges the wholesalers manipulated the market by bidding at excessive prices effectively withholding supplies or by not bidding at all when they had generation capability available California has been spending about million a day billion since January to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co news web sites and Southern California Edison news web sites Both utilities the states largest have been cut off by electricity wholesalers because their credit is almost worthless State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the states powerbuying is gutting its budget surplus Since the state started making emergency power buys the surplus has fallen from billion to about billion she said A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major electricity wholesaler Reliant Energy Services to continue selling to California despite its fear that it will not be paid US District Judge Frank C Damrell Jr said Californians were at risk of irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the ISO which buys it at the last minute on behalf of utilities to bolster supplies and try to fend off rolling blackouts Such blackouts hit the state twice this week On Wednesday cooling temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed the state to avoid blackouts Standard Poors has put the state on a credit watch due to its power purchases and chastised Gov Gray Davis news web sites the Legislature and state regulators for not taking more aggressive steps to make sure the utilities can pay their bills Edison and PGE say they are nearly billion in debt due to soaring wholesale power costs The states deregulation law blocks them from recovering the costs from customers Connell ordered an audit of the states powerbuying saying Davis is withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature She said she would refuse to transfer billion into a rainy day fund she said was set up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue billion in revenue bonds to cover its power buys Transferring the money would leave the state general fund billion in debt Connell said She called the scope of the proposed transfer unprecedented and said it amounted to a shell game that disguises the power purchases effect on the state budget Sandy Harrison spokesman for the state Department of Finance and Keely Bosler of the Legislative Analysts Office said such transfers are routine and required by law They put the states budget surplus at billion The law says she has to do it The law does not give her the power to demand that kind of audit information Harrison said Harrison said the states budget isnt in danger because it will be repaid with the revenue bonds Connells criticism of Davis a fellow Democrat won support from Assembly Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who may challenge Davis next year Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the states energy woes but cant

Carroll Subject California News Friday Evening March MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetUSASCII ContentDisposition inline Friday March pm Eastern Time PGE Corp Gets B Tax Refund SAN FRANCISCO AP PGE Corp disclosed Friday that it has received a billion tax refund and will hand over almost all the money to its nearly bankrupt utility The San Franciscobased company said it will give billion to Pacific Gas and Electric Co the utility whose losses last year triggered the refund By turning over the refund to its subsidiary PGE is following the suggestion of a stateordered audit released in January The holding company hasnt always been so generous with its utility PGE pocketed a million overpayment that the utility made on its taxes according to the audit by the BarringtonWellesley Group Inc With the refund Pacific Gas and Electrics cash reserves rose to billion but the utility still doesnt have enough money to pay hundreds of increasingly testy creditors The utility has been on the financial ropes for months because wholesale electricity prices have been far higher than retail prices since last May As of Jan Pacific Gas and Electric said it had run up an billion debt buying electricity Pacific Gas and Electric plans to use some of the tax refund to maintain the operations that enable the utility to continue delivering power to its customers Friday March pm Eastern Time Giant Calif Utility Gets Cash Lifeline By Andrew Quinn SAN FRANCISCO Reuters Californias largest utility shoved to the brink of bankruptcy by the states power crisis received a billion lifeline on Friday as its parent company turned over a massive federal tax refund to keep operations going Pacific Gas Electrics financial boost from parent PGE Corp NYSEPCG news will provide the giant utility with desperately needed funds to keep serving its million customers as the states political leaders struggle over a bailout package In a glimmer of optimism corporate executives said on Friday that a bailout deal might be edging closer But the cash infusion and bailout progress came amid growing concern over the financial health of Californias two major utilities amid a crisis fueled by the disastrous state electricity deregulation law that forced the utilities to buy power on the spot market but refused them the right to pass the higher prices on to consumers On Friday Pacific Gas Electric said it would make good on only a segment of debt payments due on April adding to the mountain of unpaid paper the utility has stacked up Southern California Edison the states number two utility said it would fight any effort to push it into involuntary bankruptcy In Washington meanwhile federal regulators ordered six generators to either justify why their prices were so high or refund million to California utilities for overpriced wholesale power sales in February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC move followed a similar million refund order against the same six generators last week for their January sales boosting California critics who have alleged that outofstate profiteers have exacerbated the states critical energy shortages The crisis led power managers to impose rolling blackouts across parts of the state twice in January and federal Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said on Thursday he believed more blackouts appeared inevitable this summer as air conditioning pushes power demand sharply higher in the state PGE VOICES OPTIMISM Both Pacific Gas Electric and its No rival Edison International NYSEEIX news unit Southern California Edison have been fighting a losing financial battle because the power deregulation law blocks them from passing along soaring wholesale energy costs to consumers As a result the utilities are well over billion in debt and say they simply do not have the money to continue purchasing power for their customers California Gov Gray Davis facing one of the worst economic crises ever to hit the nations richest and most populous state has crafted a rescue package which involves both emergency state purchases of power and an elaborate bailout for the utilities But that bailout hinging on the state buying the utilities vast network of transmission lines has run into trouble as negotiations bog down over the price of the deal On Friday however PGE Corp Chief Financial Officer Peter Darbee told a teleconference with investors that the talks were on track We are making pretty good progress and have moved to the point where a greater level of detail is being negotiated with Davis he said adding that he was cautiously optimistic a deal could be reached Darbee also said the talks had taken on a quickening pace of activity as pressure builds to find a solution to the states power emergency The income tax refund raised the utilitys cash on hand to billion but officials said that once all of the utilitys debts were tallied it would still be billion in the red PGE said on Friday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission it would make quarterly interest payments on its commercial paper due April but would deferring a quarterly payment on preferred securities CONTINUED CONCERN AT SOCAL EDISON Concern this week focused on Southern California Edison where a number of unsecured creditors mostly small power generators who rely heavily on income from the utility began considering plans to push the utility into involuntary bankruptcy Officials at the utilitys parent company said on Friday they believed Southern California Edison was in a strong position to fight involuntary bankruptcy which they said would cause the states power crisis to spin out of control We believe we have solid grounds on which to oppose said Barbara Mathews an assistant general counsel for SoCal Edison in an investor conference call We believe that bankruptcy court intervention isnt necessary or in anyones best interest right now Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver said the solution to the utilities woes is very much tied up in the political process but said it should come soon Peoples patience is getting short We really need a solution and we need it soon he said Wall Street which has been watching Californias lurching efforts to resolve its energy crisis clearly agrees Edison International shares closed on the New York Stock Exchange down or percent at less than half their week high of PGE shares closed on the Big Board down or percent at compared to their week high of Friday March pm Eastern Time Judge delays ruling on Calif emergency power sales SACRAMENTO Calif March Reuters A federal judge on Friday delayed until next week his decision on whether to extend an order requiring four independent energy companies to sell electricity to the California power grid operator US District Court Judge Frank Damrell put the case on hold until March following a lengthy hearing Friday in which lawyers for Reliant Energy Inc NYSEREI news Williams Cos Inc NYSEWMB news AES Corp NYSEAES news and Dynegy Inc NYSEDYN news argued their companies should be released from an order to sell power to the California Independent System Operator ISO citing fears of not being paid Utility industry and government officials said Damrell was widely expected to extend the order a move that would keep in place a Feb restraining order requiring Reliant to continue emergency sales to the ISO The order was later expanded to include the other suppliers on the strength of state lawyers arguments that the power was needed to avoid blackouts Back in January when a severe lack of electricity triggered two days of rolling blackouts the ISO was thrust into the position of securing emergency power on a daily basis to close the gap between surging demand and scant supplies The four energy merchants have repeatedly argued before Judge Damrell that deals with the ISO poses a major credit risk The ISOs credit rating was badly damaged when two of its biggest customers the utility subsidiaries of PGE Corp NYSEPCG news and Edison International NYSEEIX news ran out of cash earlier this year buying electricity in the regions volatile spot market Facing a combined billion debt the two utilities now depend on the longterm contracts negotiated on their behalf by the states Department of Water Resources and spot market purchases by the ISO to supplement power generated at their own plants The Department of Water Resources does not pose the same thorny problem for the energy merchants as the ISO since it draws on the states still solid credit rating Meanwhile the ISO which oversees about percent of the California transmission grid is currently buying up to megawatts of power a day enough to supply four million homes to make up for what has not already been secured through contracts At todays hearing lawyers for AES Williams and Dynegy told the court the three companies had volunteered to extend their sales to the ISO prior to Fridays hearing Houstonbased Reliant said it was willing to abide by an extended interim agreement with the ISO through May Friday March pm Eastern Time SoCal Edison says ready to fight any forced bankruptcy By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK March Reuters Southern California Edison one of the two utilities struggling to survive Californias power crisis said on Friday it is in a strong position to fight off a push by some of its creditors to force it into involuntary bankruptcy The utilitys parent Edison International NYSEEIX news made its statements late on Friday a day its shares fell almost percent The decline follows a federal court ruling this week that Caithness Energy one of SoCal Edisons unsecured power providers could place a lien on the utilitys Mojave power plant It also came after reports surfaced that Coram Energy another provider is circulating a petition among five other providers to push SoCal Edison into bankruptcy involuntarily so that it can get paid for power it has already provided The push comes at a time California legislature is reportedly stalled on talks to allow SoCal Edison the states No utility and No utility Pacific Gas Electric Co to recoup more than billion of wholesale power costs they cannot collect because of a rate freeze imposed under Californias failed utility deregulation The cash crunch has already triggered periodic rolling blackouts in the nations most populous state We believe we have solid grounds on which to oppose an involuntary bankruptcy filing said Barbara Mathews an assistant general counsel for SoCal Edison in an investor conference call conducted by Rosemead Califbased Edison International We believe that bankruptcy court intervention isnt necessary or in anyones best interest right now A bankruptcy filing would cause Californias power crisis to spin out of control said Ted Craver Edison Internationals chief financial officer in the call The solution is very much tied up in the political process he said Peoples patience is getting short We really need a solution and we need it soon SoCal Edison which serves million Californians and Pacific GE which serves million and their parents have already missed a variety of payments or are otherwise in default of various agreements POWER GENERATORS ORDERED TO REFUND MILLION Pacific GE said on Friday in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission it intends on April to make quarterly interest payments on its commercial paper but is deferring a quarterly payment on preferred securities PGE said in another filing it had transferred billion of its billion tax refund to the utility Meanwhile the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday ordered six power generators to refund million to the utilities for overpriced February wholesale power sales Edison International shares closed on the New York Stock Exchange down or percent at PGE shares closed on the Big Board down or percent at In the conference call Craver also questioned an article from Dow Jones News Service suggesting that negotiations with California legislators are going nowhere The article quoted an unnamed senior SoCal Edison executive as saying negotiations by California with its three investorowned utilities to buy their power lines will never see the light of day The executive also reportedly said SoCal Edison which agreed in principle last month to sell its part of Californias power grid to the state for billion is nowhere closer to a final agreement The pace of negotiations has certainly slowed down Craver said but added I dont think that a number of those statements there accurately reflect whats going on We are in active discussions with the Governors office Were scratching our heads to determine who this mysterious person is who made these comments Craver said SoCal Edison meanwhile decided on Friday to make an million payment on first mortgage bonds it had missed days ago in order to avoid having to repay million of principal immediately Separately he said Edison International and its utility unit remain in discussions with bankers who had agreed to forbear or not act upon defaults on three credit lines through Wednesday Our bank forbearance agreement expired two days ago said Craver We have initiated discussions with the banks earlier this week Those discussions continue

General Electric Company Reliant Energy Services the Mirant Corporation and Williams Energy Services to either provide the identified refund amounts million or defend the prices charged Below is the New York Times article about this latest action by FERC March US Orders Power Suppliers to Justify Prices in California By JOSEPH KAHN WASHINGTON March Federal regulators told power suppliers in Californias volatile electricity market today to refund million to sta te utilities unless they could justify prices that regulators called excessive The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued the refund notice which affected six leading electricity generators to cover the month of February Last Friday it issued a similar order reviewing sales in January In that action the agency asked generators either to justify or refund million in sales The refund mandates are part of a new push by the commission to intervene i n Californias troubled electricity market State and national political leaders have put pressure on the agency to use its authority it has the obligation to insure just and reasonable electricity rates nationwide to limit skyrocketing prices while the state tries to unravel its failed effor t at deregulation The agency has indicated that it will also scrutinize electricity transactions in March and April possibly forcing refunds if it finds that generators have charged rates above what the agency determines to be their highest costs of production While the intervention has won support from some California officials and t he Bush administration the agencys orders have been criticized as too narrow by some California market watchers and one of the federal agencys commissioners The agency decided to apply a so called rate screen effectively a price cap to electricity transactions that occur during Californias Stage emergencies Emergencies are declared when electricity supplies fall to within percent of demand The agency has said that generators are most likely to charge excessive prices when supplies are tightest But California has seen similarly high prices even when it is not forced to declare a Stage emergency California officials say They have criticized the agency for effectively blessing the profits generators have made during those nonemergency periods by excluding them from the universe of potential refunds The agency has also imposed a relatively high rate screen a proxy nu mber intended to simulate the operating costs of the states most inefficient generating plants on all sellers of electricity during crisis hours California officials had urged the agency to investigate the actual costs o f individual generators and compare them to the prices they charged tailorin g penalties to the behavior of each generator In January the commission set the rate screen at per megawatt hour In February the screen rose to per megawatthour The commission said in a statement that higher natural gas prices accounted for some of the increase This sounds like a step backward instead of the aggressive action we need from FERC said Senator Dianne Feinstein Democrat of California referrin g to the agency Before the energy crisis started in California electricity was selling at an average wholesale cost of a megawatthour Senator Feinstein said And now FERC is saying a baseline of a megawatthour is a reasonable cost Something is really wrong here Agency officials declined to comment on the rationale behind their order The refunds to date are a small fraction of total electricity sales in the state California officials using a different methodology and a different time frame to calculate price abuses had asked the agency to force refunds of million for December and January California utility executives have estimated that unless prices are abated much more aggressively in coming months the state could end up paying a billion electricity bill in compared with billion last year The latest refund notice named Duke Energy Trading and Marketing Dynegy Power Marketing Portland General Electric Company Reliant Energy Services the Mirant Corporation and Williams Energy Services six of the countrys largest power marketers Dynegy was asked to justify or refund millio n in sales and Williams was asked to defend or rebate million Spokesmen for the companies named have said that their

Client Privilege and Work Product As you may already know the CPUC filed a motion at FERC asking for a protective order and to compel production of the information they subpoened from us in the CPUCs OII case Given the timing we should discuss this on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow They request that we be required to answer their motion on Thursday to provide the information within working days of a FERC ordering production and to provide of PL information and spread sheets detailing our deals specifically delivery point delivery date counterparty volume and price We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for the information to be provided for government eyes only this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself visavis other market participants a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to share this information with the CPUC for purposes of the PUCs OII proceeding pursuant to USC hc USC gc requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities We should argue that USC hc does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the Commissions decision to allow the UDCs unfettered access to the forwards market This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can get information about the

LIMITING PRICES state buyers cartel with Northwest could create leverage Lynda Gledhill Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Thursday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifilecaMNDTL More blackouts but no ransom payments for energy gougers thats a deal looking increasingly attractive to California lawmakers and consumer advocates The idea which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the cautious interest of Gov Gray Davis is for the state to set a firm ceiling on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer and not one dime more The tradeoff would be certain blackouts possibly more than if the state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand Some advocates of the idea think that California could minimize the number of blackout hours and gain a measure of control over the energy crisis by scheduling service interruptions We need to stop this game of electricity chicken said Michael Shames director of the Utility Consumers Action Network which first proposed the idea We are likely to see blackouts this summer we should use them to our advantage rather than be victimized by them The plan calls for creating a buyers cartel of California Oregon and Washington Essentially the states would decide at what price they were willing to buy power and refuse to purchase once it tops that level The state has spent billion on energy purchases since January and at one point during last weeks power shortage was spending per megawatt hour more than times what Davis has planned on for this summer That kind of spending cannot go on Democratic Assemblyman Fred Keeley of Boulder Creek said yesterday The question is can we sustain the level of spending we have and have the state maintain economic stability I believe the answer is no said Keeley the lower houses main figure on energy policy and author of the bill that put the state in the powerbuying business To get this problem solved we have to think in bold terms said Keeley who introduced a resolution along with fellow Democratic Assemblyman Paul Koretz of West Hollywood that urged Davis to form a cartel THREE STATES ARE BETTER THAN ONE Davis said last week that my bias would be to keep the lights on at any price But yesterday the governor said a temporary price limit is certainly a matter weve talked about and considered at some length The next step will be to see how the governors of Oregon and Washington respond to it A spokesman for Gov Gary Locke of Washington said the matter is being considered Calls to the office of Oregon Gov John Kitzhaber were not returned The idea has appeal among some consumers who believe as many state officials do that California is being gouged for electricity I can see if our bills were or more but this is ridiculous said Kimberly Chambers an yearold fashion design student from Oakland Whatever it takes I dont think we should have to pay for more But Yunah Kim who moved to the Bay Area from New York a month ago said blackouts should not even be considered The infrastructure of government is coming apart and its the basic service government is able to provide she said Businesses are not going to put up with that Its very shortsighted We just have to pay until theres a solution Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley said blackouts might be worse than supporters of price limits believe I think they power companies would call our bluff and sell their electricity elsewhere Borenstein said I dont think the state has the ability to credibly commit to paying no more than X That would be a very controversial decision Legislation is already in the works to give Davis the ability to enter into a West Coast buyers cartel A bill sponsored by state Sen Dede Alpert D Coronado would allow the Independent System Operator to refuse to buy power if it is too expensive The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula based on such things as the cost of natural gas A reasonable profit for power producers would be built in supporters said LOOKING FOR SOME CONTROL Alpert said everyone wants to avoid blackouts but that seems unlikely Everybody I talked to once you establish that there will be blackouts both businesses and residents say lets have control Alpert said The California Manufacturers and Technology Association which commissioned a recent report that said unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy billion and jobs is considering whether scheduled interruptions would be less harmful The problem if we do scheduled blackouts is that we may have an inordinate amount of blackouts said Gino DeCaro a spokesman for the group NO EASY TASK The ISO which runs the states power grid is scheduled to issue a report tomorrow on how scheduled blackouts might work Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Ray said that planning blackouts is not as easy as it sounds The difficulty is a pragmatic one the circuits are not wired to deal with choices like we are having to make said Bowen who has been holding hearings on how the state might better manage blackouts Maybe we should be paying people to turn off their fuse box Bowen said Chronicle staff writer

Bradley To Paul Fox Patrick Oxford Subject In an Era of Deregulation Enron Woos Regulators More Than Ever MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetusascii ContentDisposition inline FYI in case you didnt see this on Friday Marc Racicot and BP are mentioned May In an Era of Deregulation Enron Woos Regulators More Than Ever By Bob Davis and Rebecca Smith Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON Every energy executive in America would have liked a halfhour with Vice President Dick Cheney as he fashioned the Bush administrations national energy program Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay got it Mr Lay used the time to set out an eightpoint agenda intended among other things to head off price controls on wholesale electricity provide Enron and other energy traders with unfettered access to the nations electricitytransmission system and remove regulatory obstacles to building new generating plants and power lines The energy plan President Bush unveiled Thursday reflected many of those same priorities In an interview last week the vice president said he also met with other energy executives but Mr Lay was the only one he named Mr Cheney says he sought Mr Lays advice because Enron has a different take than most energy companies Indeed Enron Corp is a modern paradox It has transformed itself over the past years from a stodgy gaspipeline operator into the nations largest trader of gas and electricity and a formidable player in newer markets such as telecommunications services and emissionsreduction credits Today its the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets Yet as much as any company in the US it has cultivated close ties with government Since the late s the Houstonbased company which was President George W Bushs biggest corporate campaign donor has beefed up its lobbying staff boosted its political contributions and sought out friends in the world of politics Now with Mr Bush in the White House it is in a unique position to see whether those efforts will pay off Enrons lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of deregulation Just as government created immense telephone electric and gas monopolies early in the last century Enron and other players feel they need the governments help in opening up those monopolies and gaining access to onceclosed markets In particular Enron wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure that energy is deregulated on terms favorable to the company Rather than having the nations transmission lines controlled by the utilities it wants those lines to provide open access for new entrants such as Enron eager to buy and sell power Mr Lay is on a firstname basis with a halfdozen members of the Bush cabinet and knows many senior White House staffers from their days in the Texas governors mansion with Mr Bush Before joining the administration both White House economist Lawrence Lindsey and US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick were on Enrons advisory board which pays members an annual stipend of Under Mr Lay Enron has donated nearly million to Mr Bush during his political career Since the start of the campaign Enron and its employees have contributed million to the Bush presidential drive the Republican Party and the presidential inauguration says the Center for Responsive Politics Enron also accounted for in contributions during Mr Bushs two runs for governor according to the Center for Public Integrity Mr Lay who holds a doctorate in economics says all he wants from government is a fair shake Enron supports candidates you believe in he says You believe in their value system you believe in their philosophy and you believe theyll do the right things as leaders But its clear that Mr Lay wants more than that from government For now he is focusing on FERC where he worked in the early s when the agency was known as the Federal Power Commission He hopes to make FERC his ally in beating back the power of utilities Long dismissed as a regulatory backwater overseeing wholesale transactions by electric and gas utilities the commission has emerged as the chief navigator of the nations transition to a fully deregulated energy marketplace Even before Mr Bush took office FERC had begun to rein in the market power of utilities In December FERC told the nations utilities that it wanted them to voluntarily surrender their highvoltage lines those that can dispatch electricity across state lines to independent grid operators such as those already in place in California and the Northeast which would provide open access to the lines Although it told the utilities to submit plans for doing so many of them have been reluctant to relinquish control of their lines to such independent organizations Mr Lay wants FERC to go further forcing the utilities to cede direct control of their lines He also is seeking rules that would end what he calls energy balkanization and create seamless interstate electricity markets Enron is the biggest gas and electric company entirely dependent on the competitive side of the business says Andre Meade an analyst for Commerzbank To the extent deregulation slows down their business slows down Right now its a lucrative strategy Enron typically targets tightly controlled markets just as they are opening up using its financial clout and riskmanagement savvy to gain a dominant market position In doing so it frequently portrays itself as an insurgent taking on entrenched interests In electricity for instance Enron buys the output of generating plants sometimes days weeks or years before the power is actually produced Using sophisticated weather data it determines the most lucrative market for the power finds a buyer and then arranges delivery via transmission lines owned by others It hedges its positions with other contracts Its wholesale trading volume climbed for natural gas and more than doubled for electricity in the first quarter alone Such growth pushed Enrons wholesale energytrading income before taxes and interest up more than threefold to million during the first quarter Between and Enrons yearly net income nearly doubled to million and its revenue increased almost eightfold to billion Over the same period Enrons stock price adjusted for splits rose more than fourfold At the start of the Bush administration FERCs future was very much up for grabs Two of the five seats on the commission were vacant and Enron quickly sought to fill them with activist Republicans President Bush named a friend of his and Enrons to one of those seats Texas utilityregulator Pat Wood Mr Wood had worked closely with Enron during a sixyear effort to open Texas retail electricity market Mr Wood also had shown the kind of backbone Enron wanted in a separate fight over telephone deregulation when he insisted on closely monitoring phone utilities to make sure they opened their networks to competitors Higher Profile For the second slot Enron backed Nora Mead Brownell a Pennsylvania utility regulator She had come to Enrons aid in when she voted to block an electricitymarket restructuring plan backed by Philadelphias utility and by GOP Gov Tom Ridge Enron argued that the plan would have locked it out of the Philadelphia market Enron worked to raise Ms Brownells visibility by lobbying the House Commerce Committee to include her as an expert witness on energy issues and as a member of an informal advisory group say Enron and congressional aides Mr Lay provided heavyweight support He says Enron included Ms Brownells name on its priority list of a halfdozen prospective FERC nominees And when her candidacy ran into opposition from Pennsylvania officials with bitter memories of her decision Mr Lay says he phoned Karl Rove the White Houses top political strategist to tell him that she was a strong force in getting the right outcome in Pennsylvania A White House spokeswoman says that a number of individuals and industry groups weighed in favor of Ms Brownell but she declined to name any Ms Brownell says she was unaware of any concerted Enron campaign on her behalf She didnt ask the White House who had supported her because she says I didnt want to be beholden Meanwhile Enron was using its Democratic contacts to strengthen its ties with Linda Breathitt a Kentucky Democrat on the commission Earlier this spring the company hired two of former Vice President Al Gores closest friends as lobbyists Nashville lawyer Charles Bones and Mr Gores campaignfinance director Johnny Hayes Both had come to know Ms Breathitt through Democratic politics Ms Breathitt says she wasnt very familiar with Enrons interests but that she accepted when Mr Hayes invited her to dinner at a Washington restaurant in April to meet Richard Shapiro Enrons managing director for government affairs Everyone likes to get to know the FERC commissioners Ms Breathitt says adding that she always pays for her own meals Enron has long played this kind of insiders game Mr Lay has been friendly with both Democratic and Republican administrations over the past years sharing time on the links with Presidents Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford Hes been a particularly close friend of the Bush family In the late s he ran thenVice President George HW Bushs fundraising drives in Texas After the younger Bush became governor he appointed Mr Lay to run the influential Governors Business Council Mr Lay also made Enrons fleet of corporate jets available to the new governor and won his help in lobbying officials considering Enron projects In March Mr Lay wrote Gov Bush to ask that he lobby the Texas congressional delegation to support exportfinance credits critical to Enron according to letters released by the Texas State Archivists office In April when Enron was negotiating a billion naturalgas joint venture in Uzbekistan Mr Lay wrote to thank the governor for meeting with the Uzbekistani ambassador to the US Six months later another Lay thankyou note concerned a phone call Mr Bush made to Pennsylvania Gov Ridge to support Enrons plan to enter the Philadelphia electricity market I am certain it will have a positive impact Mr Lay wrote Mr Lay says he hasnt sought Mr Bushs aid directly since Mr Bush won the presidency Last month he talked with the president briefly at a Houston benefit for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy on which Mr Lay serves as cochairman Its not a matter of us going off hunting or fishing or sitting around and having drinks he says Not all Mr Lays initiatives have been successful When Mr Bush reneged in March on a campaign pledge to fight global warming by requiring reductions in carbondioxide levels produced by burning hydrocarbons Mr Lay says he telephoned Mr Cheney to complain The scientific evidence although certainly not conclusive is pretty compelling that there could be a climatechange problem he says he told the vice president The administration should still look very seriously at it Around the same time Mr Lay also called Mr Rove the White House political adviser to urge him to talk to Fred Krupp the head of the moderate Environmental Defense Fund Messrs Krupp and Rove spoke briefly but found little common ground Later Enron which has plans to add emission credits to the commodities it trades joined a coalition urging mandatory reductions in carbondioxide levels But Enron saved its main lobbying push for Mr Cheneys energy task force In April Mr Lay met with the panels staff director Andrew Lundquist and later with Mr Cheney whom Mr Lay had come to know well when the vice president was chief of Halliburton Co a Dallas construction company We built Enron Field together says Mr Lay referring to Houstons new ballpark In both meetings say Enron and White House officials Mr Lay presented a broad agenda for opening up the nations electrical system and used the gastransmission system as a point of comparison In both cases he argues pipelines and transmission lines should be like the federal highway system that offers easy access to all Finding the Bottlenecks The Cheney report uses similar language describing the electrical grid as the highway for interstate commerce in electricity As Enron sought the report directs the energy secretary to determine by the end of the year whether it makes sense to establish a national grid and to identify bottlenecks in the transmission system as well as how to remove them An effort to make the grid national would enhance FERCs power as Enron has urged The report is mum on some Enron concerns such as requiring utilities to join regional transmission organizations an idea strongly opposed by the utility industry A White House aide says the task force didnt want to get involved in such battles between industries As solid as its support in the White House has turned out to be Enron is worried about the backlash against electricity deregulation in Western states and possibly in New York should electricity rates surge this summer Nevada repealed its deregulation law last month spooked by the way skyrocketing wholesaleelectricity prices in neighboring California were undermining the Golden States economy California and Oregon are contemplating stategovernment purchases of major utility assets Enrons biggest fear is that the political pressure will lead the states or perhaps Congress to control prices which could undermine Enrons business In response Enron has formed a coalition with eight other energy marketers in New York who each have pledged to pay for a media and lobbying campaign It also has hired former Montana Gov Marc Racicot and dispatched him to court Western politicians Two weeks ago Mr Racicot had breakfast with an old colleague Oregons Democratic Gov John Kitzhaber After the two chatted about flyfishing says Mr Kitzhaber Marc did say he was working to reenergize the discussion about energy and had some ideas for a framework the governors might want to consider Though Mr Kitzhaber says he knew that Mr Racicot had joined the Washington DC lobbying firm Bracewell Patterson Mr Racicot didnt disclose that he was on retainer to Enron and the star of Enrons Western states advocacy team For his part Mr Racicot says he was working not at Enrons direction but with their knowledge to advance positions that he too feels are important Jeffrey White

LIMITING PRICES state buyers cartel with Northwest could create leverage Lynda Gledhill Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Thursday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifilecaMNDTL More blackouts but no ransom payments for energy gougers thats a deal looking increasingly attractive to California lawmakers and consumer advocates The idea which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the cautious interest of Gov Gray Davis is for the state to set a firm ceiling on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer and not one dime more The tradeoff would be certain blackouts possibly more than if the state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand Some advocates of the idea think that California could minimize the number of blackout hours and gain a measure of control over the energy crisis by scheduling service interruptions We need to stop this game of electricity chicken said Michael Shames director of the Utility Consumers Action Network which first proposed the idea We are likely to see blackouts this summer we should use them to our advantage rather than be victimized by them The plan calls for creating a buyers cartel of California Oregon and Washington Essentially the states would decide at what price they were willing to buy power and refuse to purchase once it tops that level The state has spent billion on energy purchases since January and at one point during last weeks power shortage was spending per megawatt hour more than times what Davis has planned on for this summer That kind of spending cannot go on Democratic Assemblyman Fred Keeley of Boulder Creek said yesterday The question is can we sustain the level of spending we have and have the state maintain economic stability I believe the answer is no said Keeley the lower houses main figure on energy policy and author of the bill that put the state in the powerbuying business To get this problem solved we have to think in bold terms said Keeley who introduced a resolution along with fellow Democratic Assemblyman Paul Koretz of West Hollywood that urged Davis to form a cartel THREE STATES ARE BETTER THAN ONE Davis said last week that my bias would be to keep the lights on at any price But yesterday the governor said a temporary price limit is certainly a matter weve talked about and considered at some length The next step will be to see how the governors of Oregon and Washington respond to it A spokesman for Gov Gary Locke of Washington said the matter is being considered Calls to the office of Oregon Gov John Kitzhaber were not returned The idea has appeal among some consumers who believe as many state officials do that California is being gouged for electricity I can see if our bills were or more but this is ridiculous said Kimberly Chambers an yearold fashion design student from Oakland Whatever it takes I dont think we should have to pay for more But Yunah Kim who moved to the Bay Area from New York a month ago said blackouts should not even be considered The infrastructure of government is coming apart and its the basic service government is able to provide she said Businesses are not going to put up with that Its very shortsighted We just have to pay until theres a solution Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley said blackouts might be worse than supporters of price limits believe I think they power companies would call our bluff and sell their electricity elsewhere Borenstein said I dont think the state has the ability to credibly commit to paying no more than X That would be a very controversial decision Legislation is already in the works to give Davis the ability to enter into a West Coast buyers cartel A bill sponsored by state Sen Dede Alpert D Coronado would allow the Independent System Operator to refuse to buy power if it is too expensive The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula based on such things as the cost of

Bradley To Paul Fox Patrick Oxford Subject In an Era of Deregulation Enron Woos Regulators More Than Ever MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetusascii ContentDisposition inline FYI in case you didnt see this on Friday Marc Racicot and BP are mentioned May In an Era of Deregulation Enron Woos Regulators More Than Ever By Bob Davis and Rebecca Smith Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON Every energy executive in America would have liked a halfhour with Vice President Dick Cheney as he fashioned the Bush administrations national energy program Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay got it Mr Lay used the time to set out an eightpoint agenda intended among other things to head off price controls on wholesale electricity provide Enron and other energy traders with unfettered access to the nations electricitytransmission system and remove regulatory obstacles to building new generating plants and power lines The energy plan President Bush unveiled Thursday reflected many of those same priorities In an interview last week the vice president said he also met with other energy executives but Mr Lay was the only one he named Mr Cheney says he sought Mr Lays advice because Enron has a different take than most energy companies Indeed Enron Corp is a modern paradox It has transformed itself over the past years from a stodgy gaspipeline operator into the nations largest trader of gas and electricity and a formidable player in newer markets such as telecommunications services and emissionsreduction credits Today its the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets Yet as much as any company in the US it has cultivated close ties with government Since the late s the Houstonbased company which was President George W Bushs biggest corporate campaign donor has beefed up its lobbying staff boosted its political contributions and sought out friends in the world of politics Now with Mr Bush in the White House it is in a unique position to see whether those efforts will pay off Enrons lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of deregulation Just as government created immense telephone electric and gas monopolies early in the last century Enron and other players feel they need the governments help in opening up those monopolies and gaining access to onceclosed markets In particular Enron wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure that energy is deregulated on terms favorable to the company Rather than having the nations transmission lines controlled by the utilities it wants those lines to provide open access for new entrants such as Enron eager to buy and sell power Mr Lay is on a firstname basis with a halfdozen members of the Bush cabinet and knows many senior White House staffers from their days in the Texas governors mansion with Mr Bush Before joining the administration both White House economist Lawrence Lindsey and US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick were on Enrons advisory board which pays members an annual stipend of Under Mr Lay Enron has donated nearly million to Mr Bush during his political career Since the start of the campaign Enron and its employees have contributed million to the Bush presidential drive the Republican Party and the presidential inauguration says the Center for Responsive Politics Enron also accounted for in contributions during Mr Bushs two runs for governor according to the Center for Public Integrity Mr Lay who holds a doctorate in economics says all he wants from government is a fair shake Enron supports candidates you believe in he says You believe in their value system you believe in their philosophy and you believe theyll do the right things as leaders But its clear that Mr Lay wants more than that from government For now he is focusing on FERC where he worked in the early s when the agency was known as the Federal Power Commission He hopes to make FERC his ally in beating back the power of utilities Long dismissed as a regulatory backwater overseeing wholesale transactions by electric and gas utilities the commission has emerged as the chief navigator of the nations transition to a fully deregulated energy marketplace Even before Mr Bush took office FERC had begun to rein in the market power of utilities In December FERC told the nations utilities that it wanted them to voluntarily surrender their highvoltage lines those that can dispatch electricity across state lines to independent grid operators such as those already in place in California and the Northeast which would provide open access to the lines Although it told the utilities to submit plans for doing so many of them have been reluctant to relinquish control of their lines to such independent organizations Mr Lay wants FERC to go further forcing the utilities to cede direct control of their lines He also is seeking rules that would end what he calls energy balkanization and create seamless interstate electricity markets Enron is the biggest gas and electric company entirely dependent on the competitive side of the business says Andre Meade an analyst for Commerzbank To the extent deregulation slows down their business slows down Right now its a lucrative strategy Enron typically targets tightly controlled markets just as they are opening up using its financial clout and riskmanagement savvy to gain a dominant market position In doing so it frequently portrays itself as an insurgent taking on entrenched interests In electricity for instance Enron buys the output of generating plants sometimes days weeks or years before the power is actually produced Using sophisticated weather data it determines the most lucrative market for the power finds a buyer and then arranges delivery via transmission lines owned by others It hedges its positions with other contracts Its wholesale trading volume climbed for natural gas and more than doubled for electricity in the first quarter alone Such growth pushed Enrons wholesale energytrading income before taxes and interest up more than threefold to million during the first quarter Between and Enrons yearly net income nearly doubled to million and its revenue increased almost eightfold to billion Over the same period Enrons stock price adjusted for splits rose more than fourfold At the start of the Bush administration FERCs future was very much up for grabs Two of the five seats on the commission were vacant and Enron quickly sought to fill them with activist Republicans President Bush named a friend of his and Enrons to one of those seats Texas utilityregulator Pat Wood Mr Wood had worked closely with Enron during a sixyear effort to open Texas retail electricity market Mr Wood also had shown the kind of backbone Enron wanted in a separate fight over telephone deregulation when he insisted on closely monitoring phone utilities to make sure they opened their networks to competitors Higher Profile For the second slot Enron backed Nora Mead Brownell a Pennsylvania utility regulator She had come to Enrons aid in when she voted to block an electricitymarket restructuring plan backed by Philadelphias utility and by GOP Gov Tom Ridge Enron argued that the plan would have locked it out of the Philadelphia market Enron worked to raise Ms Brownells visibility by lobbying the House Commerce Committee to include her as an expert witness on energy issues and as a member of an informal advisory group say Enron and congressional aides Mr Lay provided heavyweight support He says Enron included Ms Brownells name on its priority list of a halfdozen prospective FERC nominees And when her candidacy ran into opposition from Pennsylvania officials with bitter memories of her decision Mr Lay says he phoned Karl Rove the White Houses top political strategist to tell him that she was a strong force in getting the right outcome in Pennsylvania A White House spokeswoman says that a number of individuals and industry groups weighed in favor of Ms Brownell but she declined to name any Ms Brownell says she was unaware of any concerted Enron campaign on her behalf She didnt ask the White House who had supported her because she says I didnt want to be beholden Meanwhile Enron was using its Democratic contacts to strengthen its ties with Linda Breathitt a Kentucky Democrat on the commission Earlier this spring the company hired two of former Vice President Al Gores closest friends as lobbyists Nashville lawyer Charles Bones and Mr Gores campaignfinance director Johnny Hayes Both had come to know Ms Breathitt through Democratic politics Ms Breathitt says she wasnt very familiar with Enrons interests but that she accepted when Mr Hayes invited her to dinner at a Washington restaurant in April to meet Richard Shapiro Enrons managing director for government affairs Everyone likes to get to know the FERC commissioners Ms Breathitt says adding that she always pays for her own meals Enron has long played this kind of insiders game Mr Lay has been friendly with both Democratic and Republican administrations over the past years sharing time on the links with Presidents Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford Hes been a particularly close friend of the Bush family In the late s he ran thenVice President George HW Bushs fundraising drives in Texas After the younger Bush became governor he appointed Mr Lay to run the influential Governors Business Council Mr Lay also made Enrons fleet of corporate jets available to the new governor and won his help in lobbying officials considering Enron projects In March Mr Lay wrote Gov Bush to ask that he lobby the Texas congressional delegation to support exportfinance credits critical to Enron according to letters released by the Texas State Archivists office In April when Enron was negotiating a billion naturalgas joint venture in Uzbekistan Mr Lay wrote to thank the governor for meeting with the Uzbekistani ambassador to the US Six months later another Lay thankyou note concerned a phone call Mr Bush made to Pennsylvania Gov Ridge to support Enrons plan to enter the Philadelphia electricity market I am certain it will have a positive impact Mr Lay wrote Mr Lay says he hasnt sought Mr Bushs aid directly since Mr Bush won the presidency Last month he talked with the president briefly at a Houston benefit for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy on which Mr Lay serves as cochairman Its not a matter of us going off hunting or fishing or sitting around and having drinks he says Not all Mr Lays initiatives have been successful When Mr Bush reneged in March on a campaign pledge to fight global warming by requiring reductions in carbondioxide levels produced by burning hydrocarbons Mr Lay says he telephoned Mr Cheney to complain The scientific evidence although certainly not conclusive is pretty compelling that there could be a climatechange problem he says he told the vice president The administration should still look very seriously at it Around the same time Mr Lay also called Mr Rove the White House political adviser to urge him to talk to Fred Krupp the head of the moderate Environmental Defense Fund Messrs Krupp and Rove spoke briefly but found little common ground Later Enron which has plans to add emission credits to the commodities it trades joined a coalition urging mandatory reductions in carbondioxide levels But Enron saved its main lobbying push for Mr Cheneys energy task force In April Mr Lay met with the panels staff director Andrew Lundquist and later with Mr Cheney whom Mr Lay had come to know well when the vice president was chief of Halliburton Co a Dallas construction company We built Enron Field together says Mr Lay referring to Houstons new ballpark In both meetings say Enron and White

such as requiring utilities to join regional transmission organizations an idea strongly opposed by the utility industry A White House aide says the task force didnt want to get involved in such battles between industries As solid as its support in the White House has turned out to be Enron is worried about the backlash against electricity deregulation in Western states and possibly in New York should electricity rates surge this summer Nevada repealed its deregulation law last month spooked by the way skyrocketing wholesaleelectricity prices in neighboring California were undermining the Golden States economy California and Oregon are contemplating stategovernment purchases of major utility assets Enrons biggest fear is that the political pressure will lead the states or perhaps Congress to control prices which could undermine Enrons business In response Enron has formed a coalition with eight other energy marketers in New York who each have pledged to pay for a media and lobbying campaign It also has hired former Montana Gov Marc Racicot and dispatched him to court Western politicians Two weeks ago Mr Racicot had breakfast with an old colleague Oregons Democratic Gov John Kitzhaber After the two chatted about flyfishing says Mr Kitzhaber Marc did say he was working to reenergize the discussion about energy and had some ideas for a framework the governors might

didnt see this on Friday Marc Racicot and BP are mentioned May In an Era of Deregulation Enron Woos Regulators More Than Ever By Bob Davis and Rebecca Smith Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON Every energy executive in America would have liked a halfhour with Vice President Dick Cheney as he fashioned the Bush administrations national energy program Enron Corp Chairman Kenneth Lay got it Mr Lay used the time to set out an eightpoint agenda intended among other things to head off price controls on wholesale electricity provide Enron and other energy traders with unfettered access to the nations electricitytransmission system and remove regulatory obstacles to building new generating plants and power lines The energy plan President Bush unveiled Thursday reflected many of those same priorities In an interview last week the vice president said he also met with other energy executives but Mr Lay was the only one he named Mr Cheney says he sought Mr Lays advice because Enron has a different take than most energy companies Indeed Enron Corp is a modern paradox It has transformed itself over the past years from a stodgy gaspipeline operator into the nations largest trader of gas and electricity and a formidable player in newer markets such as telecommunications services and emissionsreduction credits Today its the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets Yet as much as any company in the US it has cultivated close ties with government Since the late s the Houstonbased company which was President George W Bushs biggest corporate campaign donor has beefed up its lobbying staff boosted its political contributions and sought out friends in the world of politics Now with Mr Bush in the White House it is in a unique position to see whether those efforts will pay off Enrons lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of deregulation Just as government created immense telephone electric and gas monopolies early in the last century Enron and other players feel they need the governments help in opening up those monopolies and gaining access to onceclosed markets In particular Enron wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure that energy is deregulated on terms favorable to the company Rather than having the nations transmission lines controlled by the utilities it wants those lines to provide open access for new entrants such as Enron eager to buy and sell power Mr Lay is on a firstname basis with a halfdozen members of the Bush cabinet and knows many senior White House staffers from their days in the Texas governors mansion with Mr Bush Before joining the administration both White House economist Lawrence Lindsey and US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick were on Enrons advisory board which pays members an annual stipend of Under Mr Lay Enron has donated nearly million to Mr Bush during his political career Since the start of the campaign Enron and its employees have contributed million to the Bush presidential drive the Republican Party and the presidential inauguration says the Center for Responsive Politics Enron also accounted for in contributions during Mr Bushs two runs for governor according to the Center for Public Integrity Mr Lay who holds a doctorate in economics says all he wants from government is a fair shake Enron supports candidates you believe in he says You believe in their value system you believe in their philosophy and you believe theyll do the right things as leaders But its clear that Mr Lay wants more than that from government For now he is focusing on FERC where he worked in the early s when the agency was known as the Federal Power Commission He hopes to make FERC his ally in beating back the power of utilities Long dismissed as a regulatory backwater overseeing wholesale transactions by electric and gas utilities the commission has emerged as the chief navigator of the nations transition to a fully deregulated energy

exception to any characterization of FERC action on governance as prompt That point passed many many months ago State FERC Pressure Builds To Make CalISO Board More Independent Political pressure to dismiss the current independent system operator ISO in California and replace the board with new members appears to be reaching a head Industry insiders believe that an order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to mandate a new board is imminent and cite the actions by the ISO during the energy crisis and in the months that have followed as reason for FERC commissioners to act promptly A bombshell was released last week by Rep Doug Ose RCA in a letter to FERC accusing the ISO and the California Department of Water Resources DWR of acting in tandem to such an extent that their dealings appear to be in collusion and prohibitive of actual independence Attached to the Ose letter was a confidential memo from energy advisor Eric Woychik to then ISO Board Governor Mike Florio Ose states in his letter to FERC that the memo clearly illustrates the perils of a lack of independence from an ISO The memo states that current DWR practices cause very large additional costs for purchases on behalf of UDC customers and this also compromises reliability There are three scenarios outlined in the memo that detail violations and increased costs for customers as a result of the alleged interdependence between the two entities At one point the memos author acknowledges the gravity of the situation by stating If the press Legislature or FERC get wind of this I think we are toast Woychik tells Electric Power Alert that he was trying to impress upon the ISO that if this gets loose the ISO officers and board members should be very embarrassed FERC Chairman Pat Wood tells Electric Power Alert that the commission currently has a motion before us to address the independence of the ISO A source monitoring the situation says We are hoping that FERC says the California ISO is not an independent board and comes out and says You shall appoint an independent board Insiders note that in the past month FERC has issued two orders adjusting CalISO behavior and is actively taking a role in rectifying energy oversight in that state In their Nov commission meeting FERC ordered the ISO to treat the DWR without preferential treatment and like any other market participant FERC says one informed California source needs to kill the current ISO board dismiss the lot This is fantastic Its the first appropriate action to take place says a California energy consultant about FERCs recent order According to the source this indicates that FERC will take the next step and require actual independence from the board Should FERC make that move the insider says they have a precedent to base the action on They did it with PJM early on They rejected two of their proposed boards because they said they werent independent enough Florio who is now with the consumer organization The Utility Reform Network TURN claims that the ISO is more independent than previous boards and has local oversight I think if you asked the average Californian whether an entity like the ISO should be appointed by the governor or independent under criteria set by FERC I think the vast majority would say governor appointment is preferable because there is some political accountability that way he told Electric Power Alert He goes on to state that having served on the ISO board and the previous stakeholder board he is in a position to say unequivocally that the current board gives ISO management much more free rein than the old board ever did According to the energy consultant Californians have an ace up our sleeves to force independence on the ISO board if FERC does not act swiftly California State Senator John Burton D pushed through legislation two months ago that the source says will ensure an independent board is in place in a few months An independent board will be chosen next year whose members will be subject to California state Senate confirmation says this source Sources point to the ISOs failure to follow up on the suggestions made

Lawmakers As Power Bond Deal Stalls Updated Thursday April PM ET By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesFrustrated by delays in securing regulatory decisions needed to support a massive issue of bonds to finance power purchases California Treasurer Phil Angelides Gov Gray Davis and several lawmakers are working on an end run through the state Legislature The group is putting together legislation aimed to be introduced in the state Assembly as early as Friday that will directly authorize the state to sell billion in revenue bonds in the process clearing the way for the state to close on billion in interim financing But there are pitfalls along that path as well raising new questions about when the bonds will be sold John Hallacy managing director for municipal bond research at Merrill Lynch Associates said the bond market is still expecting the sale but hes concerned that details on marketing of the bonds havent been released Hallacy said if the bond sale is delayed it will be a problem for the state Where will they get the money to buy power over the summer Hallacy said T he state has been working since February to put together a bond deal authorized by previous legislation but the effort has been hung up in part by the California Public Utilities Commissions difficulty carving revenue out of electricity rates to service the debt The commissions standing proposal for calculating the socalled California Procurement Adjustment the amount of electricity rate revenue available to the state has been appealed by the states struggling utilities which argue the plan would leave them unable to meet their own obligations The utilities effectively blocked the bond sale by appealing the PUCs action on how they calculated the CPA an aide to Angelides said So now were saying Lets sell the bonds by revising the law and go to the Legislature to get what we need Legislature No Slam Dunk Whether the legislative route proves more fruitful remains to be seen As reported Assembly Republicans said Wednesday that they wouldnt vote for the measure unless the governor releases details of the states longterm power contracts information the governor has thus far refused to divulge Republicans believe it is fiscally irresponsible for the Legislature to ask ratepayers to shoulder the extraordinary weight of a billion bond before the governor finally discloses what the ratepayers are getting in return Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox RFair Oaks said in a press release The treasurer needs Republican support if the bill is to win the twothirds majority it needs to be implemented immediately California has spent about billion since midJanuary buying power in place of the states cashstrapped utilities a total that is growing by about million a day The state needs to move ahead with the bridge financing and bond deal to repay the states general fund for power already purchased and to stretch out future power costs that cant be covered in full by electricity rates The situation is growing more urgent Citing the mounting and uncertain costs of Californias power crisis ratings agency Standard Poors lowered the rating on Californias general obligation bonds to A from AA Further delays of the bond issue could put the state in a bind SP said If the state cannot sell its proposed revenue bond as planned in a timely manner the potential effect on the states general fund could be severe without large further retail rate hikes beyond the sizable percentage increases recently implemented SP said Angelides has said that the states budget surplus will be depleted if legislation isnt passed allowing his office to sell the bonds In addition the clock on the states bridge financing deal is ticking Commitments from bankers to fund the loan are due May and the banks have said they wont sign up if the bond issue that will repay the bridge loan is in doubt Angelides has said Keely Seen As Backer Legislation needs to be introduced and passed and in days establishing the bond sale at billion Angelides said Tuesday His office said the treasurer has been in long meetings with legislators on the issue working with the governors office to drum up votes Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek will likely carry the bill ABX an aide in his office said Wednesday The governors staff is working with Keeley on draft language said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar Keeley didnt immediately return calls for comment Keeley is the author of ABX which authorized the state to purchase power on behalf of its cashstrapped utilities and issue bonds to pay for power going forward The authorization for the bonds however depends on a complicated calculation of the CPA which determines the funds available for debt service and ultimately the size of the issue PGE Corp PCG news msgs unit Pacific Gas Electric whose appeal is pending before the PUC said the Public Utilities Commissions calculations on the CPA grossly overstate the revenue that will be left over after the utility covers its costs The utility has since filed for bankruptcy protection raising further doubt about the states ability to tap the utilitys revenue for its own purposes The PUC is also waiting for the California Department of Water Resources which is handling the states power purchases to release details of its projected power costs the amount of power needed and how much money the agency expects to spend in the spot market for power Again the state reluctant to release that information The state has set a rough target of June for the bond sale to go forward although some have said it could be delayed until July or August Hallacy of Merrill Lynch said the bond market could deal if the sale was conducted after June because it will give it more time to prepare for the sale By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Jessica Berthold contributed to this article

ContentDisposition inline FYI Linda Stuntz is quoted in this article She characterized the RTO filing requirement as bizarre It appears to me that it is typical FERC behavior FERC likes to use whatever leverage it has to force compliance April Plan on California Energy Has No Shortage of Critics By JOSEPH KAHN WASHINGTON April A novel plan by federal regulators to control Californias runaway electricity prices is a messy politically motivated compromise that may offer some relief to consumers but will do little to fix the states dysfunctional energy market analysts said today The intervention announced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday night after much haggling was dismissed by a wide range of critics today as a flawed effort that satisfies no one It fell short of the sweeping suspension of regional electricity deregulation that California officials and some energy experts had advocated But it also crossed what has become a firm ideological line among Republican leaders including President Bush by imposing price controls on some electricity sales to utilities Under the agencys order which takes effect on May California regulators can begin to impose price controls on power generators when electricity supplies fall to within percent of consumer demand The state is expected to face such shortages routinely this summer and the order has the potential to shave billions of dollars off Californias electricity bill if implemented fully some people at the federal agency say The president has a longheld belief that price caps dont work the White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said today The last thing you want to do is create artificially increased demand and put in disincentives that harm the availability of supply Mr Fleischer noted that the energy commission is an independent federal agency adding that the Bush administration has no authority to countermand its orders But Mr Bush did appoint the commissions chairman Curtis L Hbert Jr a Republican Like the president Mr Hbert has often insisted that price caps do no good But he came under withering political pressure to abandon the agencys largely hands off approach to the California crisis Some of that pressure came from the two other commissioners at the agency both Democrats and Mr Hbert wound up voting for the controls adopted on Wednesday night The split with the Bush administration raises fresh questions about whether the president will seek to replace Mr Hbert as chairman in coming weeks Mr Bush has nominated two Republicans to fill vacant slots on the commission including Pat Wood a longtime ally of the president who served as chief electricity regulator in Texas Industry executives say they expect that Mr Bush will eventually name Mr Wood to the commissions top post In a reflection of how delicate the issue is Mr Hbert argued that the agencys action did not amount to imposing price caps But his position appeared to rest on a semantic distinction between returning to cost based electricity regulation as some Californians favor and the agencys decision to impose tactical price controls Among California officials the dominant reaction was disappointment Some state regulators and market experts said the agency was practicing upsidedown economics it has chosen to impose price limits during periods of severe scarcity when prices theoretically ought to rise to encourage companies to build power plants and encourage people to use less electricity The agency its critics argue has chosen to ignore price abuses during times of relative abundance when power generators the critics say have used artificial market power to earn high profits They got it exactly wrong said Frank Wolak chief market supervisor for the California Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid It looks like theyre doing something but it doesnt work in real time Mr Wolak has estimated that most overcharges by generators last year in amounts that he puts in the billions of dollars occurred when electricity supplies were not acutely short meaning that the agencys price caps would have had no mitigating effect The state is likely to face many emergency shortages this summer But Mr Wolak said generating companies have become adept at gaming the system He predicted that they would find ways to continue to earn high profits in California One fear is that generating companies will arrange to sell their output to affiliates out of state When Californias transmission grid managers scramble to find supplies the same companies will offer to sell the power back to the state but only above the cap price The agencys new order includes a provision that is intended to discourage this sort of abuse known as megawatt laundering But the agency has a weak record of enforcing such mandates and California officials are skeptical The order also came under fire on other grounds The commission said that price caps would be canceled unless California submitted a proposal to link its transmission grid to the one that serves the Western region a priority of the agency that state officials have resisted Linda Stuntz an electricity industry lobbyist who is an expert on the agency called that clause bizarre arguing that it held the entire California market hostage to a technical filing requirement California politicians said they worried that even if the price caps were carried out as promised relief would be too limited The price limits will be based on estimates of the highest operating costs of the least efficient generating plant in the state The order as written means that companies that operate efficient generating plants could still sell power at large markups during periods when caps are imposed When the agency scrutinized the California market earlier this year it found the highcost generators to be justified in charging about a megawatt hour for electricity a price that is about times as high as the state was paying for power a year ago Copyright The New York Times Company

textplain charsetISO ContentDisposition inline FYI FERC Taken to Task Over Calif Energy Crisis By Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April Page E Even before President Bush took office he and his staff were trying keep Californias energy crisis a long arms length away saying it was primarily Californias problem to solve But the Bush White House inherited an unavoidable link to California the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a relatively small Washington agency with a large mandate to see that wholesale electricity rates remain just and reasonable Californias calamity is defined in part by a battle between FERC and state officials over what just and reasonable means On Wednesday FERC made a new effort to hold down Californias electricity prices without forsaking its commitment to energy deregulation earning another round of sharp criticism from California officials FERC had a chance to bring meaningful relief to Californias outrageous wholesale prices and they blew it California Gov Gray Davis D said yesterday The spotlight is bright and unsought for an agency with a modest million budget born in as the Federal Power Commission a weak understaffed agency that promoted and supervised hydropower dams Fifteen year later during President Franklin D Roosevelts New Deal battle against powerful utility holding companies the commission was armed with the authority to regulate rates for wholesale electricity bought by utilities and for power transmission States regulate retail rates Today FERC makes rules for the nations transition away from regulated utility electric service to a marketbased hybrid In California and many major states powerful generating companies compete to sell electricity to utilities which act as distributors The responsibilities have taxed FERCs staff of which is about percent less than peak levels during the mids A backlog of pending cases includes not just conflicts over power prices but also critical issues of reorganizing the nations power transmission network into large regional pools strong enough to make urgently needed investments in new lines When Congress set electricity deregulation in motion in FERCs goal became seeing that it succeeded Gradually it redefined the just and reasonable standard saying that as long as electricity markets were competitive the prices negotiated by generators and distributors met the standard In hewing to that doctrine the agency turned down an increasingly angry flood of demands from Davis and a host of California officials to clamp down on the states wholesale electricity prices when they suddenly shot upward last summer Although FERC concluded in November that Californias power market was badly flawed and that the potential for unfair and unjust pricing existed it did not impose hard price restraints opting for a soft partial price ceiling FERC ordered California to try to fix its broken power purchasing system by buying the bulk of its electricity through longterm supply contracts with generators rather than through lastminute purchases that forced the state to pay generators and marketers top prices But FERCs plan was not implemented They have the ability to resolve it and they are not following through with what we asked them to FERC Chairman Curt Hebert Jr said three months ago just after being named chairman by Bush But under growing political pressure to restrain Californias extraordinary wholesale electricity charges and respond to complaints of overcharging FERC has moved deeper into the morass Since March it has ordered power suppliers to refund million or prove that their charges were justified The generators say their prices have been based on high costs of natural gas and air pollution permits Were very confident that FERC will see that these issues and transactions were just and reasonable said Randy Harrison chief executive for western operations of Mirant a major California generator On Wednesday the commission went further directing California to establish maximum rates that generators could charge during power shortage emergencies through a formula linked to plant operating costs All generators would be entitled to get the highest approved price but suppliers that exceeded the price benchmark would have to justify their prices or face refund orders The decision on a to vote reflects a compromise between the agencys desire to defend the troubled experiment with deregulation while protecting consumers against overcharging said energy consultant Peter FoxPenner of the Brattle Group Theyre searching for middle ground here Its not what we think of as price caps he said Its flexible Its related to costs and thats very innovative But FERCs many critics in California rebuked the agency again yesterday saying its actions were too little and too late Because the new FERC rules would apply only during power emergencies there would be no price restraint at other times some said And by pegging approved rates to the costs of plants burning costly natural gas FERCs order would confront California with continuing costs of per megawatthour for large quantities of electricity this summer eight to times what the state was paying before the crisis critics said What they did do is virtually irrelevant said Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer Consumer Rights Its like offering someone whos been hit by a car an aspirin FERC has failed its responsibilities at every point in the crisis said Adam Goldberg a policy analyst with Consumers Union Hebert responds that slapping hard price regulations on Californias energy market is the wrong course for at least three reasons It does not encourage generators to build more plants it doesnt prompt consumers to conserve energy and it will prompt power suppliers to sell electricity to neighboring states where prices arent controlled unless California blocks power exports What lessons the public will draw from Californias plight this summer and the deregulation debate remains to be seen but FERC and perhaps the Bush administration too has been pulled more closely than ever into that drama

Columbia May Rivers Power Aids California and Enriches the Northwest By BLAINE HARDEN GEORGE Wash Doing something nice for California has never been a p riority here in the Columbia River Basin where highvoltage power lines lope acros s irrigated fields of alfalfa potatoes and wheat Politicians from California as farmers in this area will explain at great length have been scheming for decades to siphon off the basins cheap electricity and water Californians however have been noticeably less irritating as of late Having fouled up electricity deregulation six ways from Sunday they are skidding into the summer airconditioning season desperately short of power In the last year much of their salvation has come from the Columbia River whose monstrous dams are the largest hydroelectricity machines in North America All along the river from Portland Ore to British Columbia utility companies aluminum makers and farmers have joined to help save California but at a staggering price Charging whatever Californias dysfunctional pow er market will bear people in this narrow stretch of the Northwest have creat ed a kind of Kuwait along the Columbia With their record profits some public utilities are wiring the emptiness o f Eastern Washington with fiber optics buying diesel generators to make stil l more power and paying Wall Streetstyle wages to electricity traders while making sure that their electricity rates remain among the cheapest in North America Just north of the border in British Columbia a stateowned utilit y luxuriated in its California windfall by mailing out rebate checks to million customers Their good fortune though has come with a measure of ambivalence and may well be shortlived A severe drought is already hurting farmers across the region If it continues utilities along the river will have to buy power a nd may be punished by the same market forces that gave them a windfall This is not nice money said Alice Parker a retired farmer who heads a group that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin It is something that is offered to us not to use water so Californians can run their airconditioners Nice or not a whole lot of money flooded into the Columbia Basin North of here in sparsely populated Chelan County a publicly owned utility that has two dams on the Columbia made three times as much money last year than it ever had before With just local customers the utility last year had a million profit It paid its two top power traders each an astonishing income in a county where per capita income is less tha n a year The utility refuses to reveal the traders names for fear their children might be kidnapped The chief operating officer of Chelan County Public Utility District acknowledged that increases in the cost of power were huge and obscene But the executive Charles J Hosken added We would be imprudent if we d id not maximize this market for our customer owners Next door in equally sparse Grant County a public utility that also owns t wo dams on the Columbia has made even more money maximizing the market It had a record million in profits last year more than double its best previous year Grant County Public Utility District which has just retail customer s is using its windfall to help build a million fiber optic network for local residents It has also bought diesel generators to guard against power shortages and if possible exploit the power goldrush The utility estimates that those generators could add million to profits in the coming year Like Chelan Grant is using its profits as a kind of drought insurance to insulate its customers from high market prices for electricity when as no w local needs exceed generating capacity in the river Power rates in Grant a nd Chelan Counties are about onefifth as much as in New York City Grant Countys utility has rejected for the time being the idea of giving a share of its profits to its customers How would it look if Grant County gives away rebates while so many people are paying more for electricity asked Lon Topaz director of resource management for the utility It would be lousy politics An UpsideDown Economy The secondworst drought on record in the Columbia River Basin has combined with Californias deregulation mess to further distort the energy market Drought has not only helped increase the price at which electricity can be sold on the spot market to times as much as last years price it has strengthened a compelling bottomline rationale for conservation Every megawatt not purchased and used in the Northwest often at lockedin long term prices that are a fraction of the current market rate can be sent sou th to California For many utilities conservation spells local savings and a longdistance bonanza As a result a regional economy built on half a century of cheap hydropower has been stood on its head Irrigation farmers here are being paid up to an acre not to farm Similarly aluminum companies are collecting about billion this year b y not making aluminum Companies like Alcoa have earned profits that delight Wall Street while keeping about workers on their payroll by reselling hydropower that they bought in the mids under a cheap longterm contract Even residential customers are being offered a chance to make a few dollars from the power crunch Avista Utilities has announced that it will pay its customers in Washington and Idaho cents for every kilowatt they do not us e if their consumption falls more than percent below last years level For utilities in the Northwest by far the largest profits from California s electricity crisis have been secured in British Columbia A number of priva te American utilities have also benefited from Californias troubles BC Hydro a utility owned by British Columbia with dams on the Columbia and Peace Rivers is the first corporation in the history of the province to exceed billion in profits as measured in Canadian currency millio n in United States currency To celebrate the provincial government ordered BC Hydro to do something it had never done before The utility mailed each of its customers a check for BC Hydro also guaranteed them no increases in electricity rates whic h have not gone up for seven years We are just happy to be lucky that we have reservoirs and dams that were built by people of great foresight said Brian R D Smith chairman of BC Hydro When reminded that a March study by the California Independent System Operator which runs that states power grid accused BC Hydro of market manipulation and profit gouging Mr Smith was less happy All they do is scream and shout and they wont pay you the money they owe you he said arguing that his company has gone out of its way to help California in its hour of need Gouging has nothing to do with it he said adding that it was Californias awful mess in deregulating power markets that fueled BC Hydros record profits A Good Deal for Farmers In the beginning that is to say when federal money began transforming the Columbia from the worlds premier salmon highway into a chain of adjustable lakes no one paid much attention to electricity The river possessed a thi rd of Americas hydroelectric potential but there were not enough people in t he Northwest to use more than a fraction of it and longdistance high voltag e transmission lines did not exist The main intention when New Deal dollars began raining on the Northwest in the s was to create family farms Grand Coulee Dam the biggest dam i n North America and the largest hydroelectric plant was primarily designed a s a waterdelivery device for farmers Since then as miles of tunnels and concrete canals were built to shuttle water around in sagebrush country each acre farm in the Columb ia Basin Federal Irrigation Project was blessed with at least million in federal infrastructure subsidies according to the Bureau of Reclamation which built it In addition farmers are guaranteed access to cheap water from the Columbia and the right to buy all the electricity they needed to pump that water out of the river at a megawatt A megawatt of electricity currentl y sells for to on the spot market As Paul Pitzer a Columbia Basin historian has written farmers here have always felt that no price is too high to pay for their water so long as someone else is paying the bill This year though the price finally became unbearably high for the Bonneville Power Administration a nonprofit agency that markets electricit y from federal dams on river The agency calculated that if it could persuade farmers in the project not to irrigate acres of land water left in the Columbia would produce electricity worth as much as millio n if it had to be purchased at current market prices In a buyout that is without precedent in the Pacific Northwest Bonneville is paying farmers a total of million The farmers receive for eac h acre they do not farm On top of that Grant Countys public utility is paying many of the same farmers about an acre not to farm their land On April about irrigators gathered for lunch at the Martha Inn Cafe here in George to discuss the buyout Since farm prices are low this year they agreed that it was a good deal Still the farmers who do not like to be reminded of the federal subsidies that keep their irrigation system afloat said they worried about the precedent they set when they traded water for cash This has to be a temporary deal said Tom Flynt who normally farms acres but has taken acres out of production because of the buyout If anybody thought this would affect their water rights there would be no takers Several farmers said they did not like the idea of their water supporting t he lifestyles of urban people especially Californians who those who were interviewed said do not appreciate the food that the farmers put on their table We feel that Americans are making decisions with their mouths full said Tricia C Lubach a marketing consultant whose husband is an irrigation farmer Not too long ago they didnt worry about where the power comes fro m Someday they may think about where the food comes from A Wonderful Energy Fit A couple of hundred miles northwest of George in a penthouse conference ro om that overlooks Vancouver harbor Mr Smith the chairman of British Columbias most profitable company explained in mid April what a pain it was selling electricity to Californians People say to me what are you doing selling power to those ungrateful Californians he said It does not help he added that the state is behin d on its bills by about million Still neither BC Hydro nor the provincial government can afford to lose Californias money The utility has become a cash cow for the provincial budget which in the last decade has received more than billion from B C

got high deman d and we have got undersupply in the winter when they have got stuff to give to us BC Hydro has acknowledged that it massages its hydropower system to sell power when it is most needed and most expensive in California The utility closes the faucets on its dams at night during the summer storing water while meeting local electricity needs with cheap offpeak power broug ht from across the West In the morning when prices peak it opens the faucet s and zaps electricity off to California We spill water during the day Mr Smith said Why Is it because we can make more money No Its because that is when everybody wants electricity for Gods sake Questions about profit gouging on the part of damdependent utilities in th e Northwest may soon be moot Drought has reduced the Columbia River runoff s o far this year to about half of what is considered normal The shortfall dovetails with higher costs for naturalgasfired power plant s and a growing gap on the West Coast between demand for electricity and capacity to generate it Absent being successful in getting loads down we could be looking at quadrupling of the power rates said Paul Norman head of power operations at the Bonneville Power Administration Unless conservation increases or the drought eases Mr Norman warned that by late summer the Northwests era of cheap power could come to a sudden and painfully expensive

LIMITING PRICES state buyers cartel with Northwest could create leverage Lynda Gledhill Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Thursday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifilecaMNDTL More blackouts but no ransom payments for energy gougers thats a deal looking increasingly attractive to California lawmakers and consumer advocates The idea which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the cautious interest of Gov Gray Davis is for the state to set a firm ceiling on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer and not one dime more The tradeoff would be certain blackouts possibly more than if the state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand Some advocates of the idea think that California could minimize the number of blackout hours and gain a measure of control over the energy crisis by scheduling service interruptions We need to stop this game of electricity chicken said Michael Shames director of the Utility Consumers Action Network which first proposed the idea We are likely to see blackouts this summer we should use them to our advantage rather than be victimized by them The plan calls for creating a buyers cartel of California Oregon and Washington Essentially the states would decide at what price they were willing to buy power and refuse to purchase once it tops that level The state has spent billion on energy purchases since January and at one point during last weeks power shortage was spending per megawatt hour more than times what Davis has planned on for this summer That kind of spending cannot go on Democratic Assemblyman Fred Keeley of Boulder Creek said yesterday The question is can we sustain the level of spending we have and have the state maintain economic stability I believe the answer is no said Keeley the lower houses main figure on energy policy and author of the bill that put the state in the powerbuying business To get this problem solved we have to think in bold terms said Keeley who introduced a resolution along with fellow Democratic Assemblyman Paul Koretz of West Hollywood that urged Davis to form a cartel THREE STATES ARE BETTER THAN ONE Davis said last week that my bias would be to keep the lights on at any price But yesterday the governor said a temporary price limit is certainly a matter weve talked about and considered at some length The next step will be to see how the governors of Oregon and Washington respond to it A spokesman for Gov Gary Locke of Washington said the matter is being considered Calls to the office of Oregon Gov John Kitzhaber were not returned The idea has appeal among some consumers who believe as many state officials do that California is being gouged for electricity I can see if our bills were or more but this is ridiculous said Kimberly Chambers an yearold fashion design student from Oakland Whatever it takes I dont think we should have to pay for more But Yunah Kim who moved to the Bay Area from New York a month ago said blackouts should not even be considered The infrastructure of government is coming apart and its the basic service government is able to provide she said Businesses are not going to put up with that Its very shortsighted We just have to pay until theres a solution Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley said blackouts might be worse than supporters of price limits believe I think they power companies would call our bluff and sell their electricity elsewhere Borenstein said I dont think the state has the ability to credibly commit to paying no more than X That would be a very controversial decision Legislation is already in the works to give Davis the ability to enter into a West Coast buyers cartel A bill sponsored by state Sen Dede Alpert D Coronado would allow the Independent System Operator to refuse to buy power if it is too expensive The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula based on such things as the cost of natural gas A reasonable profit for power producers would be built in supporters said LOOKING FOR SOME CONTROL Alpert said everyone wants to avoid blackouts but that seems unlikely Everybody I talked to once you establish that there will be blackouts both businesses and residents say lets have control Alpert said The California Manufacturers and Technology Association which commissioned a recent report that said unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy billion and jobs is considering whether scheduled interruptions would be less harmful The problem if we do scheduled blackouts is that we may have an inordinate amount of blackouts said Gino DeCaro a spokesman for the group NO EASY TASK The ISO which runs the states power grid is scheduled to issue a report tomorrow on how scheduled blackouts might work Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Ray said that planning blackouts is not as easy as it sounds The difficulty is a pragmatic one the circuits are not wired to deal with choices like we are having to make said Bowen who has been holding hearings on how the state might better manage blackouts Maybe we should be paying people to turn off their fuse box Bowen said Chronicle staff writer

situation no surprises for anyone following this closely Please note that Chairman Hoecker felt the need to emphasize the limitations of FERCs power under the Federal Power Act DJ FERC Chief Pledges Action If Needed On Calif Pwr Woes Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Monday WASHINGTON Dow JonesThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has limited authority to address flawed electricity markets in California and alleged price gouging by power producers but will act to overhaul the states wholesale power markets if necessary FERC Chairman James Hoecker told a congressional panel Monday The commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff investigation of problems affecting power markets in the US West becomes available Hoecker said in testimony presented to a San Diego field hearing of the House Commerce Committees energy panel If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction we will do so Hoecker told lawmakers And if price gouging is occurring as some have alleged he added we will respond accordingly by revoking marketbased rates or otherwise However Hoecker stressed that the commissions authority is limited under the Federal Power Act The commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer crisis Important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility such as authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities Hoecker testified The commission cant act to limit prices charged by power providers until we have a record supporting such action he said referring to the results of the pending staff investigation Further he said the law bars FERC from ordering retroactive refunds to San Diego Gas Electric Co for the power it purchased this summer to serve its retail customer base Hoecker testified before the House Commerce Committees Energy and Power Subcommittee which is looking into the supply shortages in California this summer that have forced San Diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much for power as they did a year ago State Mkt Structure Blamed For Crisis The hearing comes after much wrangling at FERC as SDGE a unit of Sempra Energy SRE sought an order setting price caps for power bid into the statesponsored electricity exchange and power producers sought an order allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the states independent grid operator curtailed sales outside California where price controls dont apply FERC hasnt yet responded to the producers and deferred action on SDGEs bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed But it left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to limit the price it pays for power which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid into the power exchange Hoecker while withholding judgment pending the staff probe appeared to place much of the blame for this summers crisis with the statemandated market structure which left San Diego consumers subject to spotmarket volatility And he appeared to suggest that FERCs order directing utilities to transfer transmission assets to control of large regional transmission organizations or RTOs will offer an opportunity to develop a regional solution to the powersupply problem FERC deferred to California in restructuring the wholesale market in California because its experience with new market institutions such as power exchanges and ISOs was limited Hoecker said Other states such as Pennsylvania were less prescriptive than California in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should operate Hoecker noted Now with FERCs Order encouraging formation of RTOs the commission is in a very different posture with respect to the structure of wholesale markets he said Large regional markets can be made to work effectively Hoecker told the lawmakers citing the Pennsylvania restructuring as an example Other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the statemandated market structure By requiring the states three investorowned utilities to purchase all their electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge price risks by entering into longterm fixedprice contracts the state left consumers subject to volatility in the statemandated spot market said officials with Enron Corp ENE and Reliant Energy REI Californias market structure placed no economic incentives on the default utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately passed on to their consumers Reliants John Stout testified San Diegos experience offers the Congress an unparalleled opportunity to learn from a bungled attempt at deregulation said Michael Shames executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network Shames and other witnesses warned the congressional committee that Californias electricity crisis is likely to occur in other regions of the country unless steps are taken to free up interstate trade in power and allow FERC to better police markets California is just the latest problem area in US power markets and unless policymakers act quickly it will not be the last said Enron Corp ENE Steven Kean executive vice president Unless Congress and FERC are willing to address the interstate issues that are beyond the jurisdiction of state legislators and regulators I predict that our experience in San Diego is indicative of what others will encounter in trying to create a competitive electricity market said Edwin Guiles Sempras president of regulated operations This electricity crisis is not a Californiaonly problem said

article reflects more power marketerbashing than the Dow Jones write up on this meeting Calif free market power experiment under fire SAN DIEGO Sept Reuters California lawmakers and regulators sought a temporary halt on Tuesday to the states trailblazing free market electricity experiment at a hearing called by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission It the free market is simply a structure for extortion as we have seen this summer said Carl Wood a commissioner with state regulator the California Public Utilities Commission seeking a return to costbased rather than marketbased rates for customers FERC which regulates the wholesale power market has launched an investigation into price spikes in California this summer It is due to report its finding by November Under the terms of the deregulation of Californias electric utility industry customers of Sempra Energy subsidiary San Diego Gas and Electric became the first in the nation to pay marketbased rates without a safety net There was a public outcry in the city this summer when a rise in wholesale prices to record levels led to a tripling in their electricity bills I think many thought because we had deregulation we had competition We dont San Diego mayor Susan Golding told FERC commissioners There is no public confidence right now about the movement to a competitive energy market Companies profiting from the high prices have included independent power producers and also marketers who have purchased the output of plants under longterm contracts and been able to extract much higher prices from the spot and dayahead markets I have no sympathy for suppliers right now They are fat and happy Golding said Many local and national lawmakers have called for FERC to declare that rates set by suppliers this summer were not just and reasonable as required under US law Such a declaration could be followed by action to impose market restrictions such as price caps across the western US Stephen Baum chief executive officer of SDGE parent Sempra Energy said the utility favors selective interim bid caps for generators who have been shown to have sufficient market power to influence prices These caps would run through next summer and if the market was not then operating competitively could be followed by a return to costbased ratemaking Such a move could lead to the demise of the California Power Exchange which was set up as part of the deregulation of the states power industry CalPX is where the highpriced power has been bought this summer and its trading mechanisms have been heavily criticized That the demise of CalPX could be a result that comes out of structural reform Baum said Many are also calling on FERC to retroactively void trades at prices that were deemed not just and reasonable and order that profits from generators and marketers be returned to the victims These are reported to include single mothers forced to choose between paying their exorbitant electricity bill and buying new school uniforms for their children or fixed income pensioners who have been turning off their refrigerators in a bid to avoid massive bills If there was ever a case for you to use your remedial powers including refunds of excessive charges this is it Baum of Sempra Energy told the commissioners Terry Winters head of the California Independent System Operator ISO which operates most of the states power grid said the higher prices in California largely reflected lower available imports from surrounding states California has traditionally been a significant importer of power from states such as Nevada and Arizona but rapid economic growth in those areas has increased their own needs and reduced the amount of electricity they are able to sell elsewhere The states power problems are also linked to the absence of any new instate generation with no significant plants build during the last years Many are now planned but few will come on line before at the earliest There have also been growing calls from some for San Diego to create its own municipal utility with the citys residents casting envious eyes toward near neighbors in Los Angeles where the countrys largest municipal utility has been able to keep prices steady and even promise further price cuts Those calls have gained the support of two of the areas Congressmen Duncan Hunter and Bob Filner although only one community in the area San Marcos has so far begun the long and complicated process required Some states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws to open retail electricity markets to competition Most consumers however continue to be shielded by protective measures during the rocky transition to competitive markets

Lawmakers Advocates Call for Repair of CaliforniaS Electricity Deregulation Kate Berry The Orange County Register Calif September Sep Outraged politicians and consumer advocates demanded at a public hearing Tuesday that federal energy regulators fix Californias flawed experiment with deregulation by cutting electricity prices and refunding consumers in San Diego and south Orange County for the high cost of power this summer Federal authorities on a daylong factfinding mission said they plan to act quickly without backing away from the longterm goal of a competitive freemarket for electricity There are flaws in the existing power structure that I think must be repaired said Linda K Braithitt one of four commissioners at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which launched a formal investigation last month into the politically disastrous rise in electricity prices in California More than major players in Californias electricity market from utilities to power producers to staterun agencies that manage the electric grid and market exchange offered various solutions to the crisis The only consensus Customers are paying exorbitant prices We must roll back wholesale prices retroactively and refund consumers said Rep Bob Filner DSan Diego who accused power producers of manipulating the power market and pushing retail prices higher He also called power producers criminals reiterating a statement he made Sunday at a House commerce subcommittee hearing in San Diego We know these prices are unlawful I believe these prices are criminal Under the Federal Powers Act regulators can intervene to limit the prices power generators charge if they determine the market is not workably competitive FERC also has the authority to retroactively declare that marketbased rates this summer were not just and reasonable If it does so the PUC can act to require utilities to refund customers The utilities then would likely go to the courts on the matter Wood said The FERC investigation comes as electric bills for million customers of San Diego Gas Electric have more than doubled or quadrupled in some cases leading to hardship particularly for lowincome residents and the elderly Currently the two biggest utilities Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison have absorbed billion in costs that they want to pass on to their consumers when a rate freeze ends in April State regulators which gave up control of wholesale prices when the market was deregulated in told their federal equivalents that the system is broken Its time to reset the starting point back to protecting consumers until we can get it right said Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission We have not collectively on the state and federal level demonstrated a path that works Carl Wood a commissioner at the California Public Utilities Commission implored FERC to return in the shortterm to a costbased rate structure known to consumers before the utilities sold their power plants and had to purchase electricity on the power exchange No competitive market exists he said The market isnt functioning in California right now William Massey a FERC commissioner admitted that Californias market is flawed He also said a return to a costbased rate structure remained on the table But Curtis R Hebert another FERC commissioner said the agency had to be cautious about further regulation He advocates lifting price caps changing rules on how suppliers buy and sell into the Power Exchange and adopting marketbased approaches such as having the utilities hedge with longterm contracts You cant just say go back to costbased he said Its not that simple The most heated discussion came when Michael Shames executive director of UCAN Utility Consumers Action Network said FERC was on trial and could lose its case for deregulation FERC Chairman James J Hoecker said it was natural to look for blame on the part of power generators But he added that making a lot of money gets a bad rap when individual electricity consumers are hurting He also asked a panel of power producers directly to ask why they were gaming the system We feel weve conducted business not only legally but ethically said Bill Hall managing director of commercial affairs at Duke Energy which owns percent of power generation in the state We dont anticipate to make profits like this as soon as supply keeps up with demand John Stout vice president of the Southwest region for Reliant Energy said he was certainly in business to make a profit The fact that we had a good year in California in terms of revenue is a fact I dont deny that at all he said Across the street from the government building where the hearing was held San Diego residents at a hair salon talked about the electricity crisis with some residents in a retirement home paying a month for electricity Pat Benites manager of the C Street Salon said the highrise building she works in has seen its rates rise a month this summer Theyre just bilking us she said They told the whole building to turn computers off at night and turn electricity off she said Its dark in the lobby but we have to

NeedsContentTransferEncoding quotedprintable Date Tue Oct From Tracey Bradley To Deanna King Paul Fox Ronald Carroll Subject Portland Consultants Investigation Finds California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetUSASCII ContentDisposition inline FYI It sounds like this consultants findings are being questioned by many in the industry including by the CAISO Portland OreBased Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs Dan McSwain North County Times Escondido Calif October Oct PORTLAND OreA private investigation of state power markets has come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating capacity this summer The state enjoyed a percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared and the states power manager declared separate power emergencies because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage according to the investigation The author of the investigations preliminary report Portlandbased economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough said at a conference of analysts power traders and electricity industry regulators Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example it ran at well below its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale power prices and consumer electricity bills shot to well above the generating plants cost of production The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency which monitors emissions We are seeing a lot of undergeneration McCullough said This is market power in action Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market participants in this case suppliers to influence prices Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer and contributed to high prices but several participants said deregulation has reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal agencies including the EPA Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego County are scant Encinas operators a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc and NRG Energy Inc called Cabrillo Power confirmed that the power plant had no abnormal maintenance problems The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said Wednesday that the power plant was well within its statemandated pollution limits But David Lloyd the corporate secretary of Cabrillo denied that the Encina plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets That cant possibly be right Lloyd said of McCulloughs analysis In North County we were right on the ragged edge of being off an emergency shutdown because of heavy output Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off I cant comment Lloyd said We certainly dont want to be accused of anything wrongful he said We dont have that much power in California and for us to be shutting down in California to push up the price somewhere else doesnt make sense for us We want to run all we can when the prices are high Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May resulting in a doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the million customers of San Diego Gas Electric Co and causing an estimated billion in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with a retail rate cap but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow beyond million if high wholesale prices persist No fewer than five private state and federal investigations are under way to assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western states The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright manipulation in order to increase profits Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission Electricity Oversight Board and attorney general along with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation were launched in July and August Staff investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate the price spikes His effort is thought to be the first to complete an exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that was actually used Chief among McCulloughs findings was that demand for power was lower this summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web of power transmission lines that connect California to other Western states British Columbia and northern Mexico McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North County Times and the initial reaction of the states energy community was one of deep skepticism EPA data is notoriously unreliable said Frank Wolak a Stanford professor and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California Independent System Operator the agency that manages the state grid and which has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer To gauge the actual output of power plants that burn fossil fuel McCullough used emissions data from the EPA Greed would get the best of anybody Wolak said I found a lot of hours where instate generators were exceeding nameplate capacity These guys were cranking it out Wolak in a study of power markets for the system operator did conclude however that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was the major cause of higher prices this summer At the conference in Portland most of the panelists did not openly criticize McCulloughs analysis but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures in the Southwest were blamed for limiting Californias ability to import electricity Others said state and federal regulators along with market participants themselves wont really know what happened until more experts look at hard market information that is in short supply Ron Eachus the

October pm Eastern Time Press Release SOURCE Southern California Edison SCE Files Joint Petition Urging Federal Regulators to Act Swiftly in Response To Unjust and Unreasonable Rates WASHINGTON Oct PRNewswire Southern California Edison SCE today filed a joint petition urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to take immediate action in response to unjust and unreasonable wholesale electricity prices by authorizing a MWh cap in the markets run by the California Independent System Operator CalISO and the California Power Exchange PX Pacific Gas and Electric Co PGE and The Utility Reform Network TURN joined SCE in filing the petition In addition to immediate relief the filing asked for an expedited proceeding to provide the fact finding needed a to adopt comprehensive marketpower mitigation measures that would replace the MWh cap and b to determine refund responsibility Even though the peak demands of the summer are behind us electricity prices in the wholesale market remain unreasonably high said SCE Senior Vice President for Regulatory Policy Affairs John Fielder For example on Sunday September prices reached MWh even though demand was relatively low about twothirds that seen during a peak summer day Each day that passes the consumers utilities and economy of California are unfairly burdened with excessive electricity costs Fielder said We reiterate Governor Gray Davis request that FERC act without delay to address the problems in the wholesale market Specifically SCE PGE and TURN asked FERC to make an immediate finding that Californias electricity market is not workably competitive and that resulting prices are unjust and unreasonable Numerous studies from independent analysts have provided ample documentation of the many problems that plague the California market Fielder said For example in a report dated Sept CalISOs Market Surveillance Committee found that prices in June of this year were nearly three times the level that would be experienced in a properly functioning competitive market SCE and the other petitioners asked FERC to provide immediate relief from these unjust and unreasonable rates by authorizing a MWh cap in the dayahead hourahead dayof and realtime markets run by CalISO and PX a MWh cap currently is in effect only in the CalISO markets In the past FERC has used a MWh rate as a standard in cases where neither costbased nor marketbased rates apply such as emergency service The filing demonstrated that this price level was sufficient to cover costs for most plants but also allowed generators and energy traders to seek a higher rate from FERC This higher price would be paid only to the individual seller on a unitspecific basis it would not set the market clearing price In addition to this immediate emergency relief the filing also asked FERC for an expedited hearing on intermediate steps that can be taken until longterm changes to the California electricity market can be implemented The petitioners asked FERC to require sellers of electricity other than musttake units to submit costofservice information to the Commission within days The filing noted that FERC could use this information to replace the MWh cap with marketpower mitigation measures tailored to address the precise problems identified in the hearing process These measures could include the temporary imposition of costofservice pricing contracts through which generators would commit a percentage of their capacity to the ISO at costbased rates unitspecific bid caps or marketwide caps that vary based on the operating cost of the unit expected to be on the margin at different load levels While the marketpower mitigation measures will ensure just and reasonable rates in the future the filing also asked FERC to investigate past pricing and determine whether refunds from electricity sellers are appropriate An Edison International company Southern California Edison is one of the nations largest

Tracey Bradley To Ronald Carroll Subject PowerPlus CA Munis Propose StateRun NonProfit Transco For Market Woe MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetUSASCII ContentDisposition inline PowerPlus In effort to regain state authority CA Munis Propose StateRun NonProfit Transco For Market Woes A recent proposal by municipal utilities in California to turn the California Independent System Operator CalISO into a staterun transmission company transco has piqued the interest of some industry officials who claim it will start an effective dialog on the future of the states energy markets and the organization responsible for access to the grid the CalISO However the ISO argues the proposal is a nonsolution and will only delay constructive discussions over the fate of restructuring in California Others say the concept is a concerted effort by state agencies to regain control over the transmission system that California lost when the ISO was approved by federal regulators The California Municipal Utilities Association CMUA proposed the concept in a statement when the organization delivered a filing to FERC seeking a return to costbased rates in the state CMUA filed the petition with the commission earlier this month but FERC action on any filing regarding Californias electricity markets will likely have to wait until the commission issues the results of its investigation into the states wholesale power markets due later this fall While a return to costbased rates in FERCs hands CMUA has initiated an innovative discussion on the status of the CalISO the entity many California officials fault for some of the problems resulting from the energy crisis which plagued the state and indeed the West much of this past summer CMUA claims the current ISO model and governance structure contains too much red tape which only adds unnecessary delay in crisis situations when quick action is needed CMUA says the biggest fault with the ISO is its connection to the marketplace it oversees Ideally regional transmission organizations RTOs should not have any responsibility over markets and only needs to concentrate on managing the grid in an independent manner By forcing the ISO to operate both the market the ISO is responsible for managing the ancillary services markets and the grid it cannot be expected to run either efficiently a CMUA source says The market here doesnt work the CMUA source says The ISO by default has been embroiled in the market The new transco wouldnt be involved with ancillary services This gets the ISO out of the market another public power source says It was never envisioned to be a part of procuring energy supplies Exact details of the structure of the staterun transco have yet to be resolved because any changes to the ISO will have to come from legislative and regulatory mandates the CMUA source says The group is considering legislation to initiate the changes and says the concept resolves what many officials claim to be a major flaw with the ISO its stakeholder board Currently the ISO is managed by a board made up of industry representatives and meets regularly each month At the monthly board meetings the ISO makes most of its crucial decisions on management governance and price caps The CMUA source contends that the ISO does a suspect job in getting materials to board members before meetings and if the organization is staterun it will be forced to open all executive meetings to the public The transco would be nonprofit and a government agency so you have open meetings the source says The ISO has not been good at getting material to board members before meetings A staterun transco also would have eminent domain authority to site new transmission lines something which the ISO currently lacks And because the transco would both own and operate the system it would have the necessary incentives to build more transmission the CMUA source says The public agency will have the power of eminent domain the source says Some industry officials say the idea is part of a concerted effort among California executives and lawmakers to retain as much control as possible over the ISO In numerous reports issued this past summer in response to the energy crisis the ISO and its regulator FERC were seen as two of the main culprits By making the ISO an official state agency that owns the system California retains its authority over the grid This may very well play as a part of a state strategy to get more control back to California an ISO board member says If its a state agency the state is going to have a much bigger role The concept has not been wellreceived by the ISO where an official there calls the idea a solution to a nonproblem This source says the ISO has done a laudable job in maintaining the efficiency of the transmission grid and has spent nearly million in transmission expansion This is a curious solution to a nonproblem this official says The market operation of the ISO is a nonissue The transmission system is being utilized much more efficiently now than it was before The official also says that it is unclear whether a stateowned transco would meet FERCs RTO requirements and such an entity would further cloud the line between state and federal jurisdiction If it is a public owner it is not clear if its federally or stateowned this source says It solves a nonproblem I dont know how easily it would be to integrate it into an interstate market

Electric Megawatt Laundering Steve Johnson San Jose Mercury News Calif October Oct While investigating this summers stunning spike in electricity prices state authorities have heard stories about a curious phenomenon On days when the weather is hot batches of power generated in California are sold to other states A little later in the day similar amounts of power are sold back to California but at much higher prices The question is is it the same power If so that could be megawatt laundering a multicompany conspiracy to evade Californias wholesale price cap which covers power generated in California but not power sold into California from elsewhere Worried that such transactions could be costing consumers millions of dollars several energy specialists raised concerns about megawatt laundering during a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hearing a month ago in San Diego And earlier this month state Sen Steve Peace DLa Mesa who helped lead the push to deregulate electricity sales in California formally asked the commission to investigate the practice which he termed potentially illegal market coordination But an unconfirmed news report last week said the federal agency had concluded that generators had not abused the market And others say concerns about megawatt laundering are exaggerated Among them is Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association a powerfirm trade group and chairman of the Independent System Operator which oversees most of Californias power grid While acknowledging that such laundering is possible SmutnyJones said there is no evidence it is actually occurring or is widespread This is one of those things thats turning into an urban legend he said I dont want to characterize this as a significant problem Even some critics of the way power is purchased in California concede that most of what has been labeled megawatt laundering probably reflects nothing more sinister than the ability of some entrepreneurs to take advantage of a good deal when they see one Nonetheless they see evidence that at least some Californiaproduced power is being sold out of and back into the state at a higher price And they blame that on loopholes in the system that they say ought to be closed because the transactions are helping to drive up the cost of power The Independent System Operator invites this type of activity said Frank Wolak a Stanford economist who chairs the nonprofit corporations market surveillance committee which has warned of the potential for megawatt laundering in at least two reports this year The thing that makes all these problems go is the fact that the ISO has said Well pay whatever it takes to keep the lights on and thats screwing consumers big time In when the states energy markets were deregulated it was generally assumed that opening up the sale of electricity to competition would make power less expensive As a precaution however officials at the Independent System Operator instituted wholesale price caps which they lowered twice this summer to help keep a lid on costs On July this year they reduced the cap from per megawatt per hour to one megawatt being sufficient power for homes Then on Aug they cut it to Unfortunately things havent worked out the way officials had hoped Wholesale prices rose dramatically this year And while a freeze on retail utility rates has temporarily shielded Pacific Gas Electric Co customers from those soaring costs home electricity prices have tripled in San Diego where a similar freeze already has come off In the process some generators learned that all it takes to get around the states wholesale price caps is a basic understanding of how the market works One of the best ways to get top dollar they learned was to hold off selling their electricity until the Independent System Operator issues what is known as an outofmarket call for energy which amounts to an emergency request for electricity From May through September this year the overall price of power in the state averaged less than per megawatt hour according to authorities But over the same period power sold in response to outofmarket calls averaged more than During the summer when energy use is at a maximum California typically imports about onefourth of the power it uses from other states Since power generated by firms in other states isnt limited by Californias price cap those companies generally are in a better position than California firms to make a killing on outofmarket sales But by cutting a deal with a collaborator in another state energy specialists say California generators also can profit handsomely despite the cap Heres how Say a California generator has megawatts Instead of selling it in California where the firm can receive no more than per megawatt hour under the current cap it finds a utility an electricity broker or a corporate affiliate with an equal amount of power in another state such as Arizona Then just before an expected heat wave in California which is likely to result in an outofmarket call for power here it convinces the other firm to do a trade Under the deal the California generator sends its megawatts for one hour to the company in Arizona where there is no price cap and earns or more per megawatt for a total of In return the Arizona firm ships its megawatts for one hour here Since that power isnt subject to Californias cap it earns perhaps per megawatt for a total of Presumably energy specialists say the two firms then split the difference The potential profit from such deals is considerable Generators in and out of California received more than million from outofmarket sales this summer according to the Independent System Operator But determining if megawatt laundering is really happening how often and who might be benefiting is difficult One California investigator said authorities first suspected that megawatt laundering was occurring when they noticed that precisely the same amount of power was being sold to another state and then sold back into California minutes later But other experts said the evidence has rarely been that clear While hundreds of megawatts is sold into and out of the state on any given day they said the suspicion that firms were conspiring to sell the same power back and forth has stemmed largely from unfounded speculation One big problem for investigators trying to learn if the system has been abused is that confidentiality rules keep many of the details about these electricity transactions private Entities like us and others who may be suffering from the consequences of this laundering dont necessarily have the documents to prove it said Gary Stern director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison one of the states three main utilities We can only speculate based on things weve heard from others about the practiceIts our hope thats one of the things thats being examined by the various federal and state agencies investigating this summers extraordinary rise in California power prices Indeed while some people say megawatt laundering can be substantially limited by ending the practice of paying more than the wholesale cap for outofstate power others argue that its just as important to eliminate the secrecy surrounding electricity transactions Id like to see more information made public said Jim Bushnell a researcher at the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley who specializes in analyzing the states energy markets There are a lot of rumors circulating around this he said of megawatt laundering and it would help clarify if this is a serious problem To see more of the San Jose Mercury News or to subscribe to the newspaper go to

flying below the radar if possible the matter here is complicated by the fact that FERCs discovery rules CFR Subpart D pertain only to proceedings set for hearing and to such proceedings as the Commission may order CFR In this case FERC stated that a trialtype hearing is not necessary and specifically rejected the use of a trialtype evidentiary hearing Slip op at n Thus while I have not researched the matter as yet my preliminary view is that the CPUCs attempt to invoke FERCs discovery processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERCs Nov order and its regulations unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it specifically attempts to equate paper hearings with trialtype hearings see page of its Motion The CPUCs motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery in this case under Rule While the CPUCs motion does not apply directly to marketers FERCs ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties As a result we need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing with an expedited decisional track particularly in light of the fact that Staff has already conducted Jeffrey Watkiss AM Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers including EPMI are not included in the list of subject companies Exh B Since EPMI is not a subject of the motion why should it answer Lying in the weeds may be a more prudent course of action Fergus Gary S PM I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information Here are the facts we have so far On November th the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer According to Exhibit B read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell the following CPUC moved against the following entities AES Williams Duke Dynegy Reliant and Southern Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody in fact in footnote they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B We will have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this To repeat Enron is not named yet Thanks Gary Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday November PM To Cc Subject Important CPUC Motion Confidential Attorney Client Privilege and Work Product As you may already know the CPUC filed a motion at FERC asking for a protective order and to compel production of the information they subpoened from us in the CPUCs OII case Given the timing we should discuss this on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow They request that we be required to answer their motion on Thursday to provide the information within working days of a FERC ordering production and to provide of PL information and spread sheets detailing our deals specifically delivery point delivery date counterparty volume and price We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for the information to be provided for government eyes only this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself visavis other market participants a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to share this information with the CPUC for purposes of the PUCs OII proceeding pursuant to USC hc USC gc requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities We should argue that USC hc does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the Commissions decision to allow the UDCs unfettered access to the forwards market This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can get information about the

Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia linking Washington with Alberta as detailed in an Oct Power Pool market surveillance report Again no charges have been laid Company Web sites By Cheryl Kim Dow Jones Newswires mailto END Dow Jones

SDGEs Electricity Needs For Next Five Years at Low Fixed Price MORRO BAY Calif Nov PRNewswire Duke Energy NYSE DUK news through its business unit Duke Energy North America DENA has put forth another bold solution to Californias electricity crisis by proposing to manage San Diego Gas Electrics SDGE megawatt electricity load at a fixed price of cents per kilowatthour for the next five years This proposal is based on market prices for electricity and natural gas as of Nov DENAs proposal which takes into account SDGEs seasonal and hourly load requirements and has a percent annual adjustment for inflation was included in comments DENA submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week in response to the commissions proposed remedies for Californias electricity market Under DENAs proposal SDGEs business and residential customers no longer would be exposed to the electricity price spikes they experienced this past summer when their retail electricity prices often exceeded cents per kilowatthour The megawatts represent the full electricity load SDGE needs to serve its retail customer base during the hottest summer day said Jeff Stokes DENA executive vice president for the Western region We again have stepped up with tangible marketbased solutions that can be implemented to address the San Diego areas electricity price spikes In addition to stabilizing customers power bills our proposal would also eliminate SDGEs exposure to high wholesale electricity prices and the financial uncertainty that goes along with that exposure California is facing high wholesale electricity prices largely because of supply and demand imbalance which has caused the California Independent System Operator CalISO to call an unprecedented Stage Two Electrical Emergencies thus far in when available electricity supplies have fallen below percent The primary causes for the electricity supply shortfall are the states economic growth the lack of new power plants being built in California over the past decade an aging generation fleet that requires more maintenance and electricity imports being less available due to economic growth throughout the West Californias electricity supply and demand imbalance is expected to worsen or show little improvement until the summers of and which is the earliest a substantial amount of new more efficient and cleaner power plants can be brought on line This is another key marketbased solution to Californias electricity crisis made by Duke Energy over the past four months and we hope that it is given serious consideration said Bill Hall DENA vice president of asset management for the Western region The competitive wholesale electricity markets did not cause this electricity crisis but with patience wisdom and bold behavior by all market participants we can fix the crisis and not burden the states electricity ratepayers or taxpayers DENA has taken the following steps recently to address Californias electricity shortfall and high prices On Nov DENA broke ground on its million modernization of Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County to upgrade the existing plant and add megawatts of new capacity to the sites current megawatts When the modernization is completed the plant will be Californias largest The project represents a substantial portion of the new generation scheduled to come on line in California during summer On Nov DENA signed a wholesale electricity contract with Southern California Edison to help manage price volatility and prevent price spikes for their retail customers This followed a similar contract that was signed with Pacific Gas Electric on Oct The specific prices of the contracts are proprietary On Oct DENA refiled with the California Energy Commission its page application for certification to modernize the megawatt Morro Bay Power Plant The new megawatt facility represents a million investment If the certification is received DENA expects to bring the new plant on line by summer and demolish the existing plant by Finally DENA has begun to work with City of Chula Vista officials to accelerate the schedule for replacing the South Bay Power Plant with a cleaner and more

price cap in California will fall to MWh and refunds will not cannot be ordered Carol GMT November DJ FERC To Lower Price Cap In Calif Pwr OrderCommissioners By JASON LEOPOLD Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will likely lower its proposed per megawatthour soft cap on Californias wholesale power prices to MWh in its final order to repair the states troubled electricity market commissioners said Monday But the commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires they wont order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall profits earned last summer as a result of spiking power prices in the state despite pleas from state lawmakers and Gov Gray Davis because they lack the authority to do so We still believe we cannot order refunds one FERC commissioner said If there was an inch in the Federal Power Act that gave us the authority we would take it But that would destroy the future of deregulation FERC released a report earlier this month that largely pinned Californias ongoing power crisis on the structure of the states wholesale electricity markets The commission also issued a proposed order requiring changes needed to make the market workably competitive The order found that electricity prices in the state rose to unjust and unreasonable levels last summer But FERC fell short of ordering refunds saying it lacked the legal authority to do so Instead FERC proposed changes to the governing boards of the states two wholesalemarket operators the Independent System Operator and Power Exchange said the states three investorowned utilities should no longer be required to buy a majority of their power from the CalPX and proposed penalties for utilities that put off buying the power they need until the last minute FERC also proposed capping the price paid to all bidders in Californias power auctions at MWh Individual bidders could still get higher prices but would have to justify their claims to FERC FERC may issue its final order as early as Dec and commissioners said California shouldnt expect it to differ from the proposed changes recommended by FERC earlier this month The comment period for FERCs draft order closed Nov MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT Final Order Wont Order Refunds Davis warned FERC commissioners at a public hearing in San Diego two weeks ago that a failure to order refunds would produce a ratepayer revolt Your proposed solution to our energy crisis does nothing to lower prices for California consumers the Democratic governor told FERC on Nov at a meeting in San Diego Quite to the contrary it is designed to bring our economy and our consumers to their knees Californias power regulators and utilities also pressed for refunds The states Public Utilities Commission said it has evidence of market abuse by generators and that consumers were overcharged billion last summer for electricity Edison International unit EIX Southern California Edison in its response to the FERC order attached a study by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who found considerable evidence generators and power marketers deliberately withheld supply from California from June through September when power usage is at its peak to drive up wholesale prices But despite the allegations FERC commissioners said they will not order refunds though they said the state could legally return to costbased rates One commissioner also warned a lower soft cap of MWh would likely deter generators from building new power plants in the state even as it limited price spikes The truth of the matter is there is no painless or easy way for California to change its electricity market the FERC commissioner said Consumer Groups Push Ballot Measure To Reregulate Davis will file the changes the state wants made to the proposed order with FERC on Friday but FERC commissioners said they dont expect to be swayed by the governors filing Meanwhile Californians are steaming ahead with their own solutions On Tuesday the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights a Southern California consumer advocacy group will hold a news conference announcing its own sweeping changes to the states power market which it will try to implement through a proposed ballot measure the details of which have not been disclosed Furthermore state lawmakers plan on rewriting parts of AB Californias landmark restructuring law when the state Legislature convenes next year There is already heated debate within the Legislature to reauthorize utilities to build power plants and to create a public utility system like Nebraskas where there are no investorowned utilities in an effort to control power prices California lawmakers want to be reelected in one key lawmaker close to the electricity issue said And Davis is in meetings to replace the CalISO and CalPX with a new entity to manage the power grid and the states two wholesale power markets said Steve Maviglio Davis press secretary By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Last week FERC received hundreds of pages of comments to its proposed order for Californias power market MORE Dow Jones Newswires Gnther A Pergher Senior Analyst Dow

Dow JonesTransalta an investorowned utility based in Alberta Canada stopped selling power to the California Independent System Operator at pm PST Monday GMT Tuesday because it fears the grid operator wont be able to pay market sources told Dow Jones Newswires For about eight hours Monday Transalta sold the ISO megawatts of power from its Centralia generating station in western Washington state at a megawatthour the source said The MW will cost the ISO about million The cost of producing electricity at the MW Centralia plant is about MWh company officials said Because the ISO which manages electricity reliability in the state was buying a large quantity of power in the spot market Transalta questioned the ISOs creditworthiness A Transalta spokesperson wasnt immediately available for comment Monday Transalta could resume sales to the ISO at a later date Representatives from the ISO wouldnt comment To illustrate just how dire the supply situation in California is other power suppliers including British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH subsidiary PowerEx have requested that the ISO secure a letter of credit from one of the states three investorowned utilities before any transactions take place Last week Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison did just that issuing a letter of credit to PowerEx for million Steve Maviglio press secretary to California

since called a stagetwo power emergency and requested that Pacific Gas Electric Co interrupt about MW of power to large industrial customers who get reduced rates in exchange for having their power cut during peak demand periods By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires mailto END Dow Jones Newswires DJ CalPXFERC Should Extend Soft Cap To DayAhead Pwr Mkt Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow JonesThe California Power Exchange asked the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the California Independent System Operators new soft price cap to the CalPXs dayahead market over the objections of the ISO The ISO amendment as proposed and already implemented threatens to bring dire irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets the CalPX said in its filing On Friday the FERC approved an ISO emergency request to change the pricecap rules for its realtime market The ISO asked to be able to purchase power for more than a megawatthour so long as any seller agrees to provide documentation on costs to justify the high price In time the FERC could reduce prices for any sales above MWh if the FERC deems the price unreasonable The CalPX assumed based on FERCs approval of the ISO filing that the MWh hard price cap no longer applied to its dayahead market The CalPX cleared statewide prices on Sunday for Monday delivery that averaged MWh The CalPX had the approval of Californias three investorowned utilities for whom it buys power to dispense with the price cap according to CalPX spokesman Jesus Arredondo But when the CalPX submitted the dayahead market results to the ISO for transmission scheduling a daily procedure the ISO changed almost all the prices to MWh The ISO can adjust prices according to delivery zones within the state based on transmission congestion Prices for supplies from Arizona and Nevada often get constrained downward somewhat during the winter because available energy far outweighs transmission capacity from the Southwest into California But for the CalPXs dayahead market Sunday the ISO constrained prices downward for all zones by hundreds of dollars even though there was no transmission congestion for many hours California Gov Gray Davis publicly denounced the ISOs new soft cap rules and thinks the old hard price cap should be lowered to MWh The CalPX management has always opposed price caps The ISO approach is resulting in prices significantly below those of surrounding markets including the ISOs own outofmarket and realtime operations and other control areas This results in a significant supply migration out of the California forward markets Specifically CalPX notes that in order to accomplish the very purposes that the ISO intended to achieve it is imperative to add one fundamental missing part to the CAISO proposal ie to allow the existing hard cap on Adjustment Bids to rise from per MWh to an equivalent of the energy price that is a floating cap the CalPX told the FERC On Monday morning suppliers avoided the CalPX dayahead market because of the bottomline constrained prices of MWh they ended up getting Sunday With few suppliers and demand about the same Mondays market priced at about MWh higher than Sundays market CalPX staffers spent the weekend and Monday pleading with ISO staffers not to constrain all dayahead prices down to MWh but the ISO did anyway negotiations broke down and the CaLPX aked the FERC to referee Without immediately adding this component to the ISO proposal trading in the dayahead and dayof markets is unlikely to occur realtime trading will dramatically increase and realtime prices can be expected to rise well above competitive levels All of this is occurring already as a result of the ISO proposal and all of this is fundamentally at odds with the ISOs objectives of promoting forward activity and ensuring reliability during realtime operations CalPXs filing says Moreover all of this is a result of an abrupt change in approach to price caps which was not discussed with CalPX or to CalPXs knowledge any other stakeholders before being filed with the FERC CalPX has discussed the need for an immediate fix to ISOs incomplete tariff amendment repeatedly with the ISO since Friday and understands from discussions that continued until this very afternoon that the ISO is aware of the problem created by its proposal but unwilling to remedy it with a new filing of their own the filing states This mixture of hard and soft caps has resulted in a complete disconnect between unconstrained and constrained prices which has crippled the CalPX dayahead auction and disrupted the bilateral markets the CalPX said After the CalPX filing to FERC the ISO produced its constrained prices for Tuesday For the nine hours when there will be no transmission congestion the ISO allowed the PX prices around MWh to stand but the ISO lowered the prices for other hours when there will be congestion down to MWh and MWh The lower constrained prices arent the result of any market formula according to one CalPX staff member but are completely arbitrary The ISO was unable to comment Monday on the issue By Mark Golden of Dow Jones

NeedsContentTransferEncoding quotedprintable Date Tue Oct From Tracey Bradley To Deanna King Paul Fox Ronald Carroll Subject Portland Consultants Investigation Finds California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetUSASCII ContentDisposition inline FYI It sounds like this consultants findings are being questioned by many in the industry including by the CAISO Portland OreBased Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs Dan McSwain North County Times Escondido Calif October Oct PORTLAND OreA private investigation of state power markets has come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating capacity this summer The state enjoyed a percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared and the states power manager declared separate power emergencies because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage according to the investigation The author of the investigations preliminary report Portlandbased economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough said at a conference of analysts power traders and electricity industry regulators Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example it ran at well below its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale power prices and consumer electricity bills shot to well above the generating plants cost of production The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency which monitors emissions We are seeing a lot of undergeneration McCullough said This is market power in action Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market participants in this case suppliers to influence prices Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer and contributed to high prices but several participants said deregulation has reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal agencies including the EPA Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego County are scant Encinas operators a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc and NRG Energy Inc called Cabrillo Power confirmed that the power plant had no abnormal maintenance problems The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said Wednesday that the power plant was well within its statemandated pollution limits But David Lloyd the corporate secretary of Cabrillo denied that the Encina plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets That cant possibly be right Lloyd said of McCulloughs analysis In North County we were right on the ragged edge of being off an emergency shutdown because of heavy output Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off I cant comment Lloyd said We certainly dont want to be accused of anything wrongful he said We dont have that much power in California and for us to be shutting down in California to push up the price somewhere else doesnt make sense for us We want to run all we can when the prices are high Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May resulting in a doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the million customers of San Diego Gas Electric Co and causing an estimated billion in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with a retail rate cap but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow beyond million if high wholesale prices persist No fewer than five private state and federal investigations are under way to assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western states The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright manipulation in order to increase profits Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission Electricity Oversight Board and attorney general along with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation were launched in July and August Staff investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate the price spikes His effort is thought to be the first to complete an exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that was actually used Chief among McCulloughs findings was that demand for power was lower this summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web of power transmission lines that connect California to other Western states British Columbia and northern Mexico McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North County Times and the initial reaction of the states energy community was one of deep skepticism EPA data is notoriously unreliable said Frank Wolak a Stanford professor and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California Independent System Operator the agency that manages the state grid and which has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer To gauge the actual output of power plants that burn fossil fuel McCullough used emissions data from the EPA Greed would get the best of anybody Wolak said I found a lot of hours where instate generators were exceeding nameplate capacity These guys were cranking it out Wolak in a study of power markets for the system operator did conclude however that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was the major cause of higher prices this summer At the conference in Portland most of the panelists did not openly criticize McCulloughs analysis but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures in the Southwest were blamed for limiting Californias ability to import electricity Others said state and federal regulators along with market participants themselves wont really know what happened until more experts look at hard market information that is in short supply Ron Eachus the

October pm Eastern Time Press Release SOURCE Southern California Edison SCE Files Joint Petition Urging Federal Regulators to Act Swiftly in Response To Unjust and Unreasonable Rates WASHINGTON Oct PRNewswire Southern California Edison SCE today filed a joint petition urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to take immediate action in response to unjust and unreasonable wholesale electricity prices by authorizing a MWh cap in the markets run by the California Independent System Operator CalISO and the California Power Exchange PX Pacific Gas and Electric Co PGE and The Utility Reform Network TURN joined SCE in filing the petition In addition to immediate relief the filing asked for an expedited proceeding to provide the fact finding needed a to adopt comprehensive marketpower mitigation measures that would replace the MWh cap and b to determine refund responsibility Even though the peak demands of the summer are behind us electricity prices in the wholesale market remain unreasonably high said SCE Senior Vice President for Regulatory Policy Affairs John Fielder For example on Sunday September prices reached MWh even though demand was relatively low about twothirds that seen during a peak summer day Each day that passes the consumers utilities and economy of California are unfairly burdened with excessive electricity costs Fielder said We reiterate Governor Gray Davis request that FERC act without delay to address the problems in the wholesale market Specifically SCE PGE and TURN asked FERC to make an immediate finding that Californias electricity market is not workably competitive and that resulting prices are unjust and unreasonable Numerous studies from independent analysts have provided ample documentation of the many problems that plague the California market Fielder said For example in a report dated Sept CalISOs Market Surveillance Committee found that prices in June of this year were nearly three times the level that would be experienced in a properly functioning competitive market SCE and the other petitioners asked FERC to provide immediate relief from these unjust and unreasonable rates by authorizing a MWh cap in the dayahead hourahead dayof and realtime markets run by CalISO and PX a MWh cap currently is in effect only in the CalISO markets In the past FERC has used a MWh rate as a standard in cases where neither costbased nor marketbased rates apply such as emergency service The filing demonstrated that this price level was sufficient to cover costs for most plants but also allowed generators and energy traders to seek a higher rate from FERC This higher price would be paid only to the individual seller on a unitspecific basis it would not set the market clearing price In addition to this immediate emergency relief the filing also asked FERC for an expedited hearing on intermediate steps that can be taken until longterm changes to the California electricity market can be implemented The petitioners asked FERC to require sellers of electricity other than musttake units to submit costofservice information to the Commission within days The filing noted that FERC could use this information to replace the MWh cap with marketpower mitigation measures tailored to address the precise problems identified in the hearing process These measures could include the temporary imposition of costofservice pricing contracts through which generators would commit a percentage of their capacity to the ISO at costbased rates unitspecific bid caps or marketwide caps that vary based on the operating cost of the unit expected to be on the margin at different load levels While the marketpower mitigation measures will ensure just and reasonable rates in the future the filing also asked FERC to investigate past pricing and determine whether refunds from electricity sellers are appropriate An Edison International company Southern California Edison is one of the nations largest

Tracey Bradley To Ronald Carroll Subject PowerPlus CA Munis Propose StateRun NonProfit Transco For Market Woe MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetUSASCII ContentDisposition inline PowerPlus In effort to regain state authority CA Munis Propose StateRun NonProfit Transco For Market Woes A recent proposal by municipal utilities in California to turn the California Independent System Operator CalISO into a staterun transmission company transco has piqued the interest of some industry officials who claim it will start an effective dialog on the future of the states energy markets and the organization responsible for access to the grid the CalISO However the ISO argues the proposal is a nonsolution and will only delay constructive discussions over the fate of restructuring in California Others say the concept is a concerted effort by state agencies to regain control over the transmission system that California lost when the ISO was approved by federal regulators The California Municipal Utilities Association CMUA proposed the concept in a statement when the organization delivered a filing to FERC seeking a return to costbased rates in the state CMUA filed the petition with the commission earlier this month but FERC action on any filing regarding Californias electricity markets will likely have to wait until the commission issues the results of its investigation into the states wholesale power markets due later this fall While a return to costbased rates in FERCs hands CMUA has initiated an innovative discussion on the status of the CalISO the entity many California officials fault for some of the problems resulting from the energy crisis which plagued the state and indeed the West much of this past summer CMUA claims the current ISO model and governance structure contains too much red tape which only adds unnecessary delay in crisis situations when quick action is needed CMUA says the biggest fault with the ISO is its connection to the marketplace it oversees Ideally regional transmission organizations RTOs should not have any responsibility over markets and only needs to concentrate on managing the grid in an independent manner By forcing the ISO to operate both the market the ISO is responsible for managing the ancillary services markets and the grid it cannot be expected to run either efficiently a CMUA source says The market here doesnt work the CMUA source says The ISO by default has been embroiled in the market The new transco wouldnt be involved with ancillary services This gets the ISO out of the market another public power source says It was never envisioned to be a part of procuring energy supplies Exact details of the structure of the staterun transco have yet to be resolved because any changes to the ISO will have to come from legislative and regulatory mandates the CMUA source says The group is considering legislation to initiate the changes and says the concept resolves what many officials claim to be a major flaw with the ISO its stakeholder board Currently the ISO is managed by a board made up of industry representatives and meets regularly each month At the monthly board meetings the ISO makes most of its crucial decisions on management governance and price caps The CMUA source contends that the ISO does a suspect job in getting materials to board members before meetings and if the organization is staterun it will be forced to open all executive meetings to the public The transco would be nonprofit and a government agency so you have open meetings the source says The ISO has not been good at getting material to board members before meetings A staterun transco also would have eminent domain authority to site new transmission lines something which the ISO currently lacks And because the transco would both own and operate the system it would have the necessary incentives to build more transmission the CMUA source says The public agency will have the power of eminent domain the source says Some industry officials say the idea is part of a concerted effort among California executives and lawmakers to retain as much control as possible over the ISO In numerous reports issued this past summer in response to the energy crisis the ISO and its regulator FERC were seen as two of the main culprits By making the ISO an official state agency that owns the system California retains its authority over the grid This may very well play as a part of a state strategy to get more control back to California an ISO board member says If its a state agency the state is going to have a much bigger role The concept has not been wellreceived by the ISO where an official there calls the idea a solution to a nonproblem This source says the ISO has done a laudable job in maintaining the efficiency of the transmission grid and has spent nearly million in transmission expansion This is a curious solution to a nonproblem this official says The market operation of the ISO is a nonissue The transmission system is being utilized much more efficiently now than it was before The official also says that it is unclear whether a stateowned transco would meet FERCs RTO requirements and such an entity would further cloud the line between state and federal jurisdiction If it is a public owner it is not clear if its federally or stateowned this source says It solves a nonproblem I dont know how easily it would be to integrate it into an interstate market

Electric Megawatt Laundering Steve Johnson San Jose Mercury News Calif October Oct While investigating this summers stunning spike in electricity prices state authorities have heard stories about a curious phenomenon On days when the weather is hot batches of power generated in California are sold to other states A little later in the day similar amounts of power are sold back to California but at much higher prices The question is is it the same power If so that could be megawatt laundering a multicompany conspiracy to evade Californias wholesale price cap which covers power generated in California but not power sold into California from elsewhere Worried that such transactions could be costing consumers millions of dollars several energy specialists raised concerns about megawatt laundering during a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hearing a month ago in San Diego And earlier this month state Sen Steve Peace DLa Mesa who helped lead the push to deregulate electricity sales in California formally asked the commission to investigate the practice which he termed potentially illegal market coordination But an unconfirmed news report last week said the federal agency had concluded that generators had not abused the market And others say concerns about megawatt laundering are exaggerated Among them is Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association a powerfirm trade group and chairman of the Independent System Operator which oversees most of Californias power grid While acknowledging that such laundering is possible SmutnyJones said there is no evidence it is actually occurring or is widespread This is one of those things thats turning into an urban legend he said I dont want to characterize this as a significant problem Even some critics of the way power is purchased in California concede that most of what has been labeled megawatt laundering probably reflects nothing more sinister than the ability of some entrepreneurs to take advantage of a good deal when they see one Nonetheless they see evidence that at least some Californiaproduced power is being sold out of and back into the state at a higher price And they blame that on loopholes in the system that they say ought to be closed because the transactions are helping to drive up the cost of power The Independent System Operator invites this type of activity said Frank Wolak a Stanford economist who chairs the nonprofit corporations market surveillance committee which has warned of the potential for megawatt laundering in at least two reports this year The thing that makes all these problems go is the fact that the ISO has said Well pay whatever it takes to keep the lights on and thats screwing consumers big time In when the states energy markets were deregulated it was generally assumed that opening up the sale of electricity to competition would make power less expensive As a precaution however officials at the Independent System Operator instituted wholesale price caps which they lowered twice this summer to help keep a lid on costs On July this year they reduced the cap from per megawatt per hour to one megawatt being sufficient power for homes Then on Aug they cut it to Unfortunately things havent worked out the way officials had hoped Wholesale prices rose dramatically this year And while a freeze on retail utility rates has temporarily shielded Pacific Gas Electric Co customers from those soaring costs home electricity prices have tripled in San Diego where a similar freeze already has come off In the process some generators learned that all it takes to get around the states wholesale price caps is a basic understanding of how the market works One of the best ways to get top dollar they learned was to hold off selling their electricity until the Independent System Operator issues what is known as an outofmarket call for energy which amounts to an emergency request for electricity From May through September this year the overall price of power in the state averaged less than per megawatt hour according to authorities But over the same period power sold in response to outofmarket calls averaged more than During the summer when energy use is at a maximum California typically imports about onefourth of the power it uses from other states Since power generated by firms in other states isnt limited by Californias price cap those companies generally are in a better position than California firms to make a killing on outofmarket sales But by cutting a deal with a collaborator in another state energy specialists say California generators also can profit handsomely despite the cap Heres how Say a California generator has megawatts Instead of selling it in California where the firm can receive no more than per megawatt hour under the current cap it finds a utility an electricity broker or a corporate affiliate with an equal amount of power in another state such as Arizona Then just before an expected heat wave in California which is likely to result in an outofmarket call for power here it convinces the other firm to do a trade Under the deal the California generator sends its megawatts for one hour to the company in Arizona where there is no price cap and earns or more per megawatt for a total of In return the Arizona firm ships its megawatts for one hour here Since that power isnt subject to Californias cap it earns perhaps per megawatt for a total of Presumably energy specialists say the two firms then split the difference The potential profit from such deals is considerable Generators in and out of California received more than million from outofmarket sales this summer according to the Independent System Operator But determining if megawatt laundering is really happening how often and who might be benefiting is difficult One California investigator said authorities first suspected that megawatt laundering was occurring when they noticed that precisely the same amount of power was being sold to another state and then sold back into California minutes later But other experts said the evidence has rarely been that clear While hundreds of megawatts is sold into and out of the state on any given day they said the suspicion that firms were conspiring to sell the same power back and forth has stemmed largely from unfounded speculation One big problem for investigators trying to learn if the system has been abused is that confidentiality rules keep many of the details about these electricity transactions private Entities like us and others who may be suffering from the consequences of this laundering dont necessarily have the documents to prove it said Gary Stern director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison one of the states three main utilities We can only speculate based on things weve heard from others about the practiceIts our hope thats one of the things thats being examined by the various federal and state agencies investigating this summers extraordinary rise in California power prices Indeed while some people say megawatt laundering can be substantially limited by ending the practice of paying more than the wholesale cap for outofstate power others argue that its just as important to eliminate the secrecy surrounding electricity transactions Id like to see more information made public said

flying below the radar if possible the matter here is complicated by the fact that FERCs discovery rules CFR Subpart D pertain only to proceedings set for hearing and to such proceedings as the Commission may order CFR In this case FERC stated that a trialtype hearing is not necessary and specifically rejected the use of a trialtype evidentiary hearing Slip op at n Thus while I have not researched the matter as yet my preliminary view is that the CPUCs attempt to invoke FERCs discovery processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERCs Nov order and its regulations unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it specifically attempts to equate paper hearings with trialtype hearings see page of its Motion The CPUCs motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery in this case under Rule While the CPUCs motion does not apply directly to marketers FERCs ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties As a result we need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing with an expedited decisional track particularly in light of the fact that Staff has already conducted Jeffrey Watkiss AM Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers including EPMI are not included in the list of subject companies Exh B Since EPMI is not a subject of the motion why should it answer Lying in the weeds may be a more prudent course of action Fergus Gary S PM I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information Here are the facts we have so far On November th the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer According to Exhibit B read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell the following CPUC moved against the following entities AES Williams Duke Dynegy Reliant and Southern Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody in fact in footnote they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B We will have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this To repeat Enron is not named yet Thanks Gary Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday November PM To Cc Subject Important CPUC Motion Confidential Attorney Client Privilege and Work Product As you may already know the CPUC filed a motion at FERC asking for a protective order and to compel production of the information they subpoened from us in the CPUCs OII case Given the timing we should discuss this on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow They request that we be required to answer their motion on Thursday to provide the information within working days of a FERC ordering production and to provide of PL information and spread sheets detailing our deals specifically delivery point delivery date counterparty volume and price We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for the information to be provided for government eyes only this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself visavis other market participants a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to share this information with the CPUC for purposes of the PUCs OII proceeding pursuant to USC hc USC gc requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities We should argue that USC hc does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the Commissions decision to allow the UDCs unfettered access to the forwards market This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can get information about the

Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc TORONTO Dow JonesCanadas Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron Canada Corp in Calgary and Powerex Corp in Vancouver earlier this year as part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two companies according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of Powerex and Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta The investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of the companies according to Enron The Competition Bureau declined to comment on the status of the case Both Enron Corp ENE which owns Enron Canada and Powerex a unit of provincially owned British Columbia Hydro Power Authority XBCH deny breaking any rules or laws From Powerexs point of view Albertans are looking for someone to blame for high power prices which have become a political issue in the province They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market design flaws Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulating market Enron has participated in Enron Corp spokesman Mark Palmer said Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility there have been investigations done Palmer said Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets investigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules This is the first such investigation into Powerexs actions Peterson said The Competition Bureau based in Ottawa wont say whether the investigaion is ongoing citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act The companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations status Their seized files were returned several months ago but Powerex hasnt heard from the Bureau since then Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week with a question according to Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode The investigation began when the Power Pool of Albertas system controllers noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C with unusual frequency The Pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power for the following day Until Oct a bidder could restate the amount of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutes before the hour of transmission The price paid for every megawatt of power needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application Powerex and Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer As little as two minutes later Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume but at a significantly higher price according to the warrant application Sometimes Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its offer Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig who once worked in Enron Canadas gas trading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostly Powerex and Enron the Pool price was raised once to CMWh four times to between C and C three times to between C and C and times to between C and C Based on the restatement patterns Craig and then the Bureaus Bloom concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool They believed the power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the higher price according to the warrant application By cutting the volume offered by Powerex the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be needed and every participant would get the higher price Powerexs Peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed by the Bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong or that the two companies had some sort of arrangement And were adamant about that Peterson said There was no deal with Enron There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a change in prices or anything like that Powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companys risk which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price Peterson said Whenever Enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments of Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced unit according to the warrant application Petersons response Were operating in a very tight market there and we felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we could sell it at Enrons Thode said And thats what Enron and every other company does thats in the business of trading The May search warrant covers the companies actions between June and Oct On Oct the Pool changed its restatement rules essentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making public its investigation into Powerex and Enron Power Pool spokesman Wayne St Amour declined to discuss details of the investigation Market surveillance is in place to among other things protect the interests and activities of market participants he said Those convicted under Canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount at the courts discretion andor jailed up to five years A conviction wouldnt likely affect Powerexs ability to trade in the US Peterson said In Canada there would have to have some followon action by the Alberta parties to inhibit that And so far they still like to get our power Companies Concerned About Reputations The bigger problem Peterson said is what the case will do to the Powerex reputation Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at stake from a reputational point of view Peterson said Both companies I believe conduct themselves in the highest possible standard But these are difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and California and people looking for somebody to blame Theres always a possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia linking Washington with Alberta as detailed in an Oct Power Pool market surveillance report Again no charges have been laid Company Web sites By Cheryl Kim Dow Jones Newswires mailto END Dow Jones

SDGEs Electricity Needs For Next Five Years at Low Fixed Price MORRO BAY Calif Nov PRNewswire Duke Energy NYSE DUK news through its business unit Duke Energy North America DENA has put forth another bold solution to Californias electricity crisis by proposing to manage San Diego Gas Electrics SDGE megawatt electricity load at a fixed price of cents per kilowatthour for the next five years This proposal is based on market prices for electricity and natural gas as of Nov DENAs proposal which takes into account SDGEs seasonal and hourly load requirements and has a percent annual adjustment for inflation was included in comments DENA submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week in response to the commissions proposed remedies for Californias electricity market Under DENAs proposal SDGEs business and residential customers no longer would be exposed to the electricity price spikes they experienced this past summer when their retail electricity prices often exceeded cents per kilowatthour The megawatts represent the full electricity load SDGE needs to serve its retail customer base during the hottest summer day said Jeff Stokes DENA executive vice president for the Western region We again have stepped up with tangible marketbased solutions that can be implemented to address the San Diego areas electricity price spikes In addition to stabilizing customers power bills our proposal would also eliminate SDGEs exposure to high wholesale electricity prices and the financial uncertainty that goes along with that exposure California is facing high wholesale electricity prices largely because of supply and demand imbalance which has caused the California Independent System Operator CalISO to call an unprecedented Stage Two Electrical Emergencies thus far in when available electricity supplies have fallen below percent The primary causes for the electricity supply shortfall are the states economic growth the lack of new power plants being built in California over the past decade an aging generation fleet that requires more maintenance and electricity imports being less available due to economic growth throughout the West Californias electricity supply and demand imbalance is expected to worsen or show little improvement until the summers of and which is the earliest a substantial amount of new more efficient and cleaner power plants can be brought on line This is another key marketbased solution to Californias electricity crisis made by Duke Energy over the past four months and we hope that it is given serious consideration said Bill Hall DENA vice president of asset management for the Western region The competitive wholesale electricity markets did not cause this electricity crisis but with patience wisdom and bold behavior by all market participants we can fix the crisis and not burden the states electricity ratepayers or taxpayers DENA has taken the following steps recently to address Californias electricity shortfall and high prices On Nov DENA broke ground on its million modernization of Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County to upgrade the existing plant and add megawatts of new capacity to the sites current megawatts When the modernization is completed the plant will be Californias largest The project represents a substantial portion of the new generation scheduled to come on line in California during summer On Nov DENA signed a wholesale electricity contract with Southern California Edison to help manage price volatility and prevent price spikes for their retail customers This followed a similar contract that was signed with Pacific Gas Electric on Oct The specific prices of the contracts are proprietary On Oct DENA refiled with the California Energy Commission its page application for certification to modernize the megawatt Morro Bay Power Plant The new megawatt facility represents a million investment If the certification is received DENA expects to bring the new plant on line by summer and demolish the existing plant by Finally DENA has begun to work with City of Chula Vista officials to accelerate the schedule for replacing the South Bay Power Plant with a cleaner and more efficient facility Existing plans call for the plant to be replaced in For more information about DENAs California operations power plant modernization plans and position on Californias electricity

price cap in California will fall to MWh and refunds will not cannot be ordered Carol GMT November DJ FERC To Lower Price Cap In Calif Pwr OrderCommissioners By JASON LEOPOLD Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will likely lower its proposed per megawatthour soft cap on Californias wholesale power prices to MWh in its final order to repair the states troubled electricity market commissioners said Monday But the commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires they wont order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall profits earned last summer as a result of spiking power prices in the state despite pleas from state lawmakers and Gov Gray Davis because they lack the authority to do so We still believe we cannot order refunds one FERC commissioner said If there was an inch in the Federal Power Act that gave us the authority we would take it But that would destroy the future of deregulation FERC released a report earlier this month that largely pinned Californias ongoing power crisis on the structure of the states wholesale electricity markets The commission also issued a proposed order requiring changes needed to make the market workably competitive The order found that electricity prices in the state rose to unjust and unreasonable levels last summer But FERC fell short of ordering refunds saying it lacked the legal authority to do so Instead FERC proposed changes to the governing boards of the states two wholesalemarket operators the Independent System Operator and Power Exchange said the states three investorowned utilities should no longer be required to buy a majority of their power from the CalPX and proposed penalties for utilities that put off buying the power they need until the last minute FERC also proposed capping the price paid to all bidders in Californias power auctions at MWh Individual bidders could still get higher prices but would have to justify their claims to FERC FERC may issue its final order as early as Dec and commissioners said California shouldnt expect it to differ from the proposed changes recommended by FERC earlier this month The comment period for FERCs draft order closed Nov MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT Final Order Wont Order Refunds Davis warned FERC commissioners at a public hearing in San Diego two weeks ago that a failure to order refunds would produce a ratepayer revolt Your proposed solution to our energy crisis does nothing to lower prices for California consumers the Democratic governor told FERC on Nov at a meeting in San Diego Quite to the contrary it is designed to bring our economy and our consumers to their knees Californias power regulators and utilities also pressed for refunds The states Public Utilities Commission said it has evidence of market abuse by generators and that consumers were overcharged billion last summer for electricity Edison International unit EIX Southern California Edison in its response to the FERC order attached a study by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who found considerable evidence generators and power marketers deliberately withheld supply from California from June through September when power usage is at its peak to drive up wholesale prices But despite the allegations FERC commissioners said they will not order refunds though they said the state could legally return to costbased rates One commissioner also warned a lower soft cap of MWh would likely deter generators from building new power plants in the state even as it limited price spikes The truth of the matter is there is no painless or easy way for California to change its electricity market the FERC commissioner said Consumer Groups Push Ballot Measure To Reregulate Davis will file the changes the state wants made to the proposed order with FERC on Friday but FERC commissioners said they dont expect to be swayed by the governors filing Meanwhile Californians are steaming ahead with their own solutions On Tuesday the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights a Southern California consumer advocacy group will hold a news conference announcing its own sweeping changes to the states power market which it will try to implement through a proposed ballot measure the details of which have not been disclosed Furthermore state lawmakers plan on rewriting parts of AB Californias landmark restructuring law when the state Legislature convenes next year There is already heated debate within the Legislature to reauthorize utilities to build power plants and to create a public utility system like Nebraskas where there are no investorowned utilities in an effort to control power prices California lawmakers want to be reelected in one key lawmaker close to the electricity issue said And Davis is in meetings to replace the CalISO and CalPX with a new entity to manage the power grid and the states two wholesale power markets said Steve Maviglio Davis press secretary By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Last week FERC received hundreds of pages of comments to its proposed order for Californias power market MORE Dow Jones Newswires Gnther A Pergher Senior Analyst Dow

Dow JonesTransalta an investorowned utility based in Alberta Canada stopped selling power to the California Independent System Operator at pm PST Monday GMT Tuesday because it fears the grid operator wont be able to pay market sources told Dow Jones Newswires For about eight hours Monday Transalta sold the ISO megawatts of power from its Centralia generating station in western Washington state at a megawatthour the source said The MW will cost the ISO about million The cost of producing electricity at the MW Centralia plant is about MWh company officials said Because the ISO which manages electricity reliability in the state was buying a large quantity of power in the spot market Transalta questioned the ISOs creditworthiness A Transalta spokesperson wasnt immediately available for comment Monday Transalta could resume sales to the ISO at a later date Representatives from the ISO wouldnt comment To illustrate just how dire the supply situation in California is other power

cut during peak demand periods By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires mailto END Dow Jones Newswires DJ CalPXFERC Should Extend Soft Cap To DayAhead Pwr Mkt Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow JonesThe California Power Exchange asked the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the California Independent System Operators new soft price cap to the CalPXs dayahead market over the objections of the ISO The ISO amendment as proposed and already implemented threatens to bring dire irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets the CalPX said in its filing On Friday the FERC approved an ISO emergency request to change the pricecap rules for its realtime market The ISO asked to be able to purchase power for more than a megawatthour so long as any seller agrees to provide documentation on costs to justify the high price In time the FERC could reduce prices for any sales above MWh if the FERC deems the price unreasonable The CalPX assumed based on FERCs approval of the ISO filing that the MWh hard price cap no longer applied to its dayahead market The CalPX cleared statewide prices on Sunday for Monday delivery that averaged MWh The CalPX had the approval of Californias three investorowned utilities for whom it buys power to dispense with the price cap according to CalPX spokesman Jesus Arredondo But when the CalPX submitted the dayahead market results to the ISO for transmission scheduling a daily procedure the ISO changed almost all the prices to MWh The ISO can adjust prices according to delivery zones within the state based on transmission congestion Prices for supplies from Arizona and Nevada often get constrained downward somewhat during the winter because available energy far outweighs transmission capacity from the Southwest into California But for the CalPXs dayahead market Sunday the ISO constrained prices downward for all zones by hundreds of dollars even though there was no transmission congestion for many hours California Gov Gray Davis publicly denounced the ISOs new soft cap rules and thinks the old hard price cap should be lowered to MWh The CalPX management has always opposed price caps The ISO approach is resulting in prices significantly below those of surrounding markets including the ISOs own outofmarket and realtime operations and other control areas This results in a significant supply migration out of the California forward markets Specifically CalPX notes that in order to accomplish the very purposes that the ISO intended to achieve it is imperative to add one fundamental missing part to the CAISO proposal ie to allow the existing hard cap on Adjustment Bids to rise from per MWh to an equivalent of the energy price that is a floating cap the CalPX told the FERC On Monday morning suppliers avoided the CalPX dayahead market because of the bottomline constrained prices of MWh they ended up getting Sunday With few suppliers and demand about the same Mondays market priced at about MWh higher than Sundays market CalPX staffers spent the weekend and Monday pleading with ISO staffers not to constrain all dayahead prices down to MWh but the ISO did anyway negotiations broke down and the CaLPX aked the FERC to referee Without immediately adding this component to the ISO proposal trading in the dayahead and dayof markets is unlikely to occur realtime trading will dramatically increase and realtime prices can be expected to rise well above competitive levels All of this is occurring already as a result of the ISO proposal and all of this is fundamentally at odds with the ISOs objectives of promoting forward activity and ensuring reliability during realtime operations CalPXs filing says Moreover all of this is a result of an abrupt change in approach to price caps which was not discussed with CalPX or to CalPXs knowledge any other stakeholders before being filed with the FERC CalPX has discussed the need for an immediate fix to ISOs incomplete tariff amendment repeatedly with the ISO since Friday and understands from discussions that continued until this very afternoon that the ISO is aware of the problem created by its proposal but unwilling to remedy it with a new filing of their own the filing states This mixture of hard and soft caps has resulted in a complete disconnect between unconstrained and constrained prices which has crippled the CalPX dayahead auction and disrupted the bilateral markets the CalPX said After the CalPX filing to FERC the ISO produced its constrained prices for Tuesday For the nine hours when there will be no transmission congestion the ISO allowed the PX prices around MWh to stand but the ISO lowered the prices for other hours when there will be congestion down to MWh and MWh The lower constrained prices arent the result of any market formula according to one CalPX staff member but are completely arbitrary The ISO was unable to comment Monday on the issue By Mark Golden of Dow Jones

LIMITING PRICES state buyers cartel with Northwest could create leverage Lynda Gledhill Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Thursday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifilecaMNDTL More blackouts but no ransom payments for energy gougers thats a deal looking increasingly attractive to California lawmakers and consumer advocates The idea which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the cautious interest of Gov Gray Davis is for the state to set a firm ceiling on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer and not one dime more The tradeoff would be certain blackouts possibly more than if the state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand Some advocates of the idea think that California could minimize the number of blackout hours and gain a measure of control over the energy crisis by scheduling service interruptions We need to stop this game of electricity chicken said Michael Shames director of the Utility Consumers Action Network which first proposed the idea We are likely to see blackouts this summer we should use them to our advantage rather than be victimized by them The plan calls for creating a buyers cartel of California Oregon and Washington Essentially the states would decide at what price they were willing to buy power and refuse to purchase once it tops that level The state has spent billion on energy purchases since January and at one point during last weeks power shortage was spending per megawatt hour more than times what Davis has planned on for this summer That kind of spending cannot go on Democratic Assemblyman Fred Keeley of Boulder Creek said yesterday The question is can we sustain the level of spending we have and have the state maintain economic stability I believe the answer is no said Keeley the lower houses main figure on energy policy and author of the bill that put the state in the powerbuying business To get this problem solved we have to think in bold terms said Keeley who introduced a resolution along with fellow Democratic Assemblyman Paul Koretz of West Hollywood that urged Davis to form a cartel THREE STATES ARE BETTER THAN ONE Davis said last week that my bias would be to keep the lights on at any price But yesterday the governor said a temporary price limit is certainly a matter weve talked about and considered at some length The next step will be to see how the governors of Oregon and Washington respond to it A spokesman for Gov Gary Locke of Washington said the matter is being considered Calls to the office of Oregon Gov John Kitzhaber were not returned The idea has appeal among some consumers who believe as many state officials do that California is being gouged for electricity I can see if our bills were or more but this is ridiculous said Kimberly Chambers an yearold fashion design student from Oakland Whatever it takes I dont think we should have to pay for more But Yunah Kim who moved to the Bay Area from New York a month ago said blackouts should not even be considered The infrastructure of government is coming apart and its the basic service government is able to provide she said Businesses are not going to put up with that Its very shortsighted We just have to pay until theres a solution Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley said blackouts might be worse than supporters of price limits believe I think they power companies would call our bluff and sell their electricity elsewhere Borenstein said I dont think the state has the ability to credibly commit to paying no more than X That would be a very controversial decision Legislation is already in the works to give Davis the ability to enter into a West Coast buyers cartel A bill sponsored by state Sen Dede Alpert D Coronado would allow the Independent System Operator to refuse to buy power if it is too expensive The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula based on such things as the cost of natural gas A reasonable profit for power producers would be built in supporters said LOOKING FOR SOME CONTROL Alpert said everyone wants to avoid blackouts but that seems unlikely Everybody I talked to once you establish that there will be blackouts both businesses and residents say lets have control Alpert said The California Manufacturers and Technology Association which commissioned a recent report that said unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy billion and jobs is considering whether scheduled interruptions would be less harmful The problem if we do scheduled blackouts is that we may have an inordinate amount of blackouts said Gino DeCaro a spokesman for the group NO EASY TASK The ISO which runs the states power grid is scheduled to issue a report tomorrow on how scheduled blackouts might work Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Ray said that planning blackouts is not as easy as it sounds The difficulty is a pragmatic one the circuits are not wired to deal with choices like we are having to make said Bowen who has been holding hearings on how the state might better manage blackouts Maybe we should be paying people to turn off their fuse box Bowen said Chronicle staff writer

Columbia May Rivers Power Aids California and Enriches the Northwest By BLAINE HARDEN GEORGE Wash Doing something nice for California has never been a p riority here in the Columbia River Basin where highvoltage power lines lope acros s irrigated fields of alfalfa potatoes and wheat Politicians from California as farmers in this area will explain at great length have been scheming for decades to siphon off the basins cheap electricity and water Californians however have been noticeably less irritating as of late Having fouled up electricity deregulation six ways from Sunday they are skidding into the summer airconditioning season desperately short of power In the last year much of their salvation has come from the Columbia River whose monstrous dams are the largest hydroelectricity machines in North America All along the river from Portland Ore to British Columbia utility companies aluminum makers and farmers have joined to help save California but at a staggering price Charging whatever Californias dysfunctional pow er market will bear people in this narrow stretch of the Northwest have creat ed a kind of Kuwait along the Columbia With their record profits some public utilities are wiring the emptiness o f Eastern Washington with fiber optics buying diesel generators to make stil l more power and paying Wall Streetstyle wages to electricity traders while making sure that their electricity rates remain among the cheapest in North America Just north of the border in British Columbia a stateowned utilit y luxuriated in its California windfall by mailing out rebate checks to million customers Their good fortune though has come with a measure of ambivalence and may well be shortlived A severe drought is already hurting farmers across the region If it continues utilities along the river will have to buy power a nd may be punished by the same market forces that gave them a windfall This is not nice money said Alice Parker a retired farmer who heads a group that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin It is something that is offered to us not to use water so Californians can run their airconditioners Nice or not a whole lot of money flooded into the Columbia Basin North of here in sparsely populated Chelan County a publicly owned utility that has two dams on the Columbia made three times as much money last year than it ever had before With just local customers the utility last year had a million profit It paid its two top power traders each an astonishing income in a county where per capita income is less tha n a year The utility refuses to reveal the traders names for fear their children might be kidnapped The chief operating officer of Chelan County Public Utility District acknowledged that increases in the cost of power were huge and obscene But the executive Charles J Hosken added We would be imprudent if we d id not maximize this market for our customer owners Next door in equally sparse Grant County a public utility that also owns t wo dams on the Columbia has made even more money maximizing the market It had a record million in profits last year more than double its best previous year Grant County Public Utility District which has just retail customer s is using its windfall to help build a million fiber optic network for local residents It has also bought diesel generators to guard against power shortages and if possible exploit the power goldrush The utility estimates that those generators could add million to profits in the coming year Like Chelan Grant is using its profits as a kind of drought insurance to insulate its customers from high market prices for electricity when as no w local needs exceed generating capacity in the river Power rates in Grant a nd Chelan Counties are about onefifth as much as in New York City Grant Countys utility has rejected for the time being the idea of giving a share of its profits to its customers How would it look if Grant County gives away rebates while so many people are paying more for electricity asked Lon Topaz director of resource management for the utility It would be lousy politics An UpsideDown Economy The secondworst drought on record in the Columbia River Basin has combined with Californias deregulation mess to further distort the energy market Drought has not only helped increase the price at which electricity can be sold on the spot market to times as much as last years price it has strengthened a compelling bottomline rationale for conservation Every megawatt not purchased and used in the Northwest often at lockedin long term prices that are a fraction of the current market rate can be sent sou th to California For many utilities conservation spells local savings and a longdistance bonanza As a result a regional economy built on half a century of cheap hydropower has been stood on its head Irrigation farmers here are being paid up to an acre not to farm Similarly aluminum companies are collecting about billion this year b y not making aluminum Companies like Alcoa have earned profits that delight Wall Street while keeping about workers on their payroll by reselling hydropower that they bought in the mids under a cheap longterm contract Even residential customers are being offered a chance to make a few dollars from the power crunch Avista Utilities has announced that it will pay its customers in Washington and Idaho cents for every kilowatt they do not us e if their consumption falls more than percent below last years level For utilities in the Northwest by far the largest profits from California s electricity crisis have been secured in British Columbia A number of priva te American utilities have also benefited from Californias troubles BC Hydro a utility owned by British Columbia with dams on the Columbia and Peace Rivers is the first corporation in the history of the province to exceed billion in profits as measured in Canadian currency millio n in United States currency To celebrate the provincial government ordered BC Hydro to do something it had never done before The utility mailed each of its customers a check for BC Hydro also guaranteed them no increases in electricity rates whic h have not gone up for seven years We are just happy to be lucky that we have reservoirs and dams that were built by people of great foresight said Brian R D Smith chairman of BC Hydro When reminded that a March study by the California Independent System Operator which runs that states power grid accused BC Hydro of market manipulation and profit gouging Mr Smith was less happy All they do is scream and shout and they wont pay you the money they owe you he said arguing that his company has gone out of its way to help California in its hour of need Gouging has nothing to do with it he said adding that it was Californias awful mess in deregulating power markets that fueled BC Hydros record profits A Good Deal for Farmers In the beginning that is to say when federal money began transforming the Columbia from the worlds premier salmon highway into a chain of adjustable lakes no one paid much attention to electricity The river possessed a thi rd of Americas hydroelectric potential but there were not enough people in t he Northwest to use more than a fraction of it and longdistance high voltag e transmission lines did not exist The main intention when New Deal dollars began raining on the Northwest in the s was to create family farms Grand Coulee Dam the biggest dam i n North America and the largest hydroelectric plant was primarily designed a s a waterdelivery device for farmers Since then as miles of tunnels and concrete canals were built to shuttle water around in sagebrush country each acre farm in the Columb ia Basin Federal Irrigation Project was blessed with at least million in federal infrastructure subsidies according to the Bureau of Reclamation which built it In addition farmers are guaranteed access to cheap water from the Columbia and the right to buy all the electricity they needed to pump that water out of the river at a megawatt A megawatt of electricity currentl y sells for to on the spot market As Paul Pitzer a Columbia Basin historian has written farmers here have always felt that no price is too high to pay for their water so long as someone else is paying the bill This year though the price finally became unbearably high for the Bonneville Power Administration a nonprofit agency that markets electricit y from federal dams on river The agency calculated that if it could persuade farmers in the project not to irrigate acres of land water left in the Columbia would produce electricity worth as much as millio n if it had to be purchased at current market prices In a buyout that is without precedent in the Pacific Northwest Bonneville is paying farmers a total of million The farmers receive for eac h acre they do not farm On top of that Grant Countys public utility is paying many of the same farmers about an acre not to farm their land On April about irrigators gathered for lunch at the Martha Inn Cafe here in George to discuss the buyout Since farm prices are low this year they agreed that it was a good deal Still the farmers who do not like to be reminded of the federal subsidies that keep their irrigation system afloat said they worried about the precedent they set when they traded water for cash This has to be a temporary deal said Tom Flynt who normally farms acres but has taken acres out of production because of the buyout If anybody thought this would affect their water rights there would be no takers Several farmers said they did not like the idea of their water supporting t he lifestyles of urban people especially Californians who those who were interviewed said do not appreciate the food that the farmers put on their table We feel that Americans are making decisions with their mouths full said Tricia C Lubach a marketing consultant whose husband is an irrigation farmer Not too long ago they didnt worry about where the power comes fro m Someday they may think about where the food comes from A Wonderful Energy Fit A couple of hundred miles northwest of George in a penthouse conference ro om that overlooks Vancouver harbor Mr Smith the chairman of British Columbias most profitable company explained in mid April what a pain it was selling electricity to Californians People say to me what are you doing selling power to those ungrateful Californians he said It does not help he added that the state is behin d on its bills by about million Still neither BC Hydro nor the provincial government can afford to lose Californias money The utility has become a cash cow for the provincial budget which in the last decade has received more than billion from B C Hydro We have a wonderful energy fit Mr Smith said referring to BC Hydros powertrading relationship with California if not to Californians themselves We have oversupply in the summer when they have got high deman d and we have got undersupply in the winter when they have got stuff to give to us BC Hydro has acknowledged that it massages its hydropower system to sell power when it is most needed and most expensive in California The utility closes the faucets on its dams at night during the summer storing water while meeting local electricity needs with cheap offpeak power broug ht from across the West In the morning when prices peak it opens the faucet s and zaps electricity off to California We spill water during the day Mr Smith said Why Is it because we can make more money No Its because that is when everybody wants electricity for Gods sake Questions about profit gouging on the part of damdependent utilities in th e Northwest may soon be moot Drought has reduced the Columbia River runoff s o far this year to about half of what is considered normal The shortfall dovetails with higher costs for naturalgasfired power plant s and a growing gap on the West Coast between demand for electricity and capacity to generate it Absent being successful in getting loads down we could be looking at quadrupling of the power rates said Paul Norman head of power operations at the Bonneville Power Administration Unless conservation increases or the drought eases Mr Norman warned that by late summer the Northwests era of cheap power could come to a sudden and painfully expensive

textplain charsetISO ContentDisposition inline FYI FERC Taken to Task Over Calif Energy Crisis By Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April Page E Even before President Bush took office he and his staff were trying keep Californias energy crisis a long arms length away saying it was primarily Californias problem to solve But the Bush White House inherited an unavoidable link to California the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a relatively small Washington agency with a large mandate to see that wholesale electricity rates remain just and reasonable Californias calamity is defined in part by a battle between FERC and state officials over what just and reasonable means On Wednesday FERC made a new effort to hold down Californias electricity prices without forsaking its commitment to energy deregulation earning another round of sharp criticism from California officials FERC had a chance to bring meaningful relief to Californias outrageous wholesale prices and they blew it California Gov Gray Davis D said yesterday The spotlight is bright and unsought for an agency with a modest million budget born in as the Federal Power Commission a weak understaffed agency that promoted and supervised hydropower dams Fifteen year later during President Franklin D Roosevelts New Deal battle against powerful utility holding companies the commission was armed with the authority to regulate rates for wholesale electricity bought by utilities and for power transmission States regulate retail rates Today FERC makes rules for the nations transition away from regulated utility electric service to a marketbased hybrid In California and many major states powerful generating companies compete to sell electricity to utilities which act as distributors The responsibilities have taxed FERCs staff of which is about percent less than peak levels during the mids A backlog of pending cases includes not just conflicts over power prices but also critical issues of reorganizing the nations power transmission network into large regional pools strong enough to make urgently needed investments in new lines When Congress set electricity deregulation in motion in FERCs goal became seeing that it succeeded Gradually it redefined the just and reasonable standard saying that as long as electricity markets were competitive the prices negotiated by generators and distributors met the standard In hewing to that doctrine the agency turned down an increasingly angry flood of demands from Davis and a host of California officials to clamp down on the states wholesale electricity prices when they suddenly shot upward last summer Although FERC concluded in November that Californias power market was badly flawed and that the potential for unfair and unjust pricing existed it did not impose hard price restraints opting for a soft partial price ceiling FERC ordered California to try to fix its broken power purchasing system by buying the bulk of its electricity through longterm supply contracts with generators rather than through lastminute purchases that forced the state to pay generators and marketers top prices But FERCs plan was not implemented They have the ability to resolve it and they are not following through with what we asked them to FERC Chairman Curt Hebert Jr said three months ago just after being named chairman by Bush But under growing political pressure to restrain Californias extraordinary wholesale electricity charges and respond to complaints of overcharging FERC has moved deeper into the morass Since March it has ordered power suppliers to refund million or prove that their charges were justified The generators say their prices have been based on high costs of natural gas and air pollution permits Were very confident that FERC will see that these issues and transactions were just and reasonable said Randy Harrison chief executive for western operations of Mirant a major California generator On Wednesday the commission went further directing California to establish maximum rates that generators could charge during power shortage emergencies through a formula linked to plant operating costs All generators would be entitled to get the highest approved price but suppliers that exceeded the price benchmark would have to justify their prices or face refund orders The decision on a to vote reflects a compromise between the agencys desire to defend the troubled experiment with deregulation while protecting consumers against overcharging said energy consultant Peter FoxPenner of the Brattle Group Theyre searching for middle ground here Its not what we think of as price caps he said Its flexible Its related to costs and thats very innovative But FERCs many critics in California rebuked the agency again yesterday saying its actions were too little and too late Because the new FERC rules would apply only during power emergencies there would be no price restraint at other times some said And by pegging approved rates to the costs of plants burning costly natural gas FERCs order would confront California with continuing costs of per megawatthour for large quantities of electricity this summer eight to times what the state was paying before the crisis critics said What they did do is virtually irrelevant said Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer Consumer Rights Its like offering someone whos been hit by a car an aspirin FERC has failed its responsibilities at every point in the crisis said Adam Goldberg a policy analyst with Consumers Union Hebert responds that slapping hard price regulations on Californias energy market is the wrong course for at least three reasons It does not encourage generators to build more plants it doesnt prompt consumers to conserve energy and it will prompt power suppliers to sell electricity to neighboring states where prices arent controlled unless California blocks power exports What lessons the public will draw from Californias plight this summer and the deregulation debate remains to be seen but FERC and perhaps the Bush administration too has been pulled more closely than ever into that drama

ContentDisposition inline FYI Linda Stuntz is quoted in this article She characterized the RTO filing requirement as bizarre It appears to me that it is typical FERC behavior FERC likes to use whatever leverage it has to force compliance April Plan on California Energy Has No Shortage of Critics By JOSEPH KAHN WASHINGTON April A novel plan by federal regulators to control Californias runaway electricity prices is a messy politically motivated compromise that may offer some relief to consumers but will do little to fix the states dysfunctional energy market analysts said today The intervention announced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday night after much haggling was dismissed by a wide range of critics today as a flawed effort that satisfies no one It fell short of the sweeping suspension of regional electricity deregulation that California officials and some energy experts had advocated But it also crossed what has become a firm ideological line among Republican leaders including President Bush by imposing price controls on some electricity sales to utilities Under the agencys order which takes effect on May California regulators can begin to impose price controls on power generators when electricity supplies fall to within percent of consumer demand The state is expected to face such shortages routinely this summer and the order has the potential to shave billions of dollars off Californias electricity bill if implemented fully some people at the federal agency say The president has a longheld belief that price caps dont work the White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said today The last thing you want to do is create artificially increased demand and put in disincentives that harm the availability of supply Mr Fleischer noted that the energy commission is an independent federal agency adding that the Bush administration has no authority to countermand its orders But Mr Bush did appoint the commissions chairman Curtis L Hbert Jr a Republican Like the president Mr Hbert has often insisted that price caps do no good But he came under withering political pressure to abandon the agencys largely hands off approach to the California crisis Some of that pressure came from the two other commissioners at the agency both Democrats and Mr Hbert wound up voting for the controls adopted on Wednesday night The split with the Bush administration raises fresh questions about whether the president will seek to replace Mr Hbert as chairman in coming weeks Mr Bush has nominated two Republicans to fill vacant slots on the commission including Pat Wood a longtime ally of the president who served as chief electricity regulator in Texas Industry executives say they expect that Mr Bush will eventually name Mr Wood to the commissions top post In a reflection of how delicate the issue is Mr Hbert argued that the agencys action did not amount to imposing price caps But his position appeared to rest on a semantic distinction between returning to cost based electricity regulation as some Californians favor and the agencys decision to impose tactical price controls Among California officials the dominant reaction was disappointment Some state regulators and market experts said the agency was practicing upsidedown economics it has chosen to impose price limits during periods of severe scarcity when prices theoretically ought to rise to encourage companies to build power plants and encourage people to use less electricity The agency its critics argue has chosen to ignore price abuses during times of relative abundance when power generators the critics say have used artificial market power to earn high profits They got it exactly wrong said Frank Wolak chief market supervisor for the California Independent System Operator which runs the states power grid It looks like theyre doing something but it doesnt work in real time Mr Wolak has estimated that most overcharges by generators last year in amounts that he puts in the billions of dollars occurred when electricity supplies were not acutely short meaning that the agencys price caps would have had no mitigating effect The state is likely to face many emergency shortages this summer But Mr Wolak said generating companies have become adept at gaming the system He predicted that they would find ways to continue to earn high profits in California One fear is that generating companies will arrange to sell their output to affiliates out of state When Californias transmission grid managers scramble to find supplies the same companies will offer to sell the power back to the state but only above the cap price The agencys new order includes a provision that is intended to discourage this sort of abuse known as megawatt laundering But the agency has a weak record of enforcing such mandates and California officials are skeptical The order also came under fire on other grounds The commission said that price caps would be canceled unless California submitted a proposal to link its transmission grid to the one that serves the Western region a priority of the agency that state officials have resisted Linda Stuntz an electricity industry lobbyist who is an expert on the agency called that clause bizarre arguing that it held the entire California market hostage to a technical filing requirement California politicians said they worried that even if the price caps were carried out as promised relief would be too limited The price limits will be based on estimates of the highest operating costs of the least efficient generating plant in the state The order as written means that companies that operate efficient generating plants could still sell power at large markups during periods when caps are imposed When the agency scrutinized the California market earlier this year it found the highcost generators to be justified in charging about a megawatt hour for electricity a price that is about times as high as the state was paying for power a year ago Copyright The New York Times Company

Lawmakers As Power Bond Deal Stalls Updated Thursday April PM ET By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesFrustrated by delays in securing regulatory decisions needed to support a massive issue of bonds to finance power purchases California Treasurer Phil Angelides Gov Gray Davis and several lawmakers are working on an end run through the state Legislature The group is putting together legislation aimed to be introduced in the state Assembly as early as Friday that will directly authorize the state to sell billion in revenue bonds in the process clearing the way for the state to close on billion in interim financing But there are pitfalls along that path as well raising new questions about when the bonds will be sold John Hallacy managing director for municipal bond research at Merrill Lynch Associates said the bond market is still expecting the sale but hes concerned that details on marketing of the bonds havent been released Hallacy said if the bond sale is delayed it will be a problem for the state Where will they get the money to buy power over the summer Hallacy said T he state has been working since February to put together a bond deal authorized by previous legislation but the effort has been hung up in part by the California Public Utilities Commissions difficulty carving revenue out of electricity rates to service the debt The commissions standing proposal for calculating the socalled California Procurement Adjustment the amount of electricity rate revenue available to the state has been appealed by the states struggling utilities which argue the plan would leave them unable to meet their own obligations The utilities effectively blocked the bond sale by appealing the PUCs action on how they calculated the CPA an aide to Angelides said So now were saying Lets sell the bonds by revising the law and go to the Legislature to get what we need Legislature No Slam Dunk Whether the legislative route proves more fruitful remains to be seen As reported Assembly Republicans said Wednesday that they wouldnt vote for the measure unless the governor releases details of the states longterm power contracts information the governor has thus far refused to divulge Republicans believe it is fiscally irresponsible for the Legislature to ask ratepayers to shoulder the extraordinary weight of a billion bond before the governor finally discloses what the ratepayers are getting in return Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox RFair Oaks said in a press release The treasurer needs Republican support if the bill is to win the twothirds majority it needs to be implemented immediately California has spent about billion since midJanuary buying power in place of the states cashstrapped utilities a total that is growing by about million a day The state needs to move ahead with the bridge financing and bond deal to repay the states general fund for power already purchased and to stretch out future power costs that cant be covered in full by electricity rates The situation is growing more urgent Citing the mounting and uncertain costs of Californias power crisis ratings agency Standard Poors lowered the rating on Californias general obligation bonds to A from AA Further delays of the bond issue could put the state in a bind SP said If the state cannot sell its proposed revenue bond as planned in a timely manner the potential effect on the states general fund could be severe without large further retail rate hikes beyond the sizable percentage increases recently implemented SP said Angelides has said that the states budget surplus will be depleted if legislation isnt passed allowing his office to sell the bonds In addition the clock on the states bridge financing deal is ticking Commitments from bankers to fund the loan are due May and the banks have said they wont sign up if the bond issue that will repay the bridge loan is in doubt Angelides has said Keely Seen As Backer Legislation needs to be introduced and passed and in days establishing the bond sale at billion Angelides said Tuesday His office said the treasurer has been in long meetings with legislators on the issue working with the governors office to drum up votes Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek will likely carry the bill ABX an aide in his office said Wednesday The governors staff is working with Keeley on draft language said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar Keeley didnt immediately return calls for comment Keeley is the author of ABX which authorized the state to purchase power on behalf of its cashstrapped utilities and issue bonds to pay for power going forward The authorization for the bonds however depends on a complicated calculation of the CPA which determines the funds available for debt service and ultimately the size of the issue PGE Corp PCG news msgs unit Pacific Gas Electric whose appeal is pending before the PUC said the Public Utilities Commissions calculations on the CPA grossly overstate the revenue that will be left over after the utility covers its costs The utility has since filed for bankruptcy protection raising further doubt about the states ability to tap the utilitys revenue for its own purposes The PUC is also waiting for the California Department of Water Resources which is handling the states power purchases to release details of its projected power costs the amount of power needed and how much money the agency expects to spend in the spot market for power Again the state reluctant to release that information The state has set a rough target of June for the bond sale to go forward although some have said it could be delayed until July or August Hallacy of Merrill Lynch said the bond market could deal if the sale was conducted after June because it will give it more time to prepare for the sale By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Jessica Berthold contributed to this article

situation no surprises for anyone following this closely Please note that Chairman Hoecker felt the need to emphasize the limitations of FERCs power under the Federal Power Act DJ FERC Chief Pledges Action If Needed On Calif Pwr Woes Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Monday WASHINGTON Dow JonesThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has limited authority to address flawed electricity markets in California and alleged price gouging by power producers but will act to overhaul the states wholesale power markets if necessary FERC Chairman James Hoecker told a congressional panel Monday The commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff investigation of problems affecting power markets in the US West becomes available Hoecker said in testimony presented to a San Diego field hearing of the House Commerce Committees energy panel If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction we will do so Hoecker told lawmakers And if price gouging is occurring as some have alleged he added we will respond accordingly by revoking marketbased rates or otherwise However Hoecker stressed that the commissions authority is limited under the Federal Power Act The commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer crisis Important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility such as authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities Hoecker testified The commission cant act to limit prices charged by power providers until we have a record supporting such action he said referring to the results of the pending staff investigation Further he said the law bars FERC from ordering retroactive refunds to San Diego Gas Electric Co for the power it purchased this summer to serve its retail customer base Hoecker testified before the House Commerce Committees Energy and Power Subcommittee which is looking into the supply shortages in California this summer that have forced San Diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much for power as they did a year ago State Mkt Structure Blamed For Crisis The hearing comes after much wrangling at FERC as SDGE a unit of Sempra Energy SRE sought an order setting price caps for power bid into the statesponsored electricity exchange and power producers sought an order allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the states independent grid operator curtailed sales outside California where price controls dont apply FERC hasnt yet responded to the producers and deferred action on SDGEs bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed But it left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to limit the price it pays for power which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid into the power exchange Hoecker while withholding judgment pending the staff probe appeared to place much of the blame for this summers crisis with the statemandated market structure which left San Diego consumers subject to spotmarket volatility And he appeared to suggest that FERCs order directing utilities to transfer transmission assets to control of large regional transmission organizations or RTOs will offer an opportunity to develop a regional solution to the powersupply problem FERC deferred to California in restructuring the wholesale market in California because its experience with new market institutions such as power exchanges and ISOs was limited Hoecker said Other states such as Pennsylvania were less prescriptive than California in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should operate Hoecker noted Now with FERCs Order encouraging formation of RTOs the commission is in a very different posture with respect to the structure of wholesale markets he said Large regional markets can be made to work effectively Hoecker told the lawmakers citing the Pennsylvania restructuring as an example Other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the statemandated market structure By requiring the states three investorowned utilities to purchase all their electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge price risks by entering into longterm fixedprice contracts the state left consumers subject to volatility in the statemandated spot market said officials with Enron Corp ENE and Reliant Energy REI Californias market structure placed no economic incentives on the default utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately passed on to their consumers Reliants John Stout testified San Diegos experience offers the Congress an unparalleled opportunity to learn from a bungled attempt at deregulation said Michael Shames executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network Shames and other witnesses warned the congressional committee that Californias electricity crisis is likely to occur in other regions of the country unless steps are taken to free up interstate trade in power and allow FERC to better police markets California is just the latest problem area in US power markets and unless policymakers act quickly it will not be the last said Enron Corp ENE Steven Kean executive vice president Unless Congress and FERC are willing to address the interstate issues that are beyond the jurisdiction of state legislators and regulators I predict that our experience in San Diego is indicative of what others will encounter in trying to create a competitive electricity market said Edwin Guiles Sempras president of regulated operations This electricity crisis is not a Californiaonly problem said Rep Brian Bilbray RCalif who represents San Diego and requested Mondays hearing We will continue to be in this mess if state and federal officials dont work together to find longterm solutions to the

article reflects more power marketerbashing than the Dow Jones write up on this meeting Calif free market power experiment under fire SAN DIEGO Sept Reuters California lawmakers and regulators sought a temporary halt on Tuesday to the states trailblazing free market electricity experiment at a hearing called by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission It the free market is simply a structure for extortion as we have seen this summer said Carl Wood a commissioner with state regulator the California Public Utilities Commission seeking a return to costbased rather than marketbased rates for customers FERC which regulates the wholesale power market has launched an investigation into price spikes in California this summer It is due to report its finding by November Under the terms of the deregulation of Californias electric utility industry customers of Sempra Energy subsidiary San Diego Gas and Electric became the first in the nation to pay marketbased rates without a safety net There was a public outcry in the city this summer when a rise in wholesale prices to record levels led to a tripling in their electricity bills I think many thought because we had deregulation we had competition We dont San Diego mayor Susan Golding told FERC commissioners There is no public confidence right now about the movement to a competitive energy market Companies profiting from the high prices have included independent power producers and also marketers who have purchased the output of plants under longterm contracts and been able to extract much higher prices from the spot and dayahead markets I have no sympathy for suppliers right now They are fat and happy Golding said Many local and national lawmakers have called for FERC to declare that rates set by suppliers this summer were not just and reasonable as required under US law Such a declaration could be followed by action to impose market restrictions such as price caps across the western US Stephen Baum chief executive officer of SDGE parent Sempra Energy said the utility favors selective interim bid caps for generators who have been shown to have sufficient market power to influence prices These caps would run through next summer and if the market was not then operating competitively could be followed by a return to costbased ratemaking Such a move could lead to the demise of the California Power Exchange which was set up as part of the deregulation of the states power industry CalPX is where the highpriced power has been bought this summer and its trading mechanisms have been heavily criticized That the demise of CalPX could be a result that comes out of structural reform Baum said Many are also calling on FERC to retroactively void trades at prices that were deemed not just and reasonable and order that profits from generators and marketers be returned to the victims These are reported to include single mothers forced to choose between paying their exorbitant electricity bill and buying new school uniforms for their children or fixed income pensioners who have been turning off their refrigerators in a bid to avoid massive bills If there was ever a case for you to use your remedial powers including refunds of excessive charges this is it Baum of Sempra Energy told the commissioners Terry Winters head of the California Independent System Operator ISO which operates most of the states power grid said the higher prices in California largely reflected lower available imports from surrounding states California has traditionally been a significant importer of power from states such as Nevada and Arizona but rapid economic growth in those areas has increased their own needs and reduced the amount of electricity they are able to sell elsewhere The states power problems are also linked to the absence of any new instate generation with no significant plants build during the last years Many are now planned but few will come on line before at the earliest There have also been growing calls from some for San Diego to create its own municipal utility with the citys residents casting envious eyes toward near neighbors in Los Angeles where the countrys largest municipal utility has been able to keep prices steady and even promise further price cuts Those calls have gained the support of two of the areas Congressmen Duncan Hunter and Bob Filner although only one community in the area San Marcos has so far begun the long and complicated process required Some states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws to open retail electricity markets to competition Most consumers however continue to be shielded by protective measures during the rocky transition to competitive markets

ContentDisposition inline FYI Lots of rhetoric from the politicians about price gouging However the article gives the impression that the FERC commissioners are leaning toward market structure reforms Lawmakers Advocates Call for Repair of CaliforniaS Electricity Deregulation Kate Berry The Orange County Register Calif September Sep Outraged politicians and consumer advocates demanded at a public hearing Tuesday that federal energy regulators fix Californias flawed experiment with deregulation by cutting electricity prices and refunding consumers in San Diego and south Orange County for the high cost of power this summer Federal authorities on a daylong factfinding mission said they plan to act quickly without backing away from the longterm goal of a competitive freemarket for electricity There are flaws in the existing power structure that I think must be repaired said Linda K Braithitt one of four commissioners at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which launched a formal investigation last month into the politically disastrous rise in electricity prices in California More than major players in Californias electricity market from utilities to power producers to staterun agencies that manage the electric grid and market exchange offered various solutions to the crisis The only consensus Customers are paying exorbitant prices We must roll back wholesale prices retroactively and refund consumers said Rep Bob Filner DSan Diego who accused power producers of manipulating the power market and pushing retail prices higher He also called power producers criminals reiterating a statement he made Sunday at a House commerce subcommittee hearing in San Diego We know these prices are unlawful I believe these prices are criminal Under the Federal Powers Act regulators can intervene to limit the prices power generators charge if they determine the market is not workably competitive FERC also has the authority to retroactively declare that marketbased rates this summer were not just and reasonable If it does so the PUC can act to require utilities to refund customers The utilities then would likely go to the courts on the matter Wood said The FERC investigation comes as electric bills for million customers of San Diego Gas Electric have more than doubled or quadrupled in some cases leading to hardship particularly for lowincome residents and the elderly Currently the two biggest utilities Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison have absorbed billion in costs that they want to pass on to their consumers when a rate freeze ends in April State regulators which gave up control of wholesale prices when the market was deregulated in told their federal equivalents that the system is broken Its time to reset the starting point back to protecting consumers until we can get it right said Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission We have not collectively on the state and federal level demonstrated a path that works Carl Wood a commissioner at the California Public Utilities Commission implored FERC to return in the shortterm to a costbased rate structure known to consumers before the utilities sold their power plants and had to purchase electricity on the power exchange No competitive market exists he said The market isnt functioning in California right now William Massey a FERC commissioner admitted that Californias market is flawed He also said a return to a costbased rate structure remained on the table But Curtis R Hebert another FERC commissioner said the agency had to be cautious about further regulation He advocates lifting price caps changing rules on how suppliers buy and sell into the Power Exchange and adopting marketbased approaches such as having the utilities hedge with longterm contracts You cant just say go back to costbased he said Its not that simple The most heated discussion came when Michael Shames executive director of UCAN Utility Consumers Action Network said FERC was on trial and could lose its case for deregulation FERC Chairman James J Hoecker said it was natural to look for blame on the part of power generators But he added that making a lot of money gets a bad rap when individual electricity consumers are hurting He also asked a panel of power producers directly to ask why they were gaming the system We feel weve conducted business not only legally but ethically said Bill Hall managing director of commercial affairs at Duke Energy which owns percent of power generation in the state We dont anticipate to make profits like this as soon as supply keeps up with demand John Stout vice president of the Southwest region for Reliant Energy said he was certainly in business to make a profit The fact that we had a good year in California in terms of revenue is a fact I dont deny that at all he said Across the street from the government building where the hearing was held San Diego residents at a hair salon talked about the electricity crisis with some residents in a retirement home paying a month for electricity Pat Benites manager of the C Street Salon said the highrise building she works in has seen its rates rise a month this summer Theyre just bilking us she said They told the whole building to turn computers off at night and turn electricity off she said Its dark in the lobby but we have to leave some lights on for protection just so no one breaks in To see more of The Orange County Register or to subscribe to the newspaper go to c The Orange County Register Calif Distributed by Knight
