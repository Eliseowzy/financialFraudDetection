entry section of eterra B should be a higher priority Also an alternative to B is to have a dropdown box within eTerra to display the corresponding name of the counterparty Phillips George Original Message From Capasso Joe Sent Tuesday November AM To Forney John M Subject FW Eterra Madup In reference to Eterra I have prioritized some enhancements to the system that will improve its usage and accuracy When using Eterra some tasks are difficult to complete and can result in mismatches in the Ercot Portal I will identify some of the difficult tasks and I will make some suggestions on enhancements In addition I realize that we are working with time constraints and limited personnel I will categorize the list based on Priority Priority Very important and needs to be completed immediately Priority Important and needs to be completed within the next days Priority Moderate importance easy tasks can be completed at programmers convenience Priority A Allow the Deal Entry screen to accept single entry trades such as a simultaneous Buy from Counterparty A in the South Zone and a Sell to Counterparty B in the North Zone Currently this has to be done by entering two trades a purchase from Counterparty A South Zone to the Hourly Ercot Book and a second trade a sell from the Hourly Ercot Book to Counterparty B I realize that we have a problem with the transmission between the North and South Zones and that is what makes this a difficult enhancement PriorityB Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation The current process is to input a buy from Frontera and a sell to Frontera This is not very intuitive and causes some confusion Why cant we input a buy from Frontera just as we would with any other trade It could be as simple as clicking a box to indicate that Frontera ie EPMI should be adjusted on the resource side and not EPMI on the obligation side PriorityC Eterra should not write over any trades that were input manually into the Ercot Portal Is there any way that we can make it identify a trade that was input manually into the portal When it finds one then it should not overwrite this trade PriorityA Undo Button On various occasions we have sent Bal Day trades to the QSE MOSErcot Portal and it was not the result that we had expected Therefore the trader has to manually change each of the trades This can be a very time consuming process Is there a way to have an UNDO button similar to the Excel UNDO key to retract the trade information from the QSE MOS or Portal PriorityB Change the short name in internal counterparty external counterparty to the actual long name ie elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy Reason It is just difficult to read I brought this up with Sasha and he said it would be a quick fix but it is still not done ProirityA Please give us a list of the Counterparties and their appropriate QSE names ie El Paso Merchant is actually APX This helps us identify what it will effect in the QSE MOS and Portal for example elpasomeren is converted into APX But does ELP or ELPASELECOM convert to APX also PriorityB Match Flow Period to automatically update the Contract Date This is one less step that we need to worry about The above mentioned enhancements will allow us to quickly and accurately update the QSE MOS Ercot Portal In addition it will allow us to quickly correct the portal if a mistake occurs If you need additional clarification on any of these topics I would be happy to meet with you to discuss this further I will be working days on Monday Nov th Thursday Nov th Thanks Joe Capasso PS Below is an email that outlines my conversation with Sasha on November rd Unfortunately none of the quick fixes have been completed yet Original Message From Capasso Joe Sent Saturday November PM To Forney John M Cc McElreath Alexander Olinde Jr Steve Phillips George Oh SeungTaek Subject Eterra John I met with Sasha today for approx hours We reviewed the exact process for inputting data into Eterra and verifying the trades prior to being sent to the QSE MOS Here are some suggestions that I made to Sasha for improving Eterra the top of the list is the highest priority Allow the Deal Entry screen to accept single entry trades such as a simultaneous Buy from Calpine South Zone and a Sell to FPL North Zone Currently this has to be done by entering two trades a purchase from Calpine South Zone to the Hourly Ercot book and a second entry of Hourly Ercot book to FPL North Zone Sasha said he is working on this but problems are occurring due to the transmission between South and North Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation The current process is to input a buy from Frontera into the Frontera book This is not very intuitive and we are still trying to work out an easier process Possibly even having a button that we can click to indicate that it is a purchase from Frontera Essentially this would increase the EPMI mws in the Ercot Portal Change the short name in internal counterpary external counterparty to the actual long name ie elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy Give us a list of Counterparties and the appropriate QSE ie El Paso Merchant is actually APX So that we know what it will affect in the Ercot Portal Match flow date to automatically update the Contract date One less step that we need to worry about I tried to impress upon Sasha that in trading time is of the essence and that we dont have much time to input data Therefore we need to streamline the deal entry process and to make it more user friendly I realize that the first two items will take some time but the last items should be quick fixes I hope this helps Joe Capasso

<1573845.1075852298416.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,george.phillips@enron.com,2001-09-29 11:37:20,CATX reads percent of Texans Plan to Try Electricity Competition When the gates to deregulation open on January the race to choose a new energy supplier will begin in the Texas market According to a recent Scripps Howard Texas poll there will be plenty of consumers ready to make the switch The poll predicts that percent of Texans are likely to switch their electric providers when the state markets open to competition Results also showed that a majority of Texans agree that there should be more competition in the states electric power industry Texas Deregulation Gets More Kudos Texas deregulation plan is receiving praise yet again as a successful approach to deregulation The Retail Energy Deregulation Index RED Index a scorecard developed by the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets CAEM lists Texas deregulation plan as second only to Pennsylvanias deregulation approach According to Ken Malloy CEO of CAEM Texas is primed for a successful transition to a competitive electric retail market CAEM an independent nonprofit Washington DC based thinktank specializing in energy competition policies produces the Retail Energy Deregulation Index RED Index Electric Choice Stalled in California Californias ongoing struggle to get above their problems with deregulation has finally came to a head On September the California Public Utilities Commission PUC suspended direct access until the Department of Water Resources no longer supplies power to the customers in California The PUCs decision to take away direct access was deemed necessary to help the state pay for the upcoming billion bond issue planned for later this year and to help pay off the states outstanding debt for energy purchased by the Department of Water Resources Although consumers can no longer change electricity providers companies who already hold energy agreements will continue to receive service through the end of their contracts EES is continuing to move forward in the California market with sales of natural gas procurement and delivery and many other services that are still needed in the region With California consumers temporarily unable to seek the best price for power services such as business risk management distributed generation and energy efficiency improvement services will become customers only outlet for achieving energy savings Daniel Weintraub Now its illegal to purchase your own electricity Published Sept Buying your own has been banned in California Electricity on the open market is now officially contraband Like prescription drugs which you can get only from a licensed pharmacy electricity is something you can buy from your local utility which can make its own or buy it from the state Beyond that its an illegal substance It was the grand hope of a deregulated electricity industry that you and I and the factory down the street would be able to buy our own juice from the lowest bidder It might have been a pain kind of like shopping for telephone service But just as breaking up Ma Bell spawned great leaps in mobile phone technology busting the utility monopoly was supposed to usher in a new era for electricity Not that there were mobs of shopkeepers and apartment dwellers lobbying the Legislature for consumer choice It was the biggest users who really wanted to cut their own deals Under the old regulated system the huge factories that make steel and cement and computers and gobble up electricity by the megawatt were paying percent more than their competitors in other states They wanted the right to shop around The Legislature agreed but only to a point Lawmakers permitted choice but they rigged the new system in its early years to favor the utilities that were a powerful force in the Capitol They made it nearly impossible for the private generators to undercut the utilities pricing and they put roadblocks in the way of cities that might have gathered their small customers together and used their market clout to negotiate for lower rates The government spent millions on an advertising campaign trying to persuade us of the wisdom of buying our own energy But there werent really many deals to be had Now there are none Consumer choice died a quiet death last week at the hands of the Public Utility Commission Its demise was collateral damage from the mess that was Californias experiment in electricity deregulation Choice couldnt survive because the state which now controls the energy business cant cope with the competition If Californians were allowed to buy their own electricity pretty soon most of us would figure out that we are getting a rotten deal from the state As more people left the state system the few that remained would have to pay higher and higher rates to keep the books balanced Eventually the whole thing would collapse of its own weight Were in this fix because Gov Gray Davis when he stepped in to buy electricity on behalf of the failing utilities in January went too far Craving stability at any price Davis bought almost all the energy the state will need for the next few years and much of what well need for a decade And he bought that electricity at the top of the market paying prices that had never been so high and might never be again As those prices were passed along to consumers suddenly choosing your own electricity supplier got more attractive than ever Thousands of businesses jumped at the opportunity Among them were the big steel factories in the Inland Empire region east of Los Angeles Tamco Steel of Rancho Cucamonga which makes rebar realized its annual electricity bill was going to climb from million to million if it stayed with the local utility Southern California Edison according to a report in the Riverside PressEnterprise The company which just laid off people onefourth of its workers desperately started searching for cheaper energy It signed a deal with a private supplier on Sept just days before the state slammed the door shut on such opportunities Thats a scenario that was repeated up and down the state all summer and it illustrates why in the twisted world of electricity regulation the Public Utilities Commission had to step in and just say no Without the ban there would have been a jailbreak in the words of one commissioner leaving small customers or the taxpayers holding the bag That decision might have been unavoidable given the circumstances But it didnt have to be this way Davis could have swallowed hard and ridden out the storm earlier this year He could have signed electricity contracts for shorter terms at higher prices That would have been painful financially and politically but once the crisis passed Californians would have been free again to set their own course Instead we are imprisoned in a highpriced staterun system and will be for years to come California in fact is worse off than it was in when companies stuck with high utility rates first asked for the freedom to buy their own electricity This does not seem like an unreasonable request an act that should be against the law Yet now it is The real crime though is the state bungling that destroyed the electricity industry
