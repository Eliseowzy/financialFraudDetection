football with twin goals of developing better run blockers and finding a left tackle to replac e AllAmerican Leonard Davis who was the second player chosen in the first round of the NFL draft Saturday In an interview last week he told me he is pleased about the progress his players made in both areas He said right tackle Mike Williams and right guard Derrick Dockery were outstanding this spring in every area including run blocking Mike Williams had a great spring Nunez said He had as good a spring as any offensive linemen has had since weve been here Hes really light on h is feet for such a big man and that helps him whether hes pass blocking or run blocking Derrick Dockery finally was healthy this spring he said That infection he had last season really sapped his strength all season He fought through it and played as hard as he could but this spring he was flying around and doing things he couldnt do last year He was just a different guy this spring and he really did a good job He and Mike really gave us a strong right side this spring He said center Matt Anderson played well this spring Hes a steady hand i n there He also said backup Jason Glynn had a very good spring He is real ly athletic We just need to get him some snaps Junior Robbie Doane started at left tackle all spring and Nunez said I think Robbie Doane is going to be a good football player for us He needs t o have a great summer and get stronger in his upper body He really wants to be a good player and hell work hard this summer to get there He said Doane has great technique He really knows what to do Hes just g ot to get strong enough to do it on a consistent basis Nunez said one reason Doane might not have been an obvious standout during the spring was that he was going against a great player Defensive end Kalen Thornton is as hard to block as anybody hell see during the season Hes special But the Longhorns also have some other options at left tackle Blinn Junior College star Alfio Randall has passed the JC exit exam and is on schedule t o graduate in time to join the team in August and Dockery also worked some a t left tackle in the spring and did very well Nunez said Two top guards missed the spring Senior Antwan KirkHughes a two year starter was recovering from shoulder surgery and sophomore Tillman Hollowa y sprained a knee early in the spring and missed the remainder of the drills When they return Nunez said it will make it easier to move Dockery to tack le if the need arises He said both of them should be totally recovered in plenty of time for the season How about depth at guard if Dockery moves to tackle Bo Baker had a good spring at guard he said Well continue to work him some at center but he gives us another good guard Hes really fast If we had a race he would be the fastest of the offensive linemen Nunez said players like Williams Dockery and KirkHughes have had to play earlier than they should have since none of them redshirted but he said those painful early learning experiences should pay off this year Mike Williams really improved during last season Nunez said He was playing really well by the end of the season and he carried that over into this spring He said KirkHughes shoulder and Dockerys infection hampered their play last season but he said they played as hard as they could and should be mu ch better this season because of their experiences last season Dockery made great strides this spring he said adding that he expects KirkHughes to again be one of the teams top linemen when he returns with his surgicallyrepaired shoulder Holloway started several games as a redshirt freshman last year due to Dockerys health problems and Nunez said he had to grow up during the season Its tough to start as a redshirt freshman offensive lineman in thi s league but he worked through it and he was just playing so much better by the end of the season Im excited about this group Nunez said Theyve worked hard to get better and I think they have a chance to be a really strong group this seas on if they can stay healthy Head coach Mack Brown said at the end of spring practice the Longhorns were running the ball better than they have the last two seasons Since he also says he isnt that happy with any of the tailbacks he obviously feels the line is doing a better job of run blocking We worked on it more this spring Nunez said and I think that will pay off this season One thing that needs to be noted is that the perennial powerhouse teams usually dont start offensive linemen until they are redshirt juniors whic h means they are in their fourth year Exceptional linemen can start earlier but even they usually spend two year s backing up before starting in their third year This coaching staff inherited some talent when it took over but other than a talented bunch of seniors the offensive line talent was pretty bare Even firstround draft choice Davis spent his first year on defense before the new staff switched him to the offensive line Texas should be able to begin redshirting most of its offensive linemen thi s season but the coaches havent had that luxury until now Why Because despite their great overall recruiting success they have bee n able to sign only three offensive linemen each year until they hit the jackpot with six in their last recruiting class Kelly Named Basketball MVP Senior shooting

become college head coaches and that is because he always hires a bright young assistant on the way up who also happens to be an outstanding recruiter Lanier recruited several outstanding prospects

<8998738.1075848298987.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2001-05-14 04:43:00,True Orange May Part of Parts Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No May Brown Says Longhorns Should Be Very Good Offensively with Chance for Stout Defense Too Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns will head into the football season with just one problem on offense and fewer than expected on defense if his young tackles come through In an interview with coach Brown last week I asked him how the Longhorns compare with his best teams at North Carolina In a nutshell he said Texas is better offensively than those North Carolin a teams but is not quite as imposing defensively His last two teams at North Carolina lost only to Florida State posting th e best twoyear record ever for the Tar Heels and finishing in the top twice something Texas hasnt accomplished once in nearly two decades Our offensive line is better here he said We have two quarterbacks who can play We had that at North Carolina too but our upside is better here Our receivers at North Carolina were very good but the ones we have now ca n be the best weve had He said North Carolinas fullback and tight end from his last team there a re still playing in the NFL but he also noted that UT TEs Bo Scaife and Broc k Edwards who are only sophomores in eligibility have NFL potential too He said one big plus offensively at UT is the depth the incoming freshmen will provide in the line We had good offensive linemen at North Carolina but we had trouble findin g good ones in numbers he said We didnt have good numbers here and had to force some guys to play too early he said but that got them ready to play and now we have good experience and good numbers and we hope we can start redshirting our freshm en offensive linemen We need to get to that point Hesaid the only problem he sees offensively this season is at tailback and that isnt as big a problem as it seems because all five of the returnees competing for the job are competent players and several of them have the ability to step it up And if they dont step it up there is a young fellow coming to twoadays in August who has everyone excited Ive written enough about Cedric Benson th at I wont go through it all again but he is something special If you doubt it just remember this Three state championship games in Clas s A at Midland Lee with five touchdowns in each game No one else has ever come close to doing that once in Class A much less three times Defensively Brown has high expectations and thats only natural because of the starters and of the backups on his North Carolina team were N FL draft picks Three of his defensive linemen went in the first round But he says the Longhorns have some talent on defense and could be very goo d if his young tackles come through The departures of twotime AllAmerican Casey Hampton and his equally formidable sidekick Shaun Rogers left a giant hole in the middle of the Longhorn defense They were the runstoppers deluxe who led a unit that ranked th nationall y in rushing defense yielding yards a game last year Eight starters return from a Longhorn defense that also ranked seventh in t he nation in total defense yielding only yards per game Brown also said Rogers who missed several games with a badly sprained ankl e was never close to last year after being injured early in the season Shaun was one of the best players of his size I have seen at rushing the passer he said When we lost him it really hurt our pass rush I have speculated in previous issues that the Longhorns probably will have a better pass rush from their front four this season because sophomoretobe Marcus Tubbs got sacks second on the team last year while standing in for Rogers and because the defensive ends are a year older and there is mo re speed at tackle than before Brown said the coaches are counting on a better pass rush from their lineme n Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton have the potential to be as good as anybod y at defense end he said We have high expectations for them At tackle he said Tubbs weighs and he can run Hes got a great upsid e Hes a young guy who has played well already and should just get better and better Were excited about him Brown also said the move of Maurice Gordon from end to tackle looks like a good one He runs a and he looked really good this spring We just need him to keep on working hard and hell be a good one Hes already a good pass rusher and hes working on getting stronger to stop the run While Gordon is a passrushing whiz the likely starter at tackle opposite Tubbs is redshirt freshman Stevie Lee if he is able to recover fully from foot surgery Lee played well last year in spots as a true freshman but was injured earl y and was able to get a medical redshirt year which means he is a freshman again this year If Lee is healthy Brown said the key for him is offseason conditioning work Stevie can play at about pounds but he doesnt need to play at he said In this league everybody spreads people out forcing the front four to ma ke offschedule plays You cant just be a run stopper anymore Youve got to be quick enough to make adjustments Were emphasizing speed and quickness he added Thats why we made some moves in the spring like moving Maurice Gordon to tackle O J McClintock to end from linebacker and Lee Jackson to linebacker from safety Brown also said sophomore Adam Doiron who also played well in relief last season as a true freshman has a bright future at tackle He needs to get get stronger Brown said Hes real smart and real tough He just needs to get more experience and use the offseason program to get stronger He likes his secondary saying I feel like we are in real good shape with our secondary We have guys who have the ability to cover and the speed to make up ground We also are two deep in the secondary for the first time since weve been here The area where he wants to see the most improvement on defense is a linebacker where all three starters return We have asked our linebackers to step it up he said They have played really well for us but we want them to just take an extra step to get even better The Longhorns had troubles with their place kicking in the spring and Brow n said the returnees and three walkons will compete for the starting job whe n twoadays begin in early August Summing up he said the Longhorns strengths are at quarterback wide receiver tight end the offensive line the defensive ends and the seconda ry He said defensive tackle will be a strong position too if Lee returns healthy and all the young players continue to improve When asked to comment on the most pleasant surprises from spring training Brown said Bo Scaife returning and looking like he is ready to play is on e Kyle Shanahan a walkon wide receiver did some really good things Derric k Dockery finally being healthy again was a big positive development He said all of the spindown moves the coaches made on defense this sprin g are looking good at this point We wanted to improve our speed on defense and these moves have helped us accomplish that Asked about the biggest disappointment in the spring drills he said It w as nobody emerging at tailback They all played good but after Ricky William s and Hodges Mitchell our expectations are very high True Orange Observations Look for the Longhorns to use more oneback formations this season Why Th e backup wide receivers and tight ends are more dangerous than the fullbacks WR Sloan Thomas and TE Brock Edwards would start and star for many teams b ut they are backups at Texas Also look for a lot more misdirection plays and other plays designed to ma ke the offense less predictable than it was last season With coach Mack Browns first great class of recruits heading into their third seasons and two other great classes following it this is the season the Longhorns should be able to finish in the top for the first time sin ce For those of you who seem to get a little impatient at times it is worth noting that the Longhorns have finished in the top just seven times sinc e and three of those seven times were in Browns first three years here th in st in and th in This Longhorn team probably will start out about fifth or sixth in the country and it should be able to stay in the top unless some wheels fall off The great thing about the way Brown has built this program is that he and h is assistants recruit great prospects every year and develop them I think this year will start a long string of years for UT to be contendin g for high national honors The only way you can win the highest national honor a national champio nship is to get to the championship game Since only two teams get to the championship game some very deserving team s are left out Miami and Washington for example were certainly deserving last year but unbeaten Oklahoma and oncebeaten Florida State got the nod So having an outstanding team doesnt guarantee a berth in the national title game I wont predict the Longhorns will wind up in the Rose Bowl playing for the national title this year but I will predict that Brown will have us playin g in a national championship game very soon Teams in the Big and SEC have the extra burden of having to play a postseason game for their conference titles which means they have to play two godzillas back to back to be No But great teams can do it and Texas will be a great team in the very near future It might not be this year but it could be if things break the Longhorns way Number Updated Frequently I update my number at least twice a week with football and football rec rui ting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call
<1817430.1075857327190.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2000-09-11 04:49:00,True Orange September Part Scarbroughs True Orange The Internet Newsletter and EMail Service for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No September Applewhite Freshmen Receivers Lead Horns To Opening Win UT No in AP Poll The Longhorns opened their season at home Saturday by falling behind a point underdog LouisianaLafayette team but Major Applewhite came off t he bench to spark a point second quarter that paved the way for a victory and a No ranking in the latest Associated Press Poll Heralded sophomore Chris Simms got the starting nod at quarterback over Applewhite who underwent offseason knee surgery after earning Big Offensive Player of the Year honors in But Simms had a rocky start and when his sideline pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown that gave the Ragin Cajuns a shocking lead with left in the first quarter the coaches turned to Applewhite to tr y to pump some life into the dormant Longhorn offense And he delivered big time He led the Longhorns to seven straight scores six touchdowns and a field goal before retiring for the day and lettin g Simms handle the mopup duties For the day Applewhite was of for yards and four touchdowns and that was in less than two quarters He came in for the final of the first quarter played all the second quarter and then left for keeps just deep into the third quarter with the Longhorns on top Coach Mack Brown still says the team has two firstteam quarterbacks and he still says he wont name a starter for the Stanford game but there is litt le doubt that the quarterback controversy is over and Applewhite is the starti ng quarterback once again These coaches grade on performance and his scoring percentage Saturday was perfect seven possessions seven scores that turned a hole into a romp when he left the game True freshmen wide receiver Roy Williams also had a big day He caught six passes for yards including a super onehanded grab for yards to get the Longhorns off their twoyard line Heading into this game the Longhorns had four big questions and three of them got positive answers Unfortunately the one that didnt get the positive answer was the key one Here are the questions and the answers at least for the short term Will the offensive line do a better job of blocking This is the one that didnt get the positive answer It actually did a good job of pass protecting but the Longhorns couldnt run the football against a bad team that has small defensive linemen Unless the line improves and the Horns can run with some success the good defensive linemen will do just what our defensive linemen do against the Oklahomas of the world which is pin their ears back and harass the quarterback on every play Will those young wide receivers be able to pick up the slack for Kwame Cavil Ryan Nunez and Jeremy Jones last years big three Yes Yes Yes Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas the three heralded true freshmen combined to catch passes for yards and another gjuy seeing his first action redshirt freshman Artie Ellis tacked on four more catches for more yards and two touchdowns As Darrell Royal used to say if a dog will bite hell bite as a pup These pups have big teeth and th ey know how to use them Will the special teams be better They were Saturday Brown said the kicking game was the best since weve been here and that tells the story Kris Stockton punted for a yard average the kickoffs went team and the Longhorn punt and kickoff returner s got some positive yardage Will the young defensive ends be able to fill in for fouryear starter Aaron Humphrey and Cedric Woodard a threestarter first at tackle then a t end Sophomores Cole Pittman and Cory Redding who was still bothered by a knee sprain and true freshman Kalen Thornton all played well and junior Jermai n Anderson who is swift but undersized did a good job of rushing the passer This is a Longhorn team with a lot going for it in terms of talent coachin g and a more favorable schedule but the lack of a dependable running game could prove fatal against a team that can pressure the quarterbacks Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER With the temperature at and rising the Longhorns won the toss and deferred The Cajuns ran the deep kickoff back to the then drove yard s in plays using up nearly half of the first quarter before stalling at the Longhorn and settling for a field goal to take a lead with left Simms getting the start over Applewhite at quarterback led the Horn s on a yard drive that ended when Kris Stockton was wide on a yard fiel d goal try The Cajuns couldnt move and had to punt but Simms thirddown pass was picked off by Terrance Hunter at the UT and he dashed in for th e score to give the point underdog Cajuns a lead with left Vict or Ike ran the kickoff back to the and Applewhite came in and hit TB Hodge s Mitchell for yards then found Williams twice for and yards to reach the Cajun as the quarter ended SECOND QUARTER Mitchell darted over right tackle for four yards and the touchdown on the first play of the quarter to get UT back in the game at On the Horns remaining four possessions in the half Applewhite swiftly moved them an d yards for touchdowns nine yards for a field goal and yards for a touchdown after a Joe Walker interception That point explosion put Texa s comfortably on top at at intermission In that decisive second quarte r Texas had yards offensively and Louisiana had THIRD QUARTER Ivan Williams ran the kickoff back to the UT and Applewhite took Texas o n two more quick scoring jaunts first zipping yards in five plays and the n going yards in four plays for two more TDs to push score to and gi ve him a perfect seven scores in seven tries Simms relieved him at that point and hit three straight passes to lead Texas to its final touchdown with left in the quarter Neither team threatened serious for the remainder of t he quarter FOURTH QUARTER The Longhorns went back to trying to run the ball in the final quarter without much success The Cajuns did have one late drive that got to the Texas before stalling but that was the last serious drive by either tea m True Orange Observations It was feast or famine for the Longhorns in the running game Heres the ne t gain on each running play in chronological order minus minus minus That is the primary reason Texas had the ball only and Louisiana had it Most of the successful runs were draw plays There were very few times when normal running plays made any yardage In a romp past an overmatched opponent this is no big deal But it could cost the team two or three games down the line unless the regular running plays start being more productive on a consistent basis Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting scoops The number is It costs a minute You must be to ca ll Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns had to quit trying to run the ball Saturday because LouisianaLafayette had guys lined up in every gap and they blitzed on every play He said he really wanted to establish a running game early but it was much more sensible to go to an allout passing attack because of the defense the Ragin Cajuns were playing Brown said I was surprised Major Applewhite was able to play as well a s he did the first time back after knee surgery Major played really well he said The protection was great The momentu m really changed when we put Major in but we also changed our offense and starting putting four wide receivers out on every play He said Applewhite and Chris Simms who started the game and played the fir st two series before giving way to Applewhite are both starting quarterbacks Chris had the great spring and he had an outstanding fall but it wasnt that Major got beaten out We just think we have two starting quarterbacks He also said You just as well not ask me about next weeks starter becaus e Im not going to say I didnt know who it would be in the opener but Im betting on Applewhite to get the nod Saturday night in Palo Alto against the dangerous Stanford Cardinal because of his outstanding relief duty Brown said he was pleasantly surprised with the way his young receivers performed Its been a long time since Ive seen freshmen play with composure like that he said Roy Williams became the first UT freshman ever to pick up a yard receiving game in his first start He grabbed six passes for yards including a spectacular onehanded catch on a yarder from Applewhite Roy really played well Brown said One of the catches he made was phenomenal Two other true freshman wide receivers B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas also had outstanding debuts B J made some great catches Brown said and Sloan comes in makes a catch on the sideline then makes two guys miss Im really pleased with the way the freshmen played Brown said They ke pt their poise and helped us win the game Artie Ellis a redshirt freshman also had a good day catching four passes for yards including two touchdowns Ellis was a smashing success during spring practice and was expected to mak e a big impact this year because of his pound frame and good speed a nd his ability to catch the ball in a crowd The four freshmen receivers accounted for of the Longhorns reception s and of their passing yards Littleused fifthyear senior Brandon Healy also made up for lost time wit h four catches two of them for touchdowns for a total of yards Getting back to the quarterback duel Brown said both players are handling the situation well and the team has confidence in both of them to get the job done We have to keep both of these quarterbacks upbeat Brown said Well nee d both of them to accomplish the goals we have set He said he and offensive coordinator Greg Davis talked to the guys long an d hard about playing two quarterbacks We will always talk to the players about the quarterback situation before anyone else he said Were not going to throw one in or out because of a fan poll At his Sunday press conference Brown said he was very pleased with the teams firstdown efficiency offensively and defensively and was happy with the special teams play Looking at the lack of run production he said When you score points its not important but for the season it is important He said the Longhorns will work hard on improving their running game this week We have to do a better job on running the football he said This was the fourth straight game in which the Horns had less than yard s rushing but they lost the other three to end last season so this time it wasnt fatal Brown said LouisianaLafayette deserves a lot of credit for playing hard an d he said Cajun QB Derek Dyer played really great But I thought our team was focused he said Louisiana had nothing to lose but he had a lot to lose and nothing to gain He said all aspects of the kicking game pleased him Saturday The kicking game was the best since weve been here he said Freshmen Play Fifteen freshmen played in Saturdays opening game Eight of them were true freshmen and seven were redshirt freshmen The eight true freshmen were WRs Roy Williams B J Johnson and

our oneminute offense when we got down because we wanted to force the tempo a little bit Its all shotgun formation during that time Longhorn offensive coordinator Greg Davis We played the dime six defensive backs about of the time They had three wideouts and another wideout in the backfield most of the time UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese I dont care who starts It really doesnt bother me as long as we stay undefeated and win the national championship It was exciting to be back ou t there Our line did a great job I only got hit one or two times Roy Williams is a phenomenal receiver Hes going to be great Texas QB Major Applewhite If I had known it was one on one I could have kept on running and made an even bigger play but I thought there was a safety coming over and I wanted to wrap it up before he got there If I hadnt seen that imaginary guy I might have had a really long play UT freshman WR Roy Williams explaining his onehanded grab of a ya rd pass to get the Longhorns started on a yard scoring drive They were bringing their safeties and blitzing all the time so we just we nt to our passing game Isnt that Roy Williams something He looks like hes been playing college football for years Longhorn RB Hodges Mitchell I was hungry to get out there When I came out of that tunnel and saw all those people it really fired me up I had fun out there and thought I didn t do bad for a first game Texas freshman WR B J Johnson They just came out and played hard We just had to gather oursevles After a couple of series we got things together UT AllAmerican DT Casey Hampton We drove the ball well at the start but we just werent able to put it in the end zone On the other end Major Applewhite was making good reads on h is completions He really got them going Louisiana QB Derrick Dyer If we had played all four quarters like we did at the start of the game i t would have been different Cajun DB Kyries Hebert We started pretty strong but then we got a little rattled out

Stanford The Longhorns face their first major test Saturday night when they play defending Pac champion Stanford in Palo Alto The game will start at Texas time and will be televised by the Fox Network Texas clobbered Stanford last year in Austin and the Cardinal will be trying to turn the tables this year Stanford went overall last season and won the Pac with a record But all four of the seniors they lost on offense were firstteam AllPac players They included QB Todd Husak and WR Troy Walters the leagues alltime leading receiver plus two veteran offensive linemen Six defensive starters return from last year including four linemen But only one linebacker and one defensive back who started a year ago are on ha nd Stanford opened the season with a victory over Washington State and the Cardinal defense did not allow an offensive touchdown but then the Cardinal fell to San Jose State Saturday night San Jose State beat Stanford with a powerful running game Spartan TB Deonc e Whitaker gained yards on carries scoring on runs of and yards and setting up two other TDs with long runs Stanford QB Randy Fasani threw for yards and four touchdowns in the offensive slugfest If the Longhorns are going to have a running game anytime soon this will b e their best chance to do it Texas probably will be at least a point favorite but this could be a dangerous game unless the Longhorns tackle better than they did last week a nd force a few turnovers The Horns also need to get their running game going or it will be one of those fourhour pass shootouts Here are the three keys to victory in my opinion Win the rushing battle That doesnt sound like a big order against the passhappy Cardinal but the Longhorns havent had a yard rushing game in their last four outings Put a lot of pressure on Fasani and do a good job of protecting the Texa s quarterbacks Take care of the ball Texas needs to win the turnover battle I think this is a dangerous road trip but Ill go out on a limb and pick t he Longhorns to win by a score I think Texas will pressure Fasani and take care of the ball Hopefully the Horns can run the ball too but two out of three should be good enough Big Roundup Texas plays at

Dallas Carter are UT commitments who are on USATodays Top national players Two other UT pledges OL Abe Robinson of Jersey Village and QBAthlete Kendal Briles of Frenship are on some national top lists Benson running behind an allnew offensive line is still racking up impressive numbers He had carries for yards and a TD plus a yar d reception in the defending state champions victory over a good Victoria team in the season opener then scored four touchdowns on just nin e carries good for yards in a romp past Longview His four TDs came on runs of and yards For the year he has carries yards and five touchdowns Behind an inexperienced OL he is averaging yards per carry and a touchdown every carries Terrance Young the huge Longview OL who also has committed to UT said it was a long way to go for a high school football game but he said it was worth it just to see Benson run I heard he was the best running back in the nation and he is awesome You ng said Blocking for him is going to be a lot of fun He is an awesome player Benson wont have the monster year he had last year at his present pace simply because he isnt carrying the ball as much Lee coach John Parchman trying for a third consecutive state title is working on a more diversified attack to try to spread things out a little more When you lose as many seniors as he did you have to improvise Briles the Class A Offensive Player of the Year while leading Stephenvill e to the state title in is at a new A school Wolfforth Frenship near Lubbock because his dad former Stephenville coach Art Briles is on the coaching staff at Texas Tech But dont worry about him requiring any time to get adjusted Frenship open ed its season Friday and Briles passed for yards and four touchdowns and r an for more yards and two more

for him to be a bigtime recruit next year Aldine played Madison in a battle of Class A Houston powers Aldine won b ut the most impressive players in the game were Madison OL William Winston and his teams junior QB Vincent Young Winston has the quickest feet of any pounder Ive seen this year Aldines Lawrence Hooper is a highly recruited DE Some people think hes t he best one in the state but Winston definitely won their individual battle At he is big enough to overpower most opponents and he is incredibl y quick at sliding out to pick up speed rushers He is still considering Texa s AM and a lot of other people and he is a prize Young is and he runs a sub He has a powerful arm but Aldine is a groundoriented team and he is outstanding on the option He wi ll be one of the states top recruits next year Selvin Young the great Jersey Village junior running back who topped the yard rushing mark as a sophomore is still bothered by the badly sprained ankle he suffered at the end of last season and he saw only limit ed action in his teams opener Eric Hall the fine defensive end from Clarksville Tenn took his officia l visit to Texas last weekend and his mother said he had a great time He didnt get home in time for me to talk to him before going to press but he told me before he came that Texas was his No choice and his mother said he told her the visit went even better than he

Mich AM UT Recruiting Proof Is in the Pudding Ive been covering recruiting since and there definitely is a correlation between recruiting success and success on the field But Dave Campbells Texas Football Magazine has been around a lot longer th an that and subscriber Grant Erwin of Dallas went back to the year befo re the Aggies finally started having success against Texas after decades of being hammered and compiled the results The magazine ranks recruiting classes in June of the following year so it is able to study every other ranking in detail before coming up with its own list of top recruits That should give it a great degree of accuracy Here is what the study showed DCTF Recruiting Rankings in the Southwest Conference plus results of UTA M game AM Texas UT won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won Texas AM AM won AM Texas Texas won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won Texas AM AM won AM Texas AM won Texas AM Texas won DCTF Recruiting Rankings in the Big XII South AM Texas Texas won Texas AM AM won Texas AM Texas won Texas AM AM won Texas AM Indicates recruiting battle won by a wide margin according to Dave Campbells rating system AM put together several outstanding classes in a row in the early s and kept it going with the exception of until Texas started having good recruiting success again in Its no coincidence that the Aggies who had never won more than three in a row against the Longhorns and that was way back in won five i n a row and nine times in years during their recruiting dominance over the Longhorns Team with superior talent rarely lose to less talented teams and that is w hy the Aggies enjoyed their decade in the sun But look at those recent classes All the strange happenings at AM last season delayed the inevitable in my opinion and if those recruiting rankings continue to prove as accurate a crystal ball as they have in the last two decades the Longhorns supremacy in recruiting should make this first decade of the new century a great one for UT in this long series whi ch the Horns already lead Four Baseball Stars Commit The Longhorn baseball coaches already have commitments from four top baseball players They are catcher Jack Sweeney of powerhouse Houston Bellaire and three hardthrowing righthanded pitchers Joey Guajardo wh o threw three nohitters as a junior at Round Rock and Austin Westlake aces Chaz Taylor and Huston Street Street who was with a ERA last season is the son of former UT football and baseball star James Street Taylor pitched a twohitter this summer against the Dallas Mustangs a powerful team that included seven college players or signees including Jas on Stokes of Coppell He struck Stokes out twice in that game Stokes a UT signee signed a million pro contract last week Sweeney started games as a freshman at Bellaire and has been a starter ever since He is the best defensive catcher in the country and also wields a powerful bat Basketball Recruiting The weekend of the first Longhorn football game also was a huge recruiting weekend for both Texas basketball teams T J Ford the point guard who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the Class A State Championship last season took his official visit to UT He said he enjoyed the trip I really like the coaches and the players and there are a lot of things to do at UT and in Austin he said He said he plans to visit Cincinnati and possibly Louisville and Houston before making a decision Ford is one of the top three point guards in the country The Longhorn women had two top recruits in town for official visits They a re forward Jody Bell of Chestermere HS in Calgary Canada and guard Lauren Selmon of Norman Okla Selmon is the daughter of former OU and pro football star Dewey

Volume No September Late Great Rally Comes Up Short at Stanford Texas Falls From No to No After Loss The Longhorns couldnt run couldnt protect the quarterback got a punt blocked for a Stanford touchdown and still almost won the game against the defending Pac champion Cardinals But they didnt Stanford won a verdict with a late touchdown that negated a point fourthquarter Texas rally Coach Mack Brown praised the Longhorns fight and they did fight and he said the team can build on the loss because it showed the young players the y have a chance to win tough games on the road We tried he said This one was tough because of the mistakes we made W e came back and had a chance to win it with those two big fourth quarter drives We just came up a little short Brown said the team has to work hard to improve He didnt single out the offensive line as a unit that needs to improve but while the receivers dropped some ball the quarterbacks missed some open receivers and the defense bent more than it should the one constant negative this year has been an inability to run the football After playing two teams who are not very good at stopping the run the Longhorns are last in the Big and No of Division I football tea ms in average rushing yardage per game at In two games they have net rushing yards The Longhorns actually ran the ball better against Stanford than they did against a weak LouisianaLafayette team in their opening win but the Cardinal defenders had five sacks to cut into the net figure I have been predicting a very good season and Brown has been saying the te am has some problems and must get better to accomplish its goals Hes right a nd Im wrong Lets just hope he and his assistant coaches can work out the problems in the offense in time to let the team accomplish its goals The victory gave Stanford a point underdog a record while the Longhorns fell to Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Stanford won the toss and took the ball After an exchange of punts Stanfo rd drove to midfield but backup DE Maurice Gordon sacked QB Randy Fasani and Fasani suffered an injured ankle and had to leave the game He was replaced by sophomore Chris Lewis A facemask penalty on a bad Stanford punt negate d that punt and gave Stanford a first down at the and the Cardinal took advantage of that Longhorn miscue scoring in four plays with Lewis hitting WR Luke Powell behind Quentin Jammer for the final yards to put Stanford ahead with left in the quarter DE Cory Redding blocked the extr a point Ivan Williams ran the kickoff back to the Texas drove to the Stanford before stalling Kris Stockton got off a great punt that kicked out of bounds at the Stanford A fumbled snap pushed Stanford inside the then Redding and DT Casey Hampton led a surge that trapped FB Casey Moore i n the end zone for a safety with left leaving Stanford on top Chr is Simms came in at QB for Texas and the Horns were at midfield as the period ended SECOND QUARTER Simms hit freshman WR Roy Williams down the middle for a yard touchdown strike on the third play of the quarter Williams broke an attempted tackle by CB Ryan Fernandez at the and strolled in for the score Stocktons ki ck put Texas on top with left Applewhite relieved Simms midway through the period Neither team threatened again until Stanford drove yards primarily on two big pass plays to take a left with left Neither team threatened again before intermission THIRD QUARTER Texas got the ball first but failed to make a first down and had to punt A horde of Stanford defenders poured through and blocked it and backup FB Emo ry Brock covered it in the end zone for a touchdown putting Stanford up just one minute deep into the second half The rest of the quarter was a defensive struggle with each team making only one first down FOURTH QUARTER Applewhite hit WR Montrell Flowers for yards on the second play of the fourth quarter to revive the long dormant UT offense and get the Horns started on a drive that enabled them to get into Stanford territory for the first time in the second half but a holding penalty and then a sack pushed the Horns back and killed the drive With left and Longhorn fans everywhere beginning to despair Texas starting from its own got back in the game on one huge play Applewhite found freshman WR B J Johnson behin d all the defenders and hit him for a yard scoring strike The Horns decid ed to go for a point conversion and after a pass interference penaty put th e ball on the Mitchell went over the top to get the twopointer and cut th e Stanford lead to with left The Texas defense again forced Stanford to punt quickly Mitchell returned the punt to the Texas Applewhite hit TE Mike Jones for yards to the Stanford but under a big blitz he was intercepted at the Stanford with left Stanford punted with left and Mitchell made a great punt return dashing yards to the Cardinal but a holding penalty on the return pushed the Horns back to the Backup TB Victor Ike was stopped for no gain and Applewhite threw an incomplete pass and to bring up thirdand Ike raced down the left sideline and caught Applewhites long throw just behind a Stanford defender and sprinted in for the TD putting Texas ahead with left Stanford got a good kickoff return to the Cardinal but couldnt move and had to punt giving Texas a chance to run the clock out with left A couple of first downs would have done it but two falsestart penalties left the Horns in a hole They made yards in three plays but faced a fourthand at their own and had to punt Stanford held in check throughout the second half by the Longhorn defense started i ts drive with left The Cardinal scored in five plays with Lewis hitting WR DeRonnie Phipps for yards to the Texas The Longhorns were called for roughing the passer and a penalty to the was tacked on After an incompletion Lewis found Pitts again and he barreled over for the winning TD with left Texas had enough time to come back but the Stanford defens e which already had three sacks got two more in that final minute to finish off the Longhorns Notes The Longhorns havent rushed for net yards in their last five games They are in those games with the lone victory being the season opener against LouisianaLafayette The Texas defense allowed Stanford only one first down in the third quarter and only two in the fourth quarter until the Cardinals winning drive in the final two minutes Texas had possessions Three of them resulted in touchdown two ended with pass interceptions ended with punts and the one at the end of the game ended on downs after Applewhite was sacked twice Texas three touchdown plays accounted for of the Longhorns total net yards It was a feastorfamine kind of game for the UT offense which only three other plays that gained more than yards Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting scoops The number is It costs a minute You must be to ca ll Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown was tired Sunday afternoon for his weekly postgame news conference The team plane left Palo Alto at am Texas time and got back to Austin around am But he was fairly upbeat You always hate to lose he said but if you have to lose you ought to lose early If youre going to lose it ought to be out of conference He said the only thing the lose really costs the Longhorns is a chance at going undefeated and were not a national championship caliber team in m y opinion He said the Horns can still accomplish a lot Look at Stanford last year he said You never want to lose a game but Stanford wins the Pac last year after they leave here with an embarrassing loss Brown said nothing went the Longhorns way in Palo Alto It was a night th at nothing worked for us but the positive thing is that we still had a chance to win No one asked him about his starting quarterback because he says he has two starters but it appears Major Applewhite is back in the saddle He started Saturday night and was the quarterback on of UTs possessions Sophomore Phil Simms got the other four possessions He cant comment on officiating without getting in trouble with the Big office but there were a lot of penalties against the Longhorns that came a t crucial times like the flagrant facemask call that negated Stanfords pun t on a fourthand and gave the Cardinal an automatic first down en route t o their first touchdown The Longhorns also had two false start penalties whe n they were trying to run out the clock with a lead They gained yar ds on their three plays that stood up but that left a yard short and they had to runThen there was a roughingthepasser penalty on Stanfords winning drive in the final two minutes While Brown couldnt comment after the game he had several animated discussions with the officials during the action Without commenting on the officiating he said They got a holding call on an incomplete pass on third down on one touchdown The face mask penalty le d to a score There was a late hit call on the quarterback on their last scoring drive Those things just abolutely kill because just about every one led to points for them Brown said the Longhorns didnt use their shotgun formation with four wideouts more because we werent throwing the ball and catching it very well Thats something we would have done more if we had done better at it We didnt have a good night throwing the ball overall he said We had some drops we had some passes that missed and we had some young receivers who were playing on the road for the first time Montrell Flowers was the g uy who played the best among the wide receivers and hes the most experienced It was a combination of errors on our passing game We were just not smooth Brown was asked about the teams performance in specific area that have caused problems in the past and have gotten special attention like the offensive line and the special teams He said After looking at the tape the offensive line played better than we thought The blitzes were our big problem It looked worse than it was I feel like weve made some progress with our offensive line Weve got to ke ep working on that I think the special teams have improved a lot We had some kickoff returns and Hodges Mitchell had the good punt return but we had a blocked punt for a touchdown We had to punt a lot but that blocked punt really bothers me We cant have one no matter how many times we have to punt Thats the part they have to focus on He said Texas has to bounce back quickly from the long tiring road trip coupled with the loss Our guys are totally exhausted We got back at am Sunday Thats why we didnt go to Hawaii because we knew it would be a hard game and a l ong trip Our team played really hard This was tough because we played so hard but had too many mistakes But our kids fought all the way Thats what we have to build on Weve got another game Saturday Houston is not going to care about our loss he said Itll probably excite them We can sit around and mope or we can get ready to play again This was a little eye opener for us to get better and move forward He said players and coaches cant get as up or down as fans because they kn ow they have to get ready to play another game and cant dwell on a win or a loss until the season is over Thats the least of my worries he said They really tried When you really try and you can come back on the road and have a chance to win that s something thats a positive to build on He said this game will help the team later on because it was a game the Hor ns could have won on the road against a good team We just made too many mistakes he said Thats something we can correct If we had a team that didnt care that it didnt both to lose thats the worst thing that can happen to you as a coach but thats not the problem After the game Saturday night Brown said most of the players were so upset they were crying We can build on this he said We have a really young football team We ll come back and get better We can correct the mistakes We took a big step in these big games by just hanging in there and hanging in there As long as theyll fight you can coach them and they fought all the way It was mistakes that cost them not their effort and that can be fixed We made three or four mistakes that probably cost us the game Brown said the bottom line is were a young team and we will get better INJURY UPDATE Brown said safety Lee Jackson has a strained hamstring and linebacker Marcus Wilkins has a sore groin He said those appeared to be th e only injuries sustained in the Stanford game and both players

head coach Mack Brown You would like to have more success running the football but when you dont you have to be good enough to win with the passing game Longhorn offensive coordinator Greg Davis We tried to battle them all night We shut them down most of the time but we just had too many penalties and mistakes They have a good team but we ll be okay Well fix the things that went wrong UT defensive tackle Shaun Rogers We just have to keep fighting A loss like this really hurts but we have to bounce back and win the rest of them Longhorn linebacker DeAndre Lewis I wont know for sure what happened until we look at the tape We got some confidence and some momentum in the fourth quarter but we made too many mistakes early in the game Stanford has a good team and we just made too many mistakes to win Texas quarterback Major Applewhite When we give our quarterbacks time they can complete passes but we had some breakdowns tonight Well get better We have to work to eliminate our mistakes and we can still have a great season if we can improve and elimina te some of the mistakes UT tailback Hodges Mitchell This was the biggest win weve had Texas has a very good team and we were coming off a tough loss Stanford head coach Tyrone Willingham You just have to go out and do it We had to buckle down It was now or never There was no real pressure Its what we practice every day You jus t have to execute and thats what we did Stanford quarterback Chris Lewis who threw three touchdown passes in relief of injured starter Randy Fasani on the gamewinning drive Its a great feeling Its so much better than last week a loss to San Jo se State I get to wipe that bad taste out of my mouth Its also great to wi n this one at home after what happened to us last year in Austin a loss Texas

nigh t when they host Houston at pm in a game that will be a regional Fox telecast The Cougars won their first game of the season Saturday defeating Army Army had a chence to win with a yard field goal on the final play of the game but UH defensive back Emile White blocked it Houston had lost its first two games to Rice in overtime and to LSU New Cougar coach Dana Dimel has installed an allout passing offense and hi s QB senior Jason McKinley is fifth in the nation in total offense with yards per game The Cougars are sixth in passing with yards per game and WR Brian Robinson is among the national leaders with catches for yards The Cougars gained yards against Army and ran plays Defensively Houston has struggled In losing to Stanford last week the Longhorns lost all three of the keys to victory I cited in my scouting report They lost the rushing battle they didnt put as much pressure on the Stanford QBs as the Cardinal defenders p ut on the Texas signal callers and they had two turnovers while Stanford had none The Cougars are far less formidable than Stanford so Texas should win fair ly easily Here are three keys to victory in my opinion Do a better job of running the football Thats not a huge order since t he Horns are averaging only yards per game on the ground Protect the Texas quarterbacks Stanford got five sacks and had tremendo us pressure on the Texas QBs most of the game Put a lot of pressure on McKinley The Texas secondary gives up a lot of big plays when opposing QBs have time to throw LongRange Outlook Coach Mack Brown likes to talk about four or five key games on the schedule He doesnt mean the other games are against patsies but lets ta ke a look at the teams Texas plays this year First there are six games the Longhorns should win The opening victory ov er LouisianaLafayette was one of those The others are Houston Oklahoma Stat e Missouri Baylor and Kansas If Texas takes care of business in those six games the other five will be the key to going or or somewhere in between this season Stanford as Brown noted was one of the key games so Texas is in the big games The others are Oklahoma Colorado Texas Tech and Texas AM Texas needs to win at least three of those to have a chance to finish a nd win the Big s Southern Division title Big Roundup Texas lost at Stanford and Colorado fell to visiting Washington in the Big

picked up two more commitments last week getting LB Lance McFarland of Jefferson early in the week followed by a pledge from his teammate RB Anthony Johnson on Friday Johnson rushed for more than yards in a loss to defending Class A chamion Texarkana LiberyEylau earlier this season He has great power outstanding moves and tremendous speed In other words he has all the attributes of an outstanding running back He also has confidence The Longhorns already have a commitment from super Midland Lee RB Cedric Benson but Johnson says that doesnt worry him I want to play on a great college team he said Youre going to have competition wherever you go if you want to play for a winning program His coach Jerry Bennett is the brother of Kansas States defensive coordinator and Johnson said the Wildcats finished No on his list The Wildcats also were after McFarland a hardnosed tackle with good speed for a linebacker He won a fatboy event after his sophomore year wit h an clocking Only players who weighed more than pounds competed The two additions give the Longhorns early commitments It looks more an d more like the Texas coaches will award close to scholarships because th ey still hope to add four of five defensive linemen a quarterback a tight en d a wide receiver a linebacker a safety and at least one cornerback Seven of the Longhorns commitments are offensive linemen Texas has signed only three offensive linemen in each of coach Mack Browns three previous recruiting classes and he said heading into this recruiting season that the offensive line was the No priority But he also said the defensive line was a high priority and that is where most of the remaining scholarships probably will be awarded Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter a national top player Abe Robinson Jersey Village a national top player Alfio Randall Blinn JC was a national top player two years ago Mike Garcia Galena Park was the Aggies top early pledge before switching to UT Will Allen Cypress Falls is in his three year as a starter Roman Reeves another of the states top eight offensive linemen Terrance Young Longview is tremendously strong and had offers from several top schools before committing to Texas Running Back Cedric Benson Midland Lee the greatest Class A rusher an d scorer in state history and a national top player Anthony Johnson Jefferson No on my top list Linebacker Yamil LeBron Killeen Ellison was the middle backer the Longhorns targeted early Lance McFarland Jefferson No on my top list Defensive Back Cedric Griffin San Antonio Holmes one of the states top two cornerbacks Kendal Briles Wolfforth Frenship a great option QB who wi ll play safety at Texas Braden Johnson Euless Trinity a fine athlete who is

Jakes of Valencia H S in Placentia Cal says he will visit this weekend or the following weeken d Jakes is playing nose guard this year and said he had two sacks and several other tackles for losses in Valencias opening victory over Palmdale Highland He said Highland is supposed to have a playoffcaliber team and we really shut them down Jakes lived in Plano when he was in junior high and he said he is strongly considering coming to UT I really like the way football is king in Texas he said Super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison and outstanding OL William Winston of Houston Madison both say they plan to come to the Houston game this weekend on unofficial visits Harris is the nations top DT prospect and Winston is a dominating OL UT pledg e Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity rallied his team from a thirdquarter deficit to a victory over Arlington Martin by running and yards for TDs DE Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn took his official visit to Texas the Sept weekend and said he really enjoyed it He said Texas is h is favorite right now but said he wants to take some other visits before committing to anyone Hall was born in Fort Hood and like Jakes says he h as fond memories of Texas football Satchell Richardson Status Two Longhorn freshmen football players linebacker Aurmon Satchell and RB Tyrone Richardson have been lost to the team for at least this semester Satchell and Richardson both said they have some academic issues that need to be resolved before they can return Both said they hope to be back in Janua ry Satchell is from Denver Jefferson and Richardson is from Clarksville True Orange Observations Coach Mack Brown is in his third year of what should have been a major rebuilding job at Texas Thanks to the way he and his assistants took charge and changed one of the nations worst defenses into one of its best and thanks to the way they recruit the Longhorns are already back among the nations elite I know they lost at Stanford I didnt like it The coaches and players didnt like it either It bothers them even more than it bothers us But Texas hasnt finished among the nations top in football since so we probably all expected too much from this team The Horns will finish in the top again very soon and probably next year if not this one With three great recruiting classes already in school and a fourth in the making there are going to be a lot more Ws than Ls in the weeks and year s ahead Lets be grateful for what he and his assistants and players have accomplished and help them get back on the winning track Gustafsons Lawsuit Dismissed State District Judge J Scott McCown ruled last week that former Longhorn baseball coach Cliff Gustafsons lawsuit against UT athletic director DeLos s Dodds has no merit and he dismissed it McCown also said Dodds has official immunity from such a lawsuit The lawsuit alleged that Dodds falsified an outside income statement by Gustafson and provided false information to thenUT president Robert Berdah l that Gustfson has violated university rules by maintaining a nonuniversity bank account for a baseball camp The suit alleged Dodds actions forced hi m to resign The judge ordered Gustafson to pay Dodds court costs Basketball Recruiting T J Ford the outstanding point guard at Fort Bend Willowridge says he h ad a great visit to Texas the Sept weekend but isnt ready to commit to anyone until he looks at some other schools UCLA probably is the Horns main competition for Ford a super quick star who is the states No prospect He led Willowridge to the state Clas s A title and a record last season Coach Rick Barnes only has one more scholarship to award so UTs recruitin g will be over for this year if Ford commits to the Longhorns The Longhorn women are going to get a visit late this month from Kala Bower s a forward from Woodward Okla She is a national top star who plays on a team that has lost only two games in the last two years Coach Jody Conradt already has a pledge from the states top prospect forward Heather Schreiber of Windthorst Kelly to Miss Fall Semester Senior guard Darren Kelly will miss the fall semester Longhorn basketball coach Rick Barnes announced last week Kelly hopes to return to game action for the Longhorns following the fall semester It is going to be difficult not being able to play this fall but I have some academic issues that I need to take care of to return to the team Kelly said I am going to attempt to take care of that this fall and hope to rejoin the team in December Kelly was slated to return for his second season as the teams starting shooting guard He earned Big Conference AllNewcomer and AllBench team recognition as a junior averaging points and rebounds per game He was third on the squad in scoring and second in assists last season He also was the top threepoint shooter on the team and secondbest in the Big including a mark in league play of Im sad for Darren because he had made such great strides in his game duri ng the latter part of last year and over the summer and he had really taken a strong leadership role on this team Barnes said With the addition of so many new guys this year theres no question that his loss in the fall will hurt us Hopefully hell be able to return to the team and give us a big lift heading into Big Conference play A True Orange Subscription Is The Gift You Can Get Every Year for Your

selective in making offers to recruits so far this spring but that will change next month when they host some of the top blue chippers at their summer camps The Aggies have two commitments to the Longhorns one pledge from my man differencemaker list on page but that will all change in June Coach Mack Brown is the one who invented early recruiting in Texas and he did it through his June camps That hasnt changed The only thing that has changed is that the Aggies went out in March and April and gave offers to about kids Theres nothing wrong with that and I am not knocking their strategy But Browns strategy works and there is no reason for him to change it If you look at the last three February signing days youll know why he doesnt need to change it Meanwhile the Horns got one offensive lineman they wanted when they got a pledge from terrific run blocker Bret Valdez of Brownwood The Aggies got commitments last week from center Bob Morton of McKinney the guy I have rated as the best offensive lineman in the state and LTydrick Riley of Crockett the top recruit in the state in the athlete category Texas probably would have offered Riley a scholarship at some point if he had not committed to AM but the Longhorn coaches did not recruit Morton as hard as they are recruiting several other offensive linemen in the state I think when the dust settles in February the Longhorns will have another great class signed and ready for delivery They got commitments last June en route to a national top five recruiting class and they probably will have close to that number at the end of June this year Most of those commitments last June were from big offensive linemen who were just what the Longhorns needed Several of them this June could be from big defensive linemen and thats where the Longhorns need to load up this season DT Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Arizona younger brother of current UT LB Austin Sendlein and son of former UT and pro LB Robin Sendlein told me he probably will commit to Texas when he attends the Longhorns early June camp He is the top recruit in Arizona and is being heavily recruited by top schools all over the country DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos also plans to attend a UT camp next month and he is another possibility for an early commitment In a year when the state is loaded with top defensive line prospect he is a star among stars The best DT of them all however is Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings He probably wont commit early but he likes the Longhorns Wright is a pounder with outstanding quickness and he does the best job of staying low and collapsing the line of scrimmage of anyone I have seen in the nation If Texas can sign Wright Anderson Sendlein and Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo they will be set at defensive tackle and they have the inside track with all four of them Studdard is the son of former UT and Denver Bronco offensive line star David Studdard Anderson like Keller DT Tully Janszen is a super quick starter who could play end or tackle in college At DE the top guy in Texas is Travis Leitko of The Woodlands He is a super student who is pretty wide open but he likes the Longhorns and he also is friends with redshirt freshman QB Chance Mock and incoming freshman WRDB Brian Carter two Longhorns who are former Woodlands stars Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel brother of Cole Pittman who was expected to contend for a starting job at DT with Texas this year before being killed in a tragic auto accident also is an outstanding DE prospect who is like Leitko very quick and very physical He is strongly considering Texas The coaches also want a super quick DE and their best hope in Texas might be Nick Owino of Alief Elsik They also are trying to get in on Zack Latimer who led Colorado in sacks last year with at Aurora Gateway But Latimer is AllState in both football and basketball and could opt for the latter in college Owino and Latimer are the kind of outside speed rushing defensive ends the Longhorn coaches have been seeking since they arrived at Texas The two fastest junior football players in the state are also two of the best ones And thats no coincidence because you cant tackle something you cant catch RB DaBryan Blanton of Forney broke the sprint records in Class A with a smoking in the meters and a in the meters Not since the days of Roy Martin a quarter century ago have I seen a high school sprinter run a meters like that The times at the state meet are all fully automatic which makes them officially seconds slower than hand times In the old handtimed days he would have had a He also anchored Forneys meter relay team to victory in Blanton is an outstanding running back but he probably will be a wide receiver or defensive back in college He is pretty wide open on his college choices but he is considering Texas CB Edorian McCullough of North Garland won thge A in finished second in the in flat and anchored his teams meter relay team to second place making up a lot of ground to pull from fourth to second McCullough was undefeated in the meters this year He is a top RBCB prospect who favors Texas over Oklahoma The talent level in Texas this year is very high About Texas players have been listed on one or more national groupings and there are some other outstanding players who are equally talented but who are not as well known yet One interesting factor this year is geography In most year the Houston area has most of the really elite prospects Houston is very strong at the top again with the top two and three of the top five players on my differencemaker list on page But the DallasFort Worth area runs deeper in talent this year than the HoustonGulf Coast area with a edge on my list of the top The other nine players on the list include four from East Texas three from West Texas and two from the Austin area The talent runs very deep at defensive tackle and defensive end this year for the first time since Brown and his staff arrived in Austin There also are some big linebackers like Glenn Jackson of Carrollton Turner who are bigframed guys who already weigh and might grow into pound defensive ends in college Jackson runs a and is an outstanding pass rusher from the corner There also is a lot of talent at quarterback and if a school misses on a top signal caller in this recruiting class there are a pair of kids who will be juniors this season who already have college recruiters salivating They are James Battle who ran Recruiting continued from page and passed a Denton Ryan team that was in deep into the Class A playoffs last year and Devon Williams of Arlington Houston a quickfooted runner with a powerful arm Both will be top national recruits next year The Longhorns also want to sign a great running back every year and while the class of running backs doesnt run very deep Albert Hardy of Galena Park is a power runner deluxe with fine speed and he likes the Longhorns There are some very good wide receivers in Texas this year but the best one I have seen on tape is Marquis Johnson of Champaign Ill If he played in Texas he would be high in my top and would be easily the No wide receiver He likes the Longhorns and super UT recruiter Tim Brewster was in Champaign last week to visit his high school He only lives three blocks from the Illinois campus so lets hope he has a yen to travel He is a big physical receiver who has speed moves and great hands There is one receiver in Texas I havent seen play but I have heard good things about him and I saw him run a fine leg on Klein Forests thirdplace meter relay team at the state meet He is Anthony Wright another big guy with speed who has a reputation for being physical I plan to see him play in early September and might move him up on the list after that Texas needs to sign a tight end too and it will be an uphill fight to land Eric Winston of Midland Lee who is easily the top one in the state He comes from an Aggie family but says he will consider Texas too Horns rd in Baseball Play Ags Texas wound up third in the Big baseball race and will play No seed Texas AM Wednesday at am in Oklahoma City in the first round of the conference

No September Defense Special Teams Dominant in Rout Longhorns Heading into Big Action The Longhorns stampeded past the Houston Cougars Saturday night in Austin posting their first home shutout in nine years and getting dominati ng play from the defense and special teams The victory got Texas back on the winning track and pulled the Longhorns up to No in both major polls The Longhorns are heading into their Big opener Saturday against Oklahoma State The Longhorn defense was so dominant that it scored two touchdowns and Houston which has one of the nations most potent offenses got inside the Texas yard line only two times The defense blocked a field goal to blunt the first threat and sacked Couga r QB Jason McKinley forcing a fumble to kill the second one Special teams a headache a week ago in the loss at Stanford were outstanding Kris Stockton punted for a yard average and had three pun ts killed inside the UH including one at the yard line UT also blocked a field goal and got a special teams touchdown when Quentin Jammer caused a fumble on a punt and Michael Ungar recovered it in the Houston end zone The offense started slowly making only two first downs and getting only on e net yard in the first quarter but the great defensive effort provided a safety net and the offense started moving more efficiently as the game progressed Head coach Mack Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis said the offense has been under so much pressure to play better that they thought the player s were a little too tight to start the game McKinley was one of the nations top passers heading into the game after three straight yard passing game but a fierce Texas pass rush limited him to yards through the air on of passing and sacked him nine times for minus yards The Horns also picked him off twice and returned both for touchdowns Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Texas won the toss and deferred Houston drove to midfield and punted Sophomore Chris Simms got the start at quarterback for Texas but his firs t pass bounced off WR Montrell Flowers hands and was intercepted by Cougar F S Hanik Milligan at the UT The Longhorn defense held with LB Everick Raw ls getting a sack and Mike Clark tried a yard field goal but UT LB Tyrone Jones blocked it But the Horns couldnt move and had to punt Then the defense took over putting Texas on top to stay Redshirt freshman SS Dakar ai Pearson getting his first start in place of the injured Lee Jackson intercepted McKinleys pass down the middle and galloped yards untouched to put Texas on top with left Moments later Stockton got a gre at punt that went yards and was killed at the UH The Longhorn defense forced Houston to punt from the and TB Hodges Mitchell ran the kick back yards to the Applewhite came in at QB and backup TB Victor Ike got yards then more to the behind good line blocking But the Cougars swarmed Ike for a yard loss on the last play of the quarter The Cougars had a big statistical advantage for the quarter leading in first downs and in total offense but thanks to the blocked field goal and the defensive TD UT led SECOND QUARTER Applewhite fumbled the snap but recovered it for a yard loss He hit Mitchell for yards to the and Stockton kicked a yard field goal fo r a lead with left Pearson recovered a Cougar fumble a minute lat er at the Cougar and the Longhorns third TB Kenny Hayter got five yards in two tough runs then Applewhite hit freshman WR B J Johnson for yards to the UH A sreen pass to freshman WR Sloan Thomas lost to the but then Applewhite found Johnson again with a quick pass in the flat and he turned on the speed to the yard line Ike scored on the next play and Stocktons kick gave UT a lead with left The Longhorn defenders again forced a quick Houston punt but Applewhite threw an interception to give Houston another shot from midfield Simms came back in at QB on the ne xt series and played the remainder of the quarter At the half despite having three passes intercepted and having gained only yards the Longhorns wer e in control at Houston had only yards offensively THIRD QUARTER With Applewhite back at the controls Texas opened the second half by drivi ng yards to set up a yard Stockton field goal that raised UTs lead to with left A yard run by Mitchell and passes of and yar ds from Applewhite to WR Montrell Flowers did most of the damage on the drive The Cougars came right back with their only sustained drive of the game zipping from their own to the UT but DE Cory Redding sacked McKinley and he fumbled with Redding covering the loose ball That was the Cougars last scoring threat The Longhorns punted quickly but Jammers jarring tackle forced a fumble on the return and Ungar fell on it in the end zone f or another Texas TD and a lead with left Neither team threatened again in the quarter FOURTH QUARTER Applewhite hit Mitchell for and Flowers for on the Horns first possession then Mitchell ran yards to the Houston Hayter came in and got the TD to give Texas a advange with left On Houstons next possession UT LB O J McClintock intercepted McKinleys pass and returned it yards for a score and a lead with left Simms came back in and engineered the Horns final TD drive hitting passes of yards to backup TB Ivan Williams to Flowers and then the yard scoring pass to fullback Matt Trissel with left The Horns almost scored again in the final minute when Simms hit true freshman WR Sloan Thomas for yards to t he Cougar but Williams fumbled on the final play SUMMARY The Texas defense was a picture of consistency Saturday never allowing Houston to get anything going offensively The Cougars ran plays for yards in the first quarter plays for yards in the second period plays for yards in the third quarter and plays for yards in the fourth quarter The Texas offense started slowly running plays for one net yard in the first quarter getting plays for yards in the second period running plays for yards in the third quarter and wrapping up with an play yard final period UTOU Likely am Start The official announcement wont come until noon today but its pretty certain that the TexasOklahoma game will begin at am on Oct in Dall as and will be televised by ABC Computer Guru Nixes Horns Jeff Sagarin the MIT mathermatics graduate who rates football teams for several major publications currently

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday afternoon the Longhorns are improving in a lot of areas but still need to play better On defense our secondary has improved a lot he said Our young defensi ve ends are playing a lot better Last night was one of the few times that we didnt give up big plays in the passing game We had a good pass rush and the secondary did a good job Offensively we are starting to run it a little bit better but we are sti ll not running it like we need to he said I also think we are gaining a lo t of depth Our special teams last night were outstanding Brown said They were as good as they have been since we got here He said TB Hodges Mitchell was chosen as the offensive player of the game and FS Quentin Jammer whose hard tackle on a punt forced a fumble that resulting in a Texas touchdown was the defensive player of the game He said three players shared the honors for the special teams They were LB Tyrone Jones who blocked a field goal Jammer and walkon Michael Ungar w ho covered the fumbled punt Jammer caused for his first collegiate touchdown Brown said he was pleased the offense did score four of the five time it g ot in the red zone with the only failure being the one at the end of the game He also said some of the Longhorns young defensive players really came of age against Houston Brown said sophomore DE Cory Redding played by far his best game and he said redshirt freshman DT Marcus Tubbs had two of our nine sacks Were really excited about his quickness off the ball and his explosiveness He a nd redshirt freshman safety Dakarai Pearson were really pleasant surprises Asked about throwing deep in the final minute of the game Brown said It s really a hard decision when you look at it My job is to do whats best for our football team He said the two big factors to consider were that sophomore QB Chris Simms needed some confidence and Houston had just gone for a fourth and six at their yard line We had five freshmen in there at the end of the game and Chris hadnt had a lot of success I wasnt trying to run up the score but I have to do what s best for our team INJURY UPDATE Brown said the rash of injuries at defensive tackle has real ly cut into the teams depth AllBig Shaun Rogers suffered a sprained ankle on an illegal chop block and Brown said he wont have any idea how long Rogers will be out until he talks to the team doctors Monday

repair Safety Lee Jackson who missed the Houston game with a strained hamstring is expected back for Oklahoma State Freshman wide receiver Roy Williams also suffered a bruised arm early in th e Houston game but it did not appear to be an injury that would sideline him against Oklahoma State Junior offensive tackle Mike Williams sustained a bruised collarbone that sidelined him for the rest

goose eggs are hard to come by UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese It was Horns thats what were excited about The defense played great Offensively we withstood the early surge and moved the ball tetter in the second half Its hard to be consistent offensively in todays game because of all the blitzes I think our guys were so uptight to do well tha t they made some mistakes early in the game UT

like the Texas coaches He said Darryl Drake and Everett Withers were the two Texas coaches who recruited him and he said Withers the Texas secondary coach came to see him play in his second game this season He is a big fast corner with long arms but dont look for him to get many picks this year because he doesnt get many passes thrown his way because h e is so good at tight manforman coverage I went to Waco Friday night to see the Lions play Tyler Lee Waco LB Derric k Johnson scored one touchdown on an yard interception return and just generally wreaked havoc on Lees efforts to make a game of it Waco won and Johnson is as good a linebacker as I have seen in Texas recently He is or weighs around and he can really run He has the frame to carry pounds without losing any speed He says Texas is his No choice but he also says he probably will take a ll five official visits before making a decision Other schools in contention are AM FSU Oklahoma and UCLA but he says Id like to play pretty close to home so my friends and family could see m e play His teammate DT Sharod McGowan is listed in the program as being and He doesnt look that heavy but he is a dominating player too on occasion McGowan is very quick and might be better suited to playing DE at the colle ge levelHe doesnt play with the same intensity as Johnson but he can domina te a game when he plays all out FB James

womens softball team She said she will sign with Texas during the early signing period that begi ns in November In adding to pitching for her high school she was the ace pitcher last summer for the Katy Cruisers team that won the national title for the ASA andunder Gold Division which was the top national group At the ASA National Tournament in St Louis she struck out in innin gs and pitched one perfect game and one nohitter while going against the top high school seniors and college freshmen in the country Osterman pitched against the U S Olympic team last summer while playing f or the Katy Cruisers and struck out of the batters she faced while allowing just one hit in five innings The Cruisers were the only team to take the Olympic team to extra innings losing in eight innings The only other pitchers who struck out more Olympians were professional tea m pitchers who went seven full innings and none of them struck out more than Carol Adcock Ostermans coach at Cypress Springs said She could have go ne anywhere she wanted Every top softball program in the nation wanted her Adcock said Osterman compares favorably with former Longhorn AllAmerican a nd current Olympian Christa Williams at a comparable stage in their careers Cat doesnt throw quite as hard as Christa did in high school Adcock sai d but she has more movement on her pitches She is as dominating as any high school pitcher I have seen Osterman had a record last season at Cy Springs She gave up only one earned run during the season and had an ERA that looks like a misprint at Adcock said she struck out in innings last season averaging strikeouts per inning game Adcock said Her best pitch is a rise ball Its great but she also has a very good drop ball and a great curve UT softball coach Connie Clark cant comment on recruits until they sign b ut Osterman is clearly the kind of dominating pitcher she has been looking for since Williams skipped her senior season to play on the Olympic team Ostermans final five schools were Texas Stanford Washington Oklahoma an d UCLA She also is an outstanding student who ranks in the top in her class S he is dedicated too She was pitching to her dad in the family driveway when I called her Sunday at pm to confirm her commitment Top Pitcher Commits to UT Luis Cortez a hardthrowing righthanded pitcher with outstandi ng control has announced he will sign a baseball scholarship with the Longhor ns Cortez had a ERA at Sinton last year and he played with a top AAU team the Ohio Thunder this summer and went with one save and a ERA He was the youngest player on the Ohio Thunder and was one of only three players on the team with remaining high school eligibility His best pitches are a slider and a fast ball that has been clocked as high as miles per hour but is consistent in the mph area He also has a good curve and a changeup He averaged two strikeouts per inning at Sinton last season Cortez also is an outstanding student He makes straight As and is

Number October Part of Parts Longhorns Find Running Game Just in Time To Maul OSU in Big Opener OU Next Foe The Longhorns ran over around and through the Oklahoma State Cowboys and their No rated rushing defense Saturday en route to a victory befor e a sellout crowd in Austin The Cowboys while they hadnt played a good rushing team in their first three games had allowed only net yards rushing all season and they real ly do have a pretty salty front seven Led by sophomore Kenny Hayters yards the Longhorns had net yards rushing It was the first time Texas has has net rushing yards in a gam e since the thumping of Texas Tech last season In the six games they played between Texas Tech and Oklahoma State when the y couldnt reach the century mark in rushing its no coincidence that they w on just twice But they utilized a new gapblocking technique to combat the Cowboys stunting defense and it worked to near perfection because Hayter who was a little used thirdteam tailback turned a lot of little holes into big ones with his hard running While the rebirth of the running game was the big overall story it didnt happen until the second half and UT had a shaky lead at that point Texas still might have lost the game without three crucial earlier developments a huge passing play a great defensive stand after still another special teams goof and a penalty against the Cowboys that wiped out a potentially gameturning interception The huge passing play of course was Major Applewhites yard passandr un connection with sensational freshman WR Roy Williams six minutes deep into the second half The Horns were holding a fragile lead at the time they were facing a thirdand and they had already had so many problems with their punting team that UT fans everywhere were simply hoping for a miracle first down After all coaches everywhere say the first five minutes of the second half is the most crucial period in a tight game and the first five minutes had been all Oklahoma State The Longhorns hadnt even made a first down since the intermission But they got a lot more than that Williams got past the Cowboy cornerback who was covering him and Applewhite looked left and drew the safety back toward the middle When he finally looked to the right and heaved the ball the only question was whether Williams could catch up to it because there are few people in college football who can catch the fleet freshman He did catching it on his fingertips and racing untouched the rest of the way That yard play gave Texas a lead and it was all downhill after that for the Longhorns But that play was a gamebreaker only because the Longhorn defense stopped t he Cowboys cold early in the second quarter when a fake punt lost yardage and put OSU in possession at the UT and because an interception of a Chris Simms pass and a long runback inside the UT was negated by a personal foul penalty against the Cowboys The defensive stand came on the series after a blocked UT punt set up OSUs only touchdown The Cowboys were leading and the Longhorns at that point hadnt generated enough offense to indicate they could fall farther behind The disallowed interception was a possible point swing because OSU might have scored with a firstandgoal inside the UT Instead the Horns kept the ball and continued a drive that ended in the field goal that opened the scoring Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Neither team threatened early but the Horns dodged a bullet on their secon d possession They started in good field possession but Simms threw an interception that was run back inside the UT before a personal foul against OSU negated the play and gave Texas a first down at the OSU Tex as couldnt move and Stockton kicked a yard field goal to put the Horns ahead with left OSU TB Reggie White broke loose for yards to the UT on the Cowboys next possession but the UT defense held and the Cowboys missed a chipshot field goal try Applewhite came in at QB for Texas UT led at the end of the quarter but the Longhorns had only o ne first down on the penalty that negated the long interception return and just yards of total offense compared to for OSU SECOND QUARTER The UT defense stopped OSU and forced a punt With Applewhite still in at QB sophomore RB Kenny Hayter got a first down on two tough runs then seni or TB Hodges Mitchell took a quick pitch around left end for yards But Applewhite was sacked and his thirddown pass to freshman WR B J Johnson was dropped That was unfortunate because it forced Stockton to punt the snap was high a defender got loose up the middle and the kick was blocked Stockton covered it at the UT and OSUs White scored in two plays galloping yard to the then bursting up the middle untouched for the score to put OSU ahead with left The next UT drive also came u p short but facing fourth and at their own the Horns went with a fake punt It was a disaster and Stockton was tackled for a twoyard loss But t he strong UT defense yielded only two yards in three plays and got the ball ba ck for the offense On his third try Applewhite got the Longhorns into the en d zone driving yards in seven plays Mitchell got the TD on a yard run but the big plays were Applewhites passes of yards to WR Montrell Flowers yards on thirdand to Johnson and yards to the to Williams Stocktons kick gave Texas a lead with left OSU got close enough to try a field goal as time expired but Ervis Hill blocked it UT outgained OSU to in the period THIRD QUARTER A combination of mishaps including a sack and a halfthedistance penalty left the Longhorns facing a third and from their own Visions of anoth er punting adventure were etched into the brains of Longhorns everywhere but Applewhite dropped back and found Williams breaking open between double coverage just past midfield He heaved it and the swift freshman caught it on his fingertips and raced untouched into the end zone to complete a yard touchdown play Stocktons kick put UT ahead with left Lindsay and White misfired on a handoff two plays later and UT LB DeAndre Lewis recovered for Texas at the Hayter powered to the to set up a firstandgoal He tried to go over the top but the Cowboys stopped him then the Horns were penalized back to the for a false start Hayter got three yards to the off right tackle but Applewhites pass on third down was knocked down and Stocktons yard field goal gave Texas a lead with left Applewhite hit redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis for yard s and another TD with left A twopoint conversion try failed leaving U P on top heading into the final period FOURTH QUARTER With Hayter making good gains and Applewhite hitting key passes the Longhorns drove yards to set up a yard Stockton FG and moved yards for a touchdown with Applewhite connecting with Flowers for the final yards Ivan Williams ran yards for the final score with seconds left Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorn offense had its best day of the season against Oklahoma State the defense did its usual fine job and the special teams with one notable exception were outstanding After reviewing the film its clear that it was the best performance wev e had offensively he said We scored points and we had no turnovers Th e offensive line had its best performance We were pleased with not only the offensive line but Roy Williams made so me great blocks too and Kenny Hayter made some tough runs He also said junior QB Major Applewhite who underwent offseason knee surgery played like the Major of old He made very very few mistakes The Major of old was very good He was the Big Offensive Newcomer of the Year as a redshirt freshman in and the CoOffensive Player of the Year as a sophomore in Applewhite and sophomore Chris Simms have been dividing time at QB and Sim ms started the OSU game but gave way to Applewhite late in the first quarter Applewhite completed of passes for yards and three touchdowns Simms who returned late in the game completed of passes for yards Brown said the defense continues to swarm and play really well Casey Hampton is amazing and D D Lewis had an outstanding day Quentin Jammer a nd Rod Babers played really well We had another blocked kick thats our th in games here I thought it was Tyrone Jones but it was Ervis Hill who blocked the field goal Its interesting that our two best kick blockers ar e both from Texas City The special teams played well Brown said except for having another punt blocked and he said that is something that simply has to be fixed The two blocked punts this year have been in different areas he said b ut we have to get it fixed We cant keep getting punts blocked He said the UTOU game was such a big game or years ago that the feeling was that the team that won this game had a chance to win the nation al championship He said he and OU coach Bob Stoops are trying to get back t o that INJURY UPDATE Brown said SS Lee Jackson suited out against Oklahoma State and should be ready to play against Oklahoma He said DT Shaun Rogers sprained ankle is questionable for the OU game We should know more abou t Shaun Tuesday he said LB O J McClintock also missed the OSU game bruised knee but he should be back this week BLOCKING QUARTERBACK NOTES The big change in the UT running game was basically one new play a counter with an off side guard pulling and the linemen blocking down on the play side The QB also handed off at least par t of the time on one side and the back veered to the other side for a little bit of misdirection Major Applewhites knee has been one of he major no pun intended reasons the coaches have tried to use Chris Simms so much in the early games Applewhite still isnt but hes getting closer every week In fact he looked pretty close to Saturday Thats just in time because the Sooners look pretty potent and the Horns need to have two top quarterbacks ready to go Baseball Recruiting Going Great The UT baseball coaches got a commitment last week from righthanded pitch er Donald Lavinski of Class AA state champion Weimar giving them pledges from two of the states big three pitching recruits They also got a pledge from catcher Curtis Thigpen of Forney Round Rocks Joey Guajardo another righthander committed several months ago The third member of the big three pitching group is David Purcey a lefthander from Dallas Trinity Christian He is considering Texas AM and OU Purcey was at Trinity Christian the last two years and his team won backtoback state TAPPS championships He also helped his team win a stat e TAPPS title in basketball last year He had strikeouts in innin gs last year Lavinski was last year with an outstanding ERA His fast ball has been clocked as high as miles per hour and he is consistently in the mph range He also has great command of a sinking fast ball and a change up He struck out batters in innings last year while issuing about walks and giving up about hits He said he also had scholarship offers from Texas AM Baylor Rice Housto n and Oklahoma State Thigpen is an outstanding defensive catcher but he also wields a potent ba t bashing opposing pitchers for a batting average last season He also considered Alabama Baylor and AM Lavinski Thigpen and Pursey all visited Texas the September weekend along with shortstop Michael Holloman of Dallas Jesuit Holloman said he is considering Texas and Stanford He visited Texas earlie r and took his official trip to Stanford last weekend Horns Rise in Polls The Longhorns are No in this weeks Associated Press poll and No in the ESPNUSA Today coaches poll Oklahoma this weeks opponent is No in the AP poll and No in the coaches

ripped some holes I had a lot of expectation s when I came here but I was a little too careless with the ball The last couple of weeks the coaches have told me I had a chance to play a lot more

Saturday in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas to battle for the leadership in the Big s Southern Division The Sooners are and ranked No in the Associated Press poll The Longhorns are and are No in the AP voting OU has six offensive and seven defensive starters back from last years team Oklahoma opened the season with a rout of TexasEl Paso then wallope d Arkansas State hammered Rice and opened Big play Saturday with a win over Kansas Texas leads the alltime series and has a threeyear winning streak In fact Texas dominated Oklahoma in the s going But coach Bob Stoops in his second year as the Sooners head man has OU humming along with an undefeated record and big ambitions Behind his allout passing attack the Sooners jumped out to a quick lead over the Longhorns last season before UT defense coordinator Carl Rees e changed his blitz packages and started getting enough pressure on QB Josh Heupel to put the brakes on the OU offense and allow Texas to rally for a win But it will be tougher this year because the Sooners of had no running threat at all They are rushing the ball much better this season which kee ps some of the pressure of Heupel The Longhorn defense should be able to pressure Heupel and corral the Soone r backs if the Texas offense shows up early The Longhorn offense hasnt done much in the first quarter of any of its games this year One field goal and very little yardage is all UT has garnered offensively this season But QB Major Applewhite who killed the Sooners last year with his clutch throws seems to be regaining his magic touch after offseason knee surgery and sophomore RB Kenny Hayter had his comingout party Saturday They keys to a Longhorn victory get a quick start on both sides of the ball pressure Heupel and make him throw before he wants to

Frenship Braden Johnson Euless Trinity Brian Carter The Woodlands Recruiting Roundup Brent Rawls of Shreveport Evangel the top QB prospect in Louisiana took his official visit to Texas last weekend I saw him going into the Texas dressing room after the game and he looks to be about as big as advertised He also appeared to be having a really good time His parents came to Austin with him which always is a good sign on an official visit Look for Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch or Rawls to commit to the Longhorns within the next week to days Nordgren is the most likely futu re Longhorn but it could be Rawls Actually its a great situation for the Longhorns because Nordgren is the top QB recruit in Texas and Rawls is the best one in Louisiana so either o ne would be a big catch The Longhorns are still at commitments They will sign between and players so there are six to nine spots left to fill I think most of those spots will be filled from a group of players consisting of Nordgren or Rawls FB James Buchanan of Sarasota Fla OLs Jami Hightower of Jacksonville and William Winston of Houston Madison DLs Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison and Kaelen Jakes of Placentia Cal DEs Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson and Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn LB Derrick Johnson of Waco S Dewayne Brandon of Temple Ath Joseph Addai o f Houston Sharpstown and the Galena Park North Shore duo of TE James Moses an d DELB Jonathon Jackson I think the Horns have at least shots at Nordgren Jakes Everett Hall Johnson Brandon and Addai Ill be surprised if they dont sign four or five players from that group Buchanan Hightower Winston Harris Jackson and Moses are all strongly considering Texas but they also are looking at a lot of other schools Texas really needs to sign Harris because he is a great defensive line prospect who really would be a great fit in defensive coordinator Carl Reeses attacking style This is a year when great offensive line prospects are plentiful but great defensive linemen are scarce and that is why Harris is such an important part of the Longhorn recruitizing puzzle There is a chance some other bigtime recruit will enter the picture but most of the remaining scholarships will go to players in one of the two groups above While big defensive line prospects are in short supply this year Ive already seen three juniors who will be bigtime recruits next year Ive written about them before but DTs Marco Martin of Mesquite and Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings are the rea l deal and so is DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands Leitko ca me to the Texas camp this summer I have seen Wright and Leitko play twice each and have seen Martin once an d also watched a lot of tape of him playing running back and in the defensive line Any college would take all three in a heartbeat if they were seniors The program at Hastings lists Wright as weighing close to pounds but h e looked more like a to pounder when I saw him play early this year against Galena Park North Shore He was a lot heavier last year but he has lost some weight and really is a great prospect While I havent seen them play I also have heard good things about some other big defensive line juniors including Damon Brown of Houston Washington Tully Jontzen of Keller and Jarre Rhodes of Dallas Lincoln who also is a tight end While were on the subject of juniors there is a great linebacker at Longview named Marvin Byrdsong He is weighs about and runs in the range Other super juniors include QBs Reggie McNeal of Lufkin and Vincent Young of Houston Madison RB Selvin Young of

October No WhatIffing in This One Sooners Turn Longhorns Every Which Way but Loose The Longhorns had their worst day during the Mack Brown era Saturday in Dallas and they picked a bad time to do it because unbeaten Oklahoma scored on its first six possessions and for good measure ran a pass back for a touchdown too en route to a victory The Sooners dominated the Longhorns offensively defensively and on special teams They even won the halftime when a Billy Simsled relay team beat an Eric Metcalfled relay team QB Josh Huepel passed the Longhorns to death and pound sophomore R B Quentin Griffin broke Oklahomas school scoring record and Longhorn fa ns hearts with six touchdowns In short it just wasnt a good day to be a Texas fan in the cold dam p Cotton Bowl or anywhere The loss dropped Texas to for the season and in the Big and gave the Sooners a big boost in their drive toward national and Big honors It also made this Saturdays game with Colorado in Boulder the biggest game of the year This is a season on the brink It could go up or down Remembe r that debacle with UCLA that started the slide in John Mackovics last year Brown is made of sterner stuff and I think he can get this team back on track But he has to do it in a hurry One thing Longhorn fans need to be very thankful about is that Heupel is a senior He was absolutely awesome Saturday and he probably will be the best allaround quarterback the Longhorns will face this year Here even more briefly than usual is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Oklahoma won the toss and deferred Texas took the ball and the Sooners go t the wind A falsestart penalty on the games second snap doomed that drive and forced a quick punt into the wind Kris Stockton got a good roll on the low kick to the OU Heupel hit four of five passes to cover the yards in six plays to give OU a lead with left TB Hodges Mitchell made a great run after catching Applewhites thirddown pass to pick up a UT first down but it was the only one in the first quarter On their second tr y the Sooners went yards in plays and ran the score to with left A holding penalty on the kickoff forced Texas to start frrom its Another threeandout series and punt out of the end zone gave the Sooners a short field at the UT They were on the move again at the UT when the period ended SECOND QUARTER The UT defense got a great leaping interception in the end zone from CB Quentin Jammer but it was disallowed and he was called for pass interferen ce instead giving OU a first down at the They scored on the next play for a lead with left Starting QB Major Applewhite almost connected wi th freshman WR Roy Williams for a yard completion but the officials ruled he lost the ball on the way down and it was ruled incomplete The Horns couldn t make a first down and J T Thatcher ran Stocktons punt back yards to t he UT A personal foul on the runback set them back to the but they scored in two plays for a lead with remaining Chris Simms came in at quarterback and hit Williams for a first down but a delayofgame penal ty negated it and Simms next pass was intercepted by OU LB Rocky Calmus who returned it for still another OU touchdown and a lead with remaining That brought Applewhite back in and he hit WR Montrell Flowers f or a nice gain on first down but an illegal motion penalty forced a punt The Sooners scored again giving them a lead with left At this point OUs offense had been so dominant that it had faced only seven first downs all day and had converted all of them Texas offense meanwhile had one first down The UT offense finally came to life driving yards in seven plays to leave OU on top with left Mitchell got the TD from seven yards out on a pass from Applewhite The Sooners were driving again when the half ended It was their only drive in the first half that did not result in a TD At the half OU led in first downs in rushing yardag e and in passing yardage THIRD QUARTER Texas finally forced OU to punt quickly to start the second half but Applewhite under a big rush threw an interception that was run back to th e UT OU scored in two plays for a lead just deep Simms came ba ck in at QB and played the rest of the way OU again drove deep into Texas territory but freshman DE Kalen Thorntons sack of Heupel forced the Soone rs to try a field goal and it went wide The Sooners next TD came after a fumble by WR Montrell Flowers at the UT That made the score with left Then Victor Ike probably the swiftest of all the Longhorns got loose on the kickoff and Sooner DB Michael Thompson caught him from behind at the OU It was an yard return But the Horns lost four yards on two plays and were facing thirdand at the OU when the quarter ended FOURTH QUARTER A pass interference penalty against OU gave Texas a first down at the Mitchell got five yards then backup TB Kenny Hayter took an outside toss f or the TD to make it with left OU came right back for its final T D driving yards primarily on runs by Griffin Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday he accepts the blame for the big loss to Oklahoma and he said the Longhorns have to bounce back because they still have a season to play and a lot of goals to accomplish if they play up to their capabilities After reviewing the film I still stand by what I said yesterday Brown said They outcoached us they outhustled us they outplayed us They totally dominated the game and when that happens it comes back to me It s my fault But he said the team still has a chance to repeat as the Big South champion Last year we were in the Big at this point Were at t he same spot as we were last season Asked if he thinks the team has a chance to rebound and win the title again he said no question about that Were far from out of anything We just h ad a poor poor performance yesterday in a game that was very important for us and our fans For me to just throw out the season because of that would be totally asinine He noted that Oklahoma after its loss to Texas last year beat Texas AM the following week and Stanford after giving up points to Texas last year won the Pac championship and Rose Bowl berth There is a lot of anger after a loss like this by our fans he said Wha t I will do this week is not look at the paper I wont watch TV or listen to the radio Ill be working hard all week trying to get us back on track He said he thought the Longhorns were ready to give a good performance against the Sooners but he said after three straight losses to Texas the Oklahoma players might have just been hungrier Our seniors had a chance to beat Oklahoma four straight times he said Some of them were crying Most of our younger players were in shock He said a loss like this one forces coaches to reevaluate everything We ll definitely go back and look very closely at everything were doing Well t ry to simplify things He said some of the Longhorn players played well but he said most of them played hard but didnt play well The defense had been playing so well for us he said It didnt even loo k like the same defense Part of it was OU QB Josh Heupel He played great We had a lot of mental mistakes Brown said We just played poorly and w ho knows why we played that poorly You guys will start looking at the things we should change The fans will start looking at the things we should change Ive got to look at things that I think will work Ive got to get them bac k on track Asked if he thinks there is a chance the team could fall apart because of t he loss to the Sooners Brown said This team wont fall apart Its a very young team with a lot of heart a lot of class Well go back to work to fi x things simplify things He said the key thing is for him to be truthful with his players this week about the things they did wrong the things they did right and the goals th e team still can accomplish This is a bad week to be going to Boulder he said noting that Colorado upset AM in College Station last week We wont ever forget this OU gam e but we still have goals to accomplish Were still in the race for the championship in our conference The players are embarrassed and I know Im embarrassed but weve got to pull back together and get back to work Weve got to go back and make sure we are fundamentally sound th Anniversary This is the final issue of my th year of publishing True Orange Next wee k will be the first issue of my th year While this is not a happy occasion because of the football game my first issue was after a Texas win over OU and UT is against the Sooners since True Orange began Thanks to all of you for your continued support True Orange Observations This was one of those games where a team has to figure out what went wrong try to correct it and then forget it because a game like this can be a cancer that ruins a season Remember UCLA and Mack Brown wont ask for my suggestions on this and Im sure he can figure it out for himself but if I were in his shoes here is what I would do rig ht now Give a royal chewing out to my players my assistants and myself becaus e this game was an embarrassment to all Longhorns Then I would say there are a lot of games left to play and this game needs to be put on the shelf and th e Colorado game should be the start of a new season for a team with a lot of goals left to accomplish Figure out the few things that have worked on offense and build future game plans around them By the same token Id figure out the plays that havent worked and quit using them The two upthegut plays the Horns used on their first two plays Saturday for zero yards have been unproductive all year Texas rarely has a running play outside the tackles but the sweeps usually work when they are tried Id also ditch that sideline pass that travels yards for a potential yard gain or an interception for a TD and start throwing downfield more often To open the game against Oklahoma State the Longhorns had a fouryard run and two pass completions on their first three plays and didnt pick up a first down Pick a QB and go with him Each QB has to be nervous knowing that if he throws an interception hell be jerked Quit being so predictable on offense Example when the Horns line up in a twoback offense and the tailback goes in motion Texas has passed or been sacked trying to pass of the time this season There has been one run by a UT fullback all year Brett Robins touchdown in mopup duty against OSU That formation invites an allout blitz If the run isnt going to be a big part of the offense go to the shotgu n with four wideouts as the basic formation It gives the quarterback a bette r chance to complete his passes as OU QB Josh Heupel demonstrated to near perfection Saturday Game Notes Oklahoma QB Josh Heupel one of the nations top passers had net yard s rushing Saturday which was more than the yards gained by the Longhorns leading ground gainer TB Hodges Mitchell This was the second most onesided game in the series trailing only the Oklahoma victory in in Texas leads the series The Sooners yards and first downs are both school records against the Longhorns This was the fifth most onesided defeat in Texas history The bottom are at Chicago UCLA Houston at Oklahoma Oklahoma at Kirksville at TCU at Vanderbilt Oklahoma Miami Baseball Team Starts Practice The Longhorn baseball begins fall practice Wednesday with lettermen back from last years team that qualified for the College World Series The team will practice through

right places at the right time Longhorn offensive coordinator Greg Davis They just whipped us They whipped us up front they whipped us at the linebacker level and they whipped us in the secondary You could put it a thousand different ways but we just got whipped UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese I feel honestly this is worse than UCLA in You dont come out against a big rival and get beat like that You feel bad getting dominated in every aspect of the game Texas defensive tackle Casey Hampton We didnt make plays Their quarterback did a great job but weve got to make plays It doesnt matter how good he throws the ball youve got to go up and knock it our or something You have to make plays and we didnt UT free safety Greg Brown We heard all week how good the Texas defense was but we knew we were a go od team too We werent going to take anything from them and our goal was to go right at them Thats what we did My getting the record was a byproduc t of our offensive performance as a whole Sooner running back Quentin Griffin after scoring a school record six touchdowns This was the worst buttkicking Ive ever been involved in OU was more emotional than us without question This is really bad To get manhandled by your rival it doesnt get any worse than this UT sophomore quarterback Chris Simms We took a lot away from this game last year We were up early and were playing good football at the start but things didnt go our way in the end We wanted to play four quarters today against a very good football team an d we did that for the most part OU quarterback Josh Heupel I was a little out of position but I knew what they were doing with their tendencies The guy looked at this receiver the entire way If he had looke d me off and gone the other way then I would have been in trouble But I too k a guess and I was right We had a great team effort today Everyone was on the same page When we work together you can see that we are a pretty good football team Sooner linebacker

storming into College Station and ending the Aggies game home winning streak last week And the Buffaloes get to play the host this week when Texas comes to milehigh Boulder for a pm game Saturday It will not be televised That sure got my attention said Texas coach Mack Brown College Station is a tough place for the visiting team Colorado coach Gary Barnett has had a tough year up to last week The Buffaloes opened the season with a loss to Colorado State then fell to Southern Cal Next up was Washington and the Huskies prevailed also by a score Powerful Kansas State pulled away in the second half for a victory After the KState loss Barnett threatened to strip the Buffalo decals off his players helmets if they didnt start playing better Barnett went with true freshman QB Craig Ochs all the way against AM and he came through big hitting of passes for yards and one touchdow n and running yards for another touchdown Sensational freshman RB Marcus Houston is out with an injury but Cortlen Johnson dented the tough Aggie defense for yards and a touchdown Saturda y WRs Javon Green and Roman Hollowell are swift and productive and TE Daniel Graham also is a threat Defensively the Buffs are led by a trio of returning linebacker starters headed by Jashon Sykes The Buffs return five offensive and six defensive starters from a team that went last year in Barnetts first season at the helm For the Longhorns to win the defense has to prove the Oklahoma game was a onetime disaster and go back to playing smashmouth defense It also has t o pressure Ochs into some freshman mistakes Offensively the Horns have to come out with their best shots early They havent scored an offensive TD all year and havent moved the ball at all i n some of their first quarters this season Unless the

Longhorns are almost through recruiting offensive linemen running backs linebackers and defensive backs They want to sign one QB one TE one or two WRs Wacos great LB Derrick Johnson who had tackles in his teams loss to power Tyler John Tyler about days ago super safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple and any other gre at prospect who wants to come They should be able to get a QB and TE and they might get one WR but probably wont be able to get two They lead for both Johnson and Brandon If things fall like they appear to be developing there will be at least fo ur spots left for defensive linemen and possibly more depending on whether t he coaches will sign players But right now it doesnt look like Texas will be able to sign a lot of top defensive linemen because the only ones who are leaning the Longhorns way are Jakes DE Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn DE Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson who might be better suited to playing TE Harris appears to be wide open If the Horns dont fill all their defensive line needs this recruiting season they should be able to next year because there is a much better gro up of the big guys who are juniors this year RECRUITING NOTES QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch visited the Texas practice Thursday and spent a lot of time after practice talking to head coach Mack Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis but he said he isnt ready to commit

players have all of those abilities But coach Jody Conradt who already had two outstanding recruits with all four of those traits landed two more last week for the Texas womens basketball team Kala Bowers of Woodward Okla and Jody Bell of Chestermere High School in Calgary Alberta Canada two stars who are so versatile that they have played point guard at times are the latest additions to Conradts recruiti ng class Bowers is a national top player who was one of just four high school underclassmen to be invited to try out for the junior national team She also considered Colorado North Carolina Stanford and Nebraska She averaged points and rebounds last season Her high school is for the last two seasons winning one Oklahoma stat e title and finishing as the runnerup to the state champion the other season Last year our point guard got hurt so Kala played point guard for us Woodward coach Kim Kramer said Shes so versatile she can play any position Bell averaged points and rebounds for Chestermere High School in Calgary She was a member of the Canadian junior national team She considered only warmweather schools and wound up picking Texas over Arizona State Chestermere coach Brian Utley said Bell is a player who can handle the ball like a guard run the floor and shoot the three Shes an insideoutsi de player with skills you normally dont see in a girl her size She has great allaround skills he said Texas got an outstanding playe r She really enjoyed her campus visit to Texas and really liked coach Conradt She said there were too many good things about Texas for her to go anywhere else Conradt also has commitments from forward Heather Schreiber of Windthorst the states hottest prospect and forward CoCo Reed of Houston Jersey Village Like Bowers and Bell they are fine ball handlers and shooters Schrieber and Bowers are both on at least one national top list Schrieb er has led her volleyball team to three straight state championships and alrea dy has been

Volume No October Longhorns Bounce Back Trample Buffaloes Behind Great Defense Solid Offense The Longhorns followed their worst game of the Mack Brown era with a great defensive effort and a solid offensive performance in a win over Colorado in Boulder Saturday afternoon The game really wasnt as close as the score indicates Texas outgained Colorado to and the Buffaloes ran only six plays in Texas end of the field all day The Buffs ran plays and they either gained nothing o r took a loss on of them The defense held Colorado to yards total offense in the first half and would have had a shutout except for a pair of fumbles that gave the Buffs a touchdown and set up their other score Texas is now for the year and in the Big Colorado fell to overall and in conference play This was a real gutcheck game for Texas after the whipping at the hands of Oklahoma the previous week and the Longhorns responded with their best defensive effort in terms of yardage yielded in years and their bes t rushing yardage total of the season The offense did struggle in the red zone and Hodges Mitchell who hadnt fumbled all year fumbled on a running play and a Colorado linebacker pick ed it up and returned it for a touchdown Mitchell also fumbled a punt to set up the other Colorado score But he ran for tough yards and scored the clinching touchdown on a pass from Major Applewhite who threw for three touchdowns and yards Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Colorado won the toss and took the ball Big mistake Texas got the wind an d the Buffs wound up playing deep in their own territory throughout the first half because the fierce Texas defense kept sacking freshman QB Craig Ochs a nd forcing turnovers That gave the Longhorn offense great field position wi th UTs first five possessions extending well into the second quarter starti ng at midfield or in Colorado territory Texas first drive started at the Buf f and got to the before Kris Stocktons attempt at a yard field goal sailed wide left Their next possession began at the CU and got to the before Applewhite fumbled and the Buffs recovered The third and final UT possession in the quarter started at the Texas and ended at the Colorado The Longhorns owned the statistics for the quarter leading in firs t downs and in total offense Colorado never crossed its yard line i n the entire period SECOND QUARTER The fourth Longhorn possession started at the Colorado and this time th e offense scored in two plays First Applewhite found true freshman WR B J Johnson streaking down the right sideline for yards to the Buffalo th en he hit his other true freshman receiver Roy Williams for the touchdown Williams outfought a Colorado defender for the ball and the score Stockton s kick gave Texas a lead only seconds deep in the quarter LB Everick Rawls intercepted Ochs pass on the first play after the kickoff and return ed it to the Colorado But the Horns couldnt move and Stocktons attempted yard field goal sailed wide right The Longhorns started their next possession at their own the worst field possession they had experie nced to this point and Applewhite hit Johnson for yards then found TE M ike Jones for more yards to the Colorado The Horns stalled at the Buff and Stockton booted a yard field goal to stretch UTs lead to with left Mitchell got loose on a yard punt return to the CU later i n the quarter Applewhite hit Johnson to the and Mitchell ran to the but a fumbled snap on a thirdand brought Stockton in to kick another yard FG to boost the lead to with left Colorado had nine possessions in the first half and had minus yardage on six of them The Buf fs had only yards at the half and just two first downs THIRD QUARTER The Longhorns were moving again to start the second half when disaster struck Mitchell was hit as he took a handoff and the ball came loose Colorado LB Jashon Sykes scooped it up and ran it back yards for a touchdown The kick was good and UTs lead was cut to with left Texas couldnt make a first down and the Buffs drove into Texas territory for the first time before punting to the UT The Horns had failed to scor e from pointblank range in the early going but they covered the yards in just five plays Mitchell got on a draw play then Applewhite threw an incompletion Mitchell bounced another draw play to the outside and ran yards to the Applewhite found Jones open again and hit him for yards to the CU Williams got a step on his defender and Applewhite hit him fo r the touchdown The Horns went for two and Williams who was well covered tipped the ball away from the defender and caught it as it came down to giv e the Horns a lead with left Redshirt freshman safety Dakarai Pearson intercepted Ochs long throw on the next play and ran it back to th e Colorado But the Horns couldnt make a first down and had to punt The UT defense forced a quick Colorado punt but Mitchell bobbled the ball at the UT and Colorado recovered A personal foul against Texas moved it to the and Colorado TB Cortlen Johnson who had been bottled up all day got outsi de the defenders and scored to cut the UT lead to with left At the end of the third quarter the Horns were clinging to a one touchdown lead despite having a edge in net yardage FOURTH QUARTER Neither team could mount a threat early in the quarter but Texas starting from its own with left finally put the game away and used up nearl y four minutes doing it Applewhite hit of passes for yards in the drive including a short pass to Mitchell on thirdand that he broke for a yard scoring jaunt That gave Texas a lead with left Neither team threatened again Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the victory at Colorado Saturday was on e of the best games weve had since weve been here Its a little disappointing that we didnt get the shutout because the defense played shutout football he said He said his young defensive ends played their best game as a group True freshman DE Kalen Thornton had two sacks and sophomore DE Cory Redding also had a sack Cory had his best game Brown said and Kalen is very mature He played really well yesterday and made some impact plays Brown also said QB Major Applewhite in his first game since being named th e starter played well He made some big plays for us He said DT Shaun Rogers who had missed two straight games with a sprained ankle played plays against Colorado and appears to be ready for fullti me duty again We need Shaun in there Brown said Hes just one of the premier footbal l players in America He said the team went back to the same basic offense it used during Ricky Williams Heisman Trophy year We were in twobacks a lot more than in oneback he said Its easier t o protect the passer with two backs When you are running the football th e safeties have to come in and get involved in the running game Then you can hit the tight end Then when they get concerned with the tight end that lets you get on with your receivers He said that was the reason TE Mike Jones was able to get open so easily Jones caught six passes for yards to lead the Longhorn receivers He al so became only the fourth tight end in school history to post a yard receiving day Brown said the UT offensive line had its best game of the year Our two tackles Mike Williams and Leonard Davis really played well he said Brown also said redshirt freshman OG Tillman Holloway who came in when Antwan KirkHughes was injured came in and was really physical He also said Major Applewhite remains the starting quarterback INJURY NOTES Brown said KirkHughes hurt his shoulder and is the only player who appears likely to miss any practice time this week He said DE Kalen Thornton who was hurt during the game is fine He got stepped on o r kicked but hes fine Colorado Game Notes Texas snapped its sixgame losing streak to Colorado The Longhorns last defeated the Buffaloes on Dec a triumph in the Bluebonnet Bowl The game Saturday also marked UTs first victory in Boulder since Sep t The victory also snapped a fivegame losing streak in games played away from Royal Memorial Stadium Texas improved to when recording more than yards of total offens e under Mack Brown The Longhorns improved to when outrushing their opponent during Browns tenure UT allowed only total yards which was its best defensive effort sinc e when New Mexico was held to yards offensively WRs B J Johnson and Roy Williams became the first true freshman receive r tandem to start for Texas since Mike Adams and Lovell Pinkney did so agains t Texas AM on Nov Williams set the Texas freshman singleseason touchdown record with his two scoring receptions in the contest yards Williams who has four scoring catches this season broke fellow teammate Artie Ellis and Lovell Pinkneys record of three The pair of touchdown receptions tied the UT freshman singlegame record held by Ellis Sept vs LouisianaLafayette Johnsons four receptions pushed his season total to and he moved into fourth place on UTs freshman singleseason receptions chart TE Mike Jones had a careerhigh six receptions for a careerbest yard s previous receptions for yards at Stanford Sept It is only the fourth time in school history that a tight end has posted at least receiving yards in a game and the first since Kerry Cash had seven receptions for yards on Nov at Texas Tech a span of games QB Major Applewhite threw for more than yards for a schoolrecord eighth time in his career previous by James Brown He also h ad at least three touchdown passes for the th time during his career including bowl games RB Hodges Mitchell had rushing yards and moved into th place on Texas alltime list Mitchell now has rushed for yards during his career Basketball Fan Jam All fans are invited to meet the Texas mens and womens basketball teams Saturday at the second annual

enough right now to beat the m Their defense gave us the worst field position in the first half that Ive ever seen Colorado head coach Gary Barnett When the ball is in the air you want to feel like its million dollars coming at you and you dont want to miss catching that million Texas freshman wide receiver Roy Williams who caught two touchdown pa sses and a point conversion pass Texas defense is very fast probably the fastest defense Ive played against all year Give them credit They played very well I played poorly and thats about all you can chalk it up to Colorado freshman quarterback Craig Ochs It was fun but it really doesnt matter how many I catch The big thing i s to win the ball game Texas tight end Mike Jones after catching six passes for yards They knew we were going to try to stop the run We just had to play tough from the beginning to the end UT sophomore defensive end Cory Redding Last week the OU game was embarrassing We worked hard all week in practice and came out trying our hardest We were just enjoying ourselves a nd having a good time It was a great team effort Each phase of our defense d id its job We just wanted to keep the pressure on Longhorn defensive

disaster in Dallas will damage UT recruiting But the week between the disaster and the victory over Colorado was one of the best of this recruiting season for the Longhorns The Texas coaches got commitments last week from a great JC punter the states best QB and one of the top DELB prospects in the country The latest Longhorn pledge is DELB Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn He actually plays quarterback and safety at Clarksville but Texas Nebraska Tennessee and Texas AM were all recruiting him primarily as a defensive en d He said he picked Texas because he was born in Texas and has always had a fondness for the state and for its state university I really enjoyed my official visit to Texas he said I just decided it was the place for me Hall was the th commitment for the Longhorns who also had picked up pledges last week from QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch and punter Brian Bradford of Trinity Valley JC Nordgren is easily the top protype passer in Texas and Bradford has been rated as the nations top JC punter by at least one recruiting service Nordgren chose Texas over LSU Tennessee and Colorado He also was recruit ed by most of the top programs but had narrowed his choices to those four schools He told me had had scholarship offers It was really a close call between Texas and LSU he said but I decided I wanted to play for the Longhorns Nordgren is a student who also is a highjumper and intermedia te hurdler in track He also starts for the basketball team It came down to a great list of schools Nordgren said but I felt at home at the UT campus Its a football program that I know I can help lead to a national championship Trinity Valley JC coach Chuck Langston says Bradford will punt in the NFL someday Hes the best one Ive ever been around Langston who played and later coached at Oklahoma said Hes better than any of the ones we ever had at OU when I was there He averages better than yards and he gets tremendous hang time in the second range which is really outstanding He really gets great height and great distance Langston said Bradford is our teams MVP Hes one of the those guys who turns the field over He really changes field position Bradford told me he has always wanted to play for the Longhorns He was a full qualifier out of Lufkin High School and said he will transfer to Texas in January so he can go through spring training with the Longhorns Bradford can be counted against last years class because he will enroll at midyear What I really like about Bradford is his emphasis on hang time I concentrate on kicking it high he said Id rather have a yarder with no return than a yarder that might be returned It obviously works out because he is averaging yards per kick and stil l getting close to five seconds hang time Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter Abe Robinson Jersey Village Alfio Randall Blinn JC Mike Garcia Galena Park Will Allen Cypress Falls Roman Reeves Livingston Terrance Young Longview Quarterback Matt Nordgren Dallas B Lynch Running Back Cedric Benson Midland Lee Anthony Johnson Jefferson Defensive End Eric Hall Clarksville Tenn Linebacker Yamil LeBron

Punter Brian Bradford Trinity Valley JC The Longhorns with commitments already will give at least three more and if things fall right at the end as many as six additional ones There are five players LB Derrick Johnson of Waco S Dewayne Brandon o f Temple DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal and DE Jonathan Jackson and TE James Moses both of Galena Park North Shore who strongly favor Texas But all of them are highly recruited national prospects and I would be mild ly surprised if the Horns signed all five of them Then there are four great players the Horns are still recruiting very hard DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison FB James Buchanon of Cardinal Mooney H S in Sarasota Fla and OLs William Winston of Houston Madison and Jami Hightower of Jacksonville Texas has a pretty good shot at Harris but the other three are not leaning UTs way at this time Harris had a great junior year I saw him play and he was awesome But he h as a sprained ankle that has hampered his performance this year When the ankle was well last summer he ran a weighing close to pounds Hes still a super prospect and one the Horns need desperately UT Basketball Women Start Practice The Texas womens basketball team had

Mercedes Williams Williams averaged points rebounds and steals per game in leadin g Westfield to a record and a berth in the state Class A finals She was on the AllState team and was the Houston Chronicles Player of the Year She is a strong physical presence in the paint and relishes the tough play around the basket She will provide much needed depth behind Stacy Stephens and Annissa Hastings at center for the Longhorns With the addition of Mercedes we now have five newcomers who immediately raise the overall talent level of our program Conradt said adding that a ll five players are considered among the very best players coming out of thei r respective states The other four signees are forward Kala Bowers of Woodward Okla the Oklahoma Player of the Ye ar Heather Schreiber of Windthorst the top player in Texas and a Parad e AllAmerican guardforward Coco Reed of Houston Jersey Village Canadian Junior National team player Jody Bell a forward from Chestermere High School in

Maxwell Invitational in Ardmore Okla last weekend shooting a over par to finish five strokes behind tourney champ Tulsa UT Basketball Recruits Honored Texas basketball coach Rick Barnes two recruits both ranked among the nations elite players at their positions Good national basketball ratings are hard to find but Student Sports Magazine recently came out with a ranking of the top players at each position for a national top overall Point guard T J Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge ranked No at his position and center Chris Wright of Redwater ranked No among the b ig guys in the middle Most rating services had Ford much higher but it is a great tribute to Wrights potential that he made the list of the top centers because he missed almost all of his senior year with a torn ACL that required surgery Fords Willowridge team also was ranked No in the nation by Student Sports and the Eagles were the topranked public school team Mouth of Wilson Va which gives scholarships and recruits all over the nation was ranked No but the Warriors are an allstar team with player s from several states and countries Ford also made the magazines man first team senior AllAmerican list which was surprising since he was rated only No in the pointguard category I suppose they have two gurus with different views of the point guards I g o along with the one who rated Ford as one of the top two point guards becaus e every other rating service I saw had him as one of the top two or three poi nt guards in the nation Evans Testing Pro Waters Junior Longhorns swingman Maurice Evans has declared himself eligible for June NBA draft Evans who led the Horns in scoring last year with a average has not hired an agent and can return to Texas for his senior season if he doesnt elect to turn pro While Evans is a fine college player he lacks great dribbling skills at th is point and probably wont be drafted He could benefit from another year und er coach Rick Barnes tutelage Horns Recruiting Top JC Guard The Longhorns are in the running for a top junior college combo guard Terrell Ross a point guard with fine shooting skills at Allegany JC i n Meadville Md visited UT three weeks ago and has narrowed his picks to Texas Mississippi State and Michigan State Tuesday is the deadline for signing letters of intent in basketball so he will sign with someone right away or his recruiting will drag on until he shows up on a college campus to start classes He led Allegany to a record and the National JC championship game He averaged only points a game for a loaded team that features four oth er Division I signees but he hit of his shots from the field and of his free throws He also is an outstanding defensive player and rebounder A True Orange Subscription Is The Gift You Can Give Every Year to Your

<24029828.1075857330608.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2000-10-23 04:34:00,True Orange October Part Scouting Baylor Texas hosts Baylor at am Saturday in a game that will be televised by the Fox Network The Bears have really struggled this season Their only victories are over North Texas State and South Florida They have been shut out in their last three games falling to Texas Tech AM and Nebraska Their other losses were to Minnesota and Iowa State The Bears had counted on former UT QB Greg Cicero to give them a good passi ng attack but he went down with a seasonending injury and they have had one of the least productive offenses in the country There are teams playing Division I football and Baylor ranks th in rushing th in passing th in total offense and th in scoring The Baylor defense is a little better but not much The Longhorns should be able to name their score in this one even if they do show up a little flat Heres how the teams compare statistically national rank in parenthesis Texas Baylor Offense Rushing Avg Passing Avg Total Off Avg Scoring Avg Defense Rushing Avg Passing Avg Total Def Avg Opp Scoring Avg UTs Bowl Outlook The Longhorns have to win their four remaining regular season games to have a chance to defend their Big Southern Division title and unless Oklahoma loses twice starting Saturday against Nebraska that wouldnt get them int o the league title game But a regular would guarantee them a good bowl game The Big champion is guaranteed a spot in one of the big four BCS bowls and the runnerup could wind up in one of the BCS bowls too The Cotton Bowl gets the second pick the Holiday Bowl in San Diego gets third choice and the Alamo Bowl gets the fourth pick By winning out Texas would be likely to wind up in either the Holiday Bowl or the Alamo Bowl If the Big lands two teams in the BCS bowls a Texas probably would wind up in San Diego If only one Big lands in the BCS bowls San Antonio is a more likely stopping spot for the bowl season If the Horns dont go they still will qualify for a bowl by beating Baylor Saturday and they will will go bowling somewhere Big Roundup The big game this week is in Norman where topranked and unbeaten Nebraska takes on undefeated and thirdranked Oklahoma Kansas State travels to Texas AM in another big game that will trim the li st of contenders for the two division titles to four The Wildcats and Aggies already have one loss in conference plays and a second would be fatal to their title hopes BIG STANDINGS SOUTHERN DIVISION Conference Season W L PF PA Pct W L PF PA Pct Oklahoma

a commitment so they are still at with a few slots left to fill One player who would fit one of those remaining spots very nicely safe ty Dewayne Brandon of Temple was one of the recruits who came to the TexasMissouri game Saturday The only other top recruits at the game were three who already are committe d to Texas CB Aaron Ross of Tyler John Tyler WRDB Brian Carter of the The Woodlands and DBLB Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity Ross and his Tyler Lions are having a fine season They are overall and in their district Ross is playing running back and wide receiver in addition to the defensive backfield He has scored one touchdown as a receiver and three as a running back He said only five passes have been thrown his way all year I intercepted one of them one was completed and I knocked the other three down he said The Longhorns will give five to seven more scholarships and most of them will be filled from a group of nine players They are Brandon LB Derrick Johnson of Waco DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal and DE Jonathan Jackson and TE James Moses both of Galena Park North Shore DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison Athlete Joseph Addai of Houston Sharpstown and OLs William Winston of Houston Madison and Jami Hightower of Jacksonville Super DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC is another possibility but he has some academic hurdles to clear The Longhorns are in good shape with Brandon Johnson Jakes Jackson and Moses They have as good a chance as anyone with Harris but the trouble there is that the Killeen Ellison star has a lengthy list of schools he is considering and he recently added Oklahoma to the mix and says he is wide open FB James Buchanon of Cardinal Mooney HS in Sarasota Fla is still considering Texas but he is a long shot RECRUITING NOTES Galena Park North Shore is and Jackson and Moses are having great years Moses doesnt get a lot of passes thrown his way but h e has very good hands good speed and he is a tremendous blocker Jackson wh o switched from linebacker to defensive end this year is an outstanding pass ru sher due to his speed and big frame Jacksons early college favorites give a strong indication hell be playing in Texas or Florida Hi s top five are Texas AM FSU Miami and Florida but Ill be surprised if both these bluechippers dont join former teammate Cory Redding at Texas Midland Lee star Cedric Benson isnt getting as many carries as he did la st season and hes running behind an all new and undersized line but hes sti ll lethal when he gets a chance He hit Abilene Cooper for yards and five touchdowns on carries Friday night in Midland in a key District A gam e Hes a Longhorn commitment and hes on everybodys national top list H e wont have the great statistics he had on last years state title team but he looks even bigger and faster this year Top Girls Basketball Stars Visit Coach Jody Conradt has already corraled a great recruiting class for her Longhorn womens basketball team but things could get even better because she got visits last weekend from the nations top junior and one of the states top three seniors The top junior is guardforward Ann Strother of Highlands Ranch Colorado and the top three Texas star is Niki Newton a forward from Crowley Strother is visiting several schools unofficially this year to decide which schools she wants to seriously consider next year Contadt already has commitments from two national top players Heather Schreiber of Windthorst and Kala Bowers of Woodward Okla They are the top prospects in their respective states Schreiber is rated as the nations No prospect and Bowers is ranked No by the All Star Girls Report a national rating service Horns Back in AP Rankings The Longhorns regained the top in the Associated Press rankings this wee k coming in at No They are No in the coaches poll That hasnt always been good news in recent years It seems like every time the Horns get a good ranking they get beat Is it complacency or overconfidence or just the fact they lose to a better team Im not sure but I do know thats why they havent finished in the t op since Theyve been in the top several times but they havent been able to stay there Kick Returns Picking Up Coach Mack Browns announced goal of improving the kick return teams this season is paying big dividends Victor Ike is No in the country in kickoff returns averaging yards on returns and Hodges Mitchell is No nationally in punt returns averaging yards on tries Unbeaten List Shrinking Only five Division teams still have perfect records and the list will shrink by at least one this weekend when No Nebraska and No Oklahoma meet The other teams with perfect records are No Virginia Tech No Clemson and No Texas Christian True Freshmen Will Start Tight end Brock Edwards will start against Baylor Saturday giving the Longhorns four true freshmen in the starting lineup Edwards joins defensive end Kalen Thornton who has started the last four games and wide receivers Roy Williams and B J Johnson who have started t he last two games Edwards was pressed into the starting lineup when Mike Jones the teams starting tight end suffered a lick on his knee early in the Missouri game Coach Mack Brown said Edwards did a good job against Missouri Two other redshirt freshmen have been starting Marcus Tubbs has been worki ng as the starter at defensive tackle while Shaun Rogers works his way back fr om an ankle sprain and Dakarai Pearson has won the starting free safety position Rogers is getting better each week and might reclaim his starting job this week Barring any late changes the Longhorns will start two seniors TB Hodges Mitchell and OT Leonard Davis four juniors QB Major Applewhite LT Mike Williams RG Antwan KirkHughes and C Matt Anderson two sophomores LG Derrick Dockery and FB Matt Trissel and the three true freshmen Williams Johnson and Edwards on offense Saturday Defensively they will start three seniors tackles Rogers and Casey Hampto n and SS Greg Brown four juniors LBs Everick Rawls D D Lewis and Everic k Rawls and CB Quentin Jammer two sophomores DE Cory Redding and CB Roderi ck Babers one redshirt freshman Pearson and one true freshman Thornton Baseball Stars Commit to UT The Longhorn baseball team got commitments from two more top recruits last week including a righthanded pitcher who has been clocked as high as m ph with his fast ball The pitcher is Kole Strayhorn of Shawnee Oklahoma who had offe rs from many schools but who picked Texas over Oklahoma Oklahoma State Cal StateFullerton and Baylor He was last year with a ERA He struck out in innings and said he gave up about walks and about hits He has been clocked as high as mph and he is consistent around He plays shortstop when he isnt pitching The only problem with Strayhorn is that pitchers who can hit mph and who have good control frequently wind up getting drafted so high that they get a lot of money to go pro immediately The other recruit is shortstop Seth Johnston of Boerne He also is the quarterback for Boernes football team Johnson hit last season and picked the Longhorns over Texas AM and Houston Simpler Is Better Coach Mack Brown says he thinks the Horns will fare better now that the coaches have simplified the offense Brown said he also thinks the twoback offense is better for Texas for several reasons He said having two backs behind the quarterback improves t he pass protection When teams rush eight defenders he said the five linemen the tight end a nd one running back are outnumbered When two backs are there he said there a re enough people to block everyone even in a maximum blitz It also is a better powerrunning formation because of the extra blocker h e said adding that success in the running game causes the other teams safeties to creep up to help stop the run which helps the passing game When you can run and pass it creates some problems for the defense he said We plan to keep working on being able to do both True freshman WR B J Johnson went along with the simplification idea whi le having some fun with the rerporters on hand Johnson said when he first got to Texas and heard the coaches talking about cover I didnt even know they had six coverages When someone asked him if he knew all the defensive coverages now he said I dont even know all the plays to tell you to truth You should see our playbook A True Orange Subscription Is The Gift You Can Get

will be televised by the Fox Network The Red Raiders are overall and in the Big with losses to Nebraska Kansas State and Texas AM Tech under new coach Mike Leach opened the season with a win over Ne w Mexico then whipped Utah State and North Texas before wrapping up the nonconference slate with a shutout of LousianaLafayette The Raiders fell at Texas AM to open league play Then they whitewashed Baylor before getting hammered by Nebraska Then they scared Kansas State in Manhattan before falling They outscored Kansas Saturday in Lawrence with sophomore QB Kliff Kingsbury hitting WR Derek Dorris for four touchdowns Leach is the guy who found Josh Heupel and lured him to Oklahoma last seaso n when he was the Sooners offensive coordinator The Sooners offensive success last year propeled him to the head job at Texas Tech and his offense is a pass first pass second and pass third offense just like the one the Sooners use The difference however is that there is only one Heupel But Kingsbury is very good Hes a sophomore who has thrown a nations leading passes th is year and who has hit of them He is No in the nation in total offense averaging yards per game One scary statistic is Texas Techs lofty No ranking in pass defense Th e Raiders are giving up only yards per game passing and they have intercepted passes If the Longhorns dont run any better than they have been running they wil l have to have some success throwing to have a chance to win One other worrisome thing is that Texas Tech is the second best team the Longhorns have played to this point Oklahoma with a record is the on ly other team the Horns have played with a winning record right now To win in Lubbock the Longhorns have to pressure Kingsbury and the offense and defense both have to remember to show up in the first quarter Heres how the teams compare statistically national rank in parenthesis Texas Texas Tech Offense Rushing Avg Passing Avg Total Off Avg Scoring Avg Defense Rushing Avg

lead Midland Lee past archrival Odessa Permian It was his sixth career yard game Benson has rushed for yards the th highest total ever for a Texas high school player and the best ever for one in the states highest classification He wont have the awesome stats he had last year yds TDs becaus e he is one of two offensive starters left from Lees great backtoback stat e championship teams but he looks even bigger and faster this year than he w as last year T J Mills Permians coach said My kids hit him and hit him and hit hi m but hes a load If you dont get a lot of hats on him on every play hell hurt you Don Shows the highly successful coach at West Monroe La had much the sa me thing to say after his team mauled Lee in an earlyseason game Lees lone TD came on a yard run by Benson and it came on the third pla y of the game Shows whose teams are since said We dont usuall y give up runs like that and we stopped him pretty good most of the time Bu t our game plan was to have a lot of people on him on every play and even then he made some tough tough yardage Hes a hard back to stop especial ly if he gets a little room Not much has changed in the last week The Longhorns are still waiting on several key players to make their decisions They will sign six to seven more players and several of the remaining scholarships are likely to go to S Dewayne Brandon of Temple LB Derrick Johnson of Waco DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal and DE Jonathan Jackson and TE James Moses both of Galena Park North Shore They fill the key requirements they like the Horns and the Horns like them The most important recruit remaining is super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison and others still considering Texas are Athletes Quan Cosby of Mar t and Joseph Addai of Houston Sharpstown and OLs William Winston of Houston Madison and Jami Hightower of Jacksonville Super DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC is still a possibility but he has some academic hurdles The Longhorns have as good a chance as anyone with Harris but he says he i s still considering six or seven schools and says he is wide open Harris said he came to the Missouri game Oct but got there late and didnt get to visit with the other recruits Harris said he had a good time and said Texas remains one of his top choices RECRUITING NOTES Fullback James Buchanon of Sarasota Fla picked Florida State over Texas and Boston College

opponents are dangerous and the Longhorn offense and defense will need to start their motors running a lot quicker or things could get rough down the stretch But this was Baylor a team that had been blanked for three straight games Even a slow start isnt fatal against the Bears LouisianaLafayette and Baylor are the two weakest teams the Horns have faced and UT trailed LaLa before coasting to an easy win Lets hope higher quality opponents motivate the Texas players to start competing better from the opening kickoff Texas offense gave Baylor a short field with an early fumble and it took the Bears less than two minutes to notch their first October TD this year But the offense warmed up and QB Major Applewhite threw for yards and t wo touchdowns and even scored on a quarterback sneak The Bears chose to double cover sensational freshman WR Roy Williams and h is classmate and buddy B J Johnson made them pay by hauling in nine passes for yards and a TD the best single game ever by a UT freshman But it was the Longhorn defense that set the tone for this game After that early lapse the Texas defense allowed Baylors offense only one more net yard for the remainder of this first half and forced two turnovers that led to Texas points Capitalizing on the short field created by the outstanding defensive effort the Longhorns kicked two early field goals then blew the game open with a point second quarter The Longhorn defenders forced five Baylor turnovers including four interceptions two by CB Quentin Jammer and one each by SS Greg Brown a nd backup FS Phillip Geiggar The defense also held Baylor to net yards passing and rushin g while the UT offense amassed yards total offense passing and rushing The defense forced Baylor into possessions of three downs or less The Bears only had possessions Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Baylor won the toss and deferred The Longhorns like they have all year struggled out of the starting gate They made two first downs but then blitzing Baylor DB Gary Baxter blindsided UT QB Major Applewhite and knocke d the ball loose The Bears recovered at the UT and scored in five plays with QB Guy Tomcheck hitting WR Martin Dossett for the final yards That put Baylor ahead with left Applewhite hit freshman TE Brock Edwards for yards on the Horns next possession to set up a yard fiel d goal by Kris Stockton that cut the Baylor lead to with left Starting from their own the Longhorns drove to the Baylor later in th e quarter primarily on the strength of a yard pass from Applewhite to freshman WR B J Johnson but the drive stalled and Stockton kicked a yard field goal to get the Horns back within one point at with left A bungled Baylor screen pass gave the Horns great field position in t he final minute of the quarter when RB Darrell Bush was ambushed by DE Cory Redding and fumbled with LB Everick Rawls recovering for a yard loss at the Baylor TB Hodges Mitchell carried three straight times for nine yards bringing up a fourthand at the Bear as the quarter ended Although they trailed the Horns had net yards offensively while Baylor had SECOND QUARTER Stockton kicked a yard field goal on the first play of the quarter to give the Horns a lead they would never relinquish at Baylor went threeplaysandout two straight times and after the second one the Longhorns finally found the end zone Applewhite hit Johnson for Brandon Healy for Mitchell for more and then Montrell Flowers for the final yards and the TD Stocktons kick gave Texas a lead with left After an exchange of punt UT safety Greg Brown intercepted Tomchecks pass at the Bear and returned it to the Applewhite hit Johnson to the then sneaked in for the TD Stocktons kick made it with left After another quick Baylor punt the Longhorns struck again Applewhite hit freshman WR Roy Williams for found Mitchell for more and then hit Johnson for yards and the TD Texas went for two points and Applewhite connected with Mitchell to make it with left At the half Texas had yards offensively to the Bears THIRD QUARTER Baylor got the ball first and drove to the Texas but a yard penalty and then sacks on successive plays by CB Quentin Jammer and redshirt freshm an DT Marcus Tubbs pushed the Bears back to near midfield and forced a punt Neither team mounted another drive until late in the period when Jammer got his second interception and ran it back to the Baylor A pass interferen ce penalty and an Applewhite pass to Johnson set up a yard Stockton FG to make it with left The Longhorns had yards at this point to Baylors FOURTH QUARTER Chris Simms relieved Applewhite at QB and had the Longhorns on the march at the Baylor before his pass into the right flat was picked off by Bear CB Eric Giddens who ran it back yards for Baylors final touchdown to cut the UT lead to with left Backup TBs Victor Ike and Kenny Hayt er alternated short runs and Simms went for for yards before Hayter got another UT touchdown on a oneyard plunge Stocktons kick gave Texas a lead with left The Longhorn backups scored again on their next possession driving yards in eight plays with Simms hitting freshman WR Sloan Thomas for yards and Ike getting the final yards for the touchdown on a fourthdown play Stocktons kick brought the final score to with left Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorns played really well defensively against Baylor but we just werent in sync on offense After viewing the game tapes he said the Longhorns are facing a tough fina l three regular season games and will have to play much better to have a chan ce to win For us to win the next three weeks we need to be more balanced Brown said We need to be able to run the ball He also said the Longhorns are more physical than they were early in the year but he said they need to be more physical particularly in being able to run the ball Baylor put a lot of guys around the line of scrimmage and made it harder f or us to run the ball he said But we still should have been more physical and we should have been able to run the ball The best thing we did offensively was pass protect he said The offensi ve line did a tremendous job of picking up all the blitzes He also praised tackles Leonard Davis and Mike Williams saying they are playing extremely well Running the ball successfully he said is an attitude When you take linemen the size of ours and keep pounding they the opposing linemen get tired Our staff has taken the position that were going to make the run work regardless of how many are stacked in there he said Well just hang in there and keep working at it Brown said the coaches decided to play freshman DT Adam Doiron because Shau n Rogers is still hampered by a sprained ankle Ryan Haywood is out for the year with a shoulder injury and Stevie Lee might be out for the year with a n ankle injury Asked how Doiron played he said He played really well He was in there f or plays and he had four tackles and he got in the right place on just abo ut every play I think he has a chance to be a real good player Brown said Doiron has wanted to play all year Well get a minimum of five games from him Sometimes you have to play some freshmen when you have injuries It was at about this time last year that we started playing Bo Scaife Playing Scaife from midseason on last year worked out well because he suffered a torn ACL during twoaday workouts He was lost for this season which will be counted as his redshirt year making him a sophomore in eligibility again next season True freshman TE Brock Edwards got his first start because Mike Jones is ou t for the year with a torn ACL Brown said I thought Brock did a really goo d job for his first game to start He dropped his first ball but then made a great catch in the corner and ran well after he caught it Brown said redshirt freshman DT Marcus Tubbs played his best game Tubbs has been starting while Shaun Rogers has been limited with a sprained ankle He had a sack and three tackles for losses Saturday Doiron Ninth True Freshman to Play Defensive tackle Adam Doiron played Saturday against Baylor and he is the ninth true freshman to see action this year Four true freshmen are starting They are tight end Brock Edwards defensiv e end Kalen Thornton and wide receivers Roy Williams and B J Johnson CB Nathan Vasher has started when the Longhorns open with a nickel defense five defensive backs Other true freshman who have played are defensive tackle Stevie Lee safety Phillip Geiggar and wide receive Sloan Thomas Coach Mack Brown said he probably will redshirt the remainder of the freshm an class Fullback Will Matthews has been impressive on the scout team and probably would have played this season but he was bothered by severe headaches duri ng the early drills and that set him back Other freshmen who are redshirting but who are drawing praise from the starters for their work on the scout teams are QB Chance Mock RB Sneezy Beltran WR Tony Jeffery OT Lionel Garr and LB Austin Sendlein The current UT freshman class was rated as high as No in the country by the various recruiting services and it came on the heels of a class that was a runaway choice as the best class in the country The class was headed by Cory Redding and Chris Simms the USA Today defensive and offensive players of the year That was a great class and it is living up to its press clippings Redding is starting TE Bo Scaife was to start before his knee injury OGs Derrick Dockery and Tillman Holloway have started CB Roderick Babers is a starter and so is safety Dakarai Pearson DT Marcus Tubbs also has started But I think the current freshman class is even better with four players starting as true freshmen and several more playing key roles Williams already holds the yardage record for Longhorn freshmen receivers and Johnson is third and holds the freshman single game yardage record They are the two best freshmen wide receivers I have ever seen and Thomas and Jeffery make it a great foursome because they are outstanding receivers too The Longhorns will be a lot better next year than they are this year becaus e all of those top freshmen and sophomores will be a year older and will have one more year of experience But just think how good they will be when those two classes are juniors and seniors and are backed up by the outstanding class the coaches are recruiti ng right now and the one they will get next year Injury Update Offensive guard Antwan KirkHughes was held out of the Baylor game to give his sore shoulder a rest and he probably will be able to play at Texas Tec h Saturday The knee injury TE Mike Jones suffered turned out to be a torn ACL so he will undergo surgery and will be out for the rest of the season That leaves freshman Brock Edwards as the only healthy tight end Fullback Cha d Stevens a former tight end has been working at both positions Safety Lee Jackson suffered a leg injury in the Baylor game and is questionable for Saturday Freshman defensive tackle Stevie Lee who underwent foot surgery to repair a broken bone about a month ago is due to be examined again this week to see if he can return this season Lee is eligible for a medical redshirt year if he is unable to play again this season Redshirt freshman wide receiver Artie Ellis is having problems with the sam e shin injury that hampered him during spring practice He had a stress fracture then and the same shin is sore again He is not expected to play at Tech Others who are likely to miss the Tech game are outside linebacker O J McClintock sprained knee and defensive tackle Ryan Haywood shoulder injury The True Orange FaxEMail

advantage of some matchups An offense has to have the ability to win both ways running or throwing That took away som e of their blitzes We also wanted to change the tempo We werent pleased wi th the tempo to start the game UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis explaining why the Longhorns went primarily with the passing game out of the shotgun formation I thought we played good after that early touchdown Thank goodness we didnt play for a shutout Our kids came out and played hard They made som e plays that changed field position UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese I have to give Texas credit They have a very good defensive team We had a pretty broad selection of formations and plays but we never really got in sync and Texas had a lot to do with that Baylor head coach Kevin Steele You dont come out and try to set records It just happens Setting record s isnt important I just want to win UT WR B J Johnson who caught nine passes for yards the best da y ever for a Longhorn freshman receiver Gary Baxter is a great cornerback and they tried to do some things on the weak side with him pressing Roy Williams and a safety helping out over th e top That freed B J to get a oneonone matchup and he took advantage of it Texas receivers coach Darryl Drake discussing how the Bears tried to put the clamps on one of the Longhorns outstanding freshmen wide receivers on ly to see another one have a record day It was pretty tough out there Baxter is a tough corner and they had a safety helping out a lot Roy Williams UTs freshman receiver who still managed to catch three passes for yards and run his season receiving yardage total to yards the best ever for a Longhorn freshman Its an honor but its a team award The thing I was disappointed in toda y is that we werent sharp to

November Mitchell Stockton Defense Lead Longhorns Past Raiders Applewhite Hurts Other Knee It was a game of surges weather wise and on the football field Saturday night in Lubbock and Texas triumphed because the Longhorns had two surges and Texas Tech had only one The Longhorns dominated the first quarter an d most of the second in cold rainy soldout Jones Stadium coming out smoking offensively for the first time all season Midway through the second quarter Texas was ahead and seemingly on the way to an easy win But Texas Tech scored points before intermission then scored again early in the second half to take a lead Despite losing QB Major Applewhite to a knee injury the right one not the surgically repaired left one the Longhorns roared back to score the game s final points to claim the victory and stay alive in the Big title cha se Coach Mack Brown said an MRI was done on Applewhites knee Sunday and he hopes to know the results sometime Monday He said he is hoping it is just a sprain The Longhorn heroes were plentiful Offensively the entire line played great TB Hodges Mitchell was tremendous and Kris Stockton booted five fiel d goals and narrowly missed on a yard attempt late in the first half Mitchell had carries for yards and scored both Longhorn touchdowns He also caught six passes for yards Defensively the Horns forced five turnovers which the offense converted into points and shut the Raider offense out for the final minutes The victory gave Texas a season record and Big mark while Tech fell to overall and in the Big If Texas AM upsets Oklahoma this weekend the Longhorns can tie the Sooner s for the Big South title by beating Kansas and AM to close the regular season By virtue of their win over the Horns the Sooners would represent the Sout h in the title game but the tie and a record would land the Longhorns in a top bowl game The Longhorns have won four games in a row after a slow start this season Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER The Longhorns moved the ball all over the field in the first quarter and to ok a lead They got the ball first and drove yards to the Tech with Mitchell getting all of the yardage on six tough runs behind good blocking and a yard pass reception But the drive stalled and Stockton kicked a yard field goal for a lead with left Tech went three plays an d out and Mitchell led another Longhorn drive that went yards for a touchdown and a lead with left He carried four times for yard s including a yard burst over right tackle for the TD Applewhite also hit freshman TE Brock Edwards for yards during the drive With the aid of tw o penalties against UT the Raiders drove to the Texas and QB Kliff Kingsbury hit WR Tim Baker at the but Baker fumbled and the Horns recovered and were on the move again when the quarter ended SECOND QUARTER The drive that started at the Texas stalled at the TT but Stocktons yard field goal gave UT a leadwith left UT safety Greg Brown s interception of a long Kingsbury pass killed Techs next effort but Texas couldnt move and punted for the first time Kingsbury operating out of th e shotgun bobbled a low snap and UT CB Ahmad Brooks fell on the loose ball a t the Raiders The Horns picked up a first down at the but Mitchell wa s stopped for no gain and two passes were incomplete so Stockton kicked a yard field goal for a lead with left But the Raiders came rig ht back and Kingsbury hit WR Carlos Francis for a yard touchdown strike tha t cut the UT lead to with remaining Texas had to punt and Tech aided by a pass interference penalty drove to the UT before settling fo r a yard field goal to cut the deficit to with left Applewhite was sacked and fumbled on UTs next possession giving the Raiders great field position at the Texas But the Longhorn defense held and a yard field goal try fell short UT drove to the Tech but Stocktons yard field goal try just missed to the left in the final seconds of the half THIRD QUARTER Tech got the ball to start the half but couldnt mount a drive But Applewhites pass was picked off by Tech DB John Norman who ran it back t o the UT Kingsbury got yards on a QB draw which was the longest Raide r run of the game and Ricky Williams went over the top for the final yard T he extra point put Tech on top with left But that lead was shor t lived Starting from their the Longhorns drove to the Tech before Applewhite was sacked on a thirddown play He came up limping and never returned to the game Stockton booted a yard field goal to put Texas bac k on top with left The Raiders went three plays and out and so did the Longhorns but Stocktons punt was fumbled at the Tech and Micha el Ungar recovered for the Horns Behind great blocking Mitchell ran for then for the final and the TD that gave Texas a little breathing room at with left The Raiders were driving as the quarter ended FOURTH QUARTER DE Cole Pittman sacked Kingsbury on the first play of the quarter and CB Roderick Babers intercepted Kingsburys pass two plays later and ran it bac k yards to the Tech Mitchell carried fiv e times fror yards and Simms under a big rush found Johnson for yards But a penalty set the Horns back and Stockton came in to boot his fifth field goal a yarder to put the Horns on top with left The Raiders killed most of the clock with a long drive that came up empty They drove from their own to the UT so slowly and laboriously that the clock ran from to by the time their fourthdown pass sailed incomplete The drive would have end ed much earlier but for two strange penalties against the Horns One was a la te offside call after UT recovered a fumble and the other was a personal foul on UT DE Cory Redding after he sacked Kingsbury The officials said the foul w as a blow to the head but Redding didnt appear to hit him in the head At an y rate after the fourthdown play failed Mitchell carried six straight time s for yards and two first downs to run out the rest of the clock Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday QB Major Applewhites knee injury Saturday nig ht does not appear to be as serious as the one he suffered in the Cotton Bowl game against Arkansas The injury to Applewhites left knee in the Cotton Bowl required surgery to repair a torn ACL anterier cruciate ligament Brown said the injury to his right knee Saturday in Lubbock might be just a sprain Im not a doctor so I dont know he said Were having an MRI done today and well know more tomorrow But Applewhite had to be taken off the field on a stretcher in the Cotton Bowl and he was standing on the sideline with Brown at the end of the Texas Tech game We were standing on the sideline at the end of the game Brown said He walked off the field with me He was upbeat and excited about the game It sure didnt look like what happened to him in the Arkansas game He said Chris Simms played well in relief and he said the fact that Simms played as much as he did early this season is a big plus if Applewhites injury turns out to be serious Chris progresses every time he walks out on the field Brown said He pu t a tremendous amount of pressure on himself early in the season I felt like last night was the most comfortable he has been There is no doubt in our minds that Chris is more ready to play now than h e was at the first of the season Brown said Simms threw only two passes and he completed both of them As he said my main job was pitching to Hodges left and pitching to Hodges right With Hodges Mitchell rushing for yards and carries both career high s and the line opening huge holes that was the Longhorn offense for most of the night Brown also said he probably wouldnt take the redshirt off freshman QB Chan ce Mock if Applewhites injury is serious Well talk about that Id think right now wed play Beau Trahan Brown said freshman TE Brock Edwards played really well and he said DT Casey Hampton DEs Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton LB DeAndre Lewis and D Bs Quentin Jammer Rod Babers and Greg Brown played well too He said LB Tyro ne Jones had by far his best game He also said the offensive line played great and Hodges did a great job of picking his holes Weve shown the ability in the last four games to throw it or run it We couldnt do that earlier in the year Brown said the five Tech turnovers were a great credit to the UT defense a nd he said Im really proud of the offense to with four minutes left take it and drive it on the ground and run out the clock Ive alway said you need to be able to run the ball in the fourth quarter to win Owens Thomas Lead Horns Junior forward Chris Owens had points and rebounds and freshm an forward James Thomas had points and nine rebounds to lead the Longhorn basketball team to a exhibition victory over Team Ezybonds of Austral ia before fans at the Frank Erwin Center Sunday night I think for

Then they defeated Missouri and Colorado before dropping a game to Texas Tech and then getting hammered by Nebraska The Jayhawks have a unique offense QB Dylen Smith is one of the rare quarterbacks who feels just as comfortable running the option or dropping back into a fourwide receiver set He is and fast and shifty Texas coach Mack Brown says Smith is a really athletic quarterback who has a great arm and who can make plays with his arm or his quick feet He also says RB David Winbush is the leading rusher in Kansas history and thats a school that has had Gale Sayers and John Riggins of Chicago Bears and Washington Redskins fame respectively WR Harrison Hill is one of the best in the league Defensively nose tackle Nate Dwyer is the anchor in the middle of the line and LBs Chaz Murphy and Andrew LeClair are big run stoppers The Jayhawks are giving up more yards than they are gaining which is never a good sign but they have been impressive at times particularly when they a re playing at home The Longhorns are a point favorite but this is a dangerous road game because Kansas has to beat Texas and then Iowa State next week to qualify f or a bowl game To win the Horns need to start quickly like they did in Lubbock and the defense needs to pressure Smith and keep Winbush under control If Major Applewhites knee injury turns out to be serious they also need t o have a balanced offense to keep all the pressure from falling on Chris Simm s inexperienced shoulders They also need to score more touchdowns than field goals when they get inside the Heres how the teams

Dallas Carter created quite a stir last week when he was quoted in the Dallas News as saying he remains committed to Texas but might take a visit or two just to be sure of his commitment Texas coach Mack Brown generally sees a commitment as being binding on both parties He tells recruits when they are ready to commit that UT will guarantee them scholarships and they are supposed to guarantee they will honor their commitments and refrain from visiting other schools Scott has talked off an on about visiting other schools but he hasnt set up any visits yet Ill keep you posted if he does QBAthlete Kendal Briles of Wollforth Frenship another UT pledge says Nebraska continues to recruit him but he says he is solid for the Longhorn s Central Texas normally doesnt have very many top recruits but four of bes t in the state and in the nation his year are in Central Texas and three of them play in District A which stretches from Waco in the north to Georgetown in the south Those four recruits will go a long ways toward determining whether the Longhorns have a great recruiting class or just a very good one The A players are DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison LB Derrick Johns on of Waco and DB Dewayne Brandon of Temple The other top prospect is QBAthlete Quan Cosby of Mart who led his team t o a record and a Class A state title last year Texas is recruiting all four of them and has the lead with Johnson Brandon and Cosby Harris has favored Texas when he lists a preference but he has been more noncommital about his college choice recently Texas has a good chance to get all four of them and that would really put t he icing on an already outstanding recruiting class Student Sports magazine currently has UT ranked No behind Michigan in th e national recruiting rankings If the Horns get three or four of those Central Texans I mentioned earlier they will have a great shot at the top spot And for those of you who have expressed concern that the Longhorns twolos s season could pose a problem Michigan has three losses already A seaso n at this point is a very good year to sell to recruits I still expect the Longhorns to sign or kids With already committed that leaves room for only six or seven more players In addition to the obvious recruiting targets I have been writing about recently there are two super prospects in Louisiana who are talking about taking official visits to Texas the weekend of the TexasTexas AM game They are DT Marquise Hill of New Orleans De La Salle and TE Marcus Spears of Baton Rouge Southern Lab The two Louisiana prospects and DL Kaelen Jakes of Valenci a Cal are the only outofstate prospects on the Longhorn radar screen at this time UT has a very good shot at Jakes Hill and Spears are long shots A True Orange Subscription Is The

November Mitchell SimmstoWilliams Combination Way Too Much For Jayhawks Aggies Next Kansas came out smoking in damp freezing Lawrence Saturday taking a lead over Texas before the sparse crowd had time to settle down but the Longhorns came storming back for an easy victory Senior TB Hodges Mitchell broke the UT and Big records for allpurpose yardage in a single game He had yards rushing yards in receptions and yards in punt returns for total yards He also scored two touchdowns But sophomore QB Chris Simms subbing for the injured Major Applewhite and sensational freshman WR Roy Williams also were huge offensive guns for the Longhorns Simms passed for yards and two touchdowns and Williams caught four of h is passes for yards and both touchdowns all in the first half Willia ms also added a yard touchdown on a new play an end around Williams a true freshman already held the season record in reception yardage and in touchdowns for freshmen Kansas coach Terry Allen said his defense was able to hold Mitchells production down early but then we had to doublecover Williams and that opened some running lanes When this UT offense is clicking its hard for a defense to stop because Mitchell just needs a little crease to be productive and he gets those creases regularly when Williams draws double coverage It takes a brave or foolhardy coach to consistently single cover Williams a pounder with awesome speed and leaping ability The victory gave Texas an season record and Big mark heading into an open week and then the big regular season finale the day after Thanksgiving against Texas AM The Longhorns have won five games in a row after a start Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER The Longhorns started fearfully slow offensively and defensively Texas got the ball first couldnt make a first down and punted quickly Kansas score d in three plays with WR Derick Mills going the final yards on a reverse to give the Jayhawks a lead with left On the fourth play after the kickoff Simms pass in the left flat was picked off and returned yards for a touchdown by KU CB Andrew Davison That put the Jayhawks on top with left The Longhorns finally got something going on their third possession driving from their own to a first down at the Kansas but they stalled and Kris Stockton kicked a yard field goal to cut the defic it to with left Longhorn LB DeAndre Lewis pounced on a Kansas fumb le four plays later to set the Longhorn s up at the Jayhawk Simms hit Williams behind Davison for a touchdown on the first play to cut the Kansas lead to with left The Longhorns decided to go for a point conversion but it backfired when Simms under pressure threw into the end zone and Kansas safety Carl Nesmith picked it off and returned it plus yards for two point for the Jayhawks and a lead Huge Longhorn OT Leonard Davis showed a lot of heart on that play chasing Nesmith all the w ay down the sideline But that was the last highlight for the Jayhawks They h ad to punt from their own and the punter shanked it to the KU With the Jayhawks now aware of Williams and his longdistance threat Mitchell ran f or then more and then for the TD Stocktons kick tied it at wi th seconds left SECOND QUARTER The Texas defense forced the Jayhawks to punt quickly and Williams got behi nd Davison again on the first play and Simms hit him for a yard touchdown play Stocktons kick put UT on top for the first time only seconds deep in the quarter Mitchell set up the Horns next touchdown with a yard punt return to the Kansas Simms scrambled for four yards then hit Williams again to the Jayhawk Mitchell scored on the next play for a left with second left in the half Texas had a edge in yardage and a advantage in first downs THIRD QUARTER Kansas had a good drive to open the second half but redshirt freshman safe ty Dakarai Pearson stopped it with an interception at the UT Later in the period Williams scored on a yard end around to give Texas a lead with left Mitchells yard punt return to the Texas got the Longhorns started on their next drive Simms picked up nine yards on a scramble then Mitchell ran for more than then for another TD to run the score to with left FOURTH QUARTER Backup TB Victor Ike scored the final touchdown on a yard run with left Backup QB Beau Trahan one of the teams top special teams players relieved Simms and played most of the quarter Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorns are a much better football team than they were early this season He said the teams fivegame winning streak is something they worked very hard to achieve I am very proud of our team over the past five weeks he said To win three conference games on the road including backtoback away contests against teams that all had something to prove shows me that our team is no t only tough but is gaining more confidence As a result they are also earning back some of their national respect h e said Brown said playing straight weeks worked a real hardship on the team an d he said the open date this week is very welcome He said the regular season finale against Texas AM on Nov the Friday after Thanksgiving will be a tough one We will use this week to prepare for Texas AM which I think has been underrated all year he said JaMar Toombs is one of the best tailbacks in the country and Robert Ferguson is one of the top receivers It also looks to me as if they have improved their offense with quarterbac k Mark Farris taking the helm and defensively they are the same great team that they have always been We will have our hands full in two weeks But he said the Longhorns have improved so much that they have a chance to close strong if they keep working hard He also said sophomore QB Chris Simms subbing for the injured Major Applewhite gets better every time he gets to play I was pleased with the way he came back after his rough start Brown said He showed the ability to scramble and make plays He also displayed good leadership in the huddle Brown said We should ha ve thrown the ball more in the second half but we still wanted to be physica l and use the running game as much as possible Brown said the victory at Kansas was a big one because it was the second straight tough road trip and the players really kept their focus Overall we felt that it was a very good win for us We were able to play everybody that we took on the trip and came out of the game very well Offensively we won the field position battle with our kicking game Roy Williams played great and we were obviously pleased to have plays in th e running game produce about yards In fact he said we have felt good about our running game over the last five weeks as Hodges Mitchell has established himself as one of the best running backs in the country In terms of the quarterback position we only threw the ball three times i n the second half but I thought Chris Simms got better as the game went on He hit big plays in the passing game and kept moving the chains for us Defensively Brown said we didnt let Kansas score again after their first drive so we also played very well on that side of the ball Brown said he knew the Longhorns had hit the jackpot when they signed WRs Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas last February but he said the freshmen receivers are even better than he thought I have been very impressed with the maturity of Roy Sloan and BJ he said Yesterday was a day that young players could have been flat because of the cold weather and lack of a big crowd I have been amazed all year with how these freshmen play as if they are older The young players have compet ed and showed a lot of maturity which is hard to do at that age Brown said he has been telling the team it needs to keep winning to have a shot at a good bowl game We try to have a theme each week he said and our theme last week was t o put ourselves in position to go to the best bowl possible Regardless of what bowl it is we know we do not get to choose he said I went through the bowls available to our team last week which was the only time this year that we have mentioned bowls I also showed our players the records of each team in the league and told them that it is critical for them to beat Kansas he said adding that eac h win improves the bowl picture for the team Horns Climb to th in AP Texas is ranked th in this weeks Associated Press poll Five Big teams are in the top headed by topranked Oklahoma the onl y team remaining with a perfect record Other Big teams ranked are Kansas State at No Nebraska at No and Texas AM at No One cautionary note should be injected here There is a very good reason wh y Texas has not finished in the APs top since It is the fact that every time the Longhorns got close to the top or actually got in the top the unthinkable happened and they lost and went tumbling down the rankings You have to go back no farther than the start of this season The Horns opened at No and in the second week of the season they ventured out to Palo Alto and got upset by Stanford They havent been close to the top since until now If they beat the Aggies and win their bowl game they will break that ye ar drought but thats a big if A Clutch Freshman True freshman WR Roy Williams has been Mr Clutch for the Longhorns He is averaging yards per catch on his seven touchdown receptions In addition five of his TD grabs came when the Horns were behind or tied a nd the other two came when UT held either a point or point lead Basketball Team Opens The Longhorn mens basketball team opens its season tonight Monday when i t hosts Navy at pm in the Erwin Center in the opening round of the Preseason NIT Texas won its two preseason exhibition games leading up to the start of th e regular season showing a surprisingly strong inside game without departed big men Chris Mihm and Gabe Muoneke Freshman forward James Thomas was a big factor in both exhibition games He had points and nine rebounds in the victory over EA Sports California AllStars Wednesday after getting points and nine boards in t he triumph overTeam Ezybonds of Australia last Sunday Junior forward Chris Owens had points and seven rebounds against the California team and points and rebounds against Ezybonds Junior swingman Maurice Evans a transfer from Wichita State had points seven rebounds and three blocks against EA Sports and freshman Brian Boddicker had points and eight boards in just minutes Junior transfer point guard Fredie Williams scored five points three steal s and nine assists against only three turnovers Lee Will Get Medical Redshirt Coach Mack Brown said Sunday freshman DT Stevie Lee wont play against Texa s AM because the broken bone in his foot has not allowed him to begin practicing That means Lee will get a medical redshirt and will be a redshirt freshman next year He was injured in the third game and anyone who suffers a seasonending injury prior to the fourth game is eligible for a medical redshirt year INJURY NOTES Brown said starting QB Major Applewhite is questionable for t he Aggie game He suffered a knee sprain against Texas Tech and missed the Kansas game Brown said safety Lee Jacksons leg injury is much better and he probably will play against AM WR Artie Ellis shin and TE Brock Edwards leg are both questionable for the Aggie game Edwards injury left the Horns with converted FB Chad Stevens as the only healthy scholarship TE at Kansas DT Shaun Rogers played without reinjuring his ankle and should be closer to for the Aggie game than he has been since early this season OG Antwan KirkHughes has been having problems with a shoulder and it bothered him during the Kansas game but the week off should give him a chance to be ready for the Aggie game The True Orange FaxEMail Deal Is a Great Christmas Gift Ill Have Frequent Reports on Recruiting And Practice

We had to regain our composure after our slow start We had to get the strong safety removed a little bit and the long passes from Chris Simms to Roy Williams caused him to start playing back a little That opened it up more for the run UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis Im not sure Ive seen one like that We tried to double cover him but th at didnt always work either Kansas head coach Tim Allen talking about the problems created for hi s team by sensational Longhorn freshman receiver Roy Williams I knew what was going through their minds Holy cow another one All quarterbacks throw interceptions It just seems like mine go for touchdowns In not used to throwing it away I always try to find a place to fit it in but this is a different level I guess Im going to have to learn the hard way but at least Im learning UT QB Chris Simms talking about the two interceptions Kansas ran bac k all the way one for a touchdown and the other for two points on an errant conversion pass Ive been saying prayers for Joe Beene I dedicated this game to him He used to cover me on the scout team Hes a good friend and its really sad TexasWR Roy Williams talking about the terrible injury to his former Odessa Permian teammate who is paralyzed from the chin down after sufferin g a cracked vertebrae in practice earlier in the week The big man is really good Simms talking about Williams Hodges Mitchell really gets the job done If we give him just a little hole he really gets through it in a hurry Longhorn OT Leonard Davis the biggest man on the team talking about one of the smallest I didnt think I was going to get to yards again but these last two games really helped The offensive line is just doing a great job Texas TB Hodges Mitchell who has yards rushing to give him backtoback yard seasons I thought he was a pretty easy quarterback to read I just stepped in fron t of the receiver caught the ball and I was gone I dont know what happened after that I guess after the first one I

heading into the game and Tex as is also a game ahead in the race for second place in the Big South with a record to AMs The Aggies like the Longhorns had a slow start this season They opened with a loss at Notre Dame before winning three straight over Wyomin g UTEP and Texas Tech But then they were upset at home by previously winless Colorado Much like the debacle in Dallas caused Texas to bear down and start playing better the loss to Colorado seemed to bring out the best in AM Since that disappointing loss they have defeated Baylor Iowa State and Northern Division leader Kansas State before losing to topranked Oklahoma Saturday by a razorthin margin Mark Farris a yearold sophomore who gave pro baseball a whirl before winning the AM QB job has put some life into the Aggies offense He is a very cool and very accurate passer and he has some outstanding receivers Huge TBFB JaMar Toombs also is an effective weapon But it is on defense where the Aggies win or lose most games The Longhorns outstanding defense actually has better statistics overall but the Aggies are No in the country in scoring defense giving up an average of only points per game There are four keys to a UT victory two on offense one on defense and one on special teams Offensively they must be balanced and they cant lose the turnover battle and they surely cant stand any touchdowns by the Aggie defense Defensively they have to shut down the Aggie running game and pressure Farris On special teams the Aggies are good at blocking punts and the Longhorns have had some blocked Thats a nono if the Horns

annual football banquet Nearly all of the recruits who have already committed to Texas have chos en that weekend to visit and so have most of the players the Longhorns are still recruiting The list of players the Longhorns are still seriously recruiting is continuing to shrink At this point there are recruits left on the board who a have offers or will get offers if they check out okay academically and b are strongly considering the Longhorns They are DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison LB Derrick Johnson of Waco D L Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal TE James Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson bot h of Galena Park North Shore OL Jamie Hightower of Jacksonville OL William Winston of Houston Madison safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple athlete Quan Cosby of Mart and DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC Most of the remaining six or seven scholarships will go to the players in that group Johnson Jakes Moses Jackson and Brandon all list Texas No at this point and it is possible the Longhorns will get all five of them Winston also says Texas is tops with him right now but he also wants to lo ok at several outofstate schools Harris is the remaining recruit who is No on my wish list for two excellent reasons First he is the top DT prospect in the country Second he is the only top DT who is considering the Longhorns But Oklahoma is making a big run at him and he is listening He also is being heavily recruited by Florida State and he plans to visit the Seminole s this weekend Harris earlier listed Texas No but now says the Sooners and Seminoles a re his top two teams He plans to visit Texas the Dec weekend and has another trip set up to Texas AM the Dec weekend There actually is another top DT who is interested in Texas Broussard but he has many academic hurdles to clear Jakes has already visited Texas and the other nine players in that man grouping all say they plan to visit Texas the Dec weekend unless their teams are still in the high school playoffs Their teams will have to be really good to be still in the playoffs at that point because that will be the weekend of the state semifinals in some classes and the finals in other classes There are some other great prospects who are long shots but are still in the picture They are headed by DT Marquise Hill of New Orleans De La Salle and DE Justin Tomerlin of San Clemente Cal Tomerlin has been committed to Florida State for several weeks but now say s he wants to visit several other schools including Texas He says he still is committed to FSU Im not sure he will visit but if he does there is a chance Hill says he will take an official visit to Texas the Thanksgiving weekend and will attend the TexasAM game Hill has already visited LSU and plans to visit Michigan the Dec weekend Georgia the Dec weekend and Georgia Tech the Dec weekend He said his big three are Michigan LSU and Texas Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter Abe Robinson Jersey Village Alfio Randall

Briles Wolfforth Frenship Braden Johnson Euless Trinity Brian Carter The Woodlands Punter Brian Bradford Trinity Valley JC The Bowl Picture If the Longhorns defeat Texas AM on the Friday after Thanksgiving they wi ll wind up in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas the Holiday Bowl in San Diego or the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio Those three bowls get the top three picks from the Big in that order after the BCS takes the league champion Conventional wisdom holds that Texas and the Cotton Bowl wont hook up agai n because the Longhorns have already played there on two consecutive New Year s Days But dont be too sure The Cotton Bowl brass likes the Longhorns and Texas coach Mack Brown loves New Years Day bowls If that doesnt come to pass then it will be either the Holiday or Alamo bowl for the Longhorns What if Texas loses to Texas AM I hate to consider the unthinkable and I wont until and unless that happens But if it does well all need to do some research on the Insightcom Bowl the Independence Bowl and maybe the Galleryfurniturecom Bowl UT Women Impressive Sophomore guard Tai Dillard scored a careerhigh points and led three Longhorns in doublefigure scoring as Texas captured a victory over Tulane Sunday at the Erwin center in the second round of the Preseason Womens National Invitation Tournament WNIT With the win Texas advances to the Preseason WNIT semifinal and championship rounds next Sunday and Monday at a site to be determined Texas joins No Louisiana Tech and No Virginia in the fourteam semifinals No Purdue hosts Georgetown today Monday in the final game to determine the fourth semifinalist The Preseason WNIT semifinal pairings will be Texas versus the PurdueGeorgetown winner and Louisiana Tech versus Virginia The Preason WNIT committee has announced that if Purdue defeats Georgetown then the Boilermakers will serve as the host school for the Preseason WNIT semifinals Sunday and thirdplace and championship games Monday in West Lafayette Indiana If Georgetown upsets Purdue then the Preseason WNIT semifinals and championship round will be hosted by Texas at the Erwin Center The site an d times will be announced late Monday Joining Dillard in doublefigure scoring were junior forward Tracy Cook wh o tallied points and senior guard JoRuth Woods who chipped in with points Woods added a teamhigh seven rebounds and had five assists which tied her best career night total Texas shot percent from the floor of while the Green Wave hit percent of their shots for Texas shot from the field in the first half en route to a lead in the win over Tulane Tulane turned the ball over times while UT committed turnovers The Horns also held an advantage in steals to nine while Tulane outrebounded Texas UT also scored points off turnovers to Tulanes Texas had advanced to the WNIT second round with Fridays win over Wichita State while Tulane bested Grambling State in the first round Woods had points and Cook added points in the victory over Wichita State in the season opener for both squads The Longhorns who never trailed in the game were aided by an outstanding for effort from the free throw line as they hit percent of thei r foul shots The Longhorns also shot percent from the floor and outscored the Shockers in the paint Wichita State was held to a percent shooting performance as the Shockers hit just of shots WSU also turned the ball over times while UT committed turnovers Also scoring in double figures against Wichita State were Dillard who had points and freshman forward Stacy Stephens who had points a gamehigh eight rebounds and had a gamehigh seven steals in her first game as a Longhorn In both their games the Longhorns have shown much better quickness and athleticism as a team than they showed last season This was a good first outing for us Conradt said We wanted to have a strong effort on the defensive end of the floor and we succeeded We are starting and playing a lot of young people she said and at this point in time I think we have the athletic ability the quickness and the depth to play solid defense and press Success starts with defense and we were really good again today on D Conradt added We came out with excellent intensity on defense and it helped that we started off shooting strongly As we look ahead to the WNIT semifinals and if Purdue wins against Georgetown then well be playing on the road in West Lafayette Conradt said If we do go on the road I think we all welcome the opportunity to see how we stack up against a top team and how we handle the pressure of being away from

game in early September and then another am kickoff for the Oklahoma game I know some older Longhorn fans who had to miss the LouisianaLafayette gam e because their doctors told them it would be hazardous to their health to attend because they would be exposed to a potentially deadly combination of extreme heat and three to four solid hours of blazing sunlight beaming down on them Both those games were on TV and that is always the excuse UT athletic officials come up with when kickoff times are inconvenient Most of us go along with things like that because nearly all of our games a re televised Last season of the were on TV But three games this season arent being televised and two of them Colorado and Kansas are the longest road trips the Longhorns have in B ig Conference play The game in Colorado was nixed to allow Texas AM at Baylor to be televised and the Kansas game this Saturday wont be televised so the Iowa State at Colorado game can be aired I know the TV folks dont worry about fan inconvenience but UT athletic officials certainly should and one thing they should include in the deal if they decide to inconvenience their fans with am kickoffs in early September heat is assurance that the two longest road trips on the conferen ce schedule wont be nixed for TV One subscriber who couldnt attend the LaLa game because of his doctors orders told me Athletic Director Deloss Dodds should sit outside in the hea t with the regular fans and he wouldnt ever have another am kickoff for a Sept game I think most fans are willing to accept some inconvenience but I think the y expect some sort of a trade off In other words if we need to have some early games for TV then we should get preference on the TV for the faraway games especially when they go up against the likes of AM at Baylor and Iowa State at Colorado It wouldnt have been a hard sell But apparently no one in the UT Athletic Department thought enough of the fans to ask for a quid pro quo Lets hope they do next year After all it takes pretty loyal fans to sell out big stadiums Saturday after Saturday when their team hasnt finished in the top in long years Horns Sign Fine Baseball Class Texas baseball coach Augie Garrido has signed of the top high school players in Texas and throughout the country Through the hard work of recruiting coordinator Tommy Harmon Frank Anders on and the entire

Bill Snyder is outstanding at winning games but is not popul ar with the bowl committee members because they feel he is a very reluctant participant in the prebowl festivities So the Wildcats probably wont affect the Longhorns bowl hopes because th ey will either beat Oklahoma and get an automatic BCS bid or the will lose to the Sooners and be picked for a bowl bid after the Longhorns are already se t I think Oklahoma will get a BCS bid even if the Sooners lose to KState Saturday In that case the Sooners wouldnt affect the Longhorns bowl prospects either That leaves the bowls with Big ties

on the AllTournament Team by freshman forward Annissa Hastings who came off the bench to score a careerhigh points to lead Texas to a win over Louisville in the first round of the tourney Saturday night Texas hit of free throws including a six for eight performance in t he final seconds to ice the championship game The Longhorns are and off to their best start since the season Coach Jody Conradt said she is very pleased with the way her young team i s improving Recruiting Roundup Lets get the bad news out of the way first because there is a lot of good news to brighten the overall picture The bad news is that the Horns really have an uphill fight in their bid to sign the states top recruit DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison Oklahoma has the inside track now and the Sooners will have to stumble on the field or in their recruiting of Harris to give the Horns a chance to g et back in the race Nearly all of the recruits who have already committed to Texas have chos en plan to take their official visits the Dec weekend and so have most of the players the Longhorns are still recruiting That is the weekend of the annual football banquet and the only Longhorn pledges who wont be taking official visits that weekend are DE Eric Hall o f Clarksville Tenn who took his official visit earlier and possibly playe rs like RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee and QBAthlete Kendal Briles of Wollforth Frenship because they play on teams that might be still alive in the state playoffs in midDecember Benson last years Class A Offensive Player of the Year had carries f or yards and three touchdowns on runs of and yards in a thumping of El Paso Franklin in the state playoffs last weekend He also scored on a yard screen pass Briles last years Class A Offensive Player of the year completed of passes for yards and five touchdowns in a romp past El Paso Ysleta Briles who led Stephenville to the state A title last year has thrown fo r more than yards and touchdown and has run for more than yards and more TDs so far this season Despite rumors galore to the contrary both Benson and Briles said they remain solidly committed to Texas With scholarships already committed Texas will give only five to seven more this season They could go as high as seven because they can count punter Brian Bradford of Trinity Valley JC who will enroll in January against last year The best players still available who list the Longhorns No are LB Derric k Johnson of Waco DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal TE James Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson both of Galena Park North Shore OL William Winston of Houston Madison safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple athlete Quan Cosby of Ma rt and DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC Most of the remaining six or seven scholarships will go to the players in that group DT Marquise Hill of New Orleans De La Salle and DE Justin Tomerlin of San Clemente Cal are a couple of outstanding prospects who might visit Texas but they are the longest of long shots rig ht now Top recruits who came to the AM game were DTs Harris and Broussard and Longhorn commitments OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Mike Garcia of Galena Park and Terrance Young of Longview LBs Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison and Lance McFarland of Jefferson and RB Anthony Johnson of Jefferso n Two top junior prospects also were on hand OL Kyle Thornton of Dallas St Marks and WR Anthony Wright of Klein Forest Thornton is the younger brother of Longhorn freshman DE starter Kalen Thornton Aggie Injury Excuses Hollow The Aggies players and coaches did a lost of postgame moaning about their injury problems For the second straight year Texas was missing starting QB Major Applewhit e against AM and the Horns also were down to a backup FB Chad Stevens playing TE because all three scholarship TEs were injured Two top DT reserves Stevie Lee and Ryan Haywood were lost for the season starting safety Lee Jackson and super DT Shaun Rogers have missed a lot of time with injuries and redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis the guy who was counted on to give those super freshmen some time to mature had been out nearly all year with a sore shin Then you have OL like Derrick Dockery and Antwan KirkHughes who have been battle sickness andor injuries all year The point is that every team has injuries and Texas has had more of them this season than Texas AM Basketball Team Texas took a big early lead over Indiana Friday night and then held off a Hoosier comeback for a victory in the consolation game of the Tivo Preseason NIT in New York City The Longhorns started three freshmen James Thomas Brandon Mouton a nd Royal Ivey and used a stifling defense to take a lead at halftime Indiana climbed back into the game and cut the lead to seven points a t limiting Texas to just two baskets in the first of the second half Then Thomas scored five straight points as Texas restored a comfortable lea d with a run Mouton and Maurice Evans opened the game with consecutive pointers and t he Texas defensive pressure forced a lot of turnovers Chis Owens had points in the first half and led Texas with points and rebounds Texas had fallen to topranked Duke Wednesday in the tourney semifinals Mouton led Texas with points and Evans had Baseball Team Adds Four Baseball coach Augie Garrido has signed third baseman Nic Crosta of Seattle Wash righthanded pitchers Chris Scofield of Fort Worth Nolan and Danny Muegge of Blinn JC and centerfielder Dustin Majewski of Blinn JCto round o ut the Longhorns early signing class for the campaign With their potential both offensively and defensively thse players are solid additions to our early signing class that will provide us with depth said Texas assistant coach and recruiting coordinator Tommy Harmon Overall we are very pleased with the studentathletes we have signed for the season An honor student at Nolan Catholic High School Scofield earned AllState honors to go along with AllArea distinctions in as he helped the Vikings capture their district championship and finish second in the state finals He was also named his teams MVP last season and was a teammate o f current Longhorn freshman pitcher Tim McGough at Nolan Crosta is a

Classic MVP and to an AllTournament team in Reno Nev this past summer Majewski hit and blasted homers at Blinn last season Muegge played last season at McLennan JC in Waco and is playing for Blinn this season H e has a very good changeup and a fast ball in the mph range Reese Signs Top Prospects Texas swimming coach Eddie Reese and diving coach Matt Scoggin have signed three top recruits They are swimmers Andrew Davidson of Father Ryan HS in Nashvill and Rainer Kendrick of Homewood HS in Birminghamm and diver Jonathan Linette of Fort Lauderdale Fla Davidson a fourtime high school

December Longhorns Will Face Pac TriChampion Oregon in Culligan Holiday Bowl December The thranked Longhorns who havent finished in the AP top since can wipe out years of frustration on Dec in San Diego by beating No Oregon in the Culligan Holiday Bowl While thats easy to say it will be much harder to accomplish The Ducks went overall and tied BCSbowl teams Washington and Oregon State for th e Pac championship with a record Texas has the same overall and leagu e record at and The Holiday Bowl game starts at pm Texas time and will be nationally televised by ESPN Now before I get back to the matchup let me urge all Longhorn fans to buy tickets and attend this game Why Because one major criteria for getting one of the eight elite BCS bowl bids is fan loyalty The Longhorn team forgot to show up for the Cotton Bow l last year and so did Longhorn fans who didnt fill their ticket quota Bowl folks notice things like that Coach Mack Brown has Texas poised for a long run at top status and our fans need to be in the top too to he lp the team land good bowl games So please buy some tickets the information is on page and take a few days to enjoy San Diego It will help the Longhorns in this bowl game and i t will help them get in future ones Thats it with the sermon Lets get back to the bowl matchup Brown called the game an exciting matchup and a great challenge for both programs Both teams are very well respected state institutions with a great deal of pride and tradition Brown said He also called Oregons coach Mike Bellotti a personal friend and said he has done a great job of buildin g that program Bellotti boats a record in six season at Oregon and has taken the Duc ks to bowl games in five of his six years at the helm Oregon has lost only eight games in the last three years going in in and in Oregon was picked to finish in the middle of the pack in the Pac after racking up nine wins in with a seniorladen team But Bellotti rebuilt his offense around strongarmed junior QB Joey Harrington and junior college transfer RB Maurice Morris and found competent replacements for eight lost defensive starters to produce a surprisingly good team that lost only two games all season Harrington completed of passes and the Ducks ranked th nationally in passing with yards per game Harrington threw touchdown passes while being intercepted times Morris filled the void at running back by averaging yards a game He ran for yards and eight touchdowns Senior WR Marshaun Tucker was the teams leading receiver with receptions for yards and six touchdowns Sophomore WR Keenon Howry a pound speedster is another outstanding receiver Defensively tackles Jason Nikolao and Jed Boice end Saul Patu and LB Matt Smith are the team leaders The Ducks defensive philosophy is to stop the run and dont get beat deep on pass plays Lets hope they dont make that work in the Holiday Bowl because the Horns live on beating people deep on pass plays and they also like to run the football The Ducks beat Rose Bowl representative Washington during the regul ar season and were undefeated in the Pac until the final week of the regula r season when they lost to archrival Oregon State Their only other loss was in their second game to then No ranked Wisconsin Their other victories were over Nevada Idaho UCLA US C Arizona Arizona State Washington State and California The wins over Arizona State and Washington State were in overtime The Longhorns have won six games in a row after a start and they can be at the Ducks and make it seven in a row if they can win four key battles To win the Longhorns have to be able to run the ball better than the Ducks they have to get a fast start offensively they must win the turnover battl e and they have to get another great effort from their outstanding defense Against Texas AM the Longhorns got a terrible start offensively and faile d to even make a first down in the first quarter But they were able to keep the early lead because safety Greg Brown scored on a yard pass interception on the Aggies first offensive plays They probably wont be able to count on scoring a quick defensive touchdown against Oregon which is why getting a fast start offensively is one of the main keys to the games outcome Heres how the teams compared statistically at the end of the regular seaso n national rank in parenthesis Texas Oregon Offense Rushing

Insightcom Bowl in Phoenix on Dec against Pittsburgh Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coaches Waiting for a Few Top Recruits to Come Aboard Coach Mack Brown and his assistant coaches already have enough top recruits to assure them of their third straight top class and it could challenge for the top spot again if things fall right Texas has commitments already the list is on page and the Horns probably will sign six or seven more players The Longhorns will challenge for the No spot again if most of them come from a group of nine top national recruits that includes DT Tommie Harris o f Killeen Ellison LB Derrick Johnson of Waco OL Jami Hightower of Jacksonville S Derrick Johnson of Temple Ath Quan Cosby of Mart DE Jonathan Jackson and TE James Moses both of Galena Park North Shore OL William Winston of Houston Madison and DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal The good news in this recruiting season is that Texas has cleaned up in eve ry critical area except the defensive line That makes the bad news pretty obvious if Texas doesnt sign both Harris and Jakes the class will come u p short in the big guys up front in the defensive line But even that cloud has a silver lining This was the year of the offensive lineman in Texas Next year will be the year of the defensive lineman Ther e a re more good ones than I have seen in several years The Longhorns cleaned up on offensive linemen this year and they should be able to clean up on defensive linemen next year I have already seen four junior defensive tackles who are better than anybo dy except Harris in this years senior class I spotted one of them Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings the first week of the season when I went to Houston to watch the Galena Park North ShoreHastings game I was there primarily to look at Jackson and Moses but Wright was the most dominant player on the field At and pounds he was able to stuff the run and he showed the quickness and upper body strength to get off bloc ks quickly and rush the passer Mesquites Marco Martin is generally regarded as the state s top defensive line prospect next recruiting season He is so quick he doubl es as a running back But Wright is the most physical defensive tackle I have seen in the junior ranks Suffice it to say that both Wright and Martin will be top national recruits next year Wrights time is in the to range but he has as much quickness over to yards the key distance for defensive tackles as any of the guys who might outrun him in a The other two top junior DTs I have seen this year are Earl Anderson of San Marcos and Patrick Lee Dallas Carter The Longhorns will have great shots at Wright Anderson and Lee who all li st Texas among their favorites They also will be in the hunt for Martin While I have only seen them on tape there are several other junior DTs who will be highly recruited next year They include Damon Brown of Houston Washington Tully Jontzen of Keller Jarre Rhodes of Dallas Lincoln and David Johnson of Aldine Nimitz Since the Longhorns are down to recruiting a handful of players to complete this years recruiting class lets look for a moment at some of the other top juniors who will be the difference makers next year There are two junior QBs college coaches everywhere know about They are Reggie McNeal of Lufkin and Vincent Young of Houston Madison McNeal is Arkansas No recruiting target in Texas next year Both are outstanding runners who also have strong arms TE Eric Winston is the second best player at Midland Lee behind super senior RB Cedric Benson who is committed to Texas Winston is a devastating blocker who probably will move to the offensive line in college He is a strong AM lean and has been to the Aggies summer camp Travis Leitko of The Woodlands is an outstanding defensive end If he was a senior this year he would have colleges from everywhere clamoring for his signature At LB Marvin Byrdsong of Longview Andy Matakis of Corpus Christi Flower Bluff and Archie McDaniel of Bay City are already established stars LTydrick Riley of Crockett who also plays QB very well Kendrick Muckelroy of Hallsville and Michael Cuba of Taylor are great safety prospects as juniors Now lets get back to this years recruits I thought Benson and Midland Lee might be in trouble Saturday against defensive powerhouse Duncanville which hadnt allowed any team to score mo re than points all year Benson the Energizer Bunny of the high school running backs carried times for yards and four touchdowns and scored another TD on a yard screen pass to pace the Rebels to a victory Benson now ranks No among all the high school running backs in Texas history in yardage gained with He is the only Class A rusher in Cla ss A in the top Kenneth Hall the Class B terror at Sugar Land from through hold s the record at yards He was an amazing runner but he never ran against the kind of defenses Benson faces every week Benson has led Midland Lee to backtoback state champsionships but he los t most of his supporting cast after last season and the Rebels looked vulnerable this season losing two earlyseason games But his rebuilt line is getting better every week and Duncanville coach Bob Alpert who has been coaching at the A level in Texas for many years firs t in the Houston area and now in the DallasFort Worth Metroplex has seen an d played against a lot of great running backs but he says Benson is in a cla ss by himself Hes the best high school running back Ive seen and hes by far the best one that one of my teams has had to try to stop Alpert said What makes Benson so special It doesnt take a rocket scientist Alpert said Hes got great vision hes really quick through the hole he can get something if there isnt muc h there hes hard to bring down and he has great really great balance Hes also got really good speed and he runs as hard on his th carry as he doe s on his first one And of course the high school coach to end all high school coaches the legendary Gordon Wood long retired after winning state titles galore at Stamford and Brownwood put his stamp of approval on Benson after his junio r year saying Benson is the best allaround high school running back Ive ever seen Ive moved Benson to the top spot on my difference maker list on the previous page With endorsements from guys like Wood and Alpert hes obviously an awesome prospect By the way an interesting and fairly obscure note on Woods career is that hes the guy who ended the Breckinridge dynasty in Texas If you remember Chuck Moser and his mighty Abilene Eagle dynasty and its multiyear winning streak in the s there is a connection to Breckinrid ge there too The reason Abilene won all those games in a row was that the Eagles quit playing Breckinridge That long winning streak started the week after Breckinridge thumped Abilene by three touchdowns I think the score was and it was a whipping But the team Breckinridge really had the hex on was Brownwood The Lions ha d never beaten Breckinridge and it was a really sore topic of conversation around Brownwood Back in those days Class A was the big school class Abilene was Class A and Breckinridge was Class A Both teams won state regularly But Breckinridge fell down to Class A one year and fell into Stamfords district Woods Stamford team beat the Buckaroos that year en route to another state title Folks in Brownwood noticed that the little A school was against the te am it had never beaten and they hired Wood hoping he could do the same thing for them Did he ever Brownwood started beating Breckinridge every year and winning state titles almost every year The Buckaroos still have some good teams b ut they are in Class A now and happy they dont play the Class A Lions now even with Wood long retired Pardon me for drifting back so far but I grew up in West Texas when it had the best football played and teams like Abilene and Breckinridge got everyones attention before giving way to Gordon Wood and his powerhouse Br ownwood teams So far eight members of Dave Campbells Texas Football magazines man Super Team have committed to colleges and the Longhorns have six of them Benson is the only high school player ever to grace the cover of the state s top football magazine and he is joined on the Super Team by fellow UT commitments Frenship QB Kendal Briles San Antonio Holmes CB Cedric Griffin and OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Terrance Young of Longview and Abe Robinson of Jersey Village The other Super Team players who have committed are Madisonville RB David Underwood who says he will sign with Michigan and Lancaster WR Armon Dorrough who has given his pledge to Texas Tech Briles threw three touchdown passes and ran for a fourth score to lead Frenship to a victory over Fort Worth Wyatt in the Class A regional finals Saturday Briles who led Stephenville to the Class A state title last year is threatening to do the same thing at Frenship He needs just two more victories to accomplish that rare and possibly unprecedented feat If UT has a shaky commitment it would be Briles He was recruited by Texas as an athlete probably a safety and he says he still thinks about going somewhere like Nebraska to get a shot at playing QB There is always a chance that lightning will strike and the Longhorns will get a commitment from some blue chipper from out of the blue If it happens it probably will be DT Marquise Hill of New Orleans De La Salle Michigan has a big lead over LSU but he says he probably will take a trip to Texas just to be sure Hes a long long shot but if he does take the trip to Texas it could happen Brown and his staff dont miss on many guys who take official visit s The visit limit rule isnt one that UT coaches even consider They normally bring in about kids offer about of them and sign about o f them Look for all of the UT commitments except DE Eric Hall of Tennessee who ha s already visited and possibly Benson and Briles who might be playing for repeat state championships that weekend to take their official visits to Texas the Dec weekend to attend the Texas football banquet Most of the other players Texas is recruiting also will take their visits that weekend The True Orange FaxEMail Deal Is a Great Christmas Gift Ill Have Frequent Reports on

was a little kid I like the way they run their offense He has an offer from Illinois and is considering Michigan and Notre Dame but he plans to visit Texas unofficially this summer with his parents Dont be surprised if Texas signs several outofstate players Three excellent players listed on the previous page DE Chase Pittman and DTs Lyle Sendlein and Kasey Studdard have strong Longhorn bloodlines and are seriously considering UT RB Zan Johnson of Winnfield La one of the top players in that state als o has several relatives who are Longhorn grads including former UT LB Lionel Johnson Johnson Pittman and Sendlein all came to the UT spring game Two LBFB combos Brandon Hancock of Clovis Cal Wes t and Chris Herring Batesville Miss South Panola also are considering the Longhorns but are longer shots than the ones mentioned previously Three players who have really zoomed up the recruiting charts since college coaches started watching their tapes are LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar S Vickiel Vaughn of Plano East and OL Bret Valdez of Brownwood Ive seen tape now and its easy to understand why the college coaches like them Smith is extremely quick and hardhitting Vaughn is a fast hardtackling ball hawk and Valdez is a devastating blocker with really quick feet in Brownwoods option attack Valdez came to the Texas spring game Smith also is interested in the Horns but Vaughn is interested only in outofstate schools right now I have listed other sports instead of schools by three players on my list o n page At WR Wardell Starling of Fort Bend Elkins will be a firstround

<15338207.1075848298231.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2001-04-09 04:12:00,True Orange April Part of parts of Parts Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No April Spring Shows UT Has Fine Passing Offense Defense but Questions Persist Elsewhere The Longhorns wrapped up spring football practice last week and the best news I can give you after watching all practices is that the passing offense and defense should both be very good this season The run defense probably wont be as good as last years rocksolid group but it will be a faster group that should be good against the run and much improved at rushing passers The running offense still looks spotty but coach Mack Brown says it is improved and will look much better in the fall when injured offensive guards Antwan KirkHughes and Tillman Holloway return When they return by the way look for the teams other fine guard Derrick Dockery to move to left tackle The one huge problem that surfaced in the spring was in the kicking game JC transfer Brian Bradford and redshirt freshman Justin Smith both did a good job of punting but the placekickers had a tough spring Redshirt freshman Matt McFadden showed fair consistency on field goals up to yards but struggled mightily on the longer ones Brown expressed concern about the kicking and said three walkons will be reporting in August and will get chances to win the job So looking at the big picture I see the last year of the softer schedule no Nebraska or Kansas State as one in which the Longhorns will have a passing game that will strike terror into opposing teams hearts and a pass defense that should be one of the best around too But UT teams dont usually win big games unless they can run fairly well yards at Stanford minus against Oklahoma and in the Oregon game in the Holiday Bowl Those were the three games the team lost Brown says one of the tailbacks needs to jump out of the pack and give the team a goto guy If one of them doesnt do it look for super recruit Cedric Benson to be a factor very quickly Brown doesnt like to talk about Benson because he doesnt want him to put any extra pressure on him But Benson is a guy who thrives on pressure Fifteen touchdowns in three Class A championship games shows how pressure affects him Hopefully he will do for the running game what true freshmen WRs Roy Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas did for the passing game last season With junior QB Chris Simms and five or six outstanding WRs to go with two extremely gifted TEs the Longhorns should have at great passing attack If Simms continues to make progress in looking away from his target Texas will have a great passing attack He hit of his passes and averaged yards per completion last year but he had only eight touchdowns and four of his seven interceptions were run back all the way He was much better this spring about concealing his intended target I think he will continue to improve and if he does the passing game will be so potent that it will make it easier to run The other key to getting the running game jumpstarted is getting better run blocking from the line The line worked more on run blocking this spring than it has in previous springs under Brown and he thinks that will pay off with a better running attack when the season starts Ill make a prediction right now that if the Horns can run for yards in every regularseason game they wont lose any of them Brown says he isnt concerned about the yardage but is concerned about the ability to pick up short yardage on third downs and about being able to run the ball in the fourth quarter to protect a lead Ill second that The Longhorns dont have to run for yards if they can run it successfully when they really need to run it Many teams and particularly teams in the Big are stacking the line of scrimmage to force teams to throw After Simms and Company show how they can stretch a defense I dont think many teams will want to force Texas to throw The defense meanwhile is much faster than last season Strong safety Lee Jackson is primarily a strongside linebacker now and converted cornerbacks Ahmad Brooks and Nathan Vasher are two of the top three safeties Former outside linebacker O J McClintock is a passrushing defensive end and defensive end Maurice Gordon is at defensive tackle Sophomore Marcus Tubbs had a strong spring at DT and Lee if he returns healthy in the fall should team with sophomore Adam Doiron the other spring starter to give the Horns three good tackles Gordon is already an outstanding passrushing tackle and Brown said he will try to bulk up a little in the off season to be better at handling the run too Starting DEs Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding return as do all three LBs and three of the four DBs Against Oklahoma the best team the Horns will face in the regular season this type of lighter faster defensive unit should have a better chance to succeed It should be better against the passing teams and it might be almost as good against the running teams The Achilles heel could be the placekicking unless McFadden walkon Dylan Becker or one of the three incoming walkons takes charge

costs a minute You must be or older to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown had to juggle spring football practice this year because of the tragic death of Cole Pittman and a series of thunderstorms but he says it was the most physical and successful spring in our four years here One of our main goals was to be tougher more physical he said after spring practice concluded last Wednesday We worked harder we had our ones go against our ones more and we worked on being tougher and on getting better every day We didnt have a bad practice he said They worked hard every day and thats when you get better We did get better Brown said he was very pleased with the progress the team made during the spring workouts but said there are still some problems heading into the offseason program and fall workouts We still have some unanswered questions such as developing depth along the defensive line and we need a tailback to step forward he said He said Victor Ike would start at tailback if we played tomorrow and Brett Robin would be second team Our running game has improved weve continued to improve our protections and our throwing and catching with our receivers is getting better he added While he isnt pleased with the production at tailback he said the running game will be better this season because of improvement in the offensive line Mike Williams at tackle and Derrick Dockery at guard played as well as any offensive linemen have played in the spring since we got here he said Even though we lost two great defensive players in Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers and an outstanding safety in Greg Brown our defense has continued to improve and has better team speed than last year Brown said He said strong senior leadership gives the team a chance to be really successful on defense next season Sophomore OG Tillman Holloway and redshirt freshman DT Stevie Lee were the only Longhorns who suffered serious injuries in the spring Holloway sprained a knee during the first week of workoutsand Lee had surgery on the same foot that sidelined him for the last games of the season which qualified him for a medical redshirt season Seniors Antwan KirkHughes shoulder and Mike Jones knee missed the entire spring season while recovering from offseason surgery and sophomore tight end Artie Ellis sat out with a stress fracture in his leg We were able to get through the spring without any significant injuries that would keep someone from missing time in the fall Brown said All the guys who missed this spring because of injuries last fall should be back to full strength when we start up again in August He said he was tremendously pleased with progress of sophomore TE Bo Scaife who returned after missing the entire season with a knee injury Scaife tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during the first preseason practice last August I was really pleased with Bos improvement toward the end of the spring Brown said We held him out of the majority of contact drills but the more he played the more you could tell he was getting physically ready to play He should come back with great confidence in the fall after having a solid month of practice this spring He also said one big spring goal was to develop more depth and he said the team made good progress in that area With Lee out with his foot injury it left the team really thin at DT but moving Gordon over helped a lot If Stevie hadnt been injured we probably wouldnt have moved Maurice from end to tackle Brown said Maurice looks really good at tackle and when Stevie comes back well have a lot better depth there The program is growing at the pace wed hoped it would when we came here three years ago Brown said Each year we have developed more depth and experience and from top to bottom have become an improved team with a better grasp of our overall program Last year we played more players across the board than we had in our first two years and that is what saved our season in the end We had so many players injured that it took a lot of guys stepping up for us to be successful

touchdown to highlight UTs annual OrangeWhite game before a crowd school officials estimated at Coach Mack Brown had the first team offenses and defenses square off agains t each other for the first time in the OrangeWhite game The only touchdown the firstteam defense gave up was a yard Simms pass to WR Roy Williams who had a step on CB Quentin Jammer Simms also led the offense to a field goal QB Major Applewhite operating behind an offensive line patched with walkons led the second team to one touchdown against the secondteam defense on a fade route to WR Sloan Thomas in the end zone My vote for most improved offensive player this spring is split three ways because Simms sophomore TE Brock Edwards and senior tackle Mike Williams a re all much improved over last year On defense I think its a twoway tie between DT Marcus Tubbs and CBsafety Nathan Vasher I think the Longhorns will have the best group of WRs TEs and DBs in the B ig They will have the best passing QB in the Big too if Simms continu es to improve They also will have one of the two or three best passblocking lines in the league if they stay healthy Subscribe Now To The FaxEMail Service to Get Scoops on Early Recruiting Get

I should have commented on this earlier but better late than never Kevin Sherrington of the Dallas News wrote a lovein column about Texas AM coach R C Slocum right after national signing day and both Slocum and Sherrington used the opportunity to throw a few rocks at Texas coach Mack Brown and the Longhorns Im going to quote a couple of excerpts from the column with my comments about them Heres the first one Such is RC Slocums life these days Never had a losing season at Texas AM Won more games than any coach in school history Run a clean program h is dozen years as head coach Clean program No question its cleaner than it used to be but Sherrington must have a really short memory Remember those noshow jobs Then Sherrington and Slocum got into recruiting and both took some shots a t Brown and UT Heres what they said in the column Of course rankings come with caveats too Slocum reminded After four years of enrolling the countrys top recruiting classes he asked shouldn t a school have the most talented team in the country Shouldnt expectations go way up Wouldnt that be accurate Slocum asked In other words youre up Mr Brown First of all Brown hasnt had four years of enrolling the countrys top recruiting classes Hes had three of them and the third class hasnt eve n enrolled yet The other two were freshmen and sophomores last year and they are the heart and soul of the team Browns first signees at Texas werent in the class of the others which certainly were highly ranked classes His first great class will be starting its third year this season and it is ready to boost the Longhorns back into national prominence The Aggies on the other hand went in in and in Sounds like a downward spiral to me I wonder if Aggies expectations are way up Second the last time I looked Texas and Texas AM had played three times since Brown arrived to find Slocum firmly entrenched at AM with his progra m already well established Enheriting a team Brown has produced three consecutive ninewin season s and while I know it sounds farfetched after reading the remarks of Sherrington and Slocum he has a edge over Slocum and his Aggies The lone Aggie victory over Brown was in at AM by a razorthin margin when UT QB Major Applewhite the Big CoOffensive Player of the Year was too sick to play I know you play with what you have and I am not saying that Aggie victory shouldnt count but what I am saying is that any outsider reading the colu mn would think the Aggies must be hammering us every year While Im on the subject of biased reporting I thought it was interesting that the Houston Chronicle published a threecolumn bylined story on the Texas AM spring game which drew fans The paper did not staff the U T spring game and did not run one line on an event that was attended by fans The UT Sports Information Department distributed a lengthy story on the spring game and many papers used all or part of it but the Chronicle simpl y ignored the entire event The Chronicle has one sports columnist devout Aggie John Lopez who doesn t even try to get his facts straight when writing about Texas Remember his column on how UT basketball guard Darren Kelly wanted to go to AM but didnt have the grades Kelly was a full qualifier out of high school and in fact started his college career at a Division I school before switching to a JC When he missed a semester at Texas for academic problems it was because ma ny of his hours at the small JC he attended did not transfer and he was short on hours toward his degree It want because he was failing any courses But Lopez was more interested in making excuses for the dismal Aggie basketball team than he was in getting the facts straight If you get as irritated as I do with columnists who continue to glorify the Aggies and ignore or put down the Longhorns let the sports editors andor their bosses know about it An Early Look at the Schedule Trying to predict football games in April that are several months away is a dangerous business so Im going to just look at the schedule and talk abou t the likely odds on all the games The Longhorns probably will be at least point favorites over five of the ir foes They are the home games against New Mexico State and Kansas and the road games against Houston Oklahoma State and Baylor Texas also will be favored probably by at least points in the home g ames against North Carolina and Texas Tech and the game at Missouri That leaves the Oct date in Dallas against defending national champion Oklahoma the Oct home game against Colorado and the Nov visit to A M as the ones that would appear to be the most dangerous I think Colorado will be a dangerous team if RB Marcus Houston stays health y and AM is always dangerous in College Station But there is no question that the Sooners are the most dangerous looking fo e on the schedule I wont predict Texas will win every game but I will predict if the Longhorns average yards rushing against OU Colorado and AM well all be smiling heading into the post season Conradt Gives Up AD Title Jody Conradt UT womens basketball coach since and womens athletic director since is going back to coaching full time and giving up the AD post I have appreciated the opportunity to serve the university but my heart a nd my passion are about coaching womens athletics she said Conradt said she thinks her basketball program is making significant progress toward returning to the national spotlight and said she wants to devote full time to that job Chris Plonsky a senior associate athletic director in the mens department will serve as womens athletic director on an interim basis and will get a new title senior associate athletic director for mens and womens athletics Patricia Ohlendorf UT vice president for institutional relations and legal affairs oversees both athletic departments She said she will chair a smal l committee that will study the mens and womens athletic departments to determine their future course The study probably will take about two months to complete and all signs point to a recommendation to combine the two departments Only five Division I universities have separate athletic departments for me n and women The others are Tennessee Arkansas Minnesota and Wisconsin In recent years the two departments have combined to operate together in several areas at Texas such as sports medicine strength and conditioning fundraising and development marketing ticket operations and media relations Sources close to the situation at UT say combining the two departments and having one director to oversee both would save more than million a year The sources also say UT President Larry Faulkner who will make the ultimat e call favors combining the two departments In this day of increasing expenses and tight budgets it would make a lot o f sense to join the other schools in the Big and the vast majority of t he other Division I schools in combining the two departments under one athleti c director It would eliminate a lot of duplication and save a lot of money Jamboree on TV in Austin The Longhorns Spring Football Jamboree highlighted by the OrangeWhite gam e will be telecast by time Warner Cable Monday and Tuesday on Austin Cable Channel Fox Sports and Time Warner Cable are teaming up to bring Austin cable viewers the tapedelay broadcast of the March jamboree and scrimmage It will be telecast Monday April at pm and Tuesday April at pm Umpire Boycott Silly The three Austinarea umpires who are boycotting nonconference baseball games at Texas DischFalk Field because of what they term insulting person al attacks by Longhorns assistant coaches are being silly David Wiley Tim Henderson and Wade Ford say they wont call Texas nonconference games the rest of the season because they are unhappy with t he way they have been treated by UT assistants Frank Anderson and Tommy Harmon Tim Wade and I have just decided it might be better for all parties involved if we worked elsewhere this year because the professional climate has deteriorated all year such that we felt it would be better for us to extract ourselves from that situation Wiley said Henderson and Wade were assigned before the season to work some Big game s at DischFalk and said they will honor that commitment The reason the boycott is silly is that umpires have the ultimate weapon in disputes with coaches They can eject them and that would be a far more reasonable approach than what Wiley Henderson and Ford have chosen to do A few ejections will make any coach see the light even if he is in the right because umpires have dictatorial power over coaches Its also strange that Wiley is talking about it to reporters The Big h as a strict gag rule on all Big coaches and Wiley knows he can say anythin g he wants to without fear of contradiction from the other parties involved A True Orange Subscription Is The Gift You Can Give Every Year to Your Longhorn Friends A subscription to True Orange is the perfect

Horns Snare Early Commitments Several Other Top Prospects Leaning UTs Way Coach Mack Brown and his staff have signed the best recruiting class in the Big the last two years and they are well on their way to making it three in a row The Longhorns have early commitments including two national top prospects and a junior college star who was a national top prospect two years ago And all three of those headliners are offensive linemen which is an area where the Longhorns needed to strike it rich this time around after signing only three of the big guys in their last class which was loaded with skill position players The national top prepsters are Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter and Abe Robinson of Jersey Village The JC star is Alfio Randall of Blinn JC Randall was one of the nations top prospects at Houston Yates an d signed with Texas in February of before failing to qualify academicall y and heading to Blinn Randall who says he will graduate in December plans to enroll at Texas ne xt January For a team that listed the offensive line as its greatest need heading into this recruiting season that trio is a great way to start But the Longhorns also have pledges from three other offensive linemen who were highly recruited including one from Mike Garcia of Galena Park who h ad committed to Texas AM and was the Aggies prize early pledge before visiti ng UT and deciding to switch to the Horns The other two offensive line recruits are Roman Reeves of Livingston and Wi ll Allen of Cypress Falls The offensive line class of recruits in Texas this year is the best I have seen since I started doing this years ago There are at least offensi ve linemen who are top notch and all five of the UT pledges come from that group The other recruits who have committed to the Longhorns are middle linebacke r Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison safety Kendal Briles of Frenship and defensive backs Brian Carter of The Woodlands and Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity Heres a little information on each of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter has more than scholarship offers and more are coming in all the time despite the fact that he was th e Longhorns first commitment back on June at Texas first summer camp He has the great first step that makes all the difference in trying to cut off an outside speed rusher He is on all the national top lists and is as good an offensive tackle prospect as there is in the country Abe Robinson Jersey Village is a tight end who projects as an offensive lineman in college He is one of the states top prospects and is on most of the national top lists Robinson is a power blocker with quick feet He had offers from other schools including Florida State when he committed to Texas on June Alfio Randall Blinn JC was one of the first players to commit to Texas in and has never wavered He says he will graduate fro m Blinn in December and enroll at UT in January so he can go through spring practice next year He was the states top offensive line prospect at Houst on Yates his senior year because of his quick feet and punishing blocking styl e Mike Garcia Galena Park was an early AM commitment before he and his mother took an unofficial trip to Austin He is as aggressive as any offensive line prospect in Texas A nice guy off the field he holds blocks and punishes defenders He specializes in the pancake block Will Allen Cypress Falls was the Longhorns second commitment Like Scott he committed after the first full summer camp at UT A threeyear starter at Cy Falls he is a very physical player who has the quickness and strength to play guard or tackle Roman Reeves Livingston is as impressive a physical specim en as any of the UT recruits He has the ability to dominate his opponents and the quickness to head them off Linebacker Yamil LeBron Killeen Ellison apparently was the middle linebacker UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese wanted all along He said Reese told him at the Longhorns summer camp that he liked his size speed and ferocity and wanted him to play middle linebacker He is a tough run stopper who also has the speed to cover backs on pass plays Defensive Back Kendal Briles Wolfforth Frenship was the Class A offensi ve player of the year last season after leading Stephenville to the state championship Playing QB he completed of passes for yards an d TDs and ran for yards and more scores That adds up to yards and touchdowns Nebraska wanted him as an option QB but he opted for a career as a safety at Texas His father Art Briles was his coach at Stephenville and now is on the coaching staff at Texas Tech Braden Johnson Euless Trinity is a talented athlete who wi ll move to QB for the Trojans this year after making AllDistrict as a hardhitting safety last year He is a centerfielder in baseball and runs o n the schools meter relay team He has a big frame and could be a candidate to become an outside linebacker in the future Brian Carter The Woodlands was a twoway star last season catching passes for yards and four TDs then switching over to defen se and intercepting three passes He was one of UT freshman QB Chance Mocks t op targets at The Woodlands last season All of the recruits who have committed to Texas except Randall and Garcia came to one of the UT summer camps RECRUITING NOTES The states top QB prospect Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bish op Lynch was in Austin today Monday visiting with UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis His family owns a ranch near Blanco and Nordgren really likes t he Horns The only other top QB prospect who is strongly considering Texas is Bret Rawls of Shreveport Evangel but the Horns only plan to take one QB an d Rawls is such a good baseball prospect that it would be risky making him th e only QB recruit One big plus is that Nordgren wants to commit early He ha s been to several camps alread including one at Texas and wants to visit several more before making a decision But if he does commit early and does commit to Texas the Longhorns can forget about recruiting QBs If he commi ts early to someone else then it will be on Plan B whether that is Rawls or a sleeper like Tye Gunn of La Grange a strongarmed kid who is big and fast and only gets to throw five or six times a game for the runoriented Leopards The Longhorns probably will sign about to recruits Wit h six offensive linemen three defensive backs and one linebacker already committed the remainder probably will go to one QB one or two RBs zero o r one FB zero or one TE one or two WRs one or two more OLs three or four DLs one or two LBs and two or three DBs At RB recordsetting Cedric Benson of twotime state champ Midland Lee plans to take an unofficial visi t to Texas in late July or early August He is a longtime Longhorn fan who says he might commit on his visit The most important report left on th e board is DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison Why There are two reasons First he is a great prospect probably as good a defensive line recruit as there is in the country Second he is the only great DT prospect who is strongly considering Texas and the Horns need to sign a top DT or two Thom as Derricks of Dallas Jesuit is a good DT but he has no interest in Texas After that the list includes several promising young DTs who need to have big senior years to become top prospects Texas is chasing two Louisiana stars Marcus Spears of Baton Rouge Southern Lab and Marquise Hill of N ew Orleans De La Salle but they have not show any major interest so far The UT coaches want to sign two DEs and two DTs but they might opt for three D Es because there are more top DEs The top prospects remaining who I think are at least shots to sign with Texas are Nordgren Benson Harris O L Jami Hightower of Jacksonville DEs Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson and Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn LBDE Lance McFarland of Jefferson LB Derrick Johnson of Waco CB Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple

news The number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Defensive coordinator Carl Reese is always a great interview because a he is an expert at his craft and b he is good at putting complex defensive schemes in terms we can all understand I interviewed him recently about his defense and his expectations for the season With most of the guys returning from a defense that was one o f the nations best in he is upbeat but he wants and expects to see major improvements in several areas Here are the highlights of our conversation Q Coach you lost both your defensive ends At the end of the spring you seemed pretty happy about the way Cory Redding was playing but you said yo u thought the guys on the other side were a lot better pass rushers than run stoppers The way the schedule shapes up it looks like most of the teams Texas plays are better passing teams than running teams so do you think it could be an advantage to have a better pass rush even if one side isnt as strong against the run A We were looking at the schedule the other day and it looks like about half the teams we play next fall are going to be four wideouts who throw t he ball a bunchAnd our ends can come of the edge better than they have That could help us against some teams like Stanford Oklahoma and Texas Tech three teams that are going to let it go pass a lot from the beginning Bu t I worry about that cottonpicking run because I dont want to let teams be twodimensional I like to start with any defense by being stroing agains t the run Q You have already had some outstanding defenses at Texas Do you think this years defense will be your best one at Texas A From a talent standpoint it could be The secondary has more depth tha n its had Of course the guys still have to come through We have got to get a great year out of Quentin Jammer at cornerback but going into the season we have the deepest secondary weve had Were a little thin at linebacker but we know what we have there and they can all run We know what we have a t tackle with Casey Hampton and Shawn Rogers and weve got some backups The glaring weakness is at end particularly against the run We want to ha ve the complete package at end guys who can stop the run and rush the pas ser Cory Redding still had to work on the run some but as far as giving an allout effort he does and hell improve as he gets some more experience He is our best end against the run but we want him to get better We need some of the other guys to step up on the other side and maybe one or two o f them will If they do this could be a pretty good defense Q Stevie Lee really looked good at tackle this spring in my opinions particularly considering the fact that he was playing high school football last fall then graduated early and enrolled in January What do you think about him and his chances of helping you this fall A I think Stevie Lee is going to be a real football player And youre right he should have been walking the halls of his high school in the spring What I really like about him is that we would work him against the firstteam offense and some of those firstteam offensive linemen would knock him back But the next play he would come right back He learns fast and he competes hard We play to play him quite a bit From what he and redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs showed this spring they will be the backu ps to Casey and Shawn at the start of fall practice We have some other player s who could move up too and there will be some competition because the guys who are the top backups this year will have the best chance to take it over the next season when Casey and Shawn are gone Q What do you think is the key to having a better defense this year A The secondary will be the key They have the best chance to step up Thats the key overall They improved last year and played good at times but we still didnt have a great defense because we gave up big plays too often to be a great defense Were going to stress this year that we cant give up big plays because you cant be a great defense if you do that Q What is you definition of a big play A Any pass over yards and any run over yards is a big play If we c an stop giving those up well be better than we have been Q Every time anybody talks about the strength of the Texas defense it centers around your two tackles How important are they and what do you expect from them this season A Both Casey and Shawn are strong physical guys When they go all out they can dominate They really work well together too It is really important that we be sure they give us a great year They have proved they can be great run stoppers but were going to try to push them into being good pass rush guys too Their reall challenge now is to go out and produc e again as run stoppers and get better on the pass rush They need to work to improve I havent been satisfied with the endurance part of it as far as they are concerned If Im sitting there in their shoes Im looking to be just as strong against the run and get better on the pass rush Q Speaking of young players Dakarai Pearson and Phillip Geiggar your tw o freshmen at safety made some big plays in the spring Do you think they ca n help you this season A That Dakarai just improved so much this spring Everytime I turned on a practice film I saw some improvement He just got better every day He als o has some leadership capabilities I think we are going to get a lot of big plays out of him and we might get some this year Hes going to be a real good strong safety if he keeps working at it Phillip has a lot of the same qualities You know Dakarai has been in the system longer hes a redshirt freshman and Phillip should have been walking those same high school halls with Stevie Lee Hes going to be a really good one too if he keeps improving He just needs some experience Hes probably going to get some kick returns and punt returns this year and hell probably get to play som e at safety too Q Is one of them more suited to strong safety and one more suited to free safety A Those kids are interchangeable The strong safety calls the defenses an d goes to pass strength so Dakarai probably would play there this year becau se Phillip hasnt been here as long but as they both get more experience th ey both can play either one Applewhite OK Simms Growing Recordsetting Texas QB Major Applewhites surgically repaired knee is fine and he will be ready to do battle with heralded sophomore Chris Simms for t he starting job when preseason football practice begins next month Simms meanwhile has been hitting the weights and is now packing pound s on his frame up from last season The UT coaches have said all along they plan to play two quarterbacks this season and no one in the country has a better pair to alternate Both are throwing the ball extremely well and both appear to be capable of leading the Longhorns in defense of their Big Southern Division crown If there is going to be a quarterback controversy at Texas its sure nice to know both of them are outstanding quarterbacks Some of Texas conference rivals probably will have a quarterback controversy too but it will be over whether any of the contenders are goo d enough to lead the team to a title The Longhorns have two championshipcalibre quarterbacks Schedule Revisions Reporting Dates The Longhorns seasonopener against

Longhorns hopes of getting Greg Barnum the great center prospect who left Tennessee after his freshman year are fading Vol coach Phil Fulmer has refused to give Barnum a release which would for ce him to pay his own way for a year if he comes to Texas as things now stand Since he would be a walkon it also would require him to meet UTs transfer guidelines for regular students As a regular student transer applicant with one year of college behind him he would have to have hours of C grades or above to transfer to UT Under Fulmer Tennessee football players have the worst graduation rate of any of the major NCAA Division I powers Barnum was a good high school student who might have hours of C or above grades at Tennessee If he does he would certainly have been one of the to p studentathletes on the Tennessee team UT Baseball Players Sign The pros have signed three UT baseball juniors second baseman Tommy Nicholson relief ace Charlie Thames and shortstop Todd West plus a to p recruit in catcher Scott Heard of Rancho Bernardo Cal Junior pitcher Phil Seibel is still negotiating with the pros but has not signed so far Basketball Recruiting Guard Carlos Hurt of Alief Elsik has committed to Louisville The Longhorns were recruiting him but their primary target for their only remaining scholarship is T J Ford who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the Class A state title Ford one of the nations top point guards is strongly considering the Longhorns But teams like Kentucky and Duke are also under strong consideration Maurice Williams a point guard at Murrah High School in Jackson Miss also is considering Texas Williams and Ford are both rated among the top four point guards in the country Texas already has a commitment from center Chris Wright of Redwater With only two seniors on the team coach Rick Barnes has only one more scholarship to give unless some underclassmen leave the team Aldrich Makes Olympic Team UT track and volleyball star Erin Aldrich made the U S Olympic Team Sunda y finishing second in the high jump with a leap at the Olympic Trials in California Aldrich was a senior last season but she gave the Longhorns some good publicity at the trials wearing her UT track uniform How About Those Odds Its been so long since Texas has been a preseason favorite in every regularseason game that I frankly cant remember it It probably was back in the glory days of Darrell Royal But there is an early line from the Imperial Palace in Las Vegas that alrea dy has posted early odds on three of the Longhorns key games The Imperial Palace has the Longhorns favored by points against Oklahoma in Dallas by points against Colorado in Boulder and by points against t he Aggies in Austin I thought the Boulder game might be the only one this season where the Horn s would rate as a preseason underdog I also thought the game against the Sooners in Dallas was the second toughest game on the schedule and the Agg ie game was in the running for the third toughest test So if Texas is a preseason favorite in those three big games I think I c an guarantee you that when the Imperial Palace publishes the odds for the remaining Longhorn games UT will be favored in each of them That of course doesnt mean Texas will go undefeated but I always prefer to be favored and thats what the Longhorns will be heading into the season in all of its games If they stumble early all that will change so lets hope they dont stumb le early or at all The s A Mixed Bag for Texas and Nebraska The Longhorn football team has had a lot of success historically but the s werent all that great Nebraska fans might disagree however The Huskers went in the s That was the second highest win total ever recorded in a decade Florida State went in the s to set the record But Nebraska went against Texas in the s If the Cornhuskers had won any of those three games they lost to the Horns they would have tied FSU f or the most wins in a decade If they had won two of them they would hold the record Baseball Recruit Shines Vincent Sinisi one of the Longhorns prize baseball signees led The Woodlands to the Class A State Championship last month He pitched a sixh it victory over powerful Duncanville in the simfinals then after a fourday rain delay hit a twoout double in the sixth inning to score the winning run over Corpus Chrisi Moody in a championship game Speaking of baseball the Longhorns have signed another lefthanded pitcher He is Brantley Jordan of Texarkana JC and formerly of Round Rock He was last season and he has two great pitches a mph fastball and a hardbreaking curve He was a

<11389407.1075848298490.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2001-04-23 05:01:00,True Orange April Part of Scarbroughs True Orange The newsletter for the true Texas Longhorn faithful Volume No April True Orange Crystal Ball Shows Season Will Be Longhorns BreakThrough Year My crystal ball was a little faulty last year because it didnt show TE Bo Scaife going down for the season in the first preseason practice Without that important piece of data I predicted the Longhorns would win a t least regular season games They won nine without Scaife and I think they would have won with him because the Stanford loss came before the great freshmen wide receivers became the goto guys on the team Im more confident this year because the Longhorns are deeper and even more talented than they were last season so Im going to go way out on a limb a nd predict the season will be remembered as the one we all will recall as the Horns breakthrough year By that I mean I think they will break into the top and stay there for years and years Since the Longhorns havent finished in the top since that sounds like a tall order for this team This will be coach Mack Browns fourth team at Texas and it should be his best one by far His fourth recruiting class will enroll in September and it will be his third straight great one that means the first group of great recruits will be starting their third years They will be juniors or redshirt sophomores The third year normally is one when players who have been able to play at a high level at times learn how to play at a high level consistently This team will have some flaws but every team has flaws The great teams simply have enough great players to win in spite of their flaws The Longhorns have offensive weapons that are almost off the chart With a healthy Scaife who is that rarity at TE a swift surehanded guy who can turn a sixyard pass into an yard score to go along with sophomorestobe Roy Williams and B J Johnson who broke every Longhorn freshman receiving record last year When a team has an awesome tight end and Scaife is one of those with sophomore Brock Edwards not too far behind it creates matchup problems fo r any defense Linebackers normally cover tight ends and good tight ends even one who arent really fast usually win those matchups Fast tight ends who can cat ch in a crowd usually draw coverage from a safety But then Williams and Johnson create problems because Williams almost alway s draws double coverage and Johnson is a huge threat to go all the way if one safety is worrying about Scaife and the other one is helping out on William s QB Chris Simms seems to be developing into the great player he was expected to be after all the recruiting services tabbed him as the No prospect in the country when he was a senior in high school The obvious solution for a defensive coordinator would be to play five or s ix defensive backs most of the time or to go to a zone defense But Brown says the Horns will be a better running team than they have been since Ricky Williams departed and a more experienced line and a bigger tailback should make that happen Hodges Mitchell was a great little tailback but this offense is designed primarily to pass or run between the tackles When you want to run between the tackles it helps to have a big powerful tailback The tailback this season whether it is one of the returnees or heralded recruit Cedric Benson will be bigger and more powerful than Mitchell The line was a good passblocking unit last year and with four of the five guys back it should be much better this year The only big question about the offense will be one of consistency When Simms who shared time with Major Applewhite last season was at the helm the team often had long long dry spells In the victory over Texas AM for example what most people remember is the Longhorns fourtouchdown explosion in the third quarter But I remember being scared silly at the half because the offense had made only one first down in the entire half and the defense was showing signs of tiring because of all those andouts And that was not an unusual happening In the bowl loss to Oregon Simms to ok the Longhorns on long backtoback scoring drives in the second quarter bu t the Horns generated little offense in the first and third quarters I could cite other examples because there are plenty to cite but Simms is a year older and wiser and so are the receivers who performed better last season than any of us have a right to expect true freshmen to perform A bigger stronger tailback also will be able to pick up more of those thirdandshort downs than the team did last year Defensively eight starters return from an outstanding unit The Longhorns lost two great defensive tackles but the power teams in the Southern Division of the Big rely a lot more on the pass than they do on the run and the tackles UT will play this year are quicker and might suppl y a better pass rush Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also made several position changes in the spring that are certain to generate a better pass rush If you remember the Oregon game the Ducks used quick undersized linemen t o harass Simms and it worked remarkably well most of the time With former DE Maurice Gordon now a super quick DT and former OLB O J McClintock now a super quick DE look for the Longhorns to be a much better pass rushing team in I do worry a lot about the Horns placekicking but the coaches are bringi ng in several walkons and hopefully one of them can kick off into the end zone and make most of the yard field goals Even if the kicking problems arent solved this is a team with enough weapons offensively and defensively to be a top team No one in the college ranks will be better or deeper at the receiving positions particularly when the tight ends are added to the mix and few teams will have better defensive secondaries The offensive line will be one of the best passblocking lines in the Big and the defensive line despite having two new tackles also will be one of the leagues best Heres the way I see the Big South race winding up and briefly why I place each team at its particular spot Texas Too many big play guys for the other teams to stop Oklahoma Defending national champs could do it again if they can find another great QB Texas Tech Big passing game too tough for everyone in South but Texas and Oklahoma Texas AM Even R C Slocum says the Ags will not dazzle anyone with talent Oklahoma State Team has too many holes and too tough a schedule to do any better Baylor Bears still find Big a tough row to hoe with little offense and overworked defense Nebraska should win the North mainly because the Huskers host the big game with Kansas State The Southern Division teams have beaten the North three times in the five championship games and I think Texas or Oklahoma will make it four this yea r The South is a lot stronger than the folks and particularly the pundi ts in the North think and its getting stronger every year Number Updated Frequently I update my number at least twice a week with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call UT Starts Another Great Recruiting Year with First Pledge The Longhorns have three great recruiting classes in succession and they made a good start on a fourth earlier this month when outstanding Brownwood junior OL Bret Valdez confirmed he has committed to the UT coaches Valdez one of the states great run blockers said he went to the UT sprin g game March and really liked what he saw He said the Texas coaches offered him a scholarship at the spring game They told me I was the first offensive lineman they have offered this year he said adding that he went home and talked to his parents about it and decided he wanted to be a Longhorn He said he came to Austin the weekend after the spring game and competed i n the Texas Relays throwing the shot and discus After I was through competing he said I went over to the coaches offices and talked to coach Mack Brown and coaches Tim Nunez and Mike Tolleson and told them I was ready to commit Im really excited about bein g a Longhorn He said he also was being recruited by about other schools including Florida State Texas AM Oklahoma Alabama and Notre Dame The first time they can come see us is in May and Florida State AM OU Notre Dame and Alabama coaches had all told my coach they were going to com e down and see me then But he said they need to change their travel plans because he is firmly committed to the Longhorns and will tell any other coaches who contact him that he is a future Longhorn Texas has really been recruiting well every year and I think they have a great shot at winning a national championship in the next year or two he said I like the way they emphasize academics too I think Ill have a good chance to start after a redshirt year he said The Longhorns probably will sign only three offensive line prospects next February and the coaches have not offered scholarships to any other offensive line prospects I have been talking to so they must consider Vald ez to be the states top OL prospect Brownwood went last year and Valdez was the teams top blocker He ha s thrown the shot feet and discus On tape Valdez is a very aggressive blocker who has an explosive start tha t allows him to make quick contact and then he simply drives his guy backward He has the quickest start of any of the big offensive line prospects I have seen this year One of the best things about him is that he is only and wont turn until June but he already benches and squats The Longhorns need a bumper crop of defensive linemen this year and they stand a very good chance to get an early commitment from one of the top one s around at their early June camp He is Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral a top DT who i s the No recruit in Arizona Sendlein is the son of former UT and NFL LB Robin Sendlein and he is the brother of UT redshirt freshman LB Austin Sendlein I talked to Sendlein Sunday and he told me he is coming to the June Longhorn camp I asked him if he is planning on going to any other camps this summer It depends on what happens at the Texas camp he said I might commit I really like Texas He said he also is being recruited by Notre Dame Arizona UCLA Arizona State USC and about other schools Another top DT prospect who is a strong Texas lean is Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo He is the son of David Studdard a former UT offensive line star who starte d for the Denver Broncos for about years after his career at Texas Studdard told me Sunday he probably isnt going to go to any summer camps but he said I really like Texas He said other schools recruiting him include Colorado Colorado State Nebraska Washington USC and Missouri His sister Katie recently accepted a basketball scholarship at Northern Colorado DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster who has thrown the shot nearly feet says he is bigger and also a little bit faster than I have him listed Im and I run a he said Hes also an honor student who carries a GPA on a scale and has already made a qualifying scor e on the SAT I want to take it again to try to do better but Ive already made a qualifying score he said When I asked him if he plans to go to any camps this summer Dibbles said Im going to the Nike camp at AM and a Texas camp probably in late June I might go to one more camp maybe at Oklahoma He said Oklahoma LSU TCU and SMU have already offered him a scholarship and said other schools recruiting him include UT Notre Dame AM Purdue Florida and Nebraska When asked what he is looking for in a school he said Academics has to b e first I want to major in something in the engineering or computer range I also want to know about the graduation rate for football players The coaches are important too and the chance to get playing time He said he went to the Longhorn coaches offices after competing in the Tex as Relays and met with head coach Mack Brown DE coach Hardee McCrary and RB coach Bruce Chambers who recruits the Lancaster area It was nice in Austin he said Im pretty interested in Texas He also said he thinks Lancaster has a chance to make a good run in the playoffs this year We got to the third round last year and lost to Ennis he said Ennis won state and we had a lot of young players so we think we have a chance to do better this year Some of the top football players in the state are also some of the top trac k performers UT CB signee Michael Huff won the District A sprints in and and anchored the meter relay to victory in Another Longhorn CB recruit Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes won the District A hurdles in and He also placed fourth in the triple jump with a leap There are always a lot of regional qualifier meets between the district and regional meets and junior RB DaBryan Blanton of Forney had some great times at the one in Glen Rose Friday running a meters and meters UT WR recruit Quan Cosby of Mart was second in both races running and Junior RBCB Edorian McCullough of North Garland who is undefeated in the dashes this year ran and and anchored his meter relay team to a win in in a regional qualifer meet in Mansfield Huff was second in the in and third in the in UT LB recruit Derrick Johnson ran a for

<10446582.1075857325674.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2000-08-07 04:54:00,True Orange August Part Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No August Strong Defense Promising Offense Favorable Schedule Propel Horns to No in First AP Poll Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns dont rate a top ranking in the wake of their threegame slide to end but the Associated Press preseason pollsters say the Horns are No Brown and his staff have simply done such and outstanding job of assemblin g talent and building a solid foundation to be overlooked in the preseason voting The Longhorns havent finished in the AP top since but there are four big reasons why they should end that year drought this season First the talent base is young but it is outstanding Browns first group of recruits will be juniors or redshirt sophomores this year and many of th em have been playing and playing well since they were true freshmen Second the defense was No in the nation last season and it will be eve n stingier this year Third the offense will be a lot more consistent throughout this season because there are so many more weapons at its disposal And last but certainly not least is the schedule Brown had to play Northern Division powers Nebraska preseason No and Kansas State preseason No in and He went against them in the regular season winning twice against Nebraska and losing two to KStat e The Longhorn schedule is no cakewalk It includes a road game at No Colorado the annual Dallas grudge match with No Oklahoma and some othe r dangerous dates But the early line has Texas favored in each of its regular season games and thats something no Longhorn teams has had in its favor in at least years As good as the Horns should be this year next season should be their year to really romp and stomp Why Because they have only five senior starters and Brown will have four straight awesome recruiting classes ready to roll But this season can be a very good one too In addition to the high nation al ranking in the preseason polls the Longhorns are heavy favorites to win t he Southern Division of the Big and set up a championship game with Nebrask a the Northern Division favorite and preseason choice to win the national title My theory is that the defense will be the best one Brown and his outstandin g defensive coordinator Carl Reese have put on the field at Texas That should give the young offense time to reload before playing the really big guys on the schedule With the Longhorns first three games against teams that will throw passe s a game LouisianaLafayette Stanford and Houston even Reeses young defensive ends wont be a liability because they are lightning fast pass rushers even if their runstopping techniques do leave a little to be desired Most of the other teams the Horns play during the regular season also are passoriented because Oklahoma and Texas Tech are pass teams Missouri probably will be and Oklahoma State Colorado and Baylor probably will thro w or more passes in most games I also think sophomore TE Bo Scaife and redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis wi th a little help from dimunitive sophomore WR Courtnee Garcia will be able t o slow down a lot of those blitzes that terrorized the Texas offense at the e nd of last season by allowing sacks in the final two games against Nebraska and Arkansas The Longhorns have an embarrassment of riches at quarterback where coBig Offensive Player of the Year Major Applewhite appears to healthy again afte r knee surgery but still might lose his job to immensely talented sophomore Chris Simms Ditto at running back where senior Hodges Mitchell made the AllBig team last year and is being challenged by big fast redshirt freshman Ivan Williams with sophomores Kenny Hayter and Victor Ike also in mix I can remember many past season when the Longhorns started and sometimes ev en won with a starting tailback who wasnt as good as any of this group and neither the Longhorns nor anyone else in this area has ever had two QBs as talented as Applewhite and Simms If we assume Scaife Ellis and Garcia can fill the hole left by the graduation of the teams top three receivers long enough for the talented wide receiver recruits to start getting comfortable with the offense then the only real problem left is the offensive line I know it had problems in those final quarters of the season and Ive explained in detail in past issues while it wasnt all the linemens fault but all of those guys are a year older now and should be a lot better this year The only spot in the offensive line that really concerns me is right tackle The Oline did a good job during the first games last year because UT wa s No in the league in total offense until the receivers started getting hurt thus opening the door to more allout blitzes The Longhorns even moved the ball well in the two losses in those first games but the problem at right tackle was exposed in one of those losses when Kansas State forced six Texas turnovers by applying fearsome pressure around the Horns right side on virtually every pass play When Simms a lefthander is in the game the right tackle will have to protect his blind side Either Mike Williams or Cory Quye who both started at times last year mus t step up this season or the coaches might do what they have done to fix problems in other areas move someone from another position Fullback t o linebacker DeAndre Lewis and linebacker to fullback Matt Trissel are two prime examples of moves that are paying dividends The prime candidate for a move could be guard Derrick Dockery who coach Brown called the best freshman offensive lineman Ive ever coached last year With his quick feet he would be an outside speed rushers worst nightmare That could open the door at guard to redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway wh o is the grandson of Longhorn legendary lineman Bud McFadin Holloway is talented and like his grandfather was nearly years ago is a fierce competitor The offensive line could use another player whose competitive juices run at a fever pitch One big problem for blitzers even if the problems at right tackle persist will be Scaife Nebraska and Arkansas were so good at delaying the Longhorn receivers at the line of scrimmage that they often brought eight and sometimes even nine pass rushers If anyone ever brings nine this season the other two defenders will try to chuck the two wide receivers and Scaife probably will score a touchdown if Applewhite or Simms has a split second to toss him a short pass because the re are few defenders who can run him down If they bring eight guys Ellis is and Scaife is and both are fast er than Kwame Cavil the teams ace receiver last season Cavil was a great receiver but at he was the only tall target among the key receiving corps last season Tall receivers are able to take advantage of short cornerbacks in allout blitz situations Remember that thirdandlong pass the tall Arkansas receiver caught over the short Texas cornerback after the Horns two obviou s safeties didnt count That was the difference in that game So my contention is that blitzing is not going to work as well against UT as it did late last season The Big had five teams in the APs preseason top headed by No Nebraska Texas followed at No one step ahead of No Kansas State Oklahoma was rated at No and Colorado came in at No After facing lots of ranked teams in his first two years at Texas Brown wi ll face only two top teams during the regular season this year Other than the big games against the Sooners and Buffaloes the most dangerous games for Texas during the regular season probably will be Texas Tech in Lubbock Stanford in Palo Alto and Texas AM in Austin Freshmen Report Sunday The freshmen report to campus next Sunday August The freshmen will practice Monday through Wednesday August at Frank Denius Fields corner of th and Red River The veterans will report on August UTs first fullteam practice is slated for Friday August at Whitaker Field st and Guadalupe The team will continue to practice at Whitaker Field until school starts at which time the practices will return to Deniu s All preseason practices are open to the public Coach Mack Brown has not released a full practice schedule but in the past his morning practices started around and his evening practices began around pm Browns Observations Coach Mack Brown was upbeat about the Longhorns prospects at the Big med ia meetings in Kansas City last week but he also said the team has to get better in every area Here are some of the highlights of his comments On last season We did not start like we wanted to last year and we did not finish well b ut we had a real good football team during the interim from game two through game eleven On overall needs We need to continue to work to develop depth on our team The Big is a physical league and it gets hot in Austin so we have to be at least two de ep at every position We played games last season and we got tired We have to develop more depth so we can play more people and not wear down during the season On the offense We need to continue to work to run the ball better and we have to be more patient in games when were playing against great defenses We dont have t o score every time but we do have to make some plays and take care of the ba ll better We dont want to put our defense in bad situations On the defense Weve got a really good defense but we feel like we gave up too many big plays at the end of the season Weve got to work on getting better at cutting down on the big plays and we need to get a better pass rush out of our front four so we dont have to blitz all the time On special teams We told your team its not against the rules to return punts or kickoffs Weve got to do a better job in those areas and were working on it Our n et punting needs to be better and we need to do a better job in puntblocking situations On the pressure to win at Texas I got more pressure at North Carolina in my last year being and then losing to Florida State than I got after the three losses as the end of las t year We lost those three games at the end and didnt look very good in som e of them and I didnt do a good job in some of them but Ive gotten more support from the university and our fans than anywhere else Ive ever coached The fans want us to win every game and I want expectations to be high If youre at Texas you want to win the national championship and you need to have a goal to win the national championship and you need to have a dream to win the national championship On the No ranking in the preseason AP poll Expectations are high but thats a good thing The only reason were rank ed that high is because were Texas Were not as good as the expectations and the ranking right now but we hope to grow into it Its a Great Time to Subscribe To The FaxEMail Service Ill Have Reports Almost Daily During PreSeason

Among Nations Elite The early recruiting blitz coach Mack Brown and his staff have worked to ne ar perfection in reeling in three nationally ranked recruiting classes in succession is paying off again Texas is up to early commitments now and appears headed for another top national class after getting CB Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes and OL Terrance Young of Longview both in July The Longhorn coaches cant comment on their recruits until they sign in February but Griffin the top prospect in San Antonio said the UT coaches told him they wanted him because they said I had the size speed and athletic ability they were looking for in their cornerbacks He had tackles last season broke up passes and had three interceptions two of which he returned for touchdowns Holmes coach David Sanchez said Griffin is the best cover corner in the district We went last year and reached the state Class A semifinals and his ability to take the other teams best receiver out of the game was a big reason Griffin who has run a meters said he had offers from Texas AM Oklahoma Colorado and Arkansas before he got a scholarship offer from Texa s on an unofficial visit on July and he said he didnt waste any time taking the UT offer I knew all along that Texas is where I wanted to go he said I really like Texas style of play and I was really impressed with the way the Texas coaches stress academics as well as athletics Young also had plenty of offers Miami UCLA Notre Dame Arkansas Tex as AM LSU and Mississippi State before he drove to Austin on July wi th his parents met with Brown and assistant coaches Darryl Drake and Tim Nune z and committed Drake recruits East Texas and Nunez is the offensive line coach Like Griffin he said the Longhorn offer was the one he was waiting on I really like Texas he said They have great coaches and great kids and they are going to do some grea t things in the next few years I want to be a part of that Young who already is a full qualifier with fine grades and and a SAT a nd ACT score said the Texas coaches told him they like the way he gets a quick jump on the defensive linemen and then maintains his blocks For those of you who are concerned about that time in the dont wor ry about it Young has a very quick start for a big offensive lineman and is adept at picking off speed rushers from the outside of his offensive tackle spot How fast an offensive lineman gets started is a lot more important than his time and Young gets started in a hurry Longview coach Pat Collins who coached an NCAA Division II national title team at Northeast Louisiana before getting back into the high school coachi ng ranks said The Longhorns got a great football player and a great young m an with an outstanding family Collins said Young Is one of the best high school prospects I have seen or coached he has worked really hard this summer and has excellent mobility a nd agility Seven of the Longhorns commitments are offensive linemen Texas has signed only three offensive linemen in each of Browns three previous recruiting classes and he said heading into this recruiting season that the offensive line was the No priority Since this is the best group of offensive linemen since I started doing thi s back in he couldnt have picked a better year to clean up on the big guys Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan

Longhorns Im pretty sure hell commit to Texas later this month While things are still looking bright for the states best QB its no quite that rosy for the top RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee He has been a Texas fan and has talked about committing early to the Longhorns but now he says he doesnt want to commit this summer and wants to wait take some official visits to other top programs before making his choice The Longhorn signees made good showings in the Texas High School AllStar Game in Houston last week QB Chance Mock of The Woodlands led the North to a victory by throwing two touchdown passes and was named the MVP an honor his father Mike won back in as a star QB fro m Longview The Mocks are the first fatherson duo in Texas history to win MV P awards in the NorthSouth game

NFL draft Friday and Longhorn AllAmerican teammate DT Casey Hampton also went in the first round Arizona picked Davis after the Atlanta Falcons traded up to get the first choice and took Virginia Tech QB Michael Vick Hampton was chosen by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the th pick in the fir st round The Horns other outstanding DT Shaun Rogers was picked in the second rou nd by the Detroit Lions He was the st pick overall The last time Texas had three players chosen in the first round was in Texas coach Mack Brown noted that all three players were recruited by forme r coach John Mackovic and his staff and said he is hoping it starts a trend that sees several Longhorns being drafted every year There might be a little fall off next year but Longhorns should be very popular with NFL teams on a regular basis beginning in Football Notes Observations UT QB Chris Simms says he is sure he will stay at Texas for his senior year There had been some speculation that Simms might turn pro after this season but he said he will stick around for his senior year Things to watch for this season that should make a big positive difference include More weapons to pick up those shortyardage plays to keep drives alive like a bigger stronger running back a more experienced offensive line and dont forget great targets in TEs Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards from a twoTE set More misdirection plays particularly reverses and quick pitches to the outside More short passes to frustrate the pass rushers and to give the Horns swift and elusive receivers chances to turn short passes into long gains Bears Maul Longhorns The UT baseball players looked great Friday night in whipping Baylor in Austin but they looked lost when they went to Waco for the final two games of their series Saturday and Sunday Gerritt Simpson scattered six singles and struck out Friday night to giv e the Horns a triumph in the first game of the crucial series Ryan Brooks had three hits to pace the offense But the Bears got to apply the mercy rule twice in Waco throttling the Horns in seven innings and in eight innings Texas made seven errors in the two games in Waco and that coupled with spotty pitching and very little hitting turned the two games into routs Nebraska is running away with the regular season championship and Baylor and Texas are tied for second place Texas Tech is fourth and OSU is fifth

Coordinator Interview Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says there are two areas he always focuses on in spring practice The first is replacing the seniors and the second is schematics what we did last season and what changes we need to make what we should try to do better AllAmerican LT Leonard Davis and AllBig RB Hodges Mitchell were the on ly senior starters on last years offense and he said he feels a lot better a bo ut replacing Davis than he does about replacing Mitchell Robbie Doane had a real good spring at left tackle Davis said We also worked Derrick Dockery some at left tackle because weve got three really good guards Alfeo Randall incoming JC transfer also is a left tackle Considering all the possibilities I think well be okay at left tackle But I dont think we solved anything this spring at tailback he said A ll five guys did some good things and we could play all five of them but we wanted somebody to step up and nobody did The five tailbacks are juniors Victor Ike and Kenny Hayter sophomores Bret t Robin and Ivan Williams and redshirt freshman Sneezy Beltran Head coach Mack Brown said Robin had the best spring but he said none of t he five played at the level the Longhorns need their tailback to reach Davis concurred saying Were going into the preseason practices with an unsettled situation at tailback Obviously were going to find out what the youngster can do when he gets here he added The youngster of course needs no identification He is Cedric Benson the super recruit who is finishing his senior year at Midland Lee after leading the Rebels to three straight state A championships As for a changing some things in the overall scheme Davis said We wanted to add more misdirection this spring and we worked on that Its an area where we think we can add some things that will help us He said more work needs to be done on the reverses shovel passes and quick dashes to the outside Those things are not greased yet he said but Im glad we got to throw a lot of those things at them It gives us some more avenues to attack Davis also said the coaches worked hard this spring on developing a running game to pick up shortyardage situations Were not going to be a team that says we have to run for a certain amount of yardage he said We want to do whatever it takes to win the game but there are times when you have to be able to run the ball in short yardage particularly for first downs on the goal line and in the fourth quarter wh en were trying to protect a lead Other than the uncertainty at tailback Davis liked what he saw this spring Our linemen had a good spring he said Mike Williams at right tackle ha d a great spring I think Mike will be an outstanding right tackle this seaso n Derrick Dockery had a really good spring at right guard Davis said Mat t Anderson had a good spring at center and Jason Glynn got a lot of snaps behind Matt Im really pleased with Jason Glynns development Davis said the line will be much better when guards Antwan KirkHughes and Tillman Holloway who both missed the spring rehabilitating injuries retur n for preseason practice Tight end will be a really solid position he said Bo Scaife was able t o get back into things after knee surgery and he had a really solid spring Brock Edwards is a good young tight end and well get Mike Jones knee surgery back for the season Our young wide receivers are just going to get better and better Davis said Roy Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas all played really well as true freshmen and now theyre a year older and more experienced He also said walkon Kyle Shanahan redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and seni or Montrell Flowers also will see a lot of action Shanahan is the son of the Denver Broncos head coach and was a starter on a scholarship at Duke before deciding to transfer and walk on at Texas becaus e he wants to be a coach and felt this was the best place to learn the trade After sitting out last season Shanahan is a junior and he catches the ball as well as anybody on the team This is a really solid group with very good players and quality depth Davis said Were really pleased with our wide receivers At quarterback he said you would be hard pressed to find anybody who h as two like we do They are junior starter Chris Simms and senior Major Applewhite who shattered most of Texas passing records before severe injuries to both kne es sidelined him gave Simms a chance to win the job Davis also said he is very pleased with the development of redshirt freshma n QB Chance Mock Chance Mock is really talented Davis said He has really good skills Mock has outstanding speed for a quarterback and a strong arm He also has a very quick release He needs to get some experience but he has all the tools Davis said So looking at everything how good can this Longhorn offense be I think this group has a chance to be really good he said We have a lo t of talented players We just need to solidify the running game and were working on that UT Hires Volleyball Coach Jerritt Elliott former interim head womens volleyball coach at the University of Southern California is the new head womens volleyball

<5624821.1075857326333.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2000-08-28 03:17:00,True Orange August Part Scarbroughs True Orange The newsletter and faxemail service for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No August Stronger Defense Improved Punting Explosive Offense Give Horns Chance to Stay in Top With twoaday workouts almost over and the opening game just around the corner there is some great news for Longhorn football fans That year absence from the final top could be over for three big reasons The defense looks even stronger than last years unit which ranked No nationally Kris Stockton is punting so strongly that coach Mack Brown says the pros are interested The offense which couldnt score in the final ten quarters of last season is so explosive that it should be able to score on anybody But lets temper that great news with a word or two of caution about the offense While it is capable of breaking a long touchdown play against anyo ne on the schedule it still doesnt look like an offense that can make long timeconsuming drives against a quality opponent It wont be as quick to punt or score as the offenses at the really passhappy schools on the schedule this year but there might be a scary number of threeandouts against good defenses That wont necessarily be fatal to the Longhorns high hopes if the offens e and special teams can avoid costly mistakes that leave the defense a short field to defend The Longhorn defensive unit is so strong that it will force most teams to punt quickly too Another great asset this season will be defensive depth When the Longhorn offense sputtered down the stretch last year the defenders sometimes simpl y wore down through repeated exposure But the second defensive unit has been formidable in practice It allowed t he No offense one touchdown in seven possessions in Saturdays scrimmage Brown said the only big difference in the first and second units is at defensive tackle where the first team has AllAmerican Casey Hampton and a guy the pros like even better Shaun Rogers But Rogers says the dropoff at tackle isnt that great when the second unit comes in When Casey and I come out Stevie Lee and Marcus Tubbs are really good young players who are just going to keep on getting better and better While Hampton and Rogers are seniors Lee is a true freshman who enrolled in January so he could go through spring practice and Tubbs is a redshirt freshman who came to Texas as a tight end before growing into a formidable defensive tackle The Longhorns are still a very young team with Hampton Rogers and free safety Greg Brown the only senior starters on defense and tackles Leonard Davis and Cory Quye the only likely senior starters on defense Stockton w ho will handle the punting and place kicking also is a senior Brandon Healy is starting at wide receiver now but the fifthyear senior i s being pushed by the heralded freshmen who are developing rapidly Lets take a look at what the Longhorn offense did last year and what it meant to the team The figures below show gamebygame rushing passing and total offense yardage plus the number of sacks the opponents garnered Rush Pass Total Sacks NC State L Stanford W Rutgers W Rice W Baylor W KState L Oklahoma W Nebraska W Iowa State W OState W Texas Tech W Texas AM L Nebraska L Arkansas L It doesnt take a rocket scientist to see that the Longhorns were when they had more than yards offensively and an even more impressive wh en they had yards net rushing The flip side of that coin is that they were when they had less than yards offensively and an ever worse when they had less than yards n et rushing They also had five games in which they gave up more than four sacks and the only one of those they won was against Texas Tech To keep history from repeating itself the Horns need to start percolating on offense Now lets look at the upcoming season Coach Brown doesnt mind the pollsters picking UT No in the country and he also is glad they think t he Longhorns can contend for the national championship Weve sold season tickets because of the fans enthusiasm and support he said Sunday The fans are talking about winning a national championship too and we havent finished in the top in years but thats a good thing too We have high expectations and we want the fans to have high expectations for us Brown said the team has a chance to be good if it can eliminate some of the mental mistakes that cropped up last year and continue to improve Texas ranked near the bottom nationally last season in net punting averagi ng slightly under net yards per kick He said the goal this year is to average yards net punting and he said Stockton is punting so well in practice that the pro scouts are showing so me interest Overall our punting is so much better than it was last year he said Brown also said he thinks starting tailback Hodges Mitchell is even quicker than he was last year and will be able to get the Horns some yardage as the primary punt returner and he said backup tailbacks Ivan Williams and Victo r Ike will be the primary kickoff returners We think we will be better in all those areas he said True freshman CB Nathan Vasher ran a punt back yards for a touchdown in Saturdays scrimmage and Brown said he probably will use him as a punt returner at some point in the season Heres a look at how the team is developing on a positionbyposition basi s OFFENSE Quarterback Major Applewhite the Big CoOffensive Player of the Year last season after throwing for a school record yards and another school record touchdowns seems to be fully recovered from offseason knee surgery but h e is locked in a battle with super talented sophomore Chris Simms for the starting job Brown says he thinks both will play in the NFL and he says its a great problem to have Ive had teams with no quarterbacks he said I like th is a lot better Brown also says everyone has an opinion about who will start but Im the one who will make the decision because Im the one who will get fired if it doesnt work out He also said both will play a lot this season Beau Trahan a high school quarterback who switched to safety at UT has be en moved back to quarterback and he threw a touchdown pass in Saturdays scrimmage He is very mobile and has a good arm Chance Mock the heralded recruit from The Woodlands is a great prospect Hes built like a linebacker at but he runs like a wide receiver and has a powerful accurate arm Brown wants to redshirt him and he want s to redshirt Running Back All Big tailback Hodges Mitchell is back after rushing for yards a nd catching passes for more yards Converted linebacker Matt Trissel is the fullback and he is a good one He s an outstanding blocker good receiver and tough power runner Sophomore Victor Ike the fastest of the tailbacks has been looking good i n practice and currently is running ahead of Kenny Hayter and Ivan Williams for the backup tailback job Converted tight end Chad Stevens and Brett Robin are the backup fullbacks Freshmen TB Sneezy Beltran and freshman FB Will Matthews are looking good i n practice but could be redshirted because of the depth at their positions Tight End The coaches spent much of the spring building a passing attack around multitalented sophomore Bo Scaife a pounder with great speed He was slowed last season after undergoing knee surgery following his senior seaso n in high school but was sensational during spring drills On the very first day of fall practice he hurt the other knee in a noncontact drill and has already undergone surgery to fix it He is out for the season but Brown said the injury was not as severe as th e one to the other knee and said he should be ready to go by spring practice Since he played as a true freshman this will be his redshirt year Junior Mike Jones is an outstanding blocker and good receiver and he came back pounds lighter and a little quicker He will do a fine job but he wont scare people with his speed Freshman Brock Edwards is a big fast prospect and the coaches are working hard to get him ready to play He isnt as fast as Scaife but he is very fast for a pounder Wide Receiver Redshirt freshman Artie Ellis and fifthyear senior Brandon Healy are the starters but true freshmen Roy Williams and B J Johnson have been outstanding in practice and will play a lot even if they dont start Williams and probably the fastest player on the team has been making sensational catches almost every day in practice and Johnson and super fast too caught a yard scoring pass from Applewhite against the firstteam defense in Saturdays scrimmage Two other true freshmen Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery are speedsters who also are pushing for playing time There is little experience but a lot of young talent at wide receiver The youngsters may struggle in the early games but some of them will help a lo t this season and all of them are fast enough to scare defenses Line Four starters return and super sophomore Derrick Dockery the lone new starter might be the best of the bunch The line did a good job early last season but caught much of the blame for the lateseason collapse Center Matt Anderson is getting a strong challenge from sophomore Beau Bake r at center and Cory Quye is holding off Mike Williams at right tackle for now Dockery is a fixture at left guard Leonard Davis is getting some AllAmerica mention at left tackle and Antwan KirkHughes is in control at right guard Brown has called Dockery the best true freshman lineman I have ever coache d Sophomore Robbie Doane is a strong backup at tackle and redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway is a talented newcomer at guard The line will be better because of the extra years experience The key question is the degree of improvement DEFENSE End Nine starters return from a fine defense but both seniors in were the two defensive ends Sophomore Cory Redding the Big Defensive Newcomer of the Year last year looks like a future AllAmerican at right end He is a great pass rusher an d an improving run stopper Defensive coordinator Carl Reese plans to try to fill the left end spot by using three or four players Jermain Anderson quick but undersized at pounds is the starter He is a fine pass rusher but is too small to play full time Sophomore Cole Pittman has moved over from tackle because of his runstopping ability Maurice Gordon and Adam McConathy also will play The y like Anderson excel at rushing the passer Reese likes the size and quickness of true freshman Kalen Thornton who is about and He says he will try to work him in early this season to see what he can do Tackle Seniors Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers are a formidable duo and probably ar e the best pair of tackles in college football Hampton was a firstteam AP AllAmerican last year and Rogers is bigger quicker and at times even mor e dominating True freshman Stevie Lee who graduated from high school early so he could go through spring practice at UT and redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs are outstanding backups Another redshirt freshman Ryan Haywood has a lot of potential Linebacker Reese has four outstanding linebackers who are concentrated at two position s which is why he plans to play nickel five defensive backs only two linebackers defenses at least half the time Juniors DeAndre Lewis in the middle and Everick Rawls on the weak side opposite the tight end are returning starters who just keep getting bette r Sophomore O J McClintock also has been looking great on the weak side an d redshirt freshman Reed Boyd is pushing Lewis in the middle So there is great quality and depth at two of the three spots On the strong side however juniors Tyrone Jones and Marcus Wilkins have n ot drawn a lot of praise from Reese He just says the Longhorns play five or six teams who pass most of the time and he will pull his strong side backer and play an extra defensive back He likes to have his quickest players in the game and all of his cornerback s are good tacklers Look for five or six defensive backs to letter before either strongside backer letters Secondary All four starters return but junior Quentin Jammer and sophomore Roderick Babers appear to be beating out returning cornerback regulars Ahmad Brooks and Ervis Hill Jammer living up to his name is great when it comes to jamming receivers and keeping them from getting off the line He is big and physical Babers is a speedster who played a lot as the nickel back last year He has great manforman coverage skills and always looks for the pick Regardless of who wins the starting jobs all of the cornerbacks will play in Reeses nickel and dime packages He also plans to substitute them a lot because they do so much running True freshman Nathan Vasher also is pushing for playing time At safety senior Greg Brown and junior Lee Jackson are returning starters Backing them up are redshirt freshman Dakarai Pearson who is looking very good this fall and true freshman Phillip Geiggar who graduated early so h e could go through spring practice at Texas Geiggar also looks like a future star Reese usually plays extra cornerbacks in his nickel and dime lineups but h e has been working Pearson as a nickel back in some situations Football Notes Two freshmen running back Tyrone Richardson and linebacker Aurmon Satc hell have left the team at least temporarily to resolve some academic probl ems Richardson wont be back until January at the earliest Satchell said he hopes to get his problems resolved by the NCAA Clearinghouse in time to rejoin the team this week Backup linebacker O J McClintock and freshman cornerback Nathan Vasher ha ve intercepted a lot of passes in practice Coach Brown says junior guard Antwan KirkHughes is the most improved offensive lineman but he also said We feel like all five offensive line starters will be quality players Josh Doiron older both of freshman defensive end Adam Doiron is walking o n as a tight end Josh Doiron attended Kansas State for a year on a football scholarship but quit the team and attended Oklahoma last year He did not play football at OU After sitting out this year at UT he will have two years of eligibility remaining Redshirt freshman Monti Collier has been switched from cornerback to safety Coach Brown says the true freshmen will have their first chance to move up late this week We like to get through twoadays before we do a lot of moving up and down with the freshmen he said We have to be sure they ca n play at a high level on a consistent basis True freshman WR Roy Williams makes at least one or two sensational catches in every practice and fellow true freshman WR B J Johnson also is making a strong bid for early playing time Its a Great Time to Subscribe To The FaxEMail Service

Gets Top RB Cedric Benson as Lucky th Recruit Cedric Benson of Midland Lee the alltime Class A champ in yardage gained and touchdowns scored is a future Longhorn Thirteen is supposed to be an unlucky number but not in this case because Benson is the Longhorns th early commitment and he is a rare jewel He ran for an incredible yards and scored an equally incredible touchdowns last season to lead Lee to a State Championship season Benson scored TDs rushing and caught passes for yards and the oth er seven scores He ran roughshod over a very good Aldine Eisenhower team in the state final s rushing for yards and four touchdowns and bolting yards with a scree n pass for another TD in a victory That was just another typical day for Benson who had yards and five TD s in the state finals as a sophomore en route to a yard season and touchdowns Why did he pick the Longhorns over all the other top schools who offered scholarships Ive always liked the University of Texas he said I like the way they use their running backs and have a balanced offense The UT offense is a lo t like the one we run here at Lee Benson said he was pulling for Ricky Williams to win the Heisman Trophy in and said Texas has been his top choice since he started drawing recruiting attention Asked how many scholarship offers he has received Benson said he quit counting after He also said the only other team he seriously considered was Miami but I like Texas better and its a lot closer to home Legendary high school coach Gordon Wood who won multiple state titles at Stamford and Brownwood before retiring several years ago says Benson is the best running back I ever saw in high school Woods teams had some great backs and they played against some other great backs so he has seen more than his share of the great ones Benson is a back who sets up blockers extremely well and seems to sense whe re a hole will be before it opens He is an instinctive runner who is shifty a nd hard to bring down He is on all the national top lists as are fellow Texas pledges Jonatha n Scott of Dallas Carter and Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village both offensive linemen OL Alfio Randall of Blinn JC another Texas commitment was a national top prospect two years ago at Houston Yates Randall had hoped to enroll at Texas in January but he needs more hou rs at Blinn so he will have to remain at the junior college through the sprin g semester to graduate That will delay his enrollment at Texas until next fa ll Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter is a national top player He is super quick for his size and has the long arms college coaches want f or the key left tackle spot Abe Robinson Jersey Village is another national top player He plays tight end at Jersey Village and is the top blocker for sup er junior RB Selvin Young who ran for yards last year as a sophomore Alfio Randall Blinn JC was a national top player two years ago He is super strong and extremely quick Mike Garcia Galena Park broke the Aggies hearts by changi ng his early commitment to Texas He is an offensive lineman with a defensive linemens aggressive temperament Will Allen Cypress Falls is another highly recruited star who has quick feet and great lateral movement Roman Reeves another of the states top eight offensive linemen He is a physically dominating blocker with good footwork and a strong upper body Terrance Young Longview has a very quick start and like Garcia is aggressive with his blocks Running Back Cedric Benson Midland Lee the states top running back an d another national top player Linebacker Yamil LeBron Killeen Ellison was the middle backer the Longhorns targeted early He is very physical and tough and he has great quickness Defensive Back Cedric Griffin San Antonio Holmes one of the states top two cornerbacks He is the kind of tall fast meter time corner who loves manforman coverage and is very good at it Kendal Briles Wolfforth Frenship a great option QB who wi ll play safety at Texas He was the Class A Offensive Player of the Year last season while leading Stephenville to the Class A state title He moved to the suburbs of Lubbock because his father Art left his job as head coach at Stephenville to become an assistant at Texas Tech Braden Johnson Euless Trinity a fine athlete who will play QB this season He is a real head hunter Brian Carter The Woodlands a twoway star at WR and CB So far only seven member of Dave Campbells Texas Football magazines man Super Team have committed to colleges and the Longhorns have six of them Benson is the only high school player ever to grace the cover of the state s top football magazine and he is joined on the Super Team by Briles Griffin Scott Young and Robinson The other Super Team player who has committed is Madisonville running back David Underwood who says he will sign with Michigan RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns search for a quarterback recruit has been narrowed down to the best one in Texas and the best one in Louisiana Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch is the top Texas QB recruit and Bret Rawls of Shreveport Evangel is the top one in Louisiana Rawls backed up superstar Brock Berlin last year but has soared to the top of the recruiting charts after attending several major college summer camps Eric Hall the outstanding defensive end prospect from Clarksville Tenn still plans to take his official visit the Sept weekend With recruits already committed and no defensive lineman among them that is where at least five or six of the remaining scholarships will be awarded DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison is the key one because he is the toprated DT in the nation and because he is the only great one in the high school ranks in Texas this year Paul Broussard is a great one at Blinn JC and he is very interested in Texas but he has a lot of work to do in the classroom The Longhorns are recruiting some big DEs who good grow into tackles like Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal He lived in Plano during junior high Last Open Scrimmage Wednesday The Longhorns will end twoadays Monday and Tuesday with am and pm practices at Whitaker Field then have their last open scrimmage Wednesday at pm at Royal Memorial Stadium Coach Mack Brown said he plans to give the team Friday Satuday and Sunday off then begin game week preparations next Monday

chance with him The odd s are much longer on Davis Shelton Spears and Hill Scouting LouisianaLafayette If the Longhorns dont break their quarter scoring drought quickly in their Sept season opener against LouisianaLafayette in Austin it will be a very bad sign The Ragin Cajuns didnt do much ragin last season going with their only victories coming over AA Wofford and Middle Tennessee They also gave up an average of yards per game rushing and allowed opposing backs to average yards per rush The Cajuns run a spread offense with four wideouts but they didnt score a touchdown until their fifth game last season Coach Mack Brown says you dont really know what you have until you start playing other teams He still wont know after this day in the park The game starts at am on Sept and will be televised by the Fox Network on a syndicated basis Baseball Adds Loses The Longhorn baseball coaches have signed shortstop Shaff Elkouri from Seward County JC in Kansas but they lost one of their prized recruits last weekend when slugger Jason Stokes of Coppell signed with Florida for million Elkouri will be a sophomore at Texas this season Big Basketball Recruiting Week Coming Up The season opener in football is always big news and its also going to be a big deal for basketball this year because both Longhorn teams have some bigtime recruits taking official visits the Sept weekend Its really big for the men who have only one scholarship remaining T J Ford the point guard who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the state Class A championship last season will visit Ford is the player the UT coaches want and there is a chance he will commi t on his visit The Longhorn women have three scholarships left and two outstanding player s have scheduled visits for the Sept weekend One of them has a name you will remember She is Lauren Selmon a guardforward from Norman Okla If that rings a bell you are right She is the daughter of Dewey Selmon o ne of those three great defensive line brothers who starred at Oklahoma a quarter of a century ago I was in Oklahoma working as a political reporter for The Associated Press when the Selmons played at OU Unlike some of the later Sooner stars who made the wrong kind of headlines off the field the Selmons are fine people The other is Jody Bell a forward from Chestermere HS in Alberta Canad a She averaged a triple double last season points

North Mesquite DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos says he is solidly committed to Texas and says he is being misquoted by people who say he plans to take visits to other schools WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus was held out of last weeks game after missing school and reporting he was sick FM coach Randy Mayes said he isnt sure if Timmons will play this week It depends on whether he misses any more school or practices he said Timmons is a great football prospect and is by far the best WR in Texas but he has had some disciplinary problems and it seems they are continuing But as Mayes said maybe he really was sick My next emailfax will be whenever events warrant The True Orange EMailFax Service includes at least faxemails a year and costs by EMail The True Orange Newsletter

October Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange P O Box Austin Texas Phone Brown Says Buffs Pose Real Problem No TV for Game at Missouri Coach Mack Brown said Monday Colorado will be the best running team Texas will see this year and he also said the Buffaloes have the best offensive line the Horns will face The two teams play at pm Saturday in a game that will be televised regionally by ABC The Longhorns are a point favorite over the Buffaloes also Brown said DE Kalen Thornton who missed the Oklahoma State game with a sprained knee is expected to return to practice Tuesday and he said that is very good news because Colorado has such a powerful running game that the Longhorns will need every available defensive lineman to try to stop it This is the best running team we have seen since the last time we played Nebraska he said They have a big physical line and some big physical backs He said Oklahoma uses its passing game to set up its running game He said Colorado is the opposite They run to set up their playaction passes he said They have a very good offense and their quarterback Craig Ochs is a good passer and he can hurt you running Well have a battle The Longhorns probably will be back in their basic defense against the runoriented Buffs and Brown said sophomore DT Adam Doiron who started against Oklahoma State played really well and will start again Fellow sophomore Marcus Tubbs is a fixture at the other tackle spot If Thornton is able to return Brown said that will give the coaches freedom to use Maurice Gordon at end or tackle Gordon a former end was a starting tackle until Thornton got hurt and then he moved back to end He said the Longhorns have to work hard to run a lot against Colorados tough run defense because they like to dominate time of possession with their running game and just wear the other team down We try to wear the other team down too so thats going to be interesting The Longhorns have won straight games at home That is the longest home winning streak since the early s They also are at home since Brown took over Brown said true freshman RB Cedric Benson will start and Ivan Williams also will play quite a bit against Colorado Cedric did a good job Brown said and Ivan did well when he came in late We want Cedric to get a lot of carries but probably not like he got against Oklahoma State Well probably spread it out a little more He also said TE Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards are going to start getting more chances to catch passes They can really run and weve got to work them into the offense a little more and give them more chances he said The Longhorns game at Missouri on October was not chosen for TV but UT officials have asked the Missouri athletic director to approve a pay TV arrangement for some Texas cities The game time would have to be pm or later to be approved for pay TV because the Big has a rule that prohibits any league game telecast conflicting with the sanctioned telecast which begins at am UT officials expect to get an answer from Missouri officials Tuesday This will be the first Longhorn game this season that was not chosen for TV and it is the longest road trip this season Ironically the two longest Big trips last year to Colorado and Kansas were not chosen for TV either So much for all that famed UT clout with the TV networks RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns are still at commitments One of them is a little shaky LB Garnett Smith of Arlington Lamar says he plans to sign with Texas but might take a couple of visits When kids take visits the commitments are shaky Well have to see what develops in regard to Smith and his pledge to UT Texas has pledges from five players on my man diffefrence maker list including No DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos No LB Smith No LB Brian Robison of Splendora No OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood and No QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar The Horns have a pretty good shot at every member of the top seven on that list No DT Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings No QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison No DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster No DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands No RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park and No LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite The

Phone TexasOklahoma Game Set for P M National ABC Telecast The big showdown next week between top five powers Texas and Oklahoma in Dallas has been set for a pm kickoff and will be televised nationally by ABC Both teams are unbeaten but both face tough tests this week The Sooners ranked No nationally face No Kansas State and the Longhorns ranked No play unbeaten Texas Tech Coach Mack Brown said Monday he thinks the Longhorn offense has been steadily improving this season but he said the defense has reverted to last years problem of being victimized by what he called offschedule plays You and I call those misdirection plays but by any terminology they were a major problem for the Texas defense in Saturday nights victory at Houston We have to do a better job on offschedule plays Brown said Were going to work on that a lot this week We need to tackile better and we need to do a better job of recognizing what the other team is doing With Texas Tech and Oklahoma two teams who love misdirection filling the next two spots on the schedule it could be fatal to the Longhorns lofty ambitions unless they show a lot of improvement in tackling and recognizing misdirection plays Texas leads the Big in scoring averaging points per game but Tech is No with a point average Brown said the Longhorns have to get a much better defensive performance against Tech than they got against Houston or well get beat He also said Texas will have a real challenge in trying to corral Tech QB Kliff Kingsbury one of the nations top passers and TB Ricky Williams who is averaging yards per game rushing and is the Big s leading receiver averaging catches per game for yards Hes very dangerous on those short passes Brown said of Williams Hes completely healthy for the first time in a long time and hes one of the most dangerous backs in the country Linebackers have to do a good job on Williams or he has a big day Since linebacker play is not a strength on this Longhorn team we need to hope the Texas offense has a great day I think freshman LB Derrick Johnson is already the teams best linebacker but he didnt see any firsthalf action at Houston He made an immediate impact when he came in early in the third quarter Brown said Johnson and RB Cedric Benson are potentially great players but he said both have only been going to class in college for about two or three weekis He said the coaches have to simplify offensive and defensive assignments when they play because they havent had time to learn everything they need to know Derrick is so talented and he has a real nose for the ball Brown said Hes one of the best athletes coming out of high school that Ive seen But he said defensive coordinator Carl Reese has a pretty complicated system and were bringing him along as fast as we can He said Johnson and Benson will see more action as the season progresses and they learn more about their assignments RECRUITING NOTES Texas still has commitments The two super linebackers who are still uncommitted Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and Marvin Byrdsong of Longview have had some changes in their list of favorites recently Harris had been a strong lean to Texas but he told me today he likes Texas Oklahoma and Texas AM all about the same I dont really have a favorite he said Theyre all about even But Byrdsong who has a brother at Mississippi State and who had been leaning toward the Bulldogs now says he really likes Texas I think Texas can get both of them if the Horns beat OU and AM and if Byrdsong continues to make some progress in the classroom It looks like DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos has a good chance to keep his Longhorn scholarship Brown shies away from problem kids as a rule but Anderson who was arrested on two misdemeanor charges last week had never been in any trouble before and that will help him He committed to Texas several weeks ago But the Longhorns dont appear likely to offer a scholarship to the states top WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus because his latest suspension is just another in a long line of problems By the way when I put stuff like this in my emailfaxes I dont want to see it on the internet I cant give you the inside scoop on things like this if it goes public because these kids and their coaches read the internet and it could hurt the Longhorns recruiting I want to give you the true picture but I cant if you dont

football with twin goals of developing better run blockers and finding a left tackle to replac e AllAmerican Leonard Davis who was the second player chosen in the first round of the NFL draft Saturday In an interview last week he told me he is pleased about the progress his players made in both areas He said right tackle Mike Williams and right guard Derrick Dockery were outstanding this spring in every area including run blocking Mike Williams had a great spring Nunez said He had as good a spring as any offensive linemen has had since weve been here Hes really light on h is feet for such a big man and that helps him whether hes pass blocking or run blocking Derrick Dockery finally was healthy this spring he said That infection he had last season really sapped his strength all season He fought through it and played as hard as he could but this spring he was flying around and doing things he couldnt do last year He was just a different guy this spring and he really did a good job He and Mike really gave us a strong right side this spring He said center Matt Anderson played well this spring Hes a steady hand i n there He also said backup Jason Glynn had a very good spring He is real ly athletic We just need to get him some snaps Junior Robbie Doane started at left tackle all spring and Nunez said I think Robbie Doane is going to be a good football player for us He needs t o have a great summer and get stronger in his upper body He really wants to be a good player and hell work hard this summer to get there He said Doane has great technique He really knows what to do Hes just g ot to get strong enough to do it on a consistent basis Nunez said one reason Doane might not have been an obvious standout during the spring was that he was going against a great player Defensive end Kalen Thornton is as hard to block as anybody hell see during the season Hes special But the Longhorns also have some other options at left tackle Blinn Junior College star Alfio Randall has passed the JC exit exam and is on schedule t o graduate in time to join the team in August and Dockery also worked some a t left tackle in the spring and did very well Nunez said Two top guards missed the spring Senior Antwan KirkHughes a two year starter was recovering from shoulder surgery and sophomore Tillman Hollowa y sprained a knee early in the spring and missed the remainder of the drills When they return Nunez said it will make it easier to move Dockery to tack le if the need arises He said both of them should be totally recovered in plenty of time for the season How about depth at guard if Dockery moves to tackle Bo Baker had a good spring at guard he said Well continue to work him some at center but he gives us another good guard Hes really fast If we had a race he would be the fastest of the offensive linemen Nunez said players like Williams Dockery and KirkHughes have had to play earlier than they should have since none of them redshirted but he said those painful early learning experiences should pay off this year Mike Williams really improved during last season Nunez said He was playing really well by the end of the season and he carried that over into this spring He said KirkHughes shoulder and Dockerys infection hampered their play last season but he said they played as hard as they could and should be mu ch better this season because of their experiences last season Dockery made great strides this spring he said adding that he expects KirkHughes to again be one of the teams top linemen when he returns with his surgicallyrepaired shoulder Holloway started several games as a redshirt freshman last year due to Dockerys health problems and Nunez said he had to grow up during the season Its tough to start as a redshirt freshman offensive lineman in thi s league but he worked through it and he was just playing so much better by the end of the season Im excited about this group Nunez said Theyve worked hard to get better and I think they have a chance to be a really strong group this seas on if they can stay healthy Head coach Mack Brown said at the end of spring practice the Longhorns were running the ball better than they have the last two seasons Since he also says he isnt that happy with any of the tailbacks he obviously feels the line is doing a better job of run blocking We worked on it more this spring Nunez said and I think that will pay off this season One thing that needs to be noted is that the perennial powerhouse teams usually dont start offensive linemen until they are redshirt juniors whic h means they are in their fourth year Exceptional linemen can start earlier but even they usually spend two year s backing up before starting in their third year This coaching staff inherited some talent when it took over but other than a talented bunch of seniors the offensive line talent was pretty bare Even firstround draft choice Davis spent his first year on defense before the new staff switched him to the offensive line Texas should be able to begin redshirting most of its offensive linemen thi s season but the coaches havent had that luxury until now Why Because despite their great overall recruiting success they have bee n able to sign only three offensive linemen each year until they hit the jackpot with six in their last recruiting class Kelly Named Basketball MVP Senior shooting

<4521308.1075848300298.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2001-05-14 04:43:00,True Orange May Part of Parts Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No May Brown Says Longhorns Should Be Very Good Offensively with Chance for Stout Defense Too Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns will head into the football season with just one problem on offense and fewer than expected on defense if his young tackles come through In an interview with coach Brown last week I asked him how the Longhorns compare with his best teams at North Carolina In a nutshell he said Texas is better offensively than those North Carolin a teams but is not quite as imposing defensively His last two teams at North Carolina lost only to Florida State posting th e best twoyear record ever for the Tar Heels and finishing in the top twice something Texas hasnt accomplished once in nearly two decades Our offensive line is better here he said We have two quarterbacks who can play We had that at North Carolina too but our upside is better here Our receivers at North Carolina were very good but the ones we have now ca n be the best weve had He said North Carolinas fullback and tight end from his last team there a re still playing in the NFL but he also noted that UT TEs Bo Scaife and Broc k Edwards who are only sophomores in eligibility have NFL potential too He said one big plus offensively at UT is the depth the incoming freshmen will provide in the line We had good offensive linemen at North Carolina but we had trouble findin g good ones in numbers he said We didnt have good numbers here and had to force some guys to play too early he said but that got them ready to play and now we have good experience and good numbers and we hope we can start redshirting our freshm en offensive linemen We need to get to that point Hesaid the only problem he sees offensively this season is at tailback and that isnt as big a problem as it seems because all five of the returnees competing for the job are competent players and several of them have the ability to step it up And if they dont step it up there is a young fellow coming to twoadays in August who has everyone excited Ive written enough about Cedric Benson th at I wont go through it all again but he is something special If you doubt it just remember this Three state championship games in Clas s A at Midland Lee with five touchdowns in each game No one else has ever come close to doing that once in Class A much less three times Defensively Brown has high expectations and thats only natural because of the starters and of the backups on his North Carolina team were N FL draft picks Three of his defensive linemen went in the first round But he says the Longhorns have some talent on defense and could be very goo d if his young tackles come through The departures of twotime AllAmerican Casey Hampton and his equally formidable sidekick Shaun Rogers left a giant hole in the middle of the Longhorn defense They were the runstoppers deluxe who led a unit that ranked th nationall y in rushing defense yielding yards a game last year Eight starters return from a Longhorn defense that also ranked seventh in t he nation in total defense yielding only yards per game Brown also said Rogers who missed several games with a badly sprained ankl e was never close to last year after being injured early in the season Shaun was one of the best players of his size I have seen at rushing the passer he said When we lost him it really hurt our pass rush I have speculated in previous issues that the Longhorns probably will have a better pass rush from their front four this season because sophomoretobe Marcus Tubbs got sacks second on the team last year while standing in for Rogers and because the defensive ends are a year older and there is mo re speed at tackle than before Brown said the coaches are counting on a better pass rush from their lineme n Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton have the potential to be as good as anybod y at defense end he said We have high expectations for them At tackle he said Tubbs weighs and he can run Hes got a great upsid e Hes a young guy who has played well already and should just get better and better Were excited about him Brown also said the move of Maurice Gordon from end to tackle looks like a good one He runs a and he looked really good this spring We just need him to keep on working hard and hell be a good one Hes already a good pass rusher and hes working on getting stronger to stop the run While Gordon is a passrushing whiz the likely starter at tackle opposite Tubbs is redshirt freshman Stevie Lee if he is able to recover fully from foot surgery Lee played well last year in spots as a true freshman but was injured earl y and was able to get a medical redshirt year which means he is a freshman again this year If Lee is healthy Brown said the key for him is offseason conditioning work Stevie can play at about pounds but he doesnt need to play at he said In this league everybody spreads people out forcing the front four to ma ke offschedule plays You cant just be a run stopper anymore Youve got to be quick enough to make adjustments Were emphasizing speed and quickness he added Thats why we made some moves in the spring like moving Maurice Gordon to tackle O J McClintock to end from linebacker and Lee Jackson to linebacker from safety Brown also said sophomore Adam Doiron who also played well in relief last season as a true freshman has a bright future at tackle He needs to get get stronger Brown said Hes real smart and real tough He just needs to get more experience and use the offseason program to get stronger He likes his secondary saying I feel like we are in real good shape with our secondary We have guys who have the ability to cover and the speed to make up ground We also are two deep in the secondary for the first time since weve been here The area where he wants to see the most improvement on defense is a linebacker where all three starters return We have asked our linebackers to step it up he said They have played really well for us but we want them to just take an extra step to get even better The Longhorns had troubles with their place kicking in the spring and Brow n said the returnees and three walkons will compete for the starting job whe n twoadays begin in early August Summing up he said the Longhorns strengths are at quarterback wide receiver tight end the offensive line the defensive ends and the seconda ry He said defensive tackle will be a strong position too if Lee returns healthy and all the young players continue to improve When asked to comment on the most pleasant surprises from spring training Brown said Bo Scaife returning and looking like he is ready to play is on e Kyle Shanahan a walkon wide receiver did some really good things Derric k Dockery finally being healthy again was a big positive development He said all of the spindown moves the coaches made on defense this sprin g are looking good at this point We wanted to improve our speed on defense and these moves have helped us accomplish that Asked about the biggest disappointment in the spring drills he said It w as nobody emerging at tailback They all played good but after Ricky William s and Hodges Mitchell our expectations are very high True Orange Observations Look for the Longhorns to use more oneback formations this season Why Th e backup wide receivers and tight ends are more dangerous than the fullbacks WR Sloan Thomas and TE Brock Edwards would start and star for many teams b ut they are backups at Texas Also look for a lot more misdirection plays and other plays designed to ma ke the offense less predictable than it was last season With coach Mack Browns first great class of recruits heading into their third seasons and two other great classes following it this is the season the Longhorns should be able to finish in the top for the first time sin ce For those of you who seem to get a little impatient at times it is worth noting that the Longhorns have finished in the top just seven times sinc e and three of those seven times were in Browns first three years here th in st in and th in This Longhorn team probably will start out about fifth or sixth in the country and it should be able to stay in the top unless some wheels fall off The great thing about the way Brown has built this program is that he and h is assistants recruit great prospects every year and develop them I think this year will start a long string of years for UT to be contendin g for high national honors The only way you can win the highest national honor a national champio nship is to get to the championship game Since only two teams get to the championship game some very deserving team s are left out Miami and Washington for example were certainly deserving last year but unbeaten Oklahoma and oncebeaten Florida State got the nod So having an outstanding team doesnt guarantee a berth in the national title game I wont predict the Longhorns will wind up in the Rose Bowl playing for the national title this year but I will predict that Brown will have us playin g in a national championship game very soon Teams in the Big and SEC have the extra burden of having to play a postseason game for their conference titles which means they have to play two godzillas back to back to be No But great teams can do it and Texas will be a great team in the very near future It might not be this year but it could be if things break the Longhorns way Number Updated Frequently I update my number at least twice a week with football and football rec rui ting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call

Longhorn Faithful Volume No September Applewhite Freshmen Receivers Lead Horns To Opening Win UT No in AP Poll The Longhorns opened their season at home Saturday by falling behind a point underdog LouisianaLafayette team but Major Applewhite came off t he bench to spark a point second quarter that paved the way for a victory and a No ranking in the latest Associated Press Poll Heralded sophomore Chris Simms got the starting nod at quarterback over Applewhite who underwent offseason knee surgery after earning Big Offensive Player of the Year honors in But Simms had a rocky start and when his sideline pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown that gave the Ragin Cajuns a shocking lead with left in the first quarter the coaches turned to Applewhite to tr y to pump some life into the dormant Longhorn offense And he delivered big time He led the Longhorns to seven straight scores six touchdowns and a field goal before retiring for the day and lettin g Simms handle the mopup duties For the day Applewhite was of for yards and four touchdowns and that was in less than two quarters He came in for the final of the first quarter played all the second quarter and then left for keeps just deep into the third quarter with the Longhorns on top Coach Mack Brown still says the team has two firstteam quarterbacks and he still says he wont name a starter for the Stanford game but there is litt le doubt that the quarterback controversy is over and Applewhite is the starti ng quarterback once again These coaches grade on performance and his scoring percentage Saturday was perfect seven possessions seven scores that turned a hole into a romp when he left the game True freshmen wide receiver Roy Williams also had a big day He caught six passes for yards including a super onehanded grab for yards to get the Longhorns off their twoyard line Heading into this game the Longhorns had four big questions and three of them got positive answers Unfortunately the one that didnt get the positive answer was the key one Here are the questions and the answers at least for the short term Will the offensive line do a better job of blocking This is the one that didnt get the positive answer It actually did a good job of pass protecting but the Longhorns couldnt run the football against a bad team that has small defensive linemen Unless the line improves and the Horns can run with some success the good defensive linemen will do just what our defensive linemen do against the Oklahomas of the world which is pin their ears back and harass the quarterback on every play Will those young wide receivers be able to pick up the slack for Kwame Cavil Ryan Nunez and Jeremy Jones last years big three Yes Yes Yes Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas the three heralded true freshmen combined to catch passes for yards and another gjuy seeing his first action redshirt freshman Artie Ellis tacked on four more catches for more yards and two touchdowns As Darrell Royal used to say if a dog will bite hell bite as a pup These pups have big teeth and th ey know how to use them Will the special teams be better They were Saturday Brown said the kicking game was the best since weve been here and that tells the story Kris Stockton punted for a yard average the kickoffs went team and the Longhorn punt and kickoff returner s got some positive yardage Will the young defensive ends be able to fill in for fouryear starter Aaron Humphrey and Cedric Woodard a threestarter first at tackle then a t end Sophomores Cole Pittman and Cory Redding who was still bothered by a knee sprain and true freshman Kalen Thornton all played well and junior Jermai n Anderson who is swift but undersized did a good job of rushing the passer This is a Longhorn team with a lot going for it in terms of talent coachin g and a more favorable schedule but the lack of a dependable running game could prove fatal against a team that can pressure the quarterbacks Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER With the temperature at and rising the Longhorns won the toss and deferred The Cajuns ran the deep kickoff back to the then drove yard s in plays using up nearly half of the first quarter before stalling at the Longhorn and settling for a field goal to take a lead with left Simms getting the start over Applewhite at quarterback led the Horn s on a yard drive that ended when Kris Stockton was wide on a yard fiel d goal try The Cajuns couldnt move and had to punt but Simms thirddown pass was picked off by Terrance Hunter at the UT and he dashed in for th e score to give the point underdog Cajuns a lead with left Vict or Ike ran the kickoff back to the and Applewhite came in and hit TB Hodge s Mitchell for yards then found Williams twice for and yards to reach the Cajun as the quarter ended SECOND QUARTER Mitchell darted over right tackle for four yards and the touchdown on the first play of the quarter to get UT back in the game at On the Horns remaining four possessions in the half Applewhite swiftly moved them an d yards for touchdowns nine yards for a field goal and yards for a touchdown after a Joe Walker interception That point explosion put Texa s comfortably on top at at intermission In that decisive second quarte r Texas had yards offensively and Louisiana had THIRD QUARTER Ivan Williams ran the kickoff back to the UT and Applewhite took Texas o n two more quick scoring jaunts first zipping yards in five plays and the n going yards in four plays for two more TDs to push score to and gi ve him a perfect seven scores in seven tries Simms relieved him at that point and hit three straight passes to lead Texas to its final touchdown with left in the quarter Neither team threatened serious for the remainder of t he quarter FOURTH QUARTER The Longhorns went back to trying to run the ball in the final quarter without much success The Cajuns did have one late drive that got to the Texas before stalling but that was the last serious drive by either tea m True Orange Observations It was feast or famine for the Longhorns in the running game Heres the ne t gain on each running play in chronological order minus minus minus That is the primary reason Texas had the ball only and Louisiana had it Most of the successful runs were draw plays There were very few times when normal running plays made any yardage In a romp past an overmatched opponent this is no big deal But it could cost the team two or three games down the line unless the regular running plays start being more productive on a consistent basis Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting scoops The number is It costs a minute You must be to ca ll Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns had to quit trying to run the ball Saturday because LouisianaLafayette had guys lined up in every gap and they blitzed on every play He said he really wanted to establish a running game early but it was much more sensible to go to an allout passing attack because of the defense the Ragin Cajuns were playing Brown said I was surprised Major Applewhite was able to play as well a s he did the first time back after knee surgery Major played really well he said The protection was great The momentu m really changed when we put Major in but we also changed our offense and starting putting four wide receivers out on every play He said Applewhite and Chris Simms who started the game and played the fir st two series before giving way to Applewhite are both starting quarterbacks Chris had the great spring and he had an outstanding fall but it wasnt that Major got beaten out We just think we have two starting quarterbacks He also said You just as well not ask me about next weeks starter becaus e Im not going to say I didnt know who it would be in the opener but Im betting on Applewhite to get the nod Saturday night in Palo Alto against the dangerous Stanford Cardinal because of his outstanding relief duty Brown said he was pleasantly surprised with the way his young receivers performed Its been a long time since Ive seen freshmen play with composure like that he said Roy Williams became the first UT freshman ever to pick up a yard receiving game in his first start He grabbed six passes for yards including a spectacular onehanded catch on a yarder from Applewhite Roy really played well Brown said One of the catches he made was phenomenal Two other true freshman wide receivers B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas also had outstanding debuts B J made some great catches Brown said and Sloan comes in makes a catch on the sideline then makes two guys miss Im really pleased with the way the freshmen played Brown said They ke pt their poise and helped us win the game Artie Ellis a redshirt freshman also had a good day catching four passes for yards including two touchdowns Ellis was a smashing success during spring practice and was expected to mak e a big impact this year because of his pound frame and good speed a nd his ability to catch the ball in a crowd The four freshmen receivers accounted for of the Longhorns reception s and of their passing yards Littleused fifthyear senior Brandon Healy also made up for lost time wit h four catches two of them for touchdowns for a total of yards Getting back to the quarterback duel Brown said both players are handling the situation well and the team has confidence in both of them to get the job done We have to keep both of these quarterbacks upbeat Brown said Well nee d both of them to accomplish the goals we have set He said he and offensive coordinator Greg Davis talked to the guys long an d hard about playing two quarterbacks We will always talk to the players about the quarterback situation before anyone else he said Were not going to throw one in or out because of a fan poll At his Sunday press conference Brown said he was very pleased with the teams firstdown efficiency offensively and defensively and was happy with the special teams play Looking at the lack of run production he said When you score points its not important but for the season it is important He said the Longhorns will work hard on improving their running game this week We have to do a better job on running the football he said This was the fourth straight game in which the Horns had less than yard s rushing but they lost the other three to end last season so this time it wasnt fatal Brown said LouisianaLafayette deserves a lot of credit for playing hard an d he said Cajun QB Derek Dyer played really great But I thought our team was focused he said Louisiana had nothing to lose but he had a lot to lose and nothing to gain He said all aspects of the kicking game pleased him Saturday The kicking game was the best since weve been here he said Freshmen Play Fifteen freshmen played in Saturdays opening game Eight of them were true freshmen and seven were redshirt freshmen The eight true freshmen were WRs Roy Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas TE Brock Edwards DE Kalen Thornton DT Stevie Lee CB Nathan Vashe r and S Phillip Geiggar Williams Johnson Thornton and Lee played very early in the game The seven redshirt freshmen were WR Artie Ellis RB Ivan Williams FB Brett Robin OG Tillman Holloway DT Marcus Tubbs MLB Reed Boyd and S Dakarai Pearson Holloway started due to weakened condition of Derrick Dockery who was hospitalized last week with an infected cyst Pearson also started because he is the nickel back and defensive coordinato r Carl Reese came out with a fivedefensiveback formation to start the game Ellis and Boyd also saw a lot of early action Inexperience at wide receiver was expected to be a problem for the Longhorn s this season but the trio of big fast freshmen and Ellis combined Saturday to show it as a team strength Those guys dont play like freshmen Applewhite said Its a Great Time to Subscribe To The FaxEMail Service Ill Have Frequent Reports on Recruiting And Practice Throughout the

our oneminute offense when we got down because we wanted to force the tempo a little bit Its all shotgun formation during that time Longhorn offensive coordinator Greg Davis We played the dime six defensive backs about of the time They had three wideouts and another wideout in the backfield most of the time UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese I dont care who starts It really doesnt bother me as long as we stay undefeated and win the national championship It was exciting to be back ou t there Our line did a great job I only got hit one or two times Roy Williams is a phenomenal receiver Hes going to be great Texas QB Major Applewhite If I had known it was one on one I could have kept on running and made an even bigger play but I thought there was a safety coming over and I wanted to wrap it up before he got there If I hadnt seen that imaginary guy I might have had a really long play UT freshman WR Roy Williams explaining his onehanded grab of a ya rd pass to get the Longhorns started on a yard scoring drive They were bringing their safeties and blitzing all the time so we just we nt to our passing game Isnt that Roy Williams something He looks like hes been playing college football for years Longhorn RB Hodges Mitchell I was hungry to get out there When I came out of that tunnel and saw all those people it really fired me up I had fun out there and thought I didn t do bad for a first game Texas freshman WR B J Johnson They just came out and played hard We just had to gather oursevles After a couple of series we got things together UT AllAmerican DT Casey Hampton We drove the ball well at the start but we just werent able to put it in the end zone On the other end Major Applewhite was making good reads on h is completions He really got them going Louisiana QB Derrick Dyer If we had played all four quarters like we did at the start of the game i t would have been different Cajun DB Kyries Hebert We started pretty strong but then we got a little rattled out

Stanford The Longhorns face their first major test Saturday night when they play defending Pac champion Stanford in Palo Alto The game will start at Texas time and will be televised by the Fox Network Texas clobbered Stanford last year in Austin and the Cardinal will be trying to turn the tables this year Stanford went overall last season and won the Pac with a record But all four of the seniors they lost on offense were firstteam AllPac players They included QB Todd Husak and WR Troy Walters the leagues alltime leading receiver plus two veteran offensive linemen Six defensive starters return from last year including four linemen But only one linebacker and one defensive back who started a year ago are on ha nd Stanford opened the season with a victory over Washington State and the Cardinal defense did not allow an offensive touchdown but then the Cardinal fell to San Jose State Saturday night San Jose State beat Stanford with a powerful running game Spartan TB Deonc e Whitaker gained yards on carries scoring on runs of and yards and setting up two other TDs with long runs Stanford QB Randy Fasani threw for yards and four touchdowns in the offensive slugfest If the Longhorns are going to have a running game anytime soon this will b e their best chance to do it Texas probably will be at least a point favorite but this could be a dangerous game unless the Longhorns tackle better than they did last week a nd force a few turnovers The Horns also need to get their running game going or it will be one of those fourhour pass shootouts Here are the three keys to victory in my opinion Win the rushing battle That doesnt sound like a big order against the passhappy Cardinal but the Longhorns havent had a yard rushing game in their last four outings Put a lot of pressure on Fasani and do a good job of protecting the Texa s quarterbacks Take care of the ball Texas needs to win the turnover battle I think this is a dangerous road trip but Ill go out on a limb and pick t he Longhorns to win by a score I think Texas will pressure Fasani and take care of the ball Hopefully the Horns can run the ball too but two out of three should be good enough Big Roundup Texas plays at

Dallas Carter are UT commitments who are on USATodays Top national players Two other UT pledges OL Abe Robinson of Jersey Village and QBAthlete Kendal Briles of Frenship are on some national top lists Benson running behind an allnew offensive line is still racking up impressive numbers He had carries for yards and a TD plus a yar d reception in the defending state champions victory over a good Victoria team in the season opener then scored four touchdowns on just nin e carries good for yards in a romp past Longview His four TDs came on runs of and yards For the year he has carries yards and five touchdowns Behind an inexperienced OL he is averaging yards per carry and a touchdown every carries Terrance Young the huge Longview OL who also has committed to UT said it was a long way to go for a high school football game but he said it was worth it just to see Benson run I heard he was the best running back in the nation and he is awesome You ng said Blocking for him is going to be a lot of fun He is an awesome player Benson wont have the monster year he had last year at his present pace simply because he isnt carrying the ball as much Lee coach John Parchman trying for a third consecutive state title is working on a more diversified attack to try to spread things out a little more When you lose as many seniors as he did you have to improvise Briles the Class A Offensive Player of the Year while leading Stephenvill e to the state title in is at a new A school Wolfforth Frenship near Lubbock because his dad former Stephenville coach Art Briles is on the coaching staff at Texas Tech But dont worry about him requiring any time to get adjusted Frenship open ed its season Friday and Briles passed for yards and four touchdowns and r an for more yards and two more

Winston definitely won their individual battle At he is big enough to overpower most opponents and he is incredibl y quick at sliding out to pick up speed rushers He is still considering Texa s AM and a lot of other people and he is a prize Young is and he runs a sub He has a powerful arm but Aldine is a groundoriented team and he is outstanding on the option He wi ll be one of the states top recruits next year Selvin Young the great Jersey Village junior running back who topped the yard rushing mark as a sophomore is still bothered by the badly sprained ankle he suffered at the end of last season and he saw only limit ed action in his teams opener Eric Hall the fine defensive end from Clarksville Tenn took his officia l visit to Texas last weekend and his mother said he had a great

Mich AM UT Recruiting Proof Is in the Pudding Ive been covering recruiting since and there definitely is a correlation between recruiting success and success on the field But Dave Campbells Texas Football Magazine has been around a lot longer th an that and subscriber Grant Erwin of Dallas went back to the year befo re the Aggies finally started having success against Texas after decades of being hammered and compiled the results The magazine ranks recruiting classes in June of the following year so it is able to study every other ranking in detail before coming up with its own list of top recruits That should give it a great degree of accuracy Here is what the study showed DCTF Recruiting Rankings in the Southwest Conference plus results of UTA M game AM Texas UT won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won Texas AM AM won AM Texas Texas won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won Texas AM AM won AM Texas AM won Texas AM Texas won DCTF Recruiting Rankings in the Big XII South AM Texas Texas won Texas AM AM won Texas AM Texas won Texas AM AM won Texas AM Indicates recruiting battle won by a wide margin according to Dave Campbells rating system AM put together several outstanding classes in a row in the early s and kept it going with the exception of until Texas started having good recruiting success again in Its no coincidence that the Aggies who had never won more than three in a row against the Longhorns and that was way back in won five i n a row and nine times in years during their recruiting dominance over the Longhorns Team with superior talent rarely lose to less talented teams and that is w hy the Aggies enjoyed their decade in the sun But look at those recent classes All the strange happenings at AM last season delayed the inevitable in my opinion and if those recruiting rankings continue to prove as accurate a crystal ball as they have in the last two decades the Longhorns supremacy in recruiting should make this first decade of the new century a great one for UT in this long series whi ch the Horns already lead Four Baseball Stars Commit The Longhorn baseball coaches already have commitments from four top baseball players They are catcher Jack Sweeney of powerhouse Houston Bellaire and three hardthrowing righthanded pitchers Joey Guajardo wh o threw three nohitters as a junior at Round Rock and Austin Westlake aces Chaz Taylor and Huston Street Street who was with a ERA last season is the son of former UT football and baseball star James Street Taylor pitched a twohitter this summer against the Dallas Mustangs a powerful team that included seven college players or signees including Jas on Stokes of Coppell He struck Stokes out twice in that game Stokes a UT signee signed a million pro contract last week Sweeney started games as a freshman at Bellaire and has been a starter ever since He is the best defensive catcher in the country and also wields a powerful bat Basketball Recruiting The weekend of the first Longhorn football game also was a huge recruiting weekend for both Texas basketball teams T J Ford the point guard who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the Class A State Championship last season took his official visit to UT He said he enjoyed the trip I really like the coaches and the players and there are a lot of things to do at UT and in Austin he said He said he plans to visit Cincinnati and possibly Louisville and Houston before making a decision Ford is one of the top three point guards in the country The Longhorn women had two top recruits in town for official visits They a re forward Jody Bell of Chestermere HS in Calgary Canada and guard Lauren Selmon of Norman Okla Selmon is the daughter of former OU and pro football star Dewey

Volume No September Late Great Rally Comes Up Short at Stanford Texas Falls From No to No After Loss The Longhorns couldnt run couldnt protect the quarterback got a punt blocked for a Stanford touchdown and still almost won the game against the defending Pac champion Cardinals But they didnt Stanford won a verdict with a late touchdown that negated a point fourthquarter Texas rally Coach Mack Brown praised the Longhorns fight and they did fight and he said the team can build on the loss because it showed the young players the y have a chance to win tough games on the road We tried he said This one was tough because of the mistakes we made W e came back and had a chance to win it with those two big fourth quarter drives We just came up a little short Brown said the team has to work hard to improve He didnt single out the offensive line as a unit that needs to improve but while the receivers dropped some ball the quarterbacks missed some open receivers and the defense bent more than it should the one constant negative this year has been an inability to run the football After playing two teams who are not very good at stopping the run the Longhorns are last in the Big and No of Division I football tea ms in average rushing yardage per game at In two games they have net rushing yards The Longhorns actually ran the ball better against Stanford than they did against a weak LouisianaLafayette team in their opening win but the Cardinal defenders had five sacks to cut into the net figure I have been predicting a very good season and Brown has been saying the te am has some problems and must get better to accomplish its goals Hes right a nd Im wrong Lets just hope he and his assistant coaches can work out the problems in the offense in time to let the team accomplish its goals The victory gave Stanford a point underdog a record while the Longhorns fell to Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Stanford won the toss and took the ball After an exchange of punts Stanfo rd drove to midfield but backup DE Maurice Gordon sacked QB Randy Fasani and Fasani suffered an injured ankle and had to leave the game He was replaced by sophomore Chris Lewis A facemask penalty on a bad Stanford punt negate d that punt and gave Stanford a first down at the and the Cardinal took advantage of that Longhorn miscue scoring in four plays with Lewis hitting WR Luke Powell behind Quentin Jammer for the final yards to put Stanford ahead with left in the quarter DE Cory Redding blocked the extr a point Ivan Williams ran the kickoff back to the Texas drove to the Stanford before stalling Kris Stockton got off a great punt that kicked out of bounds at the Stanford A fumbled snap pushed Stanford inside the then Redding and DT Casey Hampton led a surge that trapped FB Casey Moore i n the end zone for a safety with left leaving Stanford on top Chr is Simms came in at QB for Texas and the Horns were at midfield as the period ended SECOND QUARTER Simms hit freshman WR Roy Williams down the middle for a yard touchdown strike on the third play of the quarter Williams broke an attempted tackle by CB Ryan Fernandez at the and strolled in for the score Stocktons ki ck put Texas on top with left Applewhite relieved Simms midway through the period Neither team threatened again until Stanford drove yards primarily on two big pass plays to take a left with left Neither team threatened again before intermission THIRD QUARTER Texas got the ball first but failed to make a first down and had to punt A horde of Stanford defenders poured through and blocked it and backup FB Emo ry Brock covered it in the end zone for a touchdown putting Stanford up just one minute deep into the second half The rest of the quarter was a defensive struggle with each team making only one first down FOURTH QUARTER Applewhite hit WR Montrell Flowers for yards on the second play of the fourth quarter to revive the long dormant UT offense and get the Horns started on a drive that enabled them to get into Stanford territory for the first time in the second half but a holding penalty and then a sack pushed the Horns back and killed the drive With left and Longhorn fans everywhere beginning to despair Texas starting from its own got back in the game on one huge play Applewhite found freshman WR B J Johnson behin d all the defenders and hit him for a yard scoring strike The Horns decid ed to go for a point conversion and after a pass interference penaty put th e ball on the Mitchell went over the top to get the twopointer and cut th e Stanford lead to with left The Texas defense again forced Stanford to punt quickly Mitchell returned the punt to the Texas Applewhite hit TE Mike Jones for yards to the Stanford but under a big blitz he was intercepted at the Stanford with left Stanford punted with left and Mitchell made a great punt return dashing yards to the Cardinal but a holding penalty on the return pushed the Horns back to the Backup TB Victor Ike was stopped for no gain and Applewhite threw an incomplete pass and to bring up thirdand Ike raced down the left sideline and caught Applewhites long throw just behind a Stanford defender and sprinted in for the TD putting Texas ahead with left Stanford got a good kickoff return to the Cardinal but couldnt move and had to punt giving Texas a chance to run the clock out with left A couple of first downs would have done it but two falsestart penalties left the Horns in a hole They made yards in three plays but faced a fourthand at their own and had to punt Stanford held in check throughout the second half by the Longhorn defense started i ts drive with left The Cardinal scored in five plays with Lewis hitting WR DeRonnie Phipps for yards to the Texas The Longhorns were called for roughing the passer and a penalty to the was tacked on After an incompletion Lewis found Pitts again and he barreled over for the winning TD with left Texas had enough time to come back but the Stanford defens e which already had three sacks got two more in that final minute to finish off the Longhorns Notes The Longhorns havent rushed for net yards in their last five games They are in those games with the lone victory being the season opener against LouisianaLafayette The Texas defense allowed Stanford only one first down in the third quarter and only two in the fourth quarter until the Cardinals winning drive in the final two minutes Texas had possessions Three of them resulted in touchdown two ended with pass interceptions ended with punts and the one at the end of the game ended on downs after Applewhite was sacked twice Texas three touchdown plays accounted for of the Longhorns total net yards It was a feastorfamine kind of game for the UT offense which only three other plays that gained more than yards Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting scoops The number is It costs a minute You must be to ca ll Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown was tired Sunday afternoon for his weekly postgame news conference The team plane left Palo Alto at am Texas time and got back to Austin around am But he was fairly upbeat You always hate to lose he said but if you have to lose you ought to lose early If youre going to lose it ought to be out of conference He said the only thing the lose really costs the Longhorns is a chance at going undefeated and were not a national championship caliber team in m y opinion He said the Horns can still accomplish a lot Look at Stanford last year he said You never want to lose a game but Stanford wins the Pac last year after they leave here with an embarrassing loss Brown said nothing went the Longhorns way in Palo Alto It was a night th at nothing worked for us but the positive thing is that we still had a chance to win No one asked him about his starting quarterback because he says he has two starters but it appears Major Applewhite is back in the saddle He started Saturday night and was the quarterback on of UTs possessions Sophomore Phil Simms got the other four possessions He cant comment on officiating without getting in trouble with the Big office but there were a lot of penalties against the Longhorns that came a t crucial times like the flagrant facemask call that negated Stanfords pun t on a fourthand and gave the Cardinal an automatic first down en route t o their first touchdown The Longhorns also had two false start penalties whe n they were trying to run out the clock with a lead They gained yar ds on their three plays that stood up but that left a yard short and they had to runThen there was a roughingthepasser penalty on Stanfords winning drive in the final two minutes While Brown couldnt comment after the game he had several animated discussions with the officials during the action Without commenting on the officiating he said They got a holding call on an incomplete pass on third down on one touchdown The face mask penalty le d to a score There was a late hit call on the quarterback on their last scoring drive Those things just abolutely kill because just about every one led to points for them Brown said the Longhorns didnt use their shotgun formation with four wideouts more because we werent throwing the ball and catching it very well Thats something we would have done more if we had done better at it We didnt have a good night throwing the ball overall he said We had some drops we had some passes that missed and we had some young receivers who were playing on the road for the first time Montrell Flowers was the g uy who played the best among the wide receivers and hes the most experienced It was a combination of errors on our passing game We were just not smooth Brown was asked about the teams performance in specific area that have caused problems in the past and have gotten special attention like the offensive line and the special teams He said After looking at the tape the offensive line played better than we thought The blitzes were our big problem It looked worse than it was I feel like weve made some progress with our offensive line Weve got to ke ep working on that I think the special teams have improved a lot We had some kickoff returns and Hodges Mitchell had the good punt return but we had a blocked punt for a touchdown We had to punt a lot but that blocked punt really bothers me We cant have one no matter how many times we have to punt Thats the part they have to focus on He said Texas has to bounce back quickly from the long tiring road trip coupled with the loss Our guys are totally exhausted We got back at am Sunday Thats why we didnt go to Hawaii because we knew it would be a hard game and a l ong trip Our team played really hard This was tough because we played so hard but had too many mistakes But our kids fought all the way Thats what we have to build on Weve got another game Saturday Houston is not going to care about our loss he said Itll probably excite them We can sit around and mope or we can get ready to play again This was a little eye opener for us to get better and move forward He said players and coaches cant get as up or down as fans because they kn ow they have to get ready to play another game and cant dwell on a win or a loss until the season is over Thats the least of my worries he said They really tried When you really try and you can come back on the road and have a chance to win that s something thats a positive to build on He said this game will help the team later on because it was a game the Hor ns could have won on the road against a good team We just made too many mistakes he said Thats something we can correct If we had a team that didnt care that it didnt both to lose thats the worst thing that can happen to you as a coach but thats not the problem After the game Saturday night Brown said most of the players were so upset they were crying We can build on this he said We have a really young football team We ll come back and get better We can correct the mistakes We took a big step in these big games by just hanging in there and hanging in there As long as theyll fight you can coach them and they fought all the way It was mistakes that cost them not their effort and that can be fixed We made three or four mistakes that probably cost us the game Brown said the bottom line is were a young team and we will get better INJURY UPDATE Brown said safety Lee Jackson has a strained hamstring and linebacker Marcus Wilkins has a sore groin He said those appeared to be th e only injuries sustained in the Stanford game and both players

defensive tackle Shaun Rogers We just have to keep fighting A loss like this really hurts but we have to bounce back and win the rest of them Longhorn linebacker DeAndre Lewis I wont know for sure what happened until we look at the tape We got some confidence and some momentum in the fourth quarter but we made too many mistakes early in the game Stanford has a good team and we just made too

mistakes and we can still have a great season if we can improve and elimina te some of the mistakes UT tailback Hodges Mitchell This was the biggest win weve had Texas has a very good team and we were

nigh t when they host Houston at pm in a game that will be a regional Fox telecast The Cougars won their first game of the season Saturday defeating Army Army had a chence to win with a yard field goal on the final play of the game but UH defensive back Emile White blocked it Houston had lost its first two games to Rice in overtime and to LSU New Cougar coach Dana Dimel has installed an allout passing offense and hi s QB senior Jason McKinley is fifth in the nation in total offense with yards per game The Cougars are sixth in passing with yards per game and WR Brian Robinson is among the national leaders with catches for yards The Cougars gained yards against Army and ran plays Defensively Houston has struggled In losing to Stanford last week the Longhorns lost all three of the keys to victory I cited in my scouting report They lost the rushing battle they didnt put as much pressure on the Stanford QBs as the Cardinal defenders p ut on the Texas signal callers and they had two turnovers while Stanford had none The Cougars are far less formidable than Stanford so Texas should win fair ly easily Here are three keys to victory in my opinion Do a better job of running the football Thats not a huge order since t he Horns are averaging only yards per game on the ground Protect the Texas quarterbacks Stanford got five sacks and had tremendo us pressure on the Texas QBs most of the game Put a lot of pressure on McKinley The Texas secondary gives up a lot of big plays when opposing QBs have time to throw LongRange Outlook Coach Mack Brown likes to talk about four or five key games on the schedule He doesnt mean the other games are against patsies but lets ta ke a look at the teams Texas plays this year First there are six games the Longhorns should win The opening victory ov er LouisianaLafayette was one of those The others are Houston Oklahoma Stat e Missouri Baylor and Kansas If Texas takes care of business in those six games the other five will be the key to going or or somewhere in between this season Stanford as Brown noted was one of the key games so Texas is in the big games The others are Oklahoma Colorado Texas Tech and Texas AM Texas needs to win at least three of those to have a chance to finish a nd win the Big s Southern Division title Big Roundup Texas lost at Stanford and Colorado fell to visiting Washington in the Big

picked up two more commitments last week getting LB Lance McFarland of Jefferson early in the week followed by a pledge from his teammate RB Anthony Johnson on Friday Johnson rushed for more than yards in a loss to defending Class A chamion Texarkana LiberyEylau earlier this season He has great power outstanding moves and tremendous speed In other words he has all the attributes of an outstanding running back He also has confidence The Longhorns already have a commitment from super Midland Lee RB Cedric Benson but Johnson says that doesnt worry him I want to play on a great college team he said Youre going to have competition wherever you go if you want to play for a winning program His coach Jerry Bennett is the brother of Kansas States defensive coordinator and Johnson said the Wildcats finished No on his list The Wildcats also were after McFarland a hardnosed tackle with good speed for a linebacker He won a fatboy event after his sophomore year wit h an clocking Only players who weighed more than pounds competed The two additions give the Longhorns early commitments It looks more an d more like the Texas coaches will award close to scholarships because th ey still hope to add four of five defensive linemen a quarterback a tight en d a wide receiver a linebacker a safety and at least one cornerback Seven of the Longhorns commitments are offensive linemen Texas has signed only three offensive linemen in each of coach Mack Browns three previous recruiting classes and he said heading into this recruiting season that the offensive line was the No priority But he also said the defensive line was a high priority and that is where most of the remaining scholarships probably will be awarded Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter a national top player Abe Robinson Jersey Village a national top player Alfio Randall Blinn JC was a national top player two years ago Mike Garcia Galena Park was the Aggies top early pledge before switching to UT Will Allen Cypress Falls is in his three year as a starter Roman Reeves another of the states top eight offensive linemen Terrance Young Longview is tremendously

Anthony Johnson Jefferson No on my top list Linebacker Yamil LeBron Killeen Ellison was the middle backer the Longhorns targeted early Lance McFarland Jefferson No on my top list Defensive Back Cedric Griffin San Antonio Holmes one of the states top two cornerbacks Kendal Briles Wolfforth Frenship a great option QB who wi ll play safety at Texas Braden Johnson Euless Trinity a fine athlete who is

Jakes of Valencia H S in Placentia Cal says he will visit this weekend or the following weeken d Jakes is playing nose guard this year and said he had two sacks and several other tackles for losses in Valencias opening victory over Palmdale Highland He said Highland is supposed to have a playoffcaliber team and we really shut them down Jakes lived in Plano when he was in junior high and he said he is strongly considering coming to UT I really like the way football is king in Texas he said Super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison and outstanding OL William Winston of Houston Madison both say they plan to come to the Houston game this weekend on unofficial visits Harris is the nations top DT prospect and Winston is a dominating OL UT pledg e Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity rallied his team from a thirdquarter deficit to a victory over Arlington Martin by running and yards for TDs DE Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn took his official visit to Texas the Sept weekend and said he really enjoyed it He said Texas is h is favorite right now but said he wants to take some other visits before committing to anyone Hall was born in Fort Hood and like Jakes says he h as fond memories of Texas football Satchell Richardson Status Two Longhorn freshmen football players linebacker Aurmon Satchell and RB Tyrone Richardson have been lost to the team for at least this semester Satchell and Richardson both said they have some academic issues that need to be resolved before they can return Both said they hope to be back in Janua ry Satchell is from Denver Jefferson and Richardson is from Clarksville True Orange Observations Coach Mack Brown is in his third year of what should have been a major rebuilding job at Texas Thanks to the way he and his assistants took charge and changed one of the nations worst defenses into one of its best and thanks to the way they recruit the Longhorns are already back among the nations elite I know they lost at Stanford I didnt like it The coaches and players didnt like it either It bothers them even more than it bothers us But Texas hasnt finished among the nations top in football since so we probably all expected too much from this team The Horns will finish in the top again very soon and probably next year if not this one With three great recruiting classes already in school and a fourth in the making there are going to be a lot more Ws than Ls in the weeks and year s ahead Lets be grateful for what he and his assistants and players have accomplished and help them get back on the winning track Gustafsons Lawsuit Dismissed State District Judge J Scott McCown ruled last week that former Longhorn baseball coach Cliff Gustafsons lawsuit against UT athletic director DeLos s Dodds has no merit and he dismissed it McCown also said Dodds has official immunity from such a lawsuit The lawsuit alleged that Dodds falsified an outside income statement by Gustafson and provided false information to thenUT president Robert Berdah l that Gustfson has violated university rules by maintaining a nonuniversity bank account for a baseball camp The suit alleged Dodds actions forced hi m to resign The judge ordered Gustafson to pay Dodds court costs Basketball Recruiting T J Ford the outstanding point guard at Fort Bend Willowridge says he h ad a great visit to Texas the Sept weekend but isnt ready to commit to anyone until he looks at some other schools UCLA probably is the Horns main competition for Ford a super quick star who is the states No prospect He led Willowridge to the state Clas s A title and a record last season Coach Rick Barnes only has one more scholarship to award so UTs recruitin g will be over for this year if Ford commits to the Longhorns The Longhorn women are going to get a visit late this month from Kala Bower s a forward from Woodward Okla She is a national top star who plays on a team that has lost only two games in the last two years Coach Jody Conradt already has a pledge from the states top prospect forward Heather Schreiber of Windthorst Kelly to Miss Fall Semester Senior guard Darren Kelly will miss the fall semester Longhorn basketball coach Rick Barnes announced last week Kelly hopes to return to game action for the Longhorns following the fall semester It is going to be difficult not being able to play this fall but I have some academic issues that I need to take care of to return to the team Kelly said I am going to attempt to take care of that this fall and hope to rejoin the team in December Kelly was slated to return for his second season as the teams starting shooting guard He earned Big Conference AllNewcomer and AllBench team recognition as a junior averaging points and rebounds per game He was third on the squad in scoring and second in assists last season He also was the top threepoint shooter on the team and secondbest in the Big including a mark in league play of Im sad for Darren because he had made such great strides in his game duri ng the latter part of last year and over the summer and he had really taken a strong leadership role on this team Barnes said With the addition of so many new guys this year theres no question that his loss in the fall will hurt us Hopefully hell be able to return to the team and give us a big lift heading into Big Conference play A True Orange Subscription Is The Gift You Can Get Every Year for Your

selective in making offers to recruits so far this spring but that will change next month when they host some of the top blue chippers at their summer camps The Aggies have two commitments to the Longhorns one pledge from my man differencemaker list on page but that will all change in June Coach Mack Brown is the one who invented early recruiting in Texas and he did it through his June camps That hasnt changed The only thing that has changed is that the Aggies went out in March and April and gave offers to about kids Theres nothing wrong with that and I am not knocking their strategy But Browns strategy works and there is no reason for him to change it If you look at the last three February signing days youll know why he doesnt need to change it Meanwhile the Horns got one offensive lineman they wanted when they got a pledge from terrific run blocker Bret Valdez of Brownwood The Aggies got commitments last week from center Bob Morton of McKinney the guy I have rated as the best offensive lineman in the state and LTydrick Riley of Crockett the top recruit in the state in the athlete category Texas probably would have offered Riley a scholarship at some point if he had not committed to AM but the Longhorn coaches did not recruit Morton as hard as they are recruiting several other offensive linemen in the state I think when the dust settles in February the Longhorns will have another great class signed and ready for delivery They got commitments last June en route to a national top five recruiting class and they probably will have close to that number at the end of June this year Most of those commitments last June were from big offensive linemen who were just what the Longhorns needed Several of them this June could be from big defensive linemen and thats where the Longhorns need to load up this season DT Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Arizona younger brother of current UT LB Austin Sendlein and son of former UT and pro LB Robin Sendlein told me he probably will commit to Texas when he attends the Longhorns early June camp He is the top recruit in Arizona and is being heavily recruited by top schools all over the country DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos also plans to attend a UT camp next month and he is another possibility for an early commitment In a year when the state is loaded with top defensive line prospect he is a star among stars The best DT of them all however is Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings He probably wont commit early but he likes the Longhorns Wright is a pounder with outstanding quickness and he does the best job of staying low and collapsing the line of scrimmage of anyone I have seen in the nation If Texas can sign Wright Anderson Sendlein and Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo they will be set at defensive tackle and they have the inside track with all four of them Studdard is the son of former UT and Denver Bronco offensive line star David Studdard Anderson like Keller DT Tully Janszen is a super quick starter who could play end or tackle in college At DE the top guy in Texas is Travis Leitko of The Woodlands He is a super student who is pretty wide open but he likes the Longhorns and he also is friends with redshirt freshman QB Chance Mock and incoming freshman WRDB Brian Carter two Longhorns who are former Woodlands stars Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel brother of Cole Pittman who was expected to contend for a starting job at DT with Texas this year before being killed in a tragic auto accident also is an outstanding DE prospect who is like Leitko very quick and very physical He is strongly considering Texas The coaches also want a super quick DE and their best hope in Texas might be Nick Owino of Alief Elsik They also are trying to get in on Zack Latimer who led Colorado in sacks last year with at Aurora Gateway But Latimer is AllState in both football and basketball and could opt for the latter in college Owino and Latimer are the kind of outside speed rushing defensive ends the Longhorn coaches have been seeking since they arrived at Texas The two fastest junior football players in the state are also two of the best ones And thats no coincidence because you cant tackle something you cant catch RB DaBryan Blanton of Forney broke the sprint records in Class A with a smoking in the meters and a in the meters Not since the days of Roy Martin a quarter century ago have I seen a high school sprinter run a meters like that The times at the state meet are all fully automatic which makes them officially seconds slower than hand times In the old handtimed days he would have had a He also anchored Forneys meter relay team to victory in Blanton is an outstanding running back but he probably will be a wide receiver or defensive back in college He is pretty wide open on his college choices but he is considering Texas CB Edorian McCullough of North Garland won thge A in finished second in the in flat and anchored his teams meter relay team to second place making up a lot of ground to pull from fourth to second McCullough was undefeated in the meters this year He is a top RBCB prospect who favors Texas over Oklahoma The talent level in Texas this year is very high About Texas players have been listed on one or more national groupings and there are some other outstanding players who are equally talented but who are not as well known yet One interesting factor this year is geography In most year the Houston area has most of the really elite prospects Houston is very strong at the top again with the top two and three of the top five players on my differencemaker list on page But the DallasFort Worth area runs deeper in talent this year than the HoustonGulf Coast area with a edge on my list of the top The other nine players on the list include four from East Texas three from West Texas and two from the Austin area The talent runs very deep at defensive tackle and defensive end this year for the first time since Brown and his staff arrived in Austin There also are some big linebackers like Glenn Jackson of Carrollton Turner who are bigframed guys who already weigh and might grow into pound defensive ends in college Jackson runs a and is an outstanding pass rusher from the corner There also is a lot of talent at quarterback and if a school misses on a top signal caller in this recruiting class there are a pair of kids who will be juniors this season who already have college recruiters salivating They are James Battle who ran Recruiting continued from page and passed a Denton Ryan team that was in deep into the Class A playoffs last year and Devon Williams of Arlington Houston a quickfooted runner with a powerful arm Both will be top national recruits next year The Longhorns also want to sign a great running back every year and while the class of running backs doesnt run very deep Albert Hardy of Galena Park is a power runner deluxe with fine speed and he likes the Longhorns There are some very good wide receivers in Texas this year but the best one I have seen on tape is Marquis Johnson of Champaign Ill If he played in Texas he would be high in my top and would be easily the No wide receiver He likes the Longhorns and super UT recruiter Tim Brewster was in Champaign last week to visit his high school He only lives three blocks from the Illinois campus so lets hope he has a yen to travel He is a big physical receiver who has speed moves and great hands There is one receiver in Texas I havent seen play but I have heard good things about him and I saw him run a fine leg on Klein Forests thirdplace meter relay team at the state meet He is Anthony Wright another big guy with speed who has a reputation for being physical I plan to see him play in early September and might move him up on the list after that Texas needs to sign a tight end too and it will be an uphill fight to land Eric Winston of Midland Lee who is easily the top one in the state He comes from an Aggie family but says he will consider Texas too Horns rd in Baseball Play Ags Texas wound up third in the Big baseball race and will play No seed Texas AM Wednesday at am in Oklahoma City in the first round of the conference

Volume No September Defense Special Teams Dominant in Rout Longhorns Heading into Big Action The Longhorns stampeded past the Houston Cougars Saturday night in Austin posting their first home shutout in nine years and getting dominati ng play from the defense and special teams The victory got Texas back on the winning track and pulled the Longhorns up to No in both major polls The Longhorns are heading into their Big opener Saturday against Oklahoma State The Longhorn defense was so dominant that it scored two touchdowns and Houston which has one of the nations most potent offenses got inside the Texas yard line only two times The defense blocked a field goal to blunt the first threat and sacked Couga r QB Jason McKinley forcing a fumble to kill the second one Special teams a headache a week ago in the loss at Stanford were outstanding Kris Stockton punted for a yard average and had three pun ts killed inside the UH including one at the yard line UT also blocked a field goal and got a special teams touchdown when Quentin Jammer caused a fumble on a punt and Michael Ungar recovered it in the Houston end zone The offense started slowly making only two first downs and getting only on e net yard in the first quarter but the great defensive effort provided a safety net and the offense started moving more efficiently as the game progressed Head coach Mack Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis said the offense has been under so much pressure to play better that they thought the player s were a little too tight to start the game McKinley was one of the nations top passers heading into the game after three straight yard passing game but a fierce Texas pass rush limited him to yards through the air on of passing and sacked him nine times for minus yards The Horns also picked him off twice and returned both for touchdowns Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Texas won the toss and deferred Houston drove to midfield and punted Sophomore Chris Simms got the start at quarterback for Texas but his firs t pass bounced off WR Montrell Flowers hands and was intercepted by Cougar F S Hanik Milligan at the UT The Longhorn defense held with LB Everick Raw ls getting a sack and Mike Clark tried a yard field goal but UT LB Tyrone Jones blocked it But the Horns couldnt move and had to punt Then the defense took over putting Texas on top to stay Redshirt freshman SS Dakar ai Pearson getting his first start in place of the injured Lee Jackson intercepted McKinleys pass down the middle and galloped yards untouched to put Texas on top with left Moments later Stockton got a gre at punt that went yards and was killed at the UH The Longhorn defense forced Houston to punt from the and TB Hodges Mitchell ran the kick back yards to the Applewhite came in at QB and backup TB Victor Ike got yards then more to the behind good line blocking But the Cougars swarmed Ike for a yard loss on the last play of the quarter The Cougars had a big statistical advantage for the quarter leading in first downs and in total offense but thanks to the blocked field goal and the defensive TD UT led SECOND QUARTER Applewhite fumbled the snap but recovered it for a yard loss He hit Mitchell for yards to the and Stockton kicked a yard field goal fo r a lead with left Pearson recovered a Cougar fumble a minute lat er at the Cougar and the Longhorns third TB Kenny Hayter got five yards in two tough runs then Applewhite hit freshman WR B J Johnson for yards to the UH A sreen pass to freshman WR Sloan Thomas lost to the but then Applewhite found Johnson again with a quick pass in the flat and he turned on the speed to the yard line Ike scored on the next play and Stocktons kick gave UT a lead with left The Longhorn defenders again forced a quick Houston punt but Applewhite threw an interception to give Houston another shot from midfield Simms came back in at QB on the ne xt series and played the remainder of the quarter At the half despite having three passes intercepted and having gained only yards the Longhorns wer e in control at Houston had only yards offensively THIRD QUARTER With Applewhite back at the controls Texas opened the second half by drivi ng yards to set up a yard Stockton field goal that raised UTs lead to with left A yard run by Mitchell and passes of and yar ds from Applewhite to WR Montrell Flowers did most of the damage on the drive The Cougars came right back with their only sustained drive of the game zipping from their own to the UT but DE Cory Redding sacked McKinley and he fumbled with Redding covering the loose ball That was the Cougars last scoring threat The Longhorns punted quickly but Jammers jarring tackle forced a fumble on the return and Ungar fell on it in the end zone f or another Texas TD and a lead with left Neither team threatened again in the quarter FOURTH QUARTER Applewhite hit Mitchell for and Flowers for on the Horns first possession then Mitchell ran yards to the Houston Hayter came in and got the TD to give Texas a advange with left On Houstons next possession UT LB O J McClintock intercepted McKinleys pass and returned it yards for a score and a lead with left Simms came back in and engineered the Horns final TD drive hitting passes of yards to backup TB Ivan Williams to Flowers and then the yard scoring pass to fullback Matt Trissel with left The Horns almost scored again in the final minute when Simms hit true freshman WR Sloan Thomas for yards to t he Cougar but Williams fumbled on the final play SUMMARY The Texas defense was a picture of consistency Saturday never allowing Houston to get anything going offensively The Cougars ran plays for yards in the first quarter plays for yards in the second period plays for yards in the third quarter and plays for yards in the fourth quarter The Texas offense started slowly running plays for one net yard in the first quarter getting plays for yards in the second period running plays for yards in the third quarter and wrapping up with an play yard final period UTOU Likely am Start The official announcement wont come until noon today but its pretty certain that the TexasOklahoma game

fourth and Texas way back at th and fifth Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday afternoon the Longhorns are improving in a lot of areas but still need to play better On defense our secondary has improved a lot he said Our young defensi ve ends are playing a lot better Last night was one of the few times that we didnt give up big plays in the passing game We had a good pass rush and the secondary did a good job Offensively we are starting to run it a little bit better but we are sti ll not running it like we need to he said I also think we are gaining a lo t of depth Our special teams last night were outstanding Brown said They were as good as they have been since we got here He said TB Hodges Mitchell was chosen as the offensive player of the game and FS Quentin Jammer whose hard tackle on a punt forced a fumble that resulting in a Texas touchdown was the defensive player of the game He said three players shared the honors for the special teams They were LB Tyrone Jones who blocked a field goal Jammer and walkon Michael Ungar w ho covered the fumbled punt Jammer caused for his first collegiate touchdown Brown said he was pleased the offense did score four of the five time it g ot in the red zone with the only failure being the one at the end of the game He also said some of the Longhorns young defensive players really came of age against Houston Brown said sophomore DE Cory Redding played by far his best game and he said redshirt freshman DT Marcus Tubbs had two of our nine sacks Were really excited about his quickness off the ball and his explosiveness He a nd redshirt freshman safety Dakarai Pearson were really pleasant surprises Asked about throwing deep in the final minute of the game Brown said It s really a hard decision when you look at it My job is to do whats best for our football team He said the two big factors to consider were that sophomore QB Chris Simms needed some confidence and Houston had just gone for a fourth and six at their yard line We had five freshmen in there at the end of the game and Chris hadnt had a lot of success I wasnt trying to run up the score but I have to do what s best for our team INJURY UPDATE Brown said the rash of injuries at defensive tackle has real ly cut into the teams depth AllBig Shaun Rogers suffered a sprained ankle on an illegal chop block and Brown said he wont have any idea how long Rogers will be out until he talks to the team doctors Monday Freshman Stevie Lee sore foot and redshirt freshman Ryan Haywood sore shoulder didnt suit up for the Houston game Brown said Haywood might hav e a rotary cuff problem which might require surgery to repair Safety Lee Jackson who missed the Houston game with a strained hamstring is expected back for Oklahoma State Freshman wide receiver Roy Williams also suffered a bruised arm early in th e Houston game but it did not appear to be an injury that would sideline him against Oklahoma State Junior offensive tackle Mike Williams sustained a bruised collarbone that sidelined him for the rest of the game but its severity is not known Football Notes Five players scored their first touchdowns as Longhorns They are redshirt freshman safety Dakarai Pearson who had a yard interception return for a score sophomore linebacker O J McClintock who ran another interception back yards for a touchdown redshirt freshman running back Kenny Hayter who scored on a yard run sophomore fullback Matt Trissel who ran six yards for the final touchdown and walkon Michael Ungar who recovered a fumble in the end zone The official statistics for the game credited Texas with eight sacks but coach Mack Brown said Sunday the defensive staff said the team had nine sacks Either way its great pass rushing Defensive ends Jermain Anderson and Cory Redding had three of them Defensive coordinator Carl Reese has be en saying he needs to get more production from his ends and he got his wish Saturday night The victory gives the Longhorns a lead in their matchups with the Cougars Texas leads in games played

play tight covera ge and get a pass rush from our front four We blitzed some but not as much a s usual The kids really played great This was probably our most consistent effort for a whole game Those goose eggs are hard to come by UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese It was Horns thats what were excited about The defense played great Offensively we withstood the early surge and moved the ball tetter in the second half Its hard to be consistent offensively in todays game because of all the blitzes I think our guys were so uptight to do well tha t they made some mistakes early in the game UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis reacting to a question about the offenses slow start Our young guys like DT Marcus Tubbs and SS Dakarai Pearson really stepped up big We needed that It was really tough about Shaun Rogers because it was a dirty play Longhorn AllAmerican DT Casey Hampton talking about the chop block t hat injured his fellow DT Rogers and the way redshirt freshmen Tubbs and Pearso n filled in for injured starters We just stepped it up another notch The quarterback was under a big rush and I got a good break on the ball Texas redshirt freshman safety Dakarai Pearson talking about his interception and runback for the first touchdown I was real proud of the way responded We had really worked hard on the punting team this week My punts dont usually bounce forward Sometimes th at can be a curse but this time it worked out right UT punter Kris Stockton who averaged yards per kick and had thre e killed inside the including one at the yard line Weve been able to hold the ball longer Against a very good defensive lin e like Texas has you have to get rid of it a lot quicker and sometimes you have to get rid of it before you really want to Houston head coach Dana Dimel commenting on the fierce Texas pass ru sh It was great to have a win like that The defense played great They gave us the ball in great field position It takes a lot of pressure off the

Oklahoma State in a game that will be televised by ABC The Cowboys opened their season with a win over Tulsa then blanked Southwest Texas before suffering their first loss at the hands of nationally

like the Texas coaches He said Darryl Drake and Everett Withers were the two Texas coaches who recruited him and he said Withers the Texas secondary coach came to see him play in his second game this season He is a big fast corner with long arms but dont look for him to get many picks this year because he doesnt get many passes thrown his way because h e is so good at tight manforman coverage I went to Waco Friday night to see the Lions play Tyler Lee Waco LB Derric k Johnson scored one touchdown on an yard interception return and just generally wreaked havoc on Lees efforts to make a game of it Waco won and Johnson is as good a linebacker as I have seen in Texas recently He is or weighs around and he can really run He has the frame to carry pounds without losing any speed He says Texas is his No choice but he also says he probably will take a ll five official visits before making a decision Other schools in contention are AM FSU Oklahoma and UCLA but he says Id like to play pretty close to home so my friends and family could see m e play His teammate DT Sharod McGowan is listed in the program as being and He doesnt look that heavy but he is a dominating player too on occasion

womens softball team She said she will sign with Texas during the early signing period that begi ns in November In adding to pitching for her high school she was the ace pitcher last summer for the Katy Cruisers team that won the national title for the ASA andunder Gold Division which was the top national group At the ASA National Tournament in St Louis she struck out in innin gs and pitched one perfect game and one nohitter while going against the top high school seniors and college freshmen in the country Osterman pitched against the U S Olympic team last summer while playing f or the Katy Cruisers and struck out of the batters she faced while allowing just one hit in five innings The Cruisers were the only team to take the Olympic team to extra innings losing in eight innings The only other pitchers who struck out more Olympians were professional tea m pitchers who went seven full innings and none of them struck out more than Carol Adcock Ostermans coach at Cypress Springs said She could have go ne anywhere she wanted Every top softball program in the nation wanted her Adcock said Osterman compares favorably with former Longhorn AllAmerican a nd current Olympian Christa Williams at a comparable stage in their careers Cat doesnt throw quite as hard as Christa did in high school Adcock sai d but she has more movement on her pitches She is as dominating as any high school pitcher I have seen Osterman had a record last season at Cy Springs She gave up only one earned run during the season and had an ERA that looks like a misprint at Adcock said she struck out in innings last season averaging strikeouts per inning game Adcock said Her best pitch is a rise ball Its great but she also has a very good drop ball and a great curve UT softball coach Connie Clark cant comment on recruits until they sign b ut Osterman is clearly the kind of dominating pitcher she has been looking for since Williams skipped her senior season to play on the Olympic team Ostermans final five schools were Texas Stanford Washington Oklahoma an d UCLA She also is an outstanding student who ranks in the top in her class S he is dedicated too She was pitching to her dad in the family driveway when I called her Sunday at pm to confirm her commitment Top Pitcher Commits to UT Luis Cortez a hardthrowing righthanded pitcher with outstandi ng control has announced he will sign a baseball scholarship with the Longhor ns Cortez had a ERA at Sinton last year and he played with a top AAU team the Ohio Thunder this summer and went with one save and a ERA He was the youngest player on the Ohio Thunder and was one of only three players on the team with remaining high school eligibility His best pitches are a slider and a fast ball that has been clocked as high as miles per hour but is consistent in the mph area He also has a good curve and a changeup He averaged two strikeouts per inning at Sinton last season Cortez also is an outstanding student He makes straight As and is

Number October Part of Parts Longhorns Find Running Game Just in Time To Maul OSU in Big Opener OU Next Foe The Longhorns ran over around and through the Oklahoma State Cowboys and their No rated rushing defense Saturday en route to a victory befor e a sellout crowd in Austin The Cowboys while they hadnt played a good rushing team in their first three games had allowed only net yards rushing all season and they real ly do have a pretty salty front seven Led by sophomore Kenny Hayters yards the Longhorns had net yards rushing It was the first time Texas has has net rushing yards in a gam e since the thumping of Texas Tech last season In the six games they played between Texas Tech and Oklahoma State when the y couldnt reach the century mark in rushing its no coincidence that they w on just twice But they utilized a new gapblocking technique to combat the Cowboys stunting defense and it worked to near perfection because Hayter who was a little used thirdteam tailback turned a lot of little holes into big ones with his hard running While the rebirth of the running game was the big overall story it didnt happen until the second half and UT had a shaky lead at that point Texas still might have lost the game without three crucial earlier developments a huge passing play a great defensive stand after still another special teams goof and a penalty against the Cowboys that wiped out a potentially gameturning interception The huge passing play of course was Major Applewhites yard passandr un connection with sensational freshman WR Roy Williams six minutes deep into the second half The Horns were holding a fragile lead at the time they were facing a thirdand and they had already had so many problems with their punting team that UT fans everywhere were simply hoping for a miracle first down After all coaches everywhere say the first five minutes of the second half is the most crucial period in a tight game and the first five minutes had been all Oklahoma State The Longhorns hadnt even made a first down since the intermission But they got a lot more than that Williams got past the Cowboy cornerback who was covering him and Applewhite looked left and drew the safety back toward the middle When he finally looked to the right and heaved the ball the only question was whether Williams could catch up to it because there are few people in college football who can catch the fleet freshman He did catching it on his fingertips and racing untouched the rest of the way That yard play gave Texas a lead and it was all downhill after that for the Longhorns But that play was a gamebreaker only because the Longhorn defense stopped t he Cowboys cold early in the second quarter when a fake punt lost yardage and put OSU in possession at the UT and because an interception of a Chris Simms pass and a long runback inside the UT was negated by a personal foul penalty against the Cowboys The defensive stand came on the series after a blocked UT punt set up OSUs only touchdown The Cowboys were leading and the Longhorns at that point hadnt generated enough offense to indicate they could fall farther behind The disallowed interception was a possible point swing because OSU might have scored with a firstandgoal inside the UT Instead the Horns kept the ball and continued a drive that ended in the field goal that opened the scoring Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Neither team threatened early but the Horns dodged a bullet on their secon d possession They started in good field possession but Simms threw an interception that was run back inside the UT before a personal foul against OSU negated the play and gave Texas a first down at the OSU Tex as couldnt move and Stockton kicked a yard field goal to put the Horns ahead with left OSU TB Reggie White broke loose for yards to the UT on the Cowboys next possession but the UT defense held and the Cowboys missed a chipshot field goal try Applewhite came in at QB for Texas UT led at the end of the quarter but the Longhorns had only o ne first down on the penalty that negated the long interception return and just yards of total offense compared to for OSU SECOND QUARTER The UT defense stopped OSU and forced a punt With Applewhite still in at QB sophomore RB Kenny Hayter got a first down on two tough runs then seni or TB Hodges Mitchell took a quick pitch around left end for yards But Applewhite was sacked and his thirddown pass to freshman WR B J Johnson was dropped That was unfortunate because it forced Stockton to punt the snap was high a defender got loose up the middle and the kick was blocked Stockton covered it at the UT and OSUs White scored in two plays galloping yard to the then bursting up the middle untouched for the score to put OSU ahead with left The next UT drive also came u p short but facing fourth and at their own the Horns went with a fake punt It was a disaster and Stockton was tackled for a twoyard loss But t he strong UT defense yielded only two yards in three plays and got the ball ba ck for the offense On his third try Applewhite got the Longhorns into the en d zone driving yards in seven plays Mitchell got the TD on a yard run but the big plays were Applewhites passes of yards to WR Montrell Flowers yards on thirdand to Johnson and yards to the to Williams Stocktons kick gave Texas a lead with left OSU got close enough to try a field goal as time expired but Ervis Hill blocked it UT outgained OSU to in the period THIRD QUARTER A combination of mishaps including a sack and a halfthedistance penalty left the Longhorns facing a third and from their own Visions of anoth er punting adventure were etched into the brains of Longhorns everywhere but Applewhite dropped back and found Williams breaking open between double coverage just past midfield He heaved it and the swift freshman caught it on his fingertips and raced untouched into the end zone to complete a yard touchdown play Stocktons kick put UT ahead with left Lindsay and White misfired on a handoff two plays later and UT LB DeAndre Lewis recovered for Texas at the Hayter powered to the to set up a firstandgoal He tried to go over the top but the Cowboys stopped him then the Horns were penalized back to the for a false start Hayter got three yards to the off right tackle but Applewhites pass on third down was knocked down and Stocktons yard field goal gave Texas a lead with left Applewhite hit redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis for yard s and another TD with left A twopoint conversion try failed leaving U P on top heading into the final period FOURTH QUARTER With Hayter making good gains and Applewhite hitting key passes the Longhorns drove yards to set up a yard Stockton FG and moved yards for a touchdown with Applewhite connecting with Flowers for the final yards Ivan Williams ran yards for the final score with seconds left Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorn offense had its best day of the season against Oklahoma State the defense did its usual fine job and the special teams with one notable exception were outstanding After reviewing the film its clear that it was the best performance wev e had offensively he said We scored points and we had no turnovers Th e offensive line had its best performance We were pleased with not only the offensive line but Roy Williams made so me great blocks too and Kenny Hayter made some tough runs He also said junior QB Major Applewhite who underwent offseason knee surgery played like the Major of old He made very very few mistakes The Major of old was very good He was the Big Offensive Newcomer of the Year as a redshirt freshman in and the CoOffensive Player of the Year as a sophomore in Applewhite and sophomore Chris Simms have been dividing time at QB and Sim ms started the OSU game but gave way to Applewhite late in the first quarter Applewhite completed of passes for yards and three touchdowns Simms who returned late in the game completed of passes for yards Brown said the defense continues to swarm and play really well Casey Hampton is amazing and D D Lewis had an outstanding day Quentin Jammer a nd Rod Babers played really well We had another blocked kick thats our th in games here I thought it was Tyrone Jones but it was Ervis Hill who blocked the field goal Its interesting that our two best kick blockers ar e both from Texas City The special teams played well Brown said except for having another punt blocked and he said that is something that simply has to be fixed The two blocked punts this year have been in different areas he said b ut we have to get it fixed We cant keep getting punts blocked He said the UTOU game was such a big game or years ago that the feeling was that the team that won this game had a chance to win the nation al championship He said he and OU coach Bob Stoops are trying to get back t o that INJURY UPDATE Brown said SS Lee Jackson suited out against Oklahoma State and should be ready to play against Oklahoma He said DT Shaun Rogers sprained ankle is questionable for the OU game We should know more abou t Shaun Tuesday he said LB O J McClintock also missed the OSU game bruised knee but he should be back this week BLOCKING QUARTERBACK NOTES The big change in the UT running game was basically one new play a counter with an off side guard pulling and the linemen blocking down on the play side The QB also handed off at least par t of the time on one side and the back veered to the other side for a little bit of misdirection Major Applewhites knee has been one of he major no pun intended reasons the coaches have tried to use Chris Simms so much in the early games Applewhite still isnt but hes getting closer every week In fact he looked pretty close to Saturday Thats just in time because the Sooners look pretty potent and the Horns need to have two top quarterbacks ready to go Baseball Recruiting Going Great The UT baseball coaches got a commitment last week from righthanded pitch er Donald Lavinski of Class AA state champion Weimar giving them pledges from two of the states big three pitching recruits They also got a pledge from catcher Curtis Thigpen of Forney Round Rocks Joey Guajardo another righthander committed several months ago The third member of the big three pitching group is David Purcey a lefthander from Dallas Trinity Christian He is considering Texas AM and OU Purcey was at Trinity Christian the last two years and his team won backtoback state TAPPS championships He also helped his team win a stat e TAPPS title in basketball last year He had strikeouts in innin gs last year Lavinski was last year with an outstanding ERA His fast ball has been clocked as high as miles per hour and he is consistently in the mph range He also has great command of a sinking fast ball and a change up He struck out batters in innings last year while issuing about walks and giving up about hits He said he also had scholarship offers from Texas AM Baylor Rice Housto n and Oklahoma State Thigpen is an outstanding defensive catcher but he also wields a potent ba t bashing opposing pitchers for a batting average last season He also considered Alabama Baylor and AM Lavinski Thigpen and Pursey all visited Texas the September weekend along with shortstop Michael Holloman of Dallas Jesuit Holloman said he is considering Texas and Stanford He visited Texas earlie r and took his official trip to Stanford last weekend Horns Rise in Polls The Longhorns are No in this weeks Associated Press poll and No in the ESPNUSA Today coaches poll Oklahoma this weeks opponent is No in the AP poll and No in the coaches

us a spark He broke some tackles It brings an excitement to you when a back breaks tackles Longhorn offensive coordinator Greg Davis We really had to raise our level of play in the middle with Shaun Rogers and Stevie Lee out with injuiries It all starts up front and we got pretty good play up front today UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese We came out and played with a lot of emotion We were able to get some goo d hits on the quarterback When you get enough hits the quarterback eventual ly will start looking around and ducking Texas defensive tackle Casey Hampton At first I though I overthrew it I thought that was the big turning poin t in the game Roy Williams is just a great receiver the offensive line play ed great When I got sacked it was my fault for holding the ball too long UT QB Major Applewhite explaining his yard scoring pass to Roy Wil lims and the lines great protection To tell you the truth I was really nervous at first The holes were a lot bigger today The line really ripped some holes I had a lot of expectation s when I came here but I was a little too careless with the ball The last couple of weeks the coaches have told me I had a chance to play a lot more Sophomore RB Kenny Hayter after sparking the Longhorns running game w ith yards against the No ranked Cowboy defense I really felt like today we kind of jelled We opened up some holes for Kenny Hayter but sometimes he made us look good with the way he ran the ball and broke tackles UT senior OT Leonard Davis I couldnt go over there and tell him Mack Brown that but if you are asking if there is a difference between the two quarterbacks there is OSU head coach Bob Simmons when asked by an Oklahoma writer to compar e Texas quarterbacks Major Applewhite and Chris Simms Texas made adjustments and

play Saturday with a win over Kansas Texas leads the alltime series and has a threeyear winning streak In fact Texas dominated Oklahoma in the s going But coach Bob Stoops in his second year as the Sooners head man has OU humming along with an undefeated record and big ambitions Behind his allout passing attack the Sooners jumped out to a quick lead over the Longhorns last season before UT defense coordinator Carl Rees e changed his blitz packages and started getting enough pressure on QB Josh Heupel to put the brakes on the OU offense and allow Texas to rally for a win But it will be tougher this year because the Sooners of had no running threat at all They are rushing the ball much better this season which kee ps some of the pressure of Heupel The Longhorn defense should be able to pressure Heupel and corral the Soone r backs if the Texas offense shows up early The Longhorn offense hasnt done much in the first quarter of any of its games this year One field goal and very little yardage is all UT has garnered offensively this season But QB Major Applewhite who killed the Sooners last year with his clutch throws seems to be regaining his magic touch after offseason knee surgery and sophomore RB Kenny Hayter had his comingout party Saturday They keys to a Longhorn victory get a quick start on both sides of the ball pressure Heupel and make him throw before he wants to

Frenship Braden Johnson Euless Trinity Brian Carter The Woodlands Recruiting Roundup Brent Rawls of Shreveport Evangel the top QB prospect in Louisiana took his official visit to Texas last weekend I saw him going into the Texas dressing room after the game and he looks to be about as big as advertised He also appeared to be having a really good time His parents came to Austin with him which always is a good sign on an official visit Look for Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch or Rawls to commit to the Longhorns within the next week to days Nordgren is the most likely futu re Longhorn but it could be Rawls Actually its a great situation for the Longhorns because Nordgren is the top QB recruit in Texas and Rawls is the best one in Louisiana so either o ne would be a big catch The Longhorns are still at commitments They will sign between and players so there are six to nine spots left to fill I think most of those spots will be filled from a group of players consisting of Nordgren or Rawls FB James Buchanan of Sarasota Fla OLs Jami Hightower of Jacksonville and William Winston of Houston Madison DLs Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison and Kaelen Jakes of Placentia Cal DEs Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson and Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn LB Derrick Johnson of Waco S Dewayne Brandon of Temple Ath Joseph Addai o f Houston Sharpstown and the Galena Park North Shore duo of TE James Moses an d DELB Jonathon Jackson I think the Horns have at least shots at Nordgren Jakes Everett Hall Johnson Brandon and Addai Ill be surprised if they dont sign four or five players from that group Buchanan Hightower Winston Harris Jackson and Moses are all strongly considering Texas but they also are looking at a lot of other schools Texas really needs to sign Harris because he is a great defensive line prospect who really would be a great fit in defensive coordinator Carl Reeses attacking style This is a year when great offensive line prospects are plentiful but great defensive linemen are scarce and that is why Harris is such an important part of the Longhorn recruitizing puzzle There is a chance some other bigtime recruit will enter the picture but most of the remaining scholarships will go to players in one of the two groups above While big defensive line prospects are in short supply this year Ive already seen three juniors who will be bigtime recruits next year Ive written about them before but DTs Marco Martin of Mesquite and Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings are the rea l deal and so is DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands Leitko ca me to the Texas camp this summer I have seen Wright and Leitko play twice each and have seen Martin once an d also watched a lot of tape of him playing running back and in the defensive line Any college would take all three in a heartbeat if they were seniors The program at Hastings lists Wright as weighing close to pounds but h e looked more like a to pounder when I saw him play early this year against Galena Park North Shore He was a lot heavier last year but he has lost some weight and really is a great prospect While I havent seen them play I also have heard good things about some other big defensive line juniors including Damon Brown of Houston Washington Tully Jontzen of Keller and Jarre Rhodes of Dallas Lincoln who also is a tight end While were on the subject of juniors there is a great linebacker at Longview named Marvin Byrdsong He is weighs about and runs in the range Other super juniors include QBs Reggie McNeal of Lufkin and Vincent Young of Houston Madison RB Selvin Young of

October No WhatIffing in This One Sooners Turn Longhorns Every Which Way but Loose The Longhorns had their worst day during the Mack Brown era Saturday in Dallas and they picked a bad time to do it because unbeaten Oklahoma scored on its first six possessions and for good measure ran a pass back for a touchdown too en route to a victory The Sooners dominated the Longhorns offensively defensively and on special teams They even won the halftime when a Billy Simsled relay team beat an Eric Metcalfled relay team QB Josh Huepel passed the Longhorns to death and pound sophomore R B Quentin Griffin broke Oklahomas school scoring record and Longhorn fa ns hearts with six touchdowns In short it just wasnt a good day to be a Texas fan in the cold dam p Cotton Bowl or anywhere The loss dropped Texas to for the season and in the Big and gave the Sooners a big boost in their drive toward national and Big honors It also made this Saturdays game with Colorado in Boulder the biggest game of the year This is a season on the brink It could go up or down Remembe r that debacle with UCLA that started the slide in John Mackovics last year Brown is made of sterner stuff and I think he can get this team back on track But he has to do it in a hurry One thing Longhorn fans need to be very thankful about is that Heupel is a senior He was absolutely awesome Saturday and he probably will be the best allaround quarterback the Longhorns will face this year Here even more briefly than usual is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Oklahoma won the toss and deferred Texas took the ball and the Sooners go t the wind A falsestart penalty on the games second snap doomed that drive and forced a quick punt into the wind Kris Stockton got a good roll on the low kick to the OU Heupel hit four of five passes to cover the yards in six plays to give OU a lead with left TB Hodges Mitchell made a great run after catching Applewhites thirddown pass to pick up a UT first down but it was the only one in the first quarter On their second tr y the Sooners went yards in plays and ran the score to with left A holding penalty on the kickoff forced Texas to start frrom its Another threeandout series and punt out of the end zone gave the Sooners a short field at the UT They were on the move again at the UT when the period ended SECOND QUARTER The UT defense got a great leaping interception in the end zone from CB Quentin Jammer but it was disallowed and he was called for pass interferen ce instead giving OU a first down at the They scored on the next play for a lead with left Starting QB Major Applewhite almost connected wi th freshman WR Roy Williams for a yard completion but the officials ruled he lost the ball on the way down and it was ruled incomplete The Horns couldn t make a first down and J T Thatcher ran Stocktons punt back yards to t he UT A personal foul on the runback set them back to the but they scored in two plays for a lead with remaining Chris Simms came in at quarterback and hit Williams for a first down but a delayofgame penal ty negated it and Simms next pass was intercepted by OU LB Rocky Calmus who returned it for still another OU touchdown and a lead with remaining That brought Applewhite back in and he hit WR Montrell Flowers f or a nice gain on first down but an illegal motion penalty forced a punt The Sooners scored again giving them a lead with left At this point OUs offense had been so dominant that it had faced only seven first downs all day and had converted all of them Texas offense meanwhile had one first down The UT offense finally came to life driving yards in seven plays to leave OU on top with left Mitchell got the TD from seven yards out on a pass from Applewhite The Sooners were driving again when the half ended It was their only drive in the first half that did not result in a TD At the half OU led in first downs in rushing yardag e and in passing yardage THIRD QUARTER Texas finally forced OU to punt quickly to start the second half but Applewhite under a big rush threw an interception that was run back to th e UT OU scored in two plays for a lead just deep Simms came ba ck in at QB and played the rest of the way OU again drove deep into Texas territory but freshman DE Kalen Thorntons sack of Heupel forced the Soone rs to try a field goal and it went wide The Sooners next TD came after a fumble by WR Montrell Flowers at the UT That made the score with left Then Victor Ike probably the swiftest of all the Longhorns got loose on the kickoff and Sooner DB Michael Thompson caught him from behind at the OU It was an yard return But the Horns lost four yards on two plays and were facing thirdand at the OU when the quarter ended FOURTH QUARTER A pass interference penalty against OU gave Texas a first down at the Mitchell got five yards then backup TB Kenny Hayter took an outside toss f or the TD to make it with left OU came right back for its final T D driving yards primarily on runs by Griffin Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday he accepts the blame for the big loss to Oklahoma and he said the Longhorns have to bounce back because they still have a season to play and a lot of goals to accomplish if they play up to their capabilities After reviewing the film I still stand by what I said yesterday Brown said They outcoached us they outhustled us they outplayed us They totally dominated the game and when that happens it comes back to me It s my fault But he said the team still has a chance to repeat as the Big South champion Last year we were in the Big at this point Were at t he same spot as we were last season Asked if he thinks the team has a chance to rebound and win the title again he said no question about that Were far from out of anything We just h ad a poor poor performance yesterday in a game that was very important for us and our fans For me to just throw out the season because of that would be totally asinine He noted that Oklahoma after its loss to Texas last year beat Texas AM the following week and Stanford after giving up points to Texas last year won the Pac championship and Rose Bowl berth There is a lot of anger after a loss like this by our fans he said Wha t I will do this week is not look at the paper I wont watch TV or listen to the radio Ill be working hard all week trying to get us back on track He said he thought the Longhorns were ready to give a good performance against the Sooners but he said after three straight losses to Texas the Oklahoma players might have just been hungrier Our seniors had a chance to beat Oklahoma four straight times he said Some of them were crying Most of our younger players were in shock He said a loss like this one forces coaches to reevaluate everything We ll definitely go back and look very closely at everything were doing Well t ry to simplify things He said some of the Longhorn players played well but he said most of them played hard but didnt play well The defense had been playing so well for us he said It didnt even loo k like the same defense Part of it was OU QB Josh Heupel He played great We had a lot of mental mistakes Brown said We just played poorly and w ho knows why we played that poorly You guys will start looking at the things we should change The fans will start looking at the things we should change Ive got to look at things that I think will work Ive got to get them bac k on track Asked if he thinks there is a chance the team could fall apart because of t he loss to the Sooners Brown said This team wont fall apart Its a very young team with a lot of heart a lot of class Well go back to work to fi x things simplify things He said the key thing is for him to be truthful with his players this week about the things they did wrong the things they did right and the goals th e team still can accomplish This is a bad week to be going to Boulder he said noting that Colorado upset AM in College Station last week We wont ever forget this OU gam e but we still have goals to accomplish Were still in the race for the championship in our conference The players are embarrassed and I know Im embarrassed but weve got to pull back together and get back to work Weve got to go back and make sure we are fundamentally sound th Anniversary

after a Texas win over OU and UT is against the Sooners since True Orange began Thanks to all of you for your continued support True Orange Observations This was one of those games where a team has to figure out what went wrong try to correct it and then forget it because a game like this can be a cancer that ruins a season Remember UCLA and Mack Brown wont ask for my suggestions on this and Im sure he can figure it out for himself but if I were in his shoes here is what I would do rig ht now Give a royal chewing out to my players my assistants and myself becaus e this game was an embarrassment to all Longhorns Then I would say there are a lot of games left to play and this game needs to be put on the shelf and th e Colorado game should be the start of a new season for a team with a lot of goals left to accomplish Figure out the few things that have worked on offense and build future game plans around them By the same token Id figure out the plays that havent worked and quit using them The two upthegut plays the Horns used on their first two plays Saturday for zero yards have been unproductive all year Texas rarely has a running play outside the tackles but the sweeps usually work when they are tried Id also ditch that sideline pass that travels yards for a potential yard gain or an interception for a TD and start throwing downfield more often To open the game against Oklahoma State the Longhorns had a fouryard run and two pass completions on their first three plays and didnt pick up a first down Pick a QB and go with him Each QB has to be nervous knowing that if he throws an interception hell be jerked Quit being so predictable on offense Example when the Horns line up in a twoback offense and the tailback goes in motion Texas has passed or been sacked trying to pass of the time this season There has been one run by a UT fullback all year Brett Robins touchdown in mopup duty against OSU That formation invites an allout blitz If the run isnt going to be a big part of the offense go to the shotgu n with four wideouts as the basic formation It gives the quarterback a bette r chance to complete his passes as OU QB Josh Heupel demonstrated to near perfection Saturday Game Notes Oklahoma QB Josh Heupel one of the nations top passers had net yard s rushing Saturday which was more than the yards gained by the Longhorns leading ground gainer TB Hodges Mitchell This was the second most onesided game in the series trailing only the Oklahoma victory in in Texas leads the series The Sooners yards and first downs are both school records against the Longhorns This was the fifth most onesided defeat in Texas history The bottom are at Chicago UCLA Houston at Oklahoma Oklahoma at Kirksville at TCU at Vanderbilt Oklahoma Miami

right places at the right time Longhorn offensive coordinator Greg Davis They just whipped us They whipped us up front they whipped us at the linebacker level and they whipped us in the secondary You could put it a thousand different ways but we just got whipped UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese I feel honestly this is worse than UCLA in You dont come out against a big rival and get beat like that You feel bad getting dominated in every aspect of the game Texas defensive tackle Casey Hampton We didnt make plays Their quarterback did a great job but weve got to make plays It doesnt matter how good he throws the ball youve got to go up and knock it our or something You have to make plays and we didnt UT free safety Greg Brown We heard all week how good the Texas defense was but we knew we were a go od team too We werent going to take anything from them and our goal was to go right at them Thats what we did My getting the record was a byproduc t of our offensive performance as a whole Sooner running back Quentin Griffin after scoring a school record six touchdowns This was the worst buttkicking Ive ever been involved in OU was more emotional than us without question This is really bad To get manhandled by your rival it doesnt get any worse than this UT sophomore quarterback Chris Simms We took a lot away from this game last year We were up early and were playing good football at the start but things didnt go our way in the end We wanted to play four quarters today against a very good football team an d we did that for the most part OU quarterback Josh Heupel I was a little out of position but I knew what they were doing with their tendencies The guy looked at this receiver the entire way If he had looke d me off and gone the other way then I would have been in trouble But I too k a guess and I was right We had a great team effort today Everyone was on the same page When we work together you can see that we are a pretty good football team Sooner linebacker

storming into College Station and ending the Aggies game home winning streak last week And the Buffaloes get to play the host this week when Texas comes to milehigh Boulder for a pm game Saturday It will not be televised That sure got my attention said Texas coach Mack Brown College Station is a tough place for the visiting team Colorado coach Gary Barnett has had a tough year up to last week The Buffaloes opened the season with a loss to Colorado State then fell to Southern Cal Next up was Washington and the Huskies prevailed also by a score Powerful Kansas State pulled away in the second half for a victory After the KState loss Barnett threatened to strip the Buffalo decals off his players helmets if they didnt start playing better Barnett went with true freshman QB Craig Ochs all the way against AM and he came through big hitting of passes for yards and one touchdow n and running yards for another touchdown Sensational freshman RB Marcus Houston is out with an injury but Cortlen Johnson dented the tough Aggie defense for yards and a touchdown Saturda y WRs Javon Green and Roman Hollowell are swift and productive and TE Daniel Graham also is a threat Defensively the Buffs are led by a trio of returning linebacker starters headed by Jashon Sykes The Buffs return five offensive and six defensive starters from a team that went last year in Barnetts first season at the helm For the Longhorns to win the defense has to prove the Oklahoma game was a onetime disaster and go back to playing smashmouth defense It also has t o pressure Ochs into some freshman mistakes Offensively the Horns have to come out with their best shots early They havent scored an offensive TD all year and havent moved the ball at all i n some of their first quarters this season Unless the offense plays better than it has been playing it will be tough to win this game Heres how the teams compare statistically national rank in parenthesis Texas Colorado Offense Rushing Avg Passing Avg

Longhorns plan to sign to players with several of the remaining spots going to defensive linemen Tommie Harris the great DT from Killeen Ellison is the No guy on UTs wish list with Kaelen Jakes of Valencia HS in Placentia Cal the only other big defensive lineman who is seriously considering the Horns This is a bad year for the big guys in the middle so Harris and Jakes are as important as anyone remaining on the Longhorns wish list Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter Abe Robinson Jersey Village Alfio Randall Blinn JC Mike Garcia Galena Park Will Allen Cypress Falls Roman Reeves Livingston Terrance Young Longview Running Back Cedric Benson Midland Lee Anthony Johnson Jefferson Linebacker Yamil LeBron Killeen Ellison Lance McFarland Jefferson Defensive Back Cedric Griffin San Antonio Holmes Aaron Ross Tyler Kendal Briles Wolfforth Frenship Braden Johnson Euless Trinity Brian Carter The Woodlands As you can see the Longhorns are almost through recruiting offensive linemen running backs linebackers and defensive backs They want to sign one QB one TE one or two WRs Wacos great LB Derrick Johnson who had tackles in his teams loss to power Tyler John Tyler about days ago super safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple and any other gre at prospect who wants to come They should be able to get a QB and TE and they might get one WR but probably wont be able to get two They lead for both Johnson and Brandon If things fall like they appear to be developing there will be at least fo ur spots left for defensive linemen and possibly more depending on whether t he coaches will sign players But right now it doesnt look like Texas will be able to sign a lot of top defensive linemen because the only ones who are leaning the Longhorns way are Jakes DE Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn DE Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson who might be better suited to playing TE Harris appears to be wide open If the Horns dont fill all their defensive line needs this recruiting season they should be able to next year because there is a much better gro up of the big guys who are juniors this year RECRUITING NOTES QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch visited the Texas practice Thursday and spent a lot of time after practice talking to head coach Mack Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis but he said he isnt ready to commit and wants to look around some more The other QB Texas is recruiting Brent Rawls of Shreveport Evangel visits Florida State this weekend and says he might be ready to make a decision by next week He also has visited Texas and Purdue and Purdue appears to have a slight lead base d on his belief that he would have a chance to play quicker with the Boilermakers LBDE Jonathan Jackson of Galena Park North Shore is bein g recruited by most colleges including UT as a defensive end Colleges are wanting DEs with great speed as outside pass rusher and Jackson ran a at a summer camp That is very fast

players have all of those abilities But coach Jody Conradt who already had two outstanding recruits with all four of those traits landed two more last week for the Texas womens basketball team Kala Bowers of Woodward Okla and Jody Bell of Chestermere High School in Calgary Alberta Canada two stars who are so versatile that they have played point guard at times are the latest additions to Conradts recruiti ng class Bowers is a national top player who was one of just four high school underclassmen to be invited to try out for the junior national team She also considered Colorado North Carolina Stanford and Nebraska She averaged points and rebounds last season Her high school is for the last two seasons winning one Oklahoma stat e title and finishing as the runnerup to the state champion the other season Last year our point guard got hurt so Kala played point guard for us Woodward coach Kim Kramer said Shes so versatile she can play any position Bell averaged points and rebounds for Chestermere High School in Calgary She was a member of the Canadian junior national team She considered only warmweather schools and wound up picking Texas over Arizona State Chestermere coach Brian Utley said Bell is a player who can handle the ball like a guard run the floor and shoot the three Shes an insideoutsi de player with skills you normally dont see in a girl her size She has great allaround skills he said Texas got an outstanding playe r She really enjoyed her campus visit to Texas and really liked coach Conradt She said there were too many good things about Texas for her to go anywhere else Conradt also has commitments from forward Heather Schreiber of Windthorst the states hottest prospect and forward CoCo Reed of Houston Jersey Village Like Bowers and Bell they are fine ball handlers and shooters Schrieber and Bowers are both on at least one national top list Schrieb er has led her volleyball team to three straight state championships and alrea dy has been

Volume No October Longhorns Bounce Back Trample Buffaloes Behind Great Defense Solid Offense The Longhorns followed their worst game of the Mack Brown era with a great defensive effort and a solid offensive performance in a win over Colorado in Boulder Saturday afternoon The game really wasnt as close as the score indicates Texas outgained Colorado to and the Buffaloes ran only six plays in Texas end of the field all day The Buffs ran plays and they either gained nothing o r took a loss on of them The defense held Colorado to yards total offense in the first half and would have had a shutout except for a pair of fumbles that gave the Buffs a touchdown and set up their other score Texas is now for the year and in the Big Colorado fell to overall and in conference play This was a real gutcheck game for Texas after the whipping at the hands of Oklahoma the previous week and the Longhorns responded with their best defensive effort in terms of yardage yielded in years and their bes t rushing yardage total of the season The offense did struggle in the red zone and Hodges Mitchell who hadnt fumbled all year fumbled on a running play and a Colorado linebacker pick ed it up and returned it for a touchdown Mitchell also fumbled a punt to set up the other Colorado score But he ran for tough yards and scored the clinching touchdown on a pass from Major Applewhite who threw for three touchdowns and yards Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Colorado won the toss and took the ball Big mistake Texas got the wind an d the Buffs wound up playing deep in their own territory throughout the first half because the fierce Texas defense kept sacking freshman QB Craig Ochs a nd forcing turnovers That gave the Longhorn offense great field position wi th UTs first five possessions extending well into the second quarter starti ng at midfield or in Colorado territory Texas first drive started at the Buf f and got to the before Kris Stocktons attempt at a yard field goal sailed wide left Their next possession began at the CU and got to the before Applewhite fumbled and the Buffs recovered The third and final UT possession in the quarter started at the Texas and ended at the Colorado The Longhorns owned the statistics for the quarter leading in firs t downs and in total offense Colorado never crossed its yard line i n the entire period SECOND QUARTER The fourth Longhorn possession started at the Colorado and this time th e offense scored in two plays First Applewhite found true freshman WR B J Johnson streaking down the right sideline for yards to the Buffalo th en he hit his other true freshman receiver Roy Williams for the touchdown Williams outfought a Colorado defender for the ball and the score Stockton s kick gave Texas a lead only seconds deep in the quarter LB Everick Rawls intercepted Ochs pass on the first play after the kickoff and return ed it to the Colorado But the Horns couldnt move and Stocktons attempted yard field goal sailed wide right The Longhorns started their next possession at their own the worst field possession they had experie nced to this point and Applewhite hit Johnson for yards then found TE M ike Jones for more yards to the Colorado The Horns stalled at the Buff and Stockton booted a yard field goal to stretch UTs lead to with left Mitchell got loose on a yard punt return to the CU later i n the quarter Applewhite hit Johnson to the and Mitchell ran to the but a fumbled snap on a thirdand brought Stockton in to kick another yard FG to boost the lead to with left Colorado had nine possessions in the first half and had minus yardage on six of them The Buf fs had only yards at the half and just two first downs THIRD QUARTER The Longhorns were moving again to start the second half when disaster struck Mitchell was hit as he took a handoff and the ball came loose Colorado LB Jashon Sykes scooped it up and ran it back yards for a touchdown The kick was good and UTs lead was cut to with left Texas couldnt make a first down and the Buffs drove into Texas territory for the first time before punting to the UT The Horns had failed to scor e from pointblank range in the early going but they covered the yards in just five plays Mitchell got on a draw play then Applewhite threw an incompletion Mitchell bounced another draw play to the outside and ran yards to the Applewhite found Jones open again and hit him for yards to the CU Williams got a step on his defender and Applewhite hit him fo r the touchdown The Horns went for two and Williams who was well covered tipped the ball away from the defender and caught it as it came down to giv e the Horns a lead with left Redshirt freshman safety Dakarai Pearson intercepted Ochs long throw on the next play and ran it back to th e Colorado But the Horns couldnt make a first down and had to punt The UT defense forced a quick Colorado punt but Mitchell bobbled the ball at the UT and Colorado recovered A personal foul against Texas moved it to the and Colorado TB Cortlen Johnson who had been bottled up all day got outsi de the defenders and scored to cut the UT lead to with left At the end of the third quarter the Horns were clinging to a one touchdown lead despite having a edge in net yardage FOURTH QUARTER Neither team could mount a threat early in the quarter but Texas starting from its own with left finally put the game away and used up nearl y four minutes doing it Applewhite hit of passes for yards in the drive including a short pass to Mitchell on thirdand that he broke for a yard scoring jaunt That gave Texas a lead with left Neither team threatened again Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the victory at Colorado Saturday was on e of the best games weve had since weve been here Its a little disappointing that we didnt get the shutout because the defense played shutout football he said He said his young defensive ends played their best game as a group True freshman DE Kalen Thornton had two sacks and sophomore DE Cory Redding also had a sack Cory had his best game Brown said and Kalen is very mature He played really well yesterday and made some impact plays Brown also said QB Major Applewhite in his first game since being named th e starter played well He made some big plays for us He said DT Shaun Rogers who had missed two straight games with a sprained ankle played plays against Colorado and appears to be ready for fullti me duty again We need Shaun in there Brown said Hes just one of the premier footbal l players in America He said the team went back to the same basic offense it used during Ricky Williams Heisman Trophy year We were in twobacks a lot more than in oneback he said Its easier t o protect the passer with two backs When you are running the football th e safeties have to come in and get involved in the running game Then you can hit the tight end Then when they get concerned with the tight end that lets you get on with your receivers He said that was the reason TE Mike Jones was able to get open so easily Jones caught six passes for yards to lead the Longhorn receivers He al so became only the fourth tight end in school history to post a yard receiving day Brown said the UT offensive line had its best game of the year Our two tackles Mike Williams and Leonard Davis really played well he said Brown also said redshirt freshman OG Tillman Holloway who came in when Antwan KirkHughes was injured came in and was really physical He also said Major Applewhite remains the starting quarterback INJURY NOTES Brown said KirkHughes hurt his shoulder and is the only player who appears likely to miss any practice time this week He said DE Kalen Thornton who was hurt during the game is fine He got stepped on o r kicked but hes fine Colorado Game Notes Texas snapped its sixgame losing streak to Colorado The Longhorns last defeated the Buffaloes on Dec a triumph in the Bluebonnet Bowl The game Saturday also marked UTs first victory in Boulder since Sep t The victory also snapped a fivegame losing streak in games played away from Royal Memorial Stadium Texas improved to when recording more than yards of total offens e under Mack Brown The Longhorns improved to when outrushing their opponent during Browns tenure UT allowed only total yards which was its best defensive effort sinc e when New Mexico was held to yards offensively WRs B J Johnson and Roy Williams became the first true freshman receive r tandem to start for Texas since Mike Adams and Lovell Pinkney did so agains t Texas AM on Nov Williams set the Texas freshman singleseason touchdown record with his two scoring receptions in the contest yards Williams who has four scoring catches this season broke fellow teammate Artie Ellis and Lovell Pinkneys record of three The pair of touchdown receptions tied the UT freshman singlegame record held by Ellis Sept vs LouisianaLafayette Johnsons four receptions pushed his season total to and he moved into fourth place on UTs freshman singleseason receptions chart TE Mike Jones had a careerhigh six receptions for a careerbest yard s previous receptions for yards at Stanford Sept It is only the fourth time in school history that a tight end has posted at least receiving yards in a game and the first since Kerry Cash had seven receptions for yards on Nov at Texas Tech a span of games QB Major Applewhite threw for more than yards for a schoolrecord eighth

enough right now to beat the m Their defense gave us the worst field position in the first half that Ive ever seen Colorado head coach Gary Barnett When the ball is in the air you want to feel like its million dollars coming at you and you dont want to miss catching that million Texas freshman wide receiver Roy Williams who caught two touchdown pa sses and a point conversion pass Texas defense is very fast probably the fastest defense Ive played against all year Give them credit They played very well I played poorly and thats about all you can chalk it up to Colorado freshman quarterback Craig Ochs It was fun but it really doesnt matter how many I catch The big thing i s to win the ball game Texas tight end Mike Jones after catching six passes for yards They knew we were going to try

have been an unpredictable team this year playing Nebraska and Michigan State tough and getting blown out by Kansas last week Missouri opened the season with a win over Western Illinois lost to Clemson then played Michigan State down to the wire before losing The Tigers played Nebraska tough the next week before losing then whipped Oklahoma State and lost to Kansas Longhorn coach Mack Brown said he watched part of the NebraskaMissouri gam e and I thought they had a chance to beat Nebraska in Lincoln while I was watching it TB Zain Gilmore a pound junior is the Tigers top rusher He is averaging yards per game rushing and has scored six touchdowns Freshman QB Darius Outlaw is filling in for injured starter Kirk Farmer and has completed of passes for yards and three touchdowns But he also has been picked off seven times Defensively the Tigers are led by AllBig DE Justin Smith a pound terror Coach Larry Smith has five offensive and six defensive starters back from a team a year ago This is a game the Longhorns will be favored to win by at least points and it is one they should win handily if they come out ready to play Heres how the teams compare statistically national rank in parenthesis Texas Missouri Offense Rushing Avg Passing Avg Total Off Avg Scoring Avg Defense Rushing Avg Passing Avg Total Def Avg Opp Scoring Avg Big Roundup Oklahoma showed it is ready to challenge for the top spot in the Big las t week by going to Manhattan and handing No Kansas State a whipping The Sooners are firmly in the drivers seat in the Big Southern Division while topranked Nebraska and Kansas State will meet later this season to determine the Northern Division champion Conventional wisdom holds that two league losses eliminate a team from championship competition If that is the case then half the teams in each division have already been eliminated leaving Oklahoma Texas and Texas AM as the teams in the Southern Division with legitimate title hopes and topranked Nebraska Kans as State and Iowa State as the teams witha chance to win the Northern Division championship At least one of the contenders will fall by the wayside this week when Texa s AM travels to Ames to take on

disaster in Dallas will damage UT recruiting But the week between the disaster and the victory over Colorado was one of the best of this recruiting season for the Longhorns The Texas coaches got commitments last week from a great JC punter the states best QB and one of the top DELB prospects in the country The latest Longhorn pledge is DELB Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn He actually plays quarterback and safety at Clarksville but Texas Nebraska Tennessee and Texas AM were all recruiting him primarily as a defensive en d He said he picked Texas because he was born in Texas and has always had a fondness for the state and for its state university I really enjoyed my official visit to Texas he said I just decided it was the place for me Hall was the th commitment for the Longhorns who also had picked up pledges last week from QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch and punter Brian Bradford of Trinity Valley JC Nordgren is easily the top protype passer in Texas and Bradford has been rated as the nations top JC punter by at least one recruiting service Nordgren chose Texas over LSU Tennessee and Colorado He also was recruit ed by most of the top programs but had narrowed his choices to those four schools He told me had had scholarship offers It was really a close call between Texas and LSU he said but I decided I wanted to play for the Longhorns Nordgren is a student who also is a highjumper and intermedia te hurdler in track He also starts for the basketball team It came down to a great list of schools Nordgren said but I felt at home at the UT campus Its a football program that I know I can help lead to a national championship Trinity Valley JC coach Chuck Langston says Bradford will punt in the NFL someday Hes the best one Ive ever been around Langston who played and later coached at Oklahoma said Hes better than any of the ones we ever had at OU when I was there He averages better than yards and he gets tremendous hang time in the second range which is really outstanding He really gets great height and great distance Langston said Bradford is our teams MVP Hes one of the those guys who turns the field over He really changes field position Bradford told me he has always wanted to play for the Longhorns He was a full qualifier out of Lufkin High School and said he will transfer to Texas in January so he can go through spring training with the Longhorns Bradford can be counted against last years class because he will enroll at midyear What I really like about Bradford is his emphasis on hang time I concentrate on kicking it high he said Id rather have a yarder with no return than a yarder that might be returned It obviously works out because he is averaging yards per kick and stil l getting close to five seconds hang time Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter Abe Robinson Jersey Village Alfio Randall Blinn JC Mike Garcia Galena Park Will Allen Cypress Falls Roman Reeves Livingston Terrance Young Longview Quarterback Matt Nordgren Dallas B Lynch Running Back Cedric Benson Midland Lee Anthony Johnson Jefferson Defensive End Eric Hall Clarksville Tenn Linebacker Yamil LeBron

Punter Brian Bradford Trinity Valley JC The Longhorns with commitments already will give at least three more and if things fall right at the end as many as six additional ones There are five players LB Derrick Johnson of Waco S Dewayne Brandon o f Temple DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal and DE Jonathan Jackson and TE James Moses both of Galena Park North Shore who strongly favor Texas But all of them are highly recruited national prospects and I would be mild ly surprised if the Horns signed all five of them Then there are four great players the Horns are still recruiting very hard DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison FB James Buchanon of Cardinal Mooney H S in Sarasota Fla and OLs William Winston of Houston Madison and Jami Hightower of Jacksonville Texas has a pretty good shot at Harris but the other three are not leaning UTs way at this time Harris had a great junior year I saw him play and he was awesome But he h as a sprained ankle that has hampered his performance this year When the ankle was well last summer he ran a weighing close to pounds Hes still a super prospect and one the Horns need desperately UT Basketball Women Start Practice The Texas womens basketball team had its first practice Saturday and coach Jody Conradt said she is so pleased with her recruiting class that three or four of the newcomers will challenge for starting jobs The Longhorns are coming off

Mercedes Williams Williams averaged points rebounds and steals per game in leadin g Westfield to a record and a berth in the state Class A finals She was on the AllState team and was the Houston Chronicles Player of the Year She is a strong physical presence in the paint and relishes the tough play around the basket She will provide much needed depth behind Stacy Stephens and Annissa Hastings at center for the Longhorns With the addition of Mercedes we now have five newcomers who immediately raise the overall talent level of our program Conradt said adding that a ll five players are considered among the very best players coming out of thei r respective states The other four signees are forward Kala Bowers of Woodward Okla the Oklahoma Player of the Ye ar Heather Schreiber of Windthorst the top player in Texas and a Parad e AllAmerican guardforward Coco Reed of Houston Jersey Village Canadian Junior National team player Jody Bell a forward from Chestermere High School in

Maxwell Invitational in Ardmore Okla last weekend shooting a over par to finish five strokes behind tourney champ Tulsa UT Basketball Recruits Honored Texas basketball coach Rick Barnes two recruits both ranked among the nations elite players at their positions Good national basketball ratings are hard to find but Student Sports Magazine recently came out with a ranking of the top players at each position for a national top overall Point guard T J Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge ranked No at his position and center Chris Wright of Redwater ranked No among the b ig guys in the middle Most rating services had Ford much higher but it is a great tribute to Wrights potential that he made the list of the top centers because he missed almost all of his senior year with a torn ACL that required surgery Fords Willowridge team also was ranked No in the nation by Student Sports and the Eagles were the topranked public school team Mouth of Wilson Va which gives scholarships and recruits all over the nation was ranked No but the Warriors are an allstar team with player s from several states and countries Ford also made the magazines man first team senior AllAmerican list which was surprising since he was rated only No in the pointguard category I suppose they have two gurus with different views of the point guards I g o along with the one who rated Ford as one of the top two point guards becaus e every other rating service I saw had him as one of the top two or three poi nt guards in the nation Evans Testing Pro Waters Junior Longhorns swingman Maurice Evans has declared himself eligible for June NBA draft Evans who led the Horns in scoring last year with a average has not hired an agent and can return to Texas for his senior season if he doesnt elect to turn pro While Evans is a fine college player he lacks great dribbling skills at th is point and probably wont be drafted He could benefit from another year und er coach Rick Barnes tutelage Horns Recruiting Top JC Guard The Longhorns are in the running for a top junior college combo guard Terrell Ross a point guard with fine shooting skills at Allegany JC i n Meadville Md visited UT three weeks ago and has narrowed his picks to Texas Mississippi State and Michigan State Tuesday is the deadline for signing letters of intent in basketball so he will sign with someone right away or his recruiting will drag on until he shows up on a college campus to start classes He led Allegany to a record and the National JC championship game He averaged only points a game for a loaded team that features four oth er Division I signees but he hit of his shots from the field and of his free throws He also is an outstanding defensive player and rebounder A True Orange Subscription Is The Gift You Can Give Every Year to Your

Fox Network The Bears have really struggled this season Their only victories are over North Texas State and South Florida They have been shut out in their last three games falling to Texas Tech AM and Nebraska Their other losses were to Minnesota and Iowa State The Bears had counted on former UT QB Greg Cicero to give them a good passi ng attack but he went down with a seasonending injury and they have had one of the least productive offenses in the country There are teams playing Division I football and Baylor ranks th in rushing th in passing th in total offense and th in scoring The Baylor defense is a little better but not much The Longhorns should be able to name their score in this one even if they do show up a little flat Heres how the teams compare statistically national rank in parenthesis Texas Baylor Offense Rushing Avg Passing Avg Total Off Avg Scoring Avg Defense Rushing Avg Passing Avg Total Def Avg Opp Scoring Avg UTs Bowl Outlook The Longhorns have to win their four remaining regular season games to have a chance to defend their Big Southern Division title and unless Oklahoma loses twice starting Saturday against Nebraska that wouldnt get them int o the league title game But a regular would guarantee them a good bowl game The Big champion is guaranteed a spot in one of the big four BCS bowls and the runnerup could wind up in one of the BCS bowls too The Cotton Bowl gets the second pick the Holiday Bowl in San Diego gets third choice and the Alamo Bowl gets the fourth pick By winning out Texas would be likely to wind up in either the Holiday Bowl or the Alamo Bowl If the Big lands two teams in the BCS bowls a Texas probably would wind up in San Diego If only one Big lands in the BCS bowls San Antonio is a more likely stopping spot for the bowl season If the Horns dont go they still will qualify for a bowl by beating Baylor Saturday and they will will go bowling somewhere Big Roundup The big game this week is in Norman where topranked and unbeaten Nebraska takes on undefeated and thirdranked Oklahoma Kansas State travels to Texas AM in another big game that will trim the li st of contenders for the two division titles to four The

a commitment so they are still at with a few slots left to fill One player who would fit one of those remaining spots very nicely safe ty Dewayne Brandon of Temple was one of the recruits who came to the TexasMissouri game Saturday The only other top recruits at the game were three who already are committe d to Texas CB Aaron Ross of Tyler John Tyler WRDB Brian Carter of the The Woodlands and DBLB Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity Ross and his Tyler Lions are having a fine season They are overall and in their district Ross is playing running back and wide receiver in addition to the defensive backfield He has scored one touchdown as a receiver and three as a running back He said only five passes have been thrown his way all year I intercepted one of them one was completed and I knocked the other three down he said The Longhorns will give five to seven more scholarships and most of them will be filled from a group of nine players They are Brandon LB Derrick Johnson of Waco DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal and DE Jonathan Jackson and TE James Moses both of Galena Park North Shore DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison Athlete Joseph Addai of Houston Sharpstown and OLs William Winston of Houston Madison and Jami Hightower of Jacksonville Super DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC is another possibility but he has some academic hurdles to clear The Longhorns are in good shape with Brandon Johnson Jakes Jackson and Moses They have as good a chance as anyone with Harris but the trouble there is that the Killeen Ellison star has a lengthy list of schools he is considering and he recently added Oklahoma to the mix and says he is wide open FB James Buchanon of Cardinal Mooney HS in Sarasota Fla is still considering Texas but he is a long shot RECRUITING NOTES Galena Park North Shore is and Jackson and Moses are having great years Moses doesnt get a lot of passes thrown his way but h e has very good hands good speed and he is a tremendous blocker Jackson wh o switched from linebacker to defensive end this year is an outstanding pass ru sher due to his speed and big frame Jacksons early college favorites give a strong indication hell be playing in Texas or Florida Hi s top five are Texas AM FSU Miami and Florida but Ill be surprised if both these bluechippers dont join former teammate Cory Redding at Texas Midland Lee star Cedric Benson isnt getting as many carries as he did la st season and hes running behind an all new and undersized line but hes sti ll lethal when he gets a chance He hit Abilene Cooper for yards and five touchdowns on carries Friday night in Midland in a key District A gam e Hes a Longhorn commitment and hes on everybodys national top list H e wont have the great statistics he had on last years state title team but he looks even bigger and faster this year Top Girls Basketball Stars Visit Coach Jody Conradt has already corraled a great recruiting class for her Longhorn womens basketball team but things could get even better because she got visits last weekend from the nations top junior and one of the states top three seniors The top junior is guardforward Ann Strother of Highlands Ranch Colorado and the top three Texas star is Niki Newton a forward from Crowley Strother is visiting several schools unofficially this year to decide which schools she wants to seriously consider next year Contadt already has commitments from two national top players Heather Schreiber of Windthorst and Kala Bowers of Woodward Okla They are the top prospects in their respective states Schreiber is rated as the nations No prospect and Bowers is ranked No by the All Star Girls Report a national rating service Horns Back in AP Rankings The Longhorns regained the top in the Associated Press rankings this wee k coming in at No They are No in the coaches poll That hasnt always been good news in recent years It seems like every time the Horns get a good ranking they get beat Is it complacency or overconfidence or just the fact they lose to a better team Im not sure but I do know thats why they havent finished in the t op since Theyve been in the top several times but they havent been able to stay there Kick Returns Picking Up Coach Mack Browns announced goal of improving the kick return teams this season is paying big dividends Victor Ike is No in the country in kickoff returns averaging yards on returns and Hodges Mitchell is No nationally in punt returns averaging yards on tries Unbeaten List Shrinking Only five Division teams still have perfect records and the list will shrink by at least one this weekend when No Nebraska and No Oklahoma meet The other teams with perfect records are No Virginia Tech No Clemson and No Texas Christian True Freshmen Will Start Tight end Brock Edwards will start against Baylor Saturday giving the Longhorns four true freshmen in the starting lineup Edwards joins defensive end Kalen Thornton who has started the last four games and wide receivers Roy Williams and B J Johnson who have started t he last two games Edwards was pressed into the starting lineup when Mike Jones the teams starting tight end suffered a lick on his knee early in the Missouri game Coach Mack Brown said Edwards did a good job against Missouri Two other redshirt freshmen have been starting Marcus Tubbs has been worki ng as the starter at defensive tackle while Shaun Rogers works his way back fr om an ankle sprain and Dakarai Pearson has won the starting free safety position Rogers is getting better each week and might reclaim his starting job this week Barring any late changes the Longhorns will start two seniors TB Hodges Mitchell and OT Leonard Davis four juniors QB Major Applewhite LT Mike Williams RG Antwan KirkHughes and C Matt Anderson two sophomores LG Derrick Dockery and FB Matt Trissel and the three true freshmen Williams Johnson and Edwards on offense Saturday Defensively they will start three seniors tackles Rogers and Casey Hampto n and SS Greg Brown four juniors LBs Everick Rawls D D Lewis and Everic k Rawls and CB Quentin Jammer two sophomores DE Cory Redding and CB Roderi ck Babers one redshirt freshman Pearson and one true freshman Thornton Baseball Stars Commit to UT The Longhorn baseball team got commitments from two more top recruits last week including a righthanded pitcher who has been clocked as high as m ph with his fast ball The pitcher is Kole Strayhorn of Shawnee Oklahoma who had offe rs from many schools but who picked Texas over Oklahoma Oklahoma State Cal StateFullerton and Baylor He was last year with a ERA He struck out in innings and said he gave up about walks and about hits He has been clocked as high as mph and he is consistent around He plays shortstop when he isnt pitching The only problem with Strayhorn is that pitchers who can hit mph and who have good control frequently wind up getting drafted so high that they get a lot of money to go pro immediately The other recruit is shortstop Seth Johnston of Boerne He also is the quarterback for Boernes football team Johnson hit last season and picked the Longhorns over Texas AM and Houston Simpler Is Better Coach Mack Brown says he thinks the Horns will fare better now that the coaches have simplified the offense Brown said he also thinks the twoback offense is better for Texas for several reasons He said having two backs behind the quarterback improves t he pass protection When teams rush eight defenders he said the five linemen the tight end a nd one running back are outnumbered When two backs are there he said there a re enough people to block everyone even in a maximum blitz It also is a better powerrunning formation because of the extra blocker h e said adding that success in the running game causes the other teams safeties to creep up to help stop the run which helps the passing game When you can run and pass it creates some problems for the defense he said We plan to keep working on being able to do both True freshman WR B J Johnson went along with the simplification idea whi le having some fun with the rerporters on hand Johnson said when he first got to Texas and heard the coaches talking about cover I didnt even know they had six coverages When someone asked him if he knew all the defensive coverages now he said I dont even know all the plays to tell you to truth You should see our playbook A True Orange Subscription Is The Gift You Can Get

will be televised by the Fox Network The Red Raiders are overall and in the Big with losses to Nebraska Kansas State and Texas AM Tech under new coach Mike Leach opened the season with a win over Ne w Mexico then whipped Utah State and North Texas before wrapping up the nonconference slate with a shutout of LousianaLafayette The Raiders fell at Texas AM to open league play Then they whitewashed Baylor before getting hammered by Nebraska Then they scared Kansas State in Manhattan before falling They outscored Kansas Saturday in Lawrence with sophomore QB Kliff Kingsbury hitting WR Derek Dorris for four touchdowns Leach is the guy who found Josh Heupel and lured him to Oklahoma last seaso n when he was the Sooners offensive coordinator The Sooners offensive success last year propeled him to the head job at Texas Tech and his offense is a pass first pass second and pass third offense just like the one the Sooners use The difference however is that there is only one Heupel But Kingsbury is very good Hes a sophomore who has thrown a nations leading passes th is year and who has hit of them He is No in the nation in total offense averaging yards per game One scary statistic is Texas Techs lofty No ranking in pass defense Th e Raiders are giving up only yards per game passing and they have intercepted passes If the Longhorns dont run any better than they have been running they wil l have to have some success throwing to have a chance to win One other worrisome thing is that Texas Tech is the second best team the Longhorns have played to this point Oklahoma with a record is the on ly other team the Horns have played with a winning record right now To win in Lubbock the Longhorns have to pressure Kingsbury and the offense and defense both have to remember to show up in the first quarter Heres how the teams compare statistically national rank in parenthesis Texas Texas Tech Offense Rushing Avg Passing Avg Total Off Avg Scoring Avg Defense Rushing Avg

looks even bigger and faster this year than he w as last year T J Mills Permians coach said My kids hit him and hit him and hit hi m but hes a load If you dont get a lot of hats on him on every play hell hurt you Don Shows the highly successful coach at West Monroe La had much the sa me thing to say after his team mauled Lee in an earlyseason game Lees lone TD came on a yard run by Benson and it came on the third pla y of the game Shows whose teams are since said We dont usuall y give up runs like that and we stopped him pretty good most of the time Bu t our game plan was to have a lot of people on him on every play and even then he made some tough tough yardage Hes a hard back to stop especial ly if he gets a little room Not much has changed in the last week The Longhorns are still

October Longhorns Overcome Slow Start Blast Bears Last Three Games Pose Major Challenge The Longhorns spotted Baylor an early lead before a sellout crowd in Austin Saturday then stormed back for a win to run their season reco rd to and their Big mark to But road trips to Texas Tech and Kansas are next on the agenda and then a home game against Texas AM wraps up the regular season All three opponents are dangerous and the Longhorn offense and defense will need to start their motors running a lot quicker or things could get rough down the stretch But this was Baylor a team that had been blanked for three straight games Even a slow start isnt fatal against the Bears LouisianaLafayette and Baylor are the two weakest teams the Horns have faced and UT trailed LaLa before coasting to an easy win Lets hope higher quality opponents motivate the Texas players to start competing better from the opening kickoff Texas offense gave Baylor a short field with an early fumble and it took the Bears less than two minutes to notch their first October TD this year But the offense warmed up and QB Major Applewhite threw for yards and t wo touchdowns and even scored on a quarterback sneak The Bears chose to double cover sensational freshman WR Roy Williams and h is classmate and buddy B J Johnson made them pay by hauling in nine passes for yards and a TD the best single game ever by a UT freshman But it was the Longhorn defense that set the tone for this game After that early lapse the Texas defense allowed Baylors offense only one more net yard for the remainder of this first half and forced two turnovers that led to Texas points Capitalizing on the short field created by the outstanding defensive effort the Longhorns kicked two early field goals then blew the game open with a point second quarter The Longhorn defenders forced five Baylor turnovers including four interceptions two by CB Quentin Jammer and one each by SS Greg Brown a nd backup FS Phillip Geiggar The defense also held Baylor to net yards passing and rushin g while the UT offense amassed yards total offense passing and rushing The defense forced Baylor into possessions of three downs or less The Bears only had possessions Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Baylor won the toss and deferred The Longhorns like they have all year struggled out of the starting gate They made two first downs but then blitzing Baylor DB Gary Baxter blindsided UT QB Major Applewhite and knocke d the ball loose The Bears recovered at the UT and scored in five plays with QB Guy Tomcheck hitting WR Martin Dossett for the final yards That put Baylor ahead with left Applewhite hit freshman TE Brock Edwards for yards on the Horns next possession to set up a yard fiel d goal by Kris Stockton that cut the Baylor lead to with left Starting from their own the Longhorns drove to the Baylor later in th e quarter primarily on the strength of a yard pass from Applewhite to freshman WR B J Johnson but the drive stalled and Stockton kicked a yard field goal to get the Horns back within one point at with left A bungled Baylor screen pass gave the Horns great field position in t he final minute of the quarter when RB Darrell Bush was ambushed by DE Cory Redding and fumbled with LB Everick Rawls recovering for a yard loss at the Baylor TB Hodges Mitchell carried three straight times for nine yards bringing up a fourthand at the Bear as the quarter ended Although they trailed the Horns had net yards offensively while Baylor had SECOND QUARTER Stockton kicked a yard field goal on the first play of the quarter to give the Horns a lead they would never relinquish at Baylor went threeplaysandout two straight times and after the second one the Longhorns finally found the end zone Applewhite hit Johnson for Brandon Healy for Mitchell for more and then Montrell Flowers for the final yards and the TD Stocktons kick gave Texas a lead with left After an exchange of punt UT safety Greg Brown intercepted Tomchecks pass at the Bear and returned it to the Applewhite hit Johnson to the then sneaked in for the TD Stocktons kick made it with left After another quick Baylor punt the Longhorns struck again Applewhite hit freshman WR Roy Williams for found Mitchell for more and then hit Johnson for yards and the TD Texas went for two points and Applewhite connected with Mitchell to make it with left At the half Texas had yards offensively to the Bears THIRD QUARTER Baylor got the ball first and drove to the Texas but a yard penalty and then sacks on successive plays by CB Quentin Jammer and redshirt freshm an DT Marcus Tubbs pushed the Bears back to near midfield and forced a punt Neither team mounted another drive until late in the period when Jammer got his second interception and ran it back to the Baylor A pass interferen ce penalty and an Applewhite pass to Johnson set up a yard Stockton FG to make it with left The Longhorns had yards at this point to Baylors FOURTH QUARTER Chris Simms relieved Applewhite at QB and had the Longhorns on the march at the Baylor before his pass into the right flat was picked off by Bear CB Eric Giddens who ran it back yards for Baylors final touchdown to cut the UT lead to with left Backup TBs Victor Ike and Kenny Hayt er alternated short runs and Simms went for for yards before Hayter got another UT touchdown on a oneyard plunge Stocktons kick gave Texas a lead with left The Longhorn backups scored again on their next possession driving yards in eight plays with Simms hitting freshman WR Sloan Thomas for yards and Ike getting the final yards for the touchdown on a fourthdown play Stocktons kick brought the final score to with left Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorns played really well defensively against Baylor but we just werent in sync on offense After viewing the game tapes he said the Longhorns are facing a tough fina l three regular season games and will have to play much better to have a chan ce to win For us to win the next three weeks we need to be more balanced Brown said We need to be able to run the ball He also said the Longhorns are more physical than they were early in the year but he said they need to be more physical particularly in being able to run the ball Baylor put a lot of guys around the line of scrimmage and made it harder f or us to run the ball he said But we still should have been more physical and we should have been able to run the ball The best thing we did offensively was pass protect he said The offensi ve line did a tremendous job of picking up all the blitzes He also praised tackles Leonard Davis and Mike Williams saying they are playing extremely well Running the ball successfully he said is an attitude When you take linemen the size of ours and keep pounding they the opposing linemen get tired Our staff has taken the position that were going to make the run work regardless of how many are stacked in there he said Well just hang in there and keep working at it Brown said the coaches decided to play freshman DT Adam Doiron because Shau n Rogers is still hampered by a sprained ankle Ryan Haywood is out for the year with a shoulder injury and Stevie Lee might be out for the year with a n ankle injury Asked how Doiron played he said He played really well He was in there f or plays and he had four tackles and he got in the right place on just abo ut every play I think he has a chance to be a real good player Brown said Doiron has wanted to play all year Well get a minimum of five games from him Sometimes you have to play some freshmen when you have injuries It was at about this time last year that we started playing Bo Scaife Playing Scaife from midseason on last year worked out well because he suffered a torn ACL during twoaday workouts He was lost for this season which will be counted as his redshirt year making him a sophomore in eligibility again next season True freshman TE Brock Edwards got his first start because Mike Jones is ou t for the year with a torn ACL Brown said I thought Brock did a really goo d job for his first game to start He dropped his first ball but then made a great catch in the corner and ran well after he caught it Brown said redshirt freshman DT Marcus Tubbs played his best game Tubbs has been starting while Shaun Rogers has been limited with a sprained ankle He had a sack and three tackles for losses Saturday Doiron Ninth True Freshman to Play Defensive tackle Adam Doiron played Saturday against Baylor and he is the ninth true freshman to see action this year Four true freshmen are starting They are tight end Brock Edwards defensiv e end Kalen Thornton and wide receivers Roy Williams and B J Johnson CB Nathan Vasher has started when the Longhorns open with a nickel defense five defensive backs Other true freshman who have played are defensive tackle Stevie Lee safety Phillip Geiggar and wide receive Sloan Thomas Coach Mack Brown said he probably will redshirt the remainder of the freshm an class Fullback Will Matthews has been impressive on the scout team and probably would have played this season but he was bothered by severe headaches duri ng the early drills and that set him back Other freshmen who are redshirting but who are drawing praise from the starters for their work on the scout teams are QB Chance Mock RB Sneezy Beltran WR Tony Jeffery OT Lionel Garr and LB Austin Sendlein The current UT freshman class was rated as high as No in the country by the various recruiting services and it came on the heels of a class that was a runaway choice as the best class in the country The class was headed by Cory Redding and Chris Simms the USA Today defensive and offensive players of the year That was a great class and it is living up to its press clippings Redding is starting TE Bo Scaife was to start before his knee injury OGs Derrick Dockery and Tillman Holloway have started CB Roderick Babers is a starter and so is safety Dakarai Pearson DT Marcus Tubbs also has started But I think the current freshman class is even better with four players starting as true freshmen and several more playing key roles Williams already holds the yardage record for Longhorn freshmen receivers and Johnson is third and holds the freshman single game yardage record They are the two best freshmen wide receivers I have ever seen and Thomas and Jeffery make it a great foursome because they are outstanding receivers too The Longhorns will be a lot better next year than they are this year becaus e all of those top freshmen and sophomores will be a year older and will have one more year of experience But just think how good they will be when those two classes are juniors and seniors and are backed up by the outstanding class the coaches are recruiti ng right now and the one they will get next year Injury Update Offensive guard Antwan KirkHughes was held out of the Baylor game to give his sore shoulder a rest and he probably will be able to play at Texas Tec h Saturday The knee injury TE Mike Jones suffered turned out to be a torn ACL so he will undergo surgery and will be out for the rest of the season That leaves freshman Brock Edwards as the only healthy tight end Fullback Cha d Stevens a former tight end has been working at both positions Safety Lee Jackson suffered a leg injury in the Baylor game and is questionable for Saturday Freshman defensive tackle Stevie Lee who underwent foot surgery to repair a broken bone about a month ago is due to be examined again this week to see if he can return this season Lee is eligible for a medical redshirt year if he is unable to play again this season Redshirt freshman wide receiver Artie Ellis is having problems with the sam e shin injury that hampered him during spring practice He had a stress fracture then and the same shin is sore again He is not expected to play at Tech Others who are likely to miss the Tech game are outside linebacker O J McClintock sprained knee and defensive tackle Ryan Haywood shoulder injury The True Orange FaxEMail

advantage of some matchups An offense has to have the ability to win both ways running or throwing That took away som e of their blitzes We also wanted to change the tempo We werent pleased wi th the tempo to start the game UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis explaining why the Longhorns went primarily with the passing game out of the shotgun formation I thought we played good after that early touchdown Thank goodness we didnt play for a shutout Our kids came out and played hard They made som e plays that changed field position UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese I have to give Texas credit They have a very good defensive team We had a pretty broad selection of formations and plays but we never really got in sync and Texas had a lot to do with that Baylor head coach Kevin Steele You dont come out and try to set records It just happens Setting record s isnt important I just want to win UT WR B J Johnson who caught nine passes for yards the best da y ever for a Longhorn freshman receiver Gary Baxter is a great cornerback and they tried to do some things on the weak side with him pressing Roy Williams and a safety helping out over th e top That freed B J to get a oneonone matchup and he took advantage of it Texas receivers coach Darryl Drake discussing how the Bears tried to put the clamps on one of the Longhorns outstanding freshmen wide receivers on ly to see another one have a record day It was pretty tough out there Baxter is a tough corner and they had a safety helping out a lot Roy Williams UTs freshman receiver who still managed to catch three passes for yards and run his season receiving yardage total to yards the best ever for a Longhorn freshman Its an honor but its a team award The thing I was disappointed in toda y is that we werent sharp to

November Mitchell Stockton Defense Lead Longhorns Past Raiders Applewhite Hurts Other Knee It was a game of surges weather wise and on the football field Saturday night in Lubbock and Texas triumphed because the Longhorns had two surges and Texas Tech had only one The Longhorns dominated the first quarter an d most of the second in cold rainy soldout Jones Stadium coming out smoking offensively for the first time all season Midway through the second quarter Texas was ahead and seemingly on the way to an easy win But Texas Tech scored points before intermission then scored again early in the second half to take a lead Despite losing QB Major Applewhite to a knee injury the right one not the surgically repaired left one the Longhorns roared back to score the game s final points to claim the victory and stay alive in the Big title cha se Coach Mack Brown said an MRI was done on Applewhites knee Sunday and he hopes to know the results sometime Monday He said he is hoping it is just a sprain The Longhorn heroes were plentiful Offensively the entire line played great TB Hodges Mitchell was tremendous and Kris Stockton booted five fiel d goals and narrowly missed on a yard attempt late in the first half Mitchell had carries for yards and scored both Longhorn touchdowns He also caught six passes for yards Defensively the Horns forced five turnovers which the offense converted into points and shut the Raider offense out for the final minutes The victory gave Texas a season record and Big mark while Tech fell to overall and in the Big If Texas AM upsets Oklahoma this weekend the Longhorns can tie the Sooner s for the Big South title by beating Kansas and AM to close the regular season By virtue of their win over the Horns the Sooners would represent the Sout h in the title game but the tie and a record would land the Longhorns in a top bowl game The Longhorns have won four games in a row after a slow start this season Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER The Longhorns moved the ball all over the field in the first quarter and to ok a lead They got the ball first and drove yards to the Tech with Mitchell getting all of the yardage on six tough runs behind good blocking and a yard pass reception But the drive stalled and Stockton kicked a yard field goal for a lead with left Tech went three plays an d out and Mitchell led another Longhorn drive that went yards for a touchdown and a lead with left He carried four times for yard s including a yard burst over right tackle for the TD Applewhite also hit freshman TE Brock Edwards for yards during the drive With the aid of tw o penalties against UT the Raiders drove to the Texas and QB Kliff Kingsbury hit WR Tim Baker at the but Baker fumbled and the Horns recovered and were on the move again when the quarter ended SECOND QUARTER The drive that started at the Texas stalled at the TT but Stocktons yard field goal gave UT a leadwith left UT safety Greg Brown s interception of a long Kingsbury pass killed Techs next effort but Texas couldnt move and punted for the first time Kingsbury operating out of th e shotgun bobbled a low snap and UT CB Ahmad Brooks fell on the loose ball a t the Raiders The Horns picked up a first down at the but Mitchell wa s stopped for no gain and two passes were incomplete so Stockton kicked a yard field goal for a lead with left But the Raiders came rig ht back and Kingsbury hit WR Carlos Francis for a yard touchdown strike tha t cut the UT lead to with remaining Texas had to punt and Tech aided by a pass interference penalty drove to the UT before settling fo r a yard field goal to cut the deficit to with left Applewhite was sacked and fumbled on UTs next possession giving the Raiders great field position at the Texas But the Longhorn defense held and a yard field goal try fell short UT drove to the Tech but Stocktons yard field goal try just missed to the left in the final seconds of the half THIRD QUARTER Tech got the ball to start the half but couldnt mount a drive But Applewhites pass was picked off by Tech DB John Norman who ran it back t o the UT Kingsbury got yards on a QB draw which was the longest Raide r run of the game and Ricky Williams went over the top for the final yard T he extra point put Tech on top with left But that lead was shor t lived Starting from their the Longhorns drove to the Tech before Applewhite was sacked on a thirddown play He came up limping and never returned to the game Stockton booted a yard field goal to put Texas bac k on top with left The Raiders went three plays and out and so did the Longhorns but Stocktons punt was fumbled at the Tech and Micha el Ungar recovered for the Horns Behind great blocking Mitchell ran for then for the final and the TD that gave Texas a little breathing room at with left The Raiders were driving as the quarter ended FOURTH QUARTER DE Cole Pittman sacked Kingsbury on the first play of the quarter and CB Roderick Babers intercepted Kingsburys pass two plays later and ran it bac k yards to the Tech Mitchell carried fiv e times fror yards and Simms under a big rush found Johnson for yards But a penalty set the Horns back and Stockton came in to boot his fifth field goal a yarder to put the Horns on top with left The Raiders killed most of the clock with a long drive that came up empty They drove from their own to the UT so slowly and laboriously that the clock ran from to by the time their fourthdown pass sailed incomplete The drive would have end ed much earlier but for two strange penalties against the Horns One was a la te offside call after UT recovered a fumble and the other was a personal foul on UT DE Cory Redding after he sacked Kingsbury The officials said the foul w as a blow to the head but Redding didnt appear to hit him in the head At an y rate after the fourthdown play failed Mitchell carried six straight time s for yards and two first downs to run out the rest of the clock Number Updated

repair a torn ACL anterier cruciate ligament Brown said the injury to his right knee Saturday in Lubbock might be just a sprain Im not a doctor so I dont know he said Were having an MRI done today and well know more tomorrow But Applewhite had to be taken off the field on a stretcher in the Cotton Bowl and he was standing on the sideline with Brown at the end of the Texas Tech game We were standing on the sideline at the end of the game Brown said He walked off the field with me He was upbeat and excited about the game It sure didnt look like what happened to him in the Arkansas game He said Chris Simms played well in relief and he said the fact that Simms played as much as he did early this season is a big plus if Applewhites injury turns out to be serious Chris progresses every time he walks out on the field Brown said He pu t a tremendous amount of pressure on himself early in the season I felt like last night was the most comfortable he has been There is no doubt in our minds that Chris is more ready to play now than h e was at the first of the season Brown said Simms threw only two passes and he completed both of them As he said my main job was pitching to Hodges left and pitching to Hodges right With Hodges Mitchell rushing for yards and carries both career high s and the line opening huge holes that was the Longhorn offense for most of the night Brown also said he probably wouldnt take the redshirt off freshman QB Chan ce Mock if Applewhites injury is serious Well talk about that Id think right now wed play Beau Trahan Brown said freshman TE Brock Edwards played really well and he said DT Casey Hampton DEs Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton LB DeAndre Lewis and D Bs Quentin Jammer Rod Babers and Greg Brown played well too He said LB Tyro ne Jones had by far his best game He also said the offensive line played great and Hodges did a great job of picking his holes Weve shown the ability in the last four games to throw it or run it We couldnt do that earlier in the year Brown said the five Tech turnovers were a great credit to the UT defense a nd he said Im really proud of the offense to with four minutes left take it and drive it on the ground and run out the clock Ive alway said you need to be able to run the ball in the fourth quarter to win Owens Thomas Lead Horns Junior forward Chris Owens had points and rebounds and freshm an forward James Thomas had points and nine rebounds to lead the Longhorn basketball team to a exhibition victory over Team Ezybonds of Austral ia before fans at the Frank Erwin Center Sunday night I think for the most part we played hard tonight Texas coach Rick Barn es said I think our guys realize that with being such a young team you hav e to go through some growing pains Our defense was not good tonight We go t hurt in transition defense and by dribble penetration so well obviously have to work on those things Owens scored his points on of shooting in just minutes of work while Thomas went of from the floor Junior swingman Maurice Evans added points on of shooting while junior point guard Fredie Willia ms had five points seven assists andseven steals Texas concludes its exhibition season

spend some time looking at the videotape of this game becau se everything that could happen in a basketball game happened here tonight said Texas head coach Jody Conradt I think we started strong pushing the ball up the floor which was good but then the game was too easy at the start and we got into a lull Injury Update Coach Mack Brown said Sunday reserve CB Ervis Hill suffered a separated shoulder and will miss the Kansas game but he said OG Antwan KirkHughes played most of the Texas Tech game without having any shoulder problems KirkHughes shoulder had been popping out but Brown said he was encourage d that he went through an entire game without problems He also said DT Shaun Rogers played without reinjuring his ankle Redshirt freshman DT Ryan Haywood underwent shoulder surgery Wednesday and is out for the remainder of the season Brown said Haywood had a high school shoulder injury that flared up again this year He said the surgery should eliminate the problem and he said Haywood might be available for part or possibly all of spring practice Texas No Favored by Texas is No this week in both the Associated Press and USA Today football polls and the Longhorns are favored

controlled the clock and kept the defense fresh UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese Texas Techs defense was th in the country and we felt like we needed t o establish the run and stay twodimensional Our offensive line did a great job I thought our drive for a field goal right after they took the lead wa s really critical They had taken the momentum from us and we got it back UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis The draw play was open for them all night We were trying to rush the passer and they kept hurting us with that draw Texas Tech head coach Mike Leach We were moving it down the field but we made some mistakes at crucial times You cant give a good team like Texas that many opportunities with fumbles But they had a good scheme and it really got the best of us Raider QB Kliff Kingsbury I played almost all of my high school games on turf On turf I feel quick er than everybody else The Tech defense was doing a lot of blitzing and the offensive line did a great job picking

Kansas at pm Saturday The game will not be televised The Jayhawks are They lost to SMU to open the season then bea t AlabamaBirmingham and Southern Illinois before falling to Oklahoma and Kansas State Then they defeated Missouri and Colorado before dropping a game to Texas Tech and then getting hammered by Nebraska The Jayhawks have a unique offense QB Dylen Smith is one of the rare quarterbacks who feels just as comfortable running the option or dropping back into a fourwide receiver set He is and fast and shifty Texas coach Mack Brown says Smith is a really athletic quarterback who has a great arm and who can make plays with his arm or his quick feet He also says RB David Winbush is the leading rusher in Kansas history and thats a school that has had Gale Sayers and John Riggins of Chicago Bears and Washington Redskins fame respectively WR Harrison Hill is one of the best in the league Defensively nose tackle Nate Dwyer is the anchor in the middle of the line and LBs Chaz Murphy and Andrew LeClair are big run stoppers The Jayhawks are giving up more yards than they are gaining which is never a good sign but they have been impressive at times particularly when they a re playing at home The Longhorns are a point favorite but this is a dangerous road game because Kansas has to beat Texas and then Iowa State next week to qualify f or a bowl game To win the Horns need to start quickly like they did in Lubbock and the defense needs to pressure Smith and keep Winbush under control If Major Applewhites knee injury turns out to be serious they also need t o have a balanced offense to keep all the pressure from falling on Chris Simm s inexperienced shoulders They also need to score more touchdowns than field goals when they get inside the Heres how the teams

Dallas Carter created quite a stir last week when he was quoted in the Dallas News as saying he remains committed to Texas but might take a visit or two just to be sure of his commitment Texas coach Mack Brown generally sees a commitment as being binding on both parties He tells recruits when they are ready to commit that UT will guarantee them scholarships and they are supposed to guarantee they will honor their commitments and refrain from visiting other schools Scott has talked off an on about visiting other schools but he hasnt set up any visits yet Ill keep you posted if he does QBAthlete Kendal Briles of Wollforth Frenship another UT pledge says Nebraska continues to recruit him but he says he is solid for the Longhorn s Central Texas normally doesnt have very many top recruits but four of bes t in the state and in the nation his year are in Central Texas and three of them play in District A which stretches from Waco in the north to Georgetown in the south Those four recruits will go a long ways toward determining whether the Longhorns have a great recruiting class or just a very good one The A players are DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison LB Derrick Johns on of Waco and DB Dewayne Brandon of Temple The other top prospect is QBAthlete Quan Cosby of Mart who led his team t o a record and a Class A state title last year Texas is recruiting all four of them and has the lead with Johnson Brandon and Cosby Harris has favored Texas when he lists a preference but he has been more noncommital about his college choice recently Texas has a good chance to get all four of them and that would really put t he icing on an already outstanding recruiting class Student Sports magazine currently has UT ranked No behind Michigan in th e national recruiting rankings If the Horns get three or four of those Central Texans I mentioned earlier they will have a great shot at the top spot And for those of you who have expressed concern that the Longhorns twolos s season could pose a problem Michigan has three losses already A seaso n at this point is a very good year to sell to recruits I still expect the Longhorns to sign or kids With already committed that leaves room for only six or seven more players In addition to the obvious recruiting targets I have been writing about recently there are two super prospects in Louisiana who are talking about taking official visits to Texas the weekend of the TexasTexas AM game They are DT Marquise Hill of New Orleans De La Salle and TE Marcus Spears of Baton Rouge Southern Lab The two Louisiana prospects and DL Kaelen Jakes of Valenci a Cal are the only outofstate prospects on the Longhorn radar screen at this time UT has a very good shot at Jakes Hill and Spears are long shots A True Orange Subscription Is The

November Mitchell SimmstoWilliams Combination Way Too Much For Jayhawks Aggies Next Kansas came out smoking in damp freezing Lawrence Saturday taking a lead over Texas before the sparse crowd had time to settle down but the Longhorns came storming back for an easy victory Senior TB Hodges Mitchell broke the UT and Big records for allpurpose yardage in a single game He had yards rushing yards in receptions and yards in punt returns for total yards He also scored two touchdowns But sophomore QB Chris Simms subbing for the injured Major Applewhite and sensational freshman WR Roy Williams also were huge offensive guns for the Longhorns Simms passed for yards and two touchdowns and Williams caught four of h is passes for yards and both touchdowns all in the first half Willia ms also added a yard touchdown on a new play an end around Williams a true freshman already held the season record in reception yardage and in touchdowns for freshmen Kansas coach Terry Allen said his defense was able to hold Mitchells production down early but then we had to doublecover Williams and that opened some running lanes When this UT offense is clicking its hard for a defense to stop because Mitchell just needs a little crease to be productive and he gets those creases regularly when Williams draws double coverage It takes a brave or foolhardy coach to consistently single cover Williams a pounder with awesome speed and leaping ability The victory gave Texas an season record and Big mark heading into an open week and then the big regular season finale the day after Thanksgiving against Texas AM The Longhorns have won five games in a row after a start Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER The Longhorns started fearfully slow offensively and defensively Texas got the ball first couldnt make a first down and punted quickly Kansas score d in three plays with WR Derick Mills going the final yards on a reverse to give the Jayhawks a lead with left On the fourth play after the kickoff Simms pass in the left flat was picked off and returned yards for a touchdown by KU CB Andrew Davison That put the Jayhawks on top with left The Longhorns finally got something going on their third possession driving from their own to a first down at the Kansas but they stalled and Kris Stockton kicked a yard field goal to cut the defic it to with left Longhorn LB DeAndre Lewis pounced on a Kansas fumb le four plays later to set the Longhorn s up at the Jayhawk Simms hit Williams behind Davison for a touchdown on the first play to cut the Kansas lead to with left The Longhorns decided to go for a point conversion but it backfired when Simms under pressure threw into the end zone and Kansas safety Carl Nesmith picked it off and returned it plus yards for two point for the Jayhawks and a lead Huge Longhorn OT Leonard Davis showed a lot of heart on that play chasing Nesmith all the w ay down the sideline But that was the last highlight for the Jayhawks They h ad to punt from their own and the punter shanked it to the KU With the Jayhawks now aware of Williams and his longdistance threat Mitchell ran f or then more and then for the TD Stocktons kick tied it at wi th seconds left SECOND QUARTER The Texas defense forced the Jayhawks to punt quickly and Williams got behi nd Davison again on the first play and Simms hit him for a yard touchdown play Stocktons kick put UT on top for the first time only seconds deep in the quarter Mitchell set up the Horns next touchdown with a yard punt return to the Kansas Simms scrambled for four yards then hit Williams again to the Jayhawk Mitchell scored on the next play for a left with second left in the half Texas had a edge in yardage and a advantage in first downs THIRD QUARTER Kansas had a good drive to open the second half but redshirt freshman safe ty Dakarai Pearson stopped it with an interception at the UT Later in the period Williams scored on a yard end around to give Texas a lead with left Mitchells yard punt return to the Texas got the Longhorns started on their next drive Simms picked up nine yards on a scramble then Mitchell ran for more than then for another TD to run the score to with left FOURTH QUARTER Backup TB Victor Ike scored the final touchdown on a yard run with left Backup QB Beau Trahan one of the teams top special teams players relieved Simms and played most of the quarter Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorns are a much better football team than they were early this season He said the teams fivegame winning streak is something they worked very hard to achieve I am very proud of our team over the past five weeks he said To win three conference games on the road including backtoback away contests against teams that all had something to prove shows me that our team is no t only tough but is gaining more confidence As a result they are also earning back some of their national respect h e said Brown said playing straight weeks worked a real hardship on the team an d he said the open date this week is very welcome He said the regular season finale against Texas AM on Nov the Friday after Thanksgiving will be a tough one We will use this week to prepare for Texas AM which I think has been underrated all year he said JaMar Toombs is one of the best tailbacks in the country and Robert Ferguson is one of the top receivers It also looks to me as if they have improved their offense with quarterbac k Mark Farris taking the helm and defensively they are the same great team that they have always been We will have our hands full in two weeks But he said the Longhorns have improved so much that they have a chance to close strong if they keep working hard He also said sophomore QB Chris Simms subbing for the injured Major Applewhite gets better every time he gets to play I was pleased with the way he came back after his rough start Brown said He showed the ability to scramble and make plays He also displayed good leadership in the huddle Brown said We should ha ve thrown the ball more in the second half but we still wanted to be physica l and use the running game as much as possible Brown said the victory at Kansas was a big one because it was the second straight tough road trip and the players really kept their focus Overall we felt that it was a very good win for us We were able to play everybody that we took on the trip and came out of the game very well Offensively we won the field position battle with our kicking game Roy Williams played great and we were obviously pleased to have plays in th e running game produce about yards In fact he said we have felt good about our running game over the last five weeks as Hodges Mitchell has established himself as one of the best running backs in the country In terms of the quarterback position we only threw the ball three times i n the second half but I thought Chris Simms got better as the game went on He hit big plays in the passing game and kept moving the chains for us Defensively Brown said we didnt let Kansas score again after their first drive so we also played very well on that side of the ball Brown said he knew the Longhorns had hit the jackpot when they signed WRs Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas last February but he said the freshmen receivers are even better than he thought I have been very impressed with the maturity of Roy Sloan and BJ he said Yesterday was a day that young players could have been flat because of the cold weather and lack of a big crowd I have been amazed all year with how these freshmen play as if they are older The young players have compet ed and showed a lot of maturity which is hard to do at that age Brown said he has been telling the team it needs to keep winning to have a shot at a good bowl game We try to have a theme each week he said and our theme last week was t o put ourselves in position to go to the best bowl possible Regardless of what bowl it is we know we do not get to choose he said I went through the bowls available to our team last week which was the only time this year that we have mentioned bowls I also showed our players the records of each team in the league and told them that it is critical for them to beat Kansas he said adding that eac h win improves the bowl picture for the team Horns Climb to th in AP Texas is ranked th in this weeks Associated Press poll Five Big teams are in the top headed by topranked Oklahoma the onl y team remaining with a perfect record Other Big teams ranked are Kansas State at No Nebraska at No and Texas AM at No One cautionary note should be injected here There is a very good reason wh y Texas has not finished in the APs top since It is the fact that every time the Longhorns got close to the top or actually got in the top the unthinkable happened and they lost and went tumbling down the rankings You have to go back no farther than the start of this season The Horns opened at No and in the second week of the season they ventured out to Palo Alto and got upset by Stanford They havent been close to the top since until now If they beat the Aggies and win their bowl game they will break that ye ar drought but thats a big if A Clutch Freshman True freshman WR Roy Williams has been Mr Clutch for the Longhorns He is averaging yards per catch on his seven touchdown receptions In addition five of his TD grabs came when the Horns were behind or tied a nd the other two came when UT held either a point or point lead Basketball Team Opens The Longhorn mens basketball team opens its season tonight Monday when i t hosts Navy at pm in the Erwin Center in the opening round of the Preseason NIT Texas won its two preseason exhibition games leading up to the start of th e regular season showing a surprisingly strong inside game without departed big men Chris Mihm and Gabe Muoneke Freshman forward James Thomas was a big factor in both exhibition games He had points and nine rebounds in the victory over EA Sports California AllStars Wednesday after getting points and nine boards in t he triumph overTeam Ezybonds of Australia last Sunday Junior forward Chris Owens had points and seven rebounds against the California team and points and rebounds against Ezybonds Junior swingman Maurice Evans a transfer from Wichita State had points seven rebounds and three blocks against EA Sports and freshman Brian Boddicker had points and eight boards in just minutes Junior transfer point guard Fredie Williams scored five points three steal s and nine assists against only three turnovers Lee Will Get Medical Redshirt Coach Mack Brown said Sunday freshman DT Stevie Lee wont play against Texa s AM because the broken bone in his foot has not allowed him to begin practicing That means Lee will get a medical redshirt and will be a redshirt freshman next year He was injured in the third game and anyone who suffers a seasonending injury prior to the fourth game is eligible for a medical redshirt year INJURY NOTES Brown said starting QB Major Applewhite is questionable for t he Aggie game He suffered a knee sprain against Texas Tech and missed the Kansas game Brown said safety Lee Jacksons leg injury is much better and he probably will play against AM WR Artie Ellis shin and TE Brock Edwards leg are both questionable for the Aggie game Edwards injury left the Horns with converted FB Chad Stevens as the only healthy scholarship TE at Kansas DT Shaun Rogers played without reinjuring his ankle and should be closer to for the Aggie game than he has been since early this season OG Antwan KirkHughes has been having problems with a shoulder and it bothered him during the Kansas game but the week off should give him a chance to be ready for the Aggie game The True Orange FaxEMail Deal Is a Great Christmas Gift Ill Have Frequent Reports on Recruiting And Practice

former Odessa Permian teammate who is paralyzed from the chin down after sufferin g a cracked vertebrae in practice earlier in the week The big man is really good Simms talking about Williams Hodges Mitchell really gets the job done If we give him just a little hole he really gets through it in a hurry Longhorn OT Leonard Davis the biggest man on the team talking about one of the smallest I didnt think I was going to get to yards again but these last two games really helped The offensive line is just doing a great job Texas TB Hodges Mitchell who has yards rushing to give him backtoback yard seasons I thought he was a pretty easy quarterback to read I just stepped in fron t of the receiver caught the ball and I was gone I dont know what happened after that I guess after the first one I got I thought I knew what he was going to do so I cheated a little Kansas CB Andrew Davison who returned one of Chris Simms passes for a touchdown but then gave up four completions from Simms to Roy

rival Texas AM on Nov the day after Thanksgiving The game has a pm kickoff and will be televised nationally by ABC Texas is ranked No in the AP poll and AM is No The Longhorns are and the Aggies are heading into the game and Tex as is also a game ahead in the race for second place in the Big South with a record to AMs The Aggies like the Longhorns had a slow start this season They opened with a loss at Notre Dame before winning three straight over Wyomin g UTEP and Texas Tech But then they were upset at home by previously winless Colorado Much like the debacle in Dallas caused Texas to bear down and start playing better the loss to Colorado seemed to bring out the best in AM Since that disappointing loss they have defeated Baylor Iowa State and Northern Division leader Kansas State before losing to topranked Oklahoma Saturday by a razorthin margin Mark Farris a yearold sophomore who gave pro baseball a whirl before winning the AM QB job has put some life into the Aggies offense He is a very cool and very accurate passer and he has some outstanding receivers Huge TBFB JaMar Toombs also is an effective weapon But it is on defense where the Aggies win or lose most games The Longhorns outstanding defense actually has better statistics overall but the Aggies are No in the country in scoring defense giving up an average of only points per game There are four keys to a UT victory two on offense one on defense and one on special teams Offensively they must be balanced and they cant lose the turnover battle and they surely cant stand any touchdowns by the Aggie defense Defensively they have to shut down the Aggie running game and pressure Farris On special teams the Aggies are good at blocking punts and the Longhorns have had some blocked Thats a nono if the Horns

annual football banquet Nearly all of the recruits who have already committed to Texas have chos en that weekend to visit and so have most of the players the Longhorns are still recruiting The list of players the Longhorns are still seriously recruiting is continuing to shrink At this point there are recruits left on the board who a have offers or will get offers if they check out okay academically and b are strongly considering the Longhorns They are DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison LB Derrick Johnson of Waco D L Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal TE James Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson bot h of Galena Park North Shore OL Jamie Hightower of Jacksonville OL William Winston of Houston Madison safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple athlete Quan Cosby of Mart and DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC Most of the remaining six or seven scholarships will go to the players in that group Johnson Jakes Moses Jackson and Brandon all list Texas No at this point and it is possible the Longhorns will get all five of them Winston also says Texas is tops with him right now but he also wants to lo ok at several outofstate schools Harris is the remaining recruit who is No on my wish list for two excellent reasons First he is the top DT prospect in the country Second he is the only top DT who is considering the Longhorns But Oklahoma is making a big run at him and he is listening He also is being heavily recruited by Florida State and he plans to visit the Seminole s this weekend Harris earlier listed Texas No but now says the Sooners and Seminoles a re his top two teams He plans to visit Texas the Dec weekend and has another trip set up to Texas AM the Dec weekend There actually is another top DT who is interested in Texas Broussard but he has many academic hurdles to clear Jakes has already visited Texas and the other nine players in that man grouping all say they plan to visit Texas the Dec weekend unless their teams are still in the high school playoffs Their teams will have to be really good to be still in the playoffs at that point because that will be the weekend of the state semifinals in some classes and the finals in other classes There are some other great prospects who are long shots but are still in the picture They are headed by DT Marquise Hill of New Orleans De La Salle and DE Justin Tomerlin of San Clemente Cal Tomerlin has been committed to Florida State for several weeks but now say s he wants to visit several other schools including Texas He says he still is committed to FSU Im not sure he will visit but if he does there is a chance Hill says he will take an official visit to Texas the Thanksgiving weekend and will attend the TexasAM game Hill has already visited LSU and plans to visit Michigan the Dec weekend Georgia the Dec weekend and Georgia Tech the Dec weekend He said his big three are Michigan LSU and Texas Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter Abe Robinson Jersey Village Alfio Randall

Briles Wolfforth Frenship Braden Johnson Euless Trinity Brian Carter The Woodlands Punter Brian Bradford Trinity Valley JC The Bowl Picture If the Longhorns defeat Texas AM on the Friday after Thanksgiving they wi ll wind up in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas the Holiday Bowl in San Diego or the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio Those three bowls get the top three picks from the Big in that order after the BCS takes the league champion Conventional wisdom holds that Texas and the Cotton Bowl wont hook up agai n because the Longhorns have already played there on two consecutive New Year s Days But dont be too sure The Cotton Bowl brass likes the Longhorns and Texas coach Mack Brown loves New Years Day bowls If that doesnt come to pass then it will be either the Holiday or Alamo bowl for the Longhorns What if Texas loses to Texas AM I hate to consider the unthinkable and I wont until and unless that happens But if it does well all need to do some research on the Insightcom Bowl the Independence Bowl and maybe the Galleryfurniturecom Bowl UT Women Impressive Sophomore guard Tai Dillard scored a careerhigh points and led three Longhorns in doublefigure scoring as Texas captured a victory over Tulane Sunday at the Erwin center in the second round of the Preseason Womens National Invitation Tournament WNIT With the win Texas advances to the Preseason WNIT semifinal and championship rounds next Sunday and Monday at a site to be determined Texas joins No Louisiana Tech and No Virginia in the fourteam semifinals No Purdue hosts Georgetown today Monday in the final game to determine the fourth semifinalist The Preseason WNIT semifinal pairings will be Texas versus the PurdueGeorgetown winner and Louisiana Tech versus Virginia The Preason WNIT committee has announced that if Purdue defeats Georgetown then the Boilermakers will serve as the host school for the Preseason WNIT semifinals Sunday and thirdplace and championship games Monday in West Lafayette Indiana If Georgetown upsets Purdue then the Preseason WNIT semifinals and championship round will be hosted by Texas at the Erwin Center The site an d times will be announced late Monday Joining Dillard in doublefigure scoring were junior forward Tracy Cook wh o tallied points and senior guard JoRuth Woods who chipped in with points Woods added a teamhigh seven rebounds and had five assists which tied her best career night total Texas shot percent from the floor of while the Green Wave hit percent of their shots for Texas shot from the field in the first half en route to a lead in the win over Tulane Tulane turned the ball over times while UT committed turnovers The Horns also held an advantage in steals to nine while Tulane outrebounded Texas UT also scored points off turnovers to Tulanes Texas had advanced to the WNIT second round with Fridays win over Wichita State while Tulane bested Grambling State in the first round Woods had points and Cook added points in the victory over Wichita State in the season opener for both squads The Longhorns who never trailed in the game were aided by an outstanding for effort from the free throw line as they hit percent of thei r foul shots The Longhorns also shot percent from the floor and outscored the Shockers in the paint Wichita State was held to a percent shooting performance as the Shockers hit just of shots WSU also turned the ball over times while UT committed turnovers Also scoring in double figures against Wichita State were Dillard who had points and freshman forward Stacy Stephens who had points a gamehigh eight rebounds and had a gamehigh seven steals in her first game as a Longhorn In both their games the Longhorns have shown much better quickness and athleticism as a team than they showed last season This was a good first outing for us Conradt said We wanted to have a strong effort on the defensive end of the floor and we succeeded We are starting and playing a lot of young people she said and at this point in time I think we have the athletic ability the quickness and the depth to play solid defense and press Success starts with defense and we were really good again today on D Conradt added We came out with excellent intensity on defense and it helped that we started off shooting strongly As we look ahead to the WNIT semifinals and if Purdue wins against Georgetown then well be playing on the road in West Lafayette Conradt said If we do go on the road I think we all welcome the opportunity to see how we stack up against a top team and how we handle the pressure of being away from

they take both by email o I am enclosing for a gift subscription email o I am enclosing for a gift subscription to the newsletter and the fa x email Name of Recipient Address fax no if applicable City State Zip Your Name Any Message You Want on Card True Orange Observations I think it is time for the Texas Athletic Department to do some major soul searching about the way it treats Longhorn football fans This season has set a modern day record for callous treatment of some of th e most loyal fans in all of college football First there was that unconscionable am kickoff of the LousianaLafayette game in early September and then another am kickoff for the Oklahoma game I know some older Longhorn fans who had to miss the LouisianaLafayette gam e because their doctors told them it would be hazardous to their health to attend because they would be exposed to a potentially deadly combination of extreme heat and three to four solid hours of blazing sunlight beaming down on them Both those games were on TV and that is always the excuse UT athletic officials come up with when kickoff times are inconvenient Most of us go along with things like that because nearly all of our games a re televised Last season of the were on TV But three games this season arent being televised and two of them Colorado and Kansas are the longest road trips the Longhorns have in B ig Conference play The game in Colorado was nixed to allow Texas AM at Baylor to be televised and the Kansas game this Saturday wont be televised so the Iowa State at Colorado game can be aired I know the TV folks dont worry about fan inconvenience but UT athletic officials certainly should and one thing they should include in the deal if they decide to inconvenience their fans with am kickoffs in early September heat is assurance that the two longest road trips on the conferen ce schedule wont be nixed for TV One subscriber who couldnt attend the LaLa game because of his doctors orders told me Athletic Director Deloss Dodds should sit outside in the hea t with the regular fans and he wouldnt ever have another am kickoff for a Sept game I think most fans are willing to accept some inconvenience but I think the y expect some sort of a trade off In other words if we need to have some early games for TV then we should get preference on the TV for the faraway games especially when they go up against the likes of AM at Baylor and Iowa State at Colorado It wouldnt have been a hard sell But apparently no one in the UT Athletic Department thought enough of the fans to ask for a quid pro quo Lets hope they do next year After all it takes pretty loyal fans to sell out big stadiums Saturday after Saturday when their team hasnt finished in the top in long years Horns Sign Fine Baseball Class Texas baseball coach Augie Garrido has signed of the top high school players in Texas and throughout the country Through the hard work of recruiting coordinator Tommy Harmon Frank Anders on and the entire baseball staff we have once again been able to sign a tremendous recruiting class for next season Garrido said This group includes some of the top prospects in the state and will help u s maintain

who posted an record with a ERA and strikeouts over innings and Huston Street of Austin Westlake who not only earned second team AllCentex honors as a pitcher with a record and a ERA last season but is also the son o f legendary UT pitcher and quarterback James Street Our focus with this recruiting class was to add depth in the middle infiel d behind the plate and on the mound Harmon said With the players that we have signed for next year we believe that we have accomplished that goal UT also signed top catchers James Sweeney of Houston Bellaire one of the best defensive catchers in the country and Curtis Thigpen of Forney who batted last season for Forney High School and is also regarded as an outstanding defensive backstop and outfielder Other signees were Seth Johnston of Boerne

Third Quarter Await Word on Bowl Matchup After a listless offensive performance in the first half the Longhorns romped and stomped in the third quarter and wrecked the Aggies Wrecking Crew defense en route to a victory Friday in Austin The Longhorns had offensive yards and averaged a whopping yards per play But there was a huge difference in the way the Longhorns played to start both halves Texas ran only plays for just yards in the first quarter an average o f just under yards per play The Longhorns ran plays for yards in the third quarter an average of yards per snap If not for safety Greg Browns yard scoring jaunt with an interception o f a Mark Farris pass on the Aggies first offensive play the Longhorns probably would have trailed at the half But that quick touchdown and an overall outstanding half by the Texas defen se allowed the Horns to go in at intermission with a lead Everything changed in the third quarter Chris Simms starting because of a knee injury to regular QB Major Applewhite had been throwing east and west for most of the first half But he came out throwing north and south to in the second half and it resulted in four touchdowns and points in the third quarter to enable th e Longhorns to put the game out of reach Simms hit of passes for yards and three touchdowns and he was a perfect for for yards in that pivotal third quarter Simms is just a sophomore and he was throwing primarily to those three tremendous true freshmen all day and particularly in the third quarter B J Johnson Roy Williams and Sloan Thomas combined for catches for yards and TDs The Horns also scored on their first two possessions in th e fourth quarter making them for on finishing drives to start the second half The Longhorns won their final six games after a rocky start and they will land in a major bowl see page for more on the bowl picture Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Victor Ike ran the kickoff back to the but the Horns went three and out Kris Stockton hammered a great punt that died at the Aggie On the Aggies first play QB Mark Farris threw into the left flat and Texas safety Greg Brown picked it off and strolled into the end zone for a TD Stocktons kick made it with left But the Longhorn offense failed to make a single first dow n in the quarter The Aggies made only three first downs but they came late in the quarter and got the Ags to the Texas as the quarter ended Texas had only nine plays and total yards in the quarter The Aggies had plays for yards SECOND QUARTER Aggie TB Richard Whitaker completed the drive when he broke off tackle and scored from the on thirdand for a tie with left A short kickoff gave Texas the ball at the UT On the second play Simms found freshman WR B J Johnson coming across for yards to the Aggie On th e next play Simms hit Johnson again for an apparent touchdown but a rare offensive pass interference penalty on Johnson negated it The penalty set UT back to the Simms connected with TB Hodges Mitchell on an inside screen to the AM but that was short of a first down because of the penalty Stocktons yard field goal put UT ack on top with left The Aggies got a yard pass from Farris to WR

plays including the reverse which broke our momentum an d got things going for them Texas AM head coach R C Slocum We felt like wed played the first half a little close to the vest and we wanted to

scor ed four touchdowns going into the wind in the third quarter after making only four first downs in the first half I thought our guys did a great job of battling in the first half We gave up some

unbelievable isnt it I focused on it a lot all week I just wanted to play smart and not make any mistakes Ive made mistakes throughout the year interceptions that were run back for touchdowns It

the next bid pm ESPN Independence Bowl in Shreveport Dec payout million pm ES PN Galleryfurniturecom Bowl in Houston Dec payout comes la st in the Big pecking order pm ESPN The bowl bids wont go out until after the Big title game this weekend but Kansas State probably needs to beat Oklahoma and win the automatic BCS berth to avoid falling to the lowerranking bowls on the Big list KState coach Bill Snyder is outstanding at winning games but is not popul ar with the bowl committee members because they feel he is a very reluctant participant in the prebowl festivities So the Wildcats probably wont affect the Longhorns bowl hopes because th ey will either beat Oklahoma and get an automatic BCS bid or the will lose to the Sooners and be picked for a bowl bid after the Longhorns are already se t I think Oklahoma will get a BCS bid even if the Sooners lose to KState Saturday In that case the Sooners wouldnt affect the Longhorns bowl prospects either That leaves the bowls with Big ties

night Texas hit of free throws including a six for eight performance in t he final seconds to ice the championship game The Longhorns are and off to their best start since the season Coach Jody Conradt said she is very pleased with the way her young team i s improving Recruiting Roundup Lets get the bad news out of the way first because there is a lot of good news to brighten the overall picture The bad news is that the Horns really have an uphill fight in their bid to sign the states top recruit DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison Oklahoma has the inside track now and the Sooners will have to stumble on the field or in their recruiting of Harris to give the Horns a chance to g et back in the race Nearly all of the recruits who have already committed to Texas have chos en plan to take their official visits the Dec weekend and so have most of the players the Longhorns are still recruiting That is the weekend of the annual football banquet and the only Longhorn pledges who wont be taking official visits that weekend are DE Eric Hall o f Clarksville Tenn who took his official visit earlier and possibly playe rs like RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee and QBAthlete Kendal Briles of Wollforth Frenship because they play on teams that might be still alive in the state playoffs in midDecember Benson last years Class A Offensive Player of the Year had carries f or yards and three touchdowns on runs of and yards in a thumping of El Paso Franklin in the state playoffs last weekend He also scored on a yard screen pass Briles last years Class A Offensive Player of the year completed of passes for yards and five touchdowns in a romp past El Paso Ysleta Briles who led Stephenville to the state A title last year has thrown fo r more than yards and touchdown and has run for more than yards and more TDs so far this season Despite rumors galore to the contrary both Benson and Briles said they remain solidly committed to Texas With scholarships already committed Texas will give only five to seven more this season They could go as high as seven because they can count punter Brian Bradford of Trinity Valley JC who will enroll in January against last year The best players still available who list the Longhorns No are LB Derric k Johnson of Waco DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal TE James Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson both of Galena Park North Shore OL William Winston of Houston Madison safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple athlete Quan Cosby of Ma rt and DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC Most of the remaining six or seven scholarships will go to the players in that group DT Marquise Hill of New Orleans De La Salle and DE Justin Tomerlin of San Clemente Cal are a couple of outstanding prospects who might visit Texas but they are the longest of long shots rig ht now Top recruits who came to the AM game were DTs Harris and Broussard and Longhorn commitments OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Mike Garcia of Galena Park and Terrance Young of Longview LBs Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison and Lance McFarland of Jefferson and RB Anthony Johnson of Jefferso n Two top junior prospects also were on hand OL Kyle Thornton of Dallas St Marks and WR Anthony Wright of Klein Forest Thornton is the younger brother of Longhorn freshman DE starter Kalen Thornton Aggie Injury Excuses Hollow The Aggies players and coaches did a lost of postgame moaning about their injury problems For the second straight year Texas was missing starting QB Major Applewhit e against AM and the Horns also were down to a backup FB Chad Stevens playing TE because all three scholarship TEs were injured Two top DT reserves Stevie Lee and Ryan Haywood were lost for the season starting safety Lee Jackson and super DT Shaun Rogers have missed a lot of time with injuries and redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis the guy who was counted on to give those super freshmen some time to mature had been out nearly all year with a sore shin Then you have OL like Derrick Dockery and Antwan KirkHughes who have been battle sickness andor injuries all year The point is that every team has injuries and Texas has had more of them this season than Texas AM Basketball Team Texas took a big early lead over Indiana Friday night and then held off a Hoosier comeback for a victory in the consolation game of the Tivo Preseason NIT in New York City The Longhorns started three freshmen James Thomas Brandon Mouton a nd Royal Ivey and used a stifling defense to take a lead at halftime Indiana climbed back into the game and cut the lead to seven points a t limiting Texas to just two baskets in the first of the second half Then Thomas scored five straight points as Texas restored a comfortable lea d with a run Mouton and Maurice Evans opened the game with consecutive pointers and t he Texas defensive pressure forced a lot of turnovers Chis Owens had points in the first half and led Texas with points and rebounds Texas had fallen to topranked Duke Wednesday in the tourney semifinals Mouton led Texas with points and Evans had Baseball Team Adds Four Baseball coach Augie Garrido has signed third baseman Nic Crosta of Seattle Wash righthanded pitchers Chris Scofield of Fort Worth Nolan and Danny Muegge of Blinn JC and centerfielder Dustin Majewski of Blinn JCto round o ut the Longhorns early signing class for the campaign With their potential both offensively and defensively

December Longhorns Will Face Pac TriChampion Oregon in Culligan Holiday Bowl December The thranked Longhorns who havent finished in the AP top since can wipe out years of frustration on Dec in San Diego by beating No Oregon in the Culligan Holiday Bowl While thats easy to say it will be much harder to accomplish The Ducks went overall and tied BCSbowl teams Washington and Oregon State for th e Pac championship with a record Texas has the same overall and leagu e record at and The Holiday Bowl game starts at pm Texas time and will be nationally televised by ESPN Now before I get back to the matchup let me urge all Longhorn fans to buy tickets and attend this game Why Because one major criteria for getting one of the eight elite BCS bowl bids is fan loyalty The Longhorn team forgot to show up for the Cotton Bow l last year and so did Longhorn fans who didnt fill their ticket quota Bowl folks notice things like that Coach Mack Brown has Texas poised for a long run at top status and our fans need to be in the top too to he lp the team land good bowl games So please buy some tickets the information is on page and take a few days to enjoy San Diego It will help the Longhorns in this bowl game and i t will help them get in future ones Thats it with the sermon Lets get back to the bowl matchup Brown called the game an exciting matchup and a great challenge for both programs Both teams are very well respected state institutions with a great deal of pride and tradition Brown said He also called Oregons coach Mike Bellotti a personal friend and said he has done a great job of buildin g that program Bellotti boats a record in six season at Oregon and has taken the Duc ks to bowl games in five of his six years at the helm Oregon has lost only eight games in the last three years going in in and in Oregon was picked to finish in the middle of the pack in the Pac after racking up nine wins in with a seniorladen team But Bellotti rebuilt his offense around strongarmed junior QB Joey Harrington and junior college transfer RB Maurice Morris and found competent replacements for eight lost defensive starters to produce a surprisingly good team that lost only two games all season Harrington completed of passes and the Ducks ranked th nationally in passing with yards per game Harrington threw touchdown passes while being intercepted times Morris filled the void at running back by averaging yards a game He ran for yards and eight touchdowns Senior WR Marshaun Tucker was the teams leading receiver with receptions for yards and six touchdowns Sophomore WR Keenon Howry a pound speedster is another outstanding receiver Defensively tackles Jason Nikolao and Jed Boice end Saul Patu and LB Matt Smith are the team leaders The Ducks defensive philosophy is to stop the run and dont get beat deep on pass plays Lets hope they dont make that work in the Holiday Bowl because the Horns live on beating people deep on pass plays and they also like to run the football The Ducks beat Rose Bowl representative Washington during the regul ar season and were undefeated in the Pac until the final week of the regula r season when they lost to archrival Oregon State Their only other loss was in their second game to then No ranked Wisconsin Their other victories were over Nevada Idaho UCLA US C Arizona Arizona State Washington State and California The wins over Arizona State and Washington State were in overtime The Longhorns have won six games in a row after a start and they can be at the Ducks and make it seven in a row if they can win four key battles To win the Longhorns have to be able to run the ball better than the Ducks they have to get a fast start offensively they must win the turnover battl e and they have to get another great effort from their outstanding defense Against Texas AM the Longhorns got a terrible start offensively and faile d to even make a first down in the first quarter But they were able to keep the early lead because safety Greg Brown scored on a yard pass interception on the Aggies first offensive plays They probably wont be able to count on scoring a quick defensive touchdown against Oregon which is why getting a fast start offensively is one of the main keys to the games outcome Heres how the teams compared statistically at the end of the regular seaso n national rank in parenthesis Texas Oregon Offense Rushing

Insightcom Bowl in Phoenix on Dec against Pittsburgh Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coaches Waiting for a Few Top Recruits to Come Aboard Coach Mack Brown and his assistant coaches already have enough top recruits to assure them of their third straight top class and it could challenge for the top spot again if things fall right Texas has commitments already the list is on page and the Horns probably will sign six or seven more players The Longhorns will challenge for the No spot again if most of them come from a group of nine top national recruits that includes DT Tommie Harris o f Killeen Ellison LB Derrick Johnson of Waco OL Jami Hightower of Jacksonville S Derrick Johnson of Temple Ath Quan Cosby of Mart DE Jonathan Jackson and TE James Moses both of Galena Park North Shore OL William Winston of Houston Madison and DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal The good news in this recruiting season is that Texas has cleaned up in eve ry critical area except the defensive line That makes the bad news pretty obvious if Texas doesnt sign both Harris and Jakes the class will come u p short in the big guys up front in the defensive line But even that cloud has a silver lining This was the year of the offensive lineman in Texas Next year will be the year of the defensive lineman Ther e a re more good ones than I have seen in several years The Longhorns cleaned up on offensive linemen this year and they should be able to clean up on defensive linemen next year I have already seen four junior defensive tackles who are better than anybo dy except Harris in this years senior class I spotted one of them Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings the first week of the season when I went to Houston to watch the Galena Park North ShoreHastings game I was there primarily to look at Jackson and Moses but Wright was the most dominant player on the field At and pounds he was able to stuff the run and he showed the quickness and upper body strength to get off bloc ks quickly and rush the passer Mesquites Marco Martin is generally regarded as the state s top defensive line prospect next recruiting season He is so quick he doubl es as a running back But Wright is the most physical defensive tackle I have seen in the junior ranks Suffice it to say that both Wright and Martin will be top national recruits next year Wrights time is in the to range but he has as much quickness over to yards the key distance for defensive tackles as any of the guys who might outrun him in a The other two top junior DTs I have seen this year are Earl Anderson of San Marcos and Patrick Lee Dallas Carter The Longhorns will have great shots at Wright Anderson and Lee who all li st Texas among their favorites They also will be in the hunt for Martin While I have only seen them on tape there are several other junior DTs who will be highly recruited next year They include Damon Brown of Houston Washington Tully Jontzen of Keller Jarre Rhodes of Dallas Lincoln and David Johnson of Aldine Nimitz Since the Longhorns are down to recruiting a handful of players to complete this years recruiting class lets look for a moment at some of the other top juniors who will be the difference makers next year There are two junior QBs college coaches everywhere know about They are Reggie McNeal of Lufkin and Vincent Young of Houston Madison McNeal is Arkansas No recruiting target in Texas next year Both are outstanding runners who also have strong arms TE Eric Winston is the second best player at Midland Lee behind super senior RB Cedric Benson who is committed to Texas Winston is a devastating blocker who probably will move to the offensive line in college He is a strong AM lean and has been to the Aggies summer camp Travis Leitko of The Woodlands is an outstanding defensive end If he was a senior this year he would have colleges from everywhere clamoring for his signature At LB Marvin Byrdsong of Longview Andy Matakis of Corpus Christi Flower Bluff and Archie McDaniel of Bay City are already established stars LTydrick Riley of Crockett who also plays QB very well Kendrick Muckelroy of Hallsville and Michael Cuba of Taylor are great safety prospects as juniors Now lets get back to this years recruits I thought Benson and Midland Lee might be in trouble Saturday against defensive powerhouse Duncanville which hadnt allowed any team to score mo re than points all year Benson the Energizer Bunny of the high school running backs carried times for yards and four touchdowns and scored another TD on a yard screen pass to pace the Rebels to a victory Benson now ranks No among all the high school running backs in Texas history in yardage gained with He is the only Class A rusher in Cla ss A in the top Kenneth Hall the Class B terror at Sugar Land from through hold s the record at yards He was an amazing runner but he never ran against the kind of defenses Benson faces every week Benson has led Midland Lee to backtoback state champsionships but he los t most of his supporting cast after last season and the Rebels looked vulnerable this season losing two earlyseason games But his rebuilt line is getting better every week and Duncanville coach Bob Alpert who has been coaching at the A level in Texas for many years firs t in the Houston area and now in the DallasFort Worth Metroplex has seen an d played against a lot of great running backs but he says Benson is in a cla ss by himself Hes the best high school running back Ive seen and hes by far the best one that one of my teams has had to try to stop Alpert said What makes Benson so special It doesnt take a rocket scientist Alpert said Hes got great vision hes really quick through the hole he can get something if there isnt muc h there hes hard to bring down and he has great really great balance Hes also got really good speed and he runs as hard on his th carry as he doe s on his first one And of course the high school coach to end all high school coaches the legendary Gordon Wood long retired after winning state titles galore at Stamford and Brownwood put his stamp of approval on Benson after his junio r year saying Benson is the best allaround high school running back Ive ever seen Ive moved Benson to the top spot on my difference maker list on the previous page With endorsements from guys like Wood and Alpert hes obviously an awesome prospect By the way an interesting and fairly obscure note on Woods career is that hes the guy who ended the Breckinridge dynasty in Texas If you remember Chuck Moser and his mighty Abilene Eagle dynasty and its multiyear winning streak in the s there is a connection to Breckinrid ge there too The reason Abilene won all those games in a row was that the Eagles quit playing Breckinridge That long winning streak started the week after Breckinridge thumped Abilene by three touchdowns I think the score was and it was a whipping But the team Breckinridge really had the hex on was Brownwood The Lions ha d never beaten Breckinridge and it was a really sore topic of conversation around Brownwood Back in those days Class A was the big school class Abilene was Class A and Breckinridge was Class A Both teams won state regularly But Breckinridge fell down to Class A one year and fell into Stamfords district Woods Stamford team beat the Buckaroos that year en route to another state title Folks in Brownwood noticed that the little A school was against the te am it had never beaten and they hired Wood hoping he could do the same thing for them Did he ever Brownwood started beating Breckinridge every year and winning state titles almost every year The Buckaroos still have some good teams b ut they are in Class A now and happy they dont play the Class A Lions now even with Wood long retired Pardon me for drifting back so far but I grew up in West Texas when it had the best football played and teams like Abilene and Breckinridge got everyones attention before giving way to Gordon Wood and his powerhouse Br ownwood teams So far eight members of Dave Campbells Texas Football magazines man Super Team have committed to colleges and the Longhorns have six of them Benson is the only high school player ever to grace the cover of the state s top football magazine and he is joined on the Super Team by fellow UT commitments Frenship QB Kendal Briles San Antonio Holmes CB Cedric Griffin and OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Terrance Young of Longview and Abe Robinson of Jersey Village The other Super Team players who have committed are Madisonville RB David Underwood who says he will sign with Michigan and Lancaster WR Armon Dorrough who has given his pledge to Texas Tech Briles threw three touchdown passes and ran for a fourth score to lead Frenship to a victory over Fort Worth Wyatt in the Class A regional finals Saturday Briles who led Stephenville to the Class A state title last year is threatening to do the same thing at Frenship He needs just two more victories to accomplish that rare and possibly unprecedented feat If UT has a shaky commitment it would be Briles He was recruited by Texas as an athlete probably a safety and he says he still thinks about going somewhere like Nebraska to get a shot at playing QB There is always a chance that lightning will strike and the Longhorns will get a commitment from some blue chipper from out of the blue If it happens it probably will be DT Marquise Hill of New Orleans De La Salle Michigan has a big lead over LSU but he says he probably will take a trip to Texas just to be sure Hes a long long shot but if he does take the trip to Texas it could happen Brown and his staff dont miss on many guys who take official visit s The visit limit rule isnt one that UT coaches even consider They normally bring in about kids offer about of them and sign about o f them Look for all of the UT commitments except DE Eric Hall of Tennessee who ha s already visited and possibly Benson and Briles who might be playing for repeat state championships that weekend to take their official visits to Texas the Dec weekend to attend the

on tape last week and he has size speed great hands and best of all he is fearless when he comes across the middle He caught passes for yards and TDs last year He told me Ive been a Texas fan since I was a little kid I like the way they run their offense He has an offer from Illinois and is considering Michigan and Notre Dame but he plans to visit Texas unofficially this summer with his parents Dont be surprised if Texas signs several outofstate players Three excellent players listed on the previous page DE Chase Pittman and DTs Lyle Sendlein and Kasey Studdard have strong Longhorn bloodlines and are seriously considering UT RB Zan Johnson of Winnfield La one of the top players in that state als o has several relatives who are Longhorn grads including former UT LB Lionel Johnson Johnson Pittman and Sendlein all came to the UT spring game Two LBFB combos Brandon Hancock of Clovis Cal Wes t and Chris Herring Batesville Miss South Panola also are considering the Longhorns but are longer shots than the ones mentioned previously Three players who have really zoomed up the recruiting charts since college coaches started watching their tapes are LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar S Vickiel Vaughn of Plano East and OL Bret Valdez of Brownwood Ive seen tape now and its easy to understand why the college coaches like them Smith is extremely quick and hardhitting Vaughn is a fast hardtackling ball hawk and Valdez is a devastating blocker with really quick feet in Brownwoods option attack Valdez came to the Texas spring game Smith also is interested in the Horns but Vaughn is interested only in outofstate schools right now I have listed other sports instead of schools by three players on my list o n page At WR Wardell Starling of Fort Bend Elkins will be a firstround

<16231923.1075848299537.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2001-04-09 04:12:00,True Orange April Part of parts of Parts Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No April Spring Shows UT Has Fine Passing Offense Defense but Questions Persist Elsewhere The Longhorns wrapped up spring football practice last week and the best news I can give you after watching all practices is that the passing offense and defense should both be very good this season The run defense probably wont be as good as last years rocksolid group but it will be a faster group that should be good against the run and much improved at rushing passers The running offense still looks spotty but coach Mack Brown says it is improved and will look much better in the fall when injured offensive guards Antwan KirkHughes and Tillman Holloway return When they return by the way look for the teams other fine guard Derrick Dockery to move to left tackle The one huge problem that surfaced in the spring was in the kicking game JC transfer Brian Bradford and redshirt freshman Justin Smith both did a good job of punting but the placekickers had a tough spring Redshirt freshman Matt McFadden showed fair consistency on field goals up to yards but struggled mightily on the longer ones Brown expressed concern about the kicking and said three walkons will be reporting in August and will get chances to win the job So looking at the big picture I see the last year of the softer schedule no Nebraska or Kansas State as one in which the Longhorns will have a passing game that will strike terror into opposing teams hearts and a pass defense that should be one of the best around too But UT teams dont usually win big games unless they can run fairly well yards at Stanford minus against Oklahoma and in the Oregon game in the Holiday Bowl Those were the three games the team lost Brown says one of the tailbacks needs to jump out of the pack and give the team a goto guy If one of them doesnt do it look for super recruit Cedric Benson to be a factor very quickly Brown doesnt like to talk about Benson because he doesnt want him to put any extra pressure on him But Benson is a guy who thrives on pressure Fifteen touchdowns in three Class A championship games shows how pressure affects him Hopefully he will do for the running game what true freshmen WRs Roy Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas did for the passing game last season With junior QB Chris Simms and five or six outstanding WRs to go with two extremely gifted TEs the Longhorns should have at great passing attack If Simms continues to make progress in looking away from his target Texas will have a great passing attack He hit of his passes and averaged yards per completion last year but he had only eight touchdowns and four of his seven interceptions were run back all the way He was much better this spring about concealing his intended target I think he will continue to improve and if he does the passing game will be so potent that it will make it easier to run The other key to getting the running game jumpstarted is getting better run blocking from the line The line worked more on run blocking this spring than it has in previous springs under Brown and he thinks that will pay off with a better running attack when the season starts Ill make a prediction right now that if the Horns can run for yards in every regularseason game they wont lose any of them Brown says he isnt concerned about the yardage but is concerned about the ability to pick up short yardage on third downs and about being able to run the ball in the fourth quarter to protect a lead Ill second that The Longhorns dont have to run for yards if they can run it successfully when they really need to run it Many teams and particularly teams in the Big are stacking the line of scrimmage to force teams to throw After Simms and Company show how they can stretch a defense I dont think many teams will want to force Texas to throw The defense meanwhile is much faster than last season Strong safety Lee Jackson is primarily a strongside linebacker now and converted cornerbacks Ahmad Brooks and Nathan Vasher are two of the top three safeties Former outside linebacker O J McClintock is a passrushing defensive end and defensive end Maurice Gordon is at defensive tackle Sophomore Marcus Tubbs had a strong spring at DT and Lee if he returns healthy in the fall should team with sophomore Adam Doiron the other spring starter to give the Horns three good tackles Gordon is already an outstanding passrushing tackle and Brown said he will try to bulk up a little in the off season to be better at handling the run too Starting DEs Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding return as do all three LBs and three of the four DBs Against Oklahoma the best team the Horns will face in the regular season this type of lighter faster defensive unit should have a better chance to succeed It should be better against the passing teams and it might be almost as good against the running teams The Achilles heel could be the placekicking unless McFadden walkon Dylan Becker or one of the three incoming walkons takes charge

costs a minute You must be or older to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown had to juggle spring football practice this year because of the tragic death of Cole Pittman and a series of thunderstorms but he says it was the most physical and successful spring in our four years here One of our main goals was to be tougher more physical he said after spring practice concluded last Wednesday We worked harder we had our ones go against our ones more and we worked on being tougher and on getting better every day We didnt have a bad practice he said They worked hard every day and thats when you get better We did get better Brown said he was very pleased with the progress the team made during the spring workouts but said there are still some problems heading into the offseason program and fall workouts We still have some unanswered questions such as developing depth along the defensive line and we need a tailback to step forward he said He said Victor Ike would start at tailback if we played tomorrow and Brett Robin would be second team Our running game has improved weve continued to improve our protections and our throwing and catching with our receivers is getting better he added While he isnt pleased with the production at tailback he said the running game will be better this season because of improvement in the offensive line Mike Williams at tackle and Derrick Dockery at guard played as well as any offensive linemen have played in the spring since we got here he said Even though we lost two great defensive players in Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers and an outstanding safety in Greg Brown our defense has continued to improve and has better team speed than last year Brown said He said strong senior leadership gives the team a chance to be really successful on defense next season Sophomore OG Tillman Holloway and redshirt freshman DT Stevie Lee were the only Longhorns who suffered serious injuries in the spring Holloway sprained a knee during the first week of workoutsand Lee had surgery on the same foot that sidelined him for the last games of the season which qualified him for a medical redshirt season Seniors Antwan KirkHughes shoulder and Mike Jones knee missed the entire spring season while recovering from offseason surgery and sophomore tight end Artie Ellis sat out with a stress fracture in his leg We were able to get through the spring without any significant injuries that would keep someone from missing time in the fall Brown said All the guys who missed this spring because of injuries last fall should be back to full strength when we start up again in August He said he was tremendously pleased with progress of sophomore TE Bo Scaife who returned after missing the entire season with a knee injury Scaife tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during the first preseason practice last August I was really pleased with Bos improvement toward the end of the spring Brown said We held him out of the majority of contact drills but the more he played the more you could tell he was getting physically ready to play He should come back with great confidence in the fall after having a solid month of practice this spring He also said one big spring goal was to develop more depth and he said the team made good progress in that area With Lee out with his foot injury it left the team really thin at DT but moving Gordon over helped a lot If Stevie hadnt been injured we probably wouldnt have moved Maurice from end to tackle Brown said Maurice looks really good at tackle and when Stevie comes back well have a lot better depth there The program is growing at the pace wed hoped it would when we came here three years ago Brown said Each year we have developed more depth and experience and from top to bottom have become an improved team with a better grasp of our overall program Last year we played more players across the board than we had in our first two years and that is what saved our season in the end We had so many players injured that it took a lot of guys stepping up for us to be successful

touchdown to highlight UTs annual OrangeWhite game before a crowd school officials estimated at Coach Mack Brown had the first team offenses and defenses square off agains t each other for the first time in the OrangeWhite game The only touchdown the firstteam defense gave up was a yard Simms pass to WR Roy Williams who had a step on CB Quentin Jammer Simms also led the offense to a field goal QB Major Applewhite operating behind an offensive line patched with walkons led the second team to one touchdown against the secondteam defense on a fade route to WR Sloan Thomas in the end zone My vote for most improved offensive player this spring is split three ways because Simms sophomore TE Brock Edwards and senior tackle Mike Williams a re all much improved over last year On defense I think its a twoway tie between DT Marcus Tubbs and CBsafety Nathan Vasher I think the Longhorns will have the best group of WRs TEs and DBs in the B ig They will have the best passing QB in the Big too if Simms continu es to improve They also will have one of the two or three best passblocking lines in the league if they stay healthy Subscribe Now To The FaxEMail Service to Get Scoops on Early Recruiting Get

I should have commented on this earlier but better late than never Kevin Sherrington of the Dallas News wrote a lovein column about Texas AM coach R C Slocum right after national signing day and both Slocum and Sherrington used the opportunity to throw a few rocks at Texas coach Mack Brown and the Longhorns Im going to quote a couple of excerpts from the column with my comments about them Heres the first one Such is RC Slocums life these days Never had a losing season at Texas AM Won more games than any coach in school history Run a clean program h is dozen years as head coach Clean program No question its cleaner than it used to be but Sherrington must have a really short memory Remember those noshow jobs Then Sherrington and Slocum got into recruiting and both took some shots a t Brown and UT Heres what they said in the column Of course rankings come with caveats too Slocum reminded After four years of enrolling the countrys top recruiting classes he asked shouldn t a school have the most talented team in the country Shouldnt expectations go way up Wouldnt that be accurate Slocum asked In other words youre up Mr Brown First of all Brown hasnt had four years of enrolling the countrys top recruiting classes Hes had three of them and the third class hasnt eve n enrolled yet The other two were freshmen and sophomores last year and they are the heart and soul of the team Browns first signees at Texas werent in the class of the others which certainly were highly ranked classes His first great class will be starting its third year this season and it is ready to boost the Longhorns back into national prominence The Aggies on the other hand went in in and in Sounds like a downward spiral to me I wonder if Aggies expectations are way up Second the last time I looked Texas and Texas AM had played three times since Brown arrived to find Slocum firmly entrenched at AM with his progra m already well established Enheriting a team Brown has produced three consecutive ninewin season s and while I know it sounds farfetched after reading the remarks of Sherrington and Slocum he has a edge over Slocum and his Aggies The lone Aggie victory over Brown was in at AM by a razorthin margin when UT QB Major Applewhite the Big CoOffensive Player of the Year was too sick to play I know you play with what you have and I am not saying that Aggie victory shouldnt count but what I am saying is that any outsider reading the colu mn would think the Aggies must be hammering us every year While Im on the subject of biased reporting I thought it was interesting that the Houston Chronicle published a threecolumn bylined story on the Texas AM spring game which drew fans The paper did not staff the U T spring game and did not run one line on an event that was attended by fans The UT Sports Information Department distributed a lengthy story on the spring game and many papers used all or part of it but the Chronicle simpl y ignored the entire event The Chronicle has one sports columnist devout Aggie John Lopez who doesn t even try to get his facts straight when writing about Texas Remember his column on how UT basketball guard Darren Kelly wanted to go to AM but didnt have the grades Kelly was a full qualifier out of high school and in fact started his college career at a Division I school before switching to a JC When he missed a semester at Texas for academic problems it was because ma ny of his hours at the small JC he attended did not transfer and he was short on hours toward his degree It want because he was failing any courses But Lopez was more interested in making excuses for the dismal Aggie basketball team than he was in getting the facts straight If you get as irritated as I do with columnists who continue to glorify the Aggies and ignore or put down the Longhorns let the sports editors andor their bosses know about it An Early Look at the Schedule Trying to predict football games in April that are several months away is a dangerous business so Im going to just look at the schedule and talk abou t the likely odds on all the games The Longhorns probably will be at least point favorites over five of the ir foes They are the home games against New Mexico State and Kansas and the road games against Houston Oklahoma State and Baylor Texas also will be favored probably by at least points in the home g ames against North Carolina and Texas Tech and the game at Missouri That leaves the Oct date in Dallas against defending national champion Oklahoma the Oct home game against Colorado and the Nov visit to A M as the ones that would appear to be the most dangerous I think Colorado will be a dangerous team if RB Marcus Houston stays health y and AM is always dangerous in College Station But there is no question that the Sooners are the most dangerous looking fo e on the schedule I wont predict Texas will win every game but I will predict if the Longhorns average yards rushing against OU Colorado and AM well all be smiling heading into the post season Conradt Gives Up AD Title Jody Conradt UT womens basketball coach since and womens athletic director since is going back to coaching full time and giving up the AD post I have appreciated the opportunity to serve the university but my heart a nd my passion are about coaching womens athletics she said Conradt said she thinks her basketball program is making significant progress toward returning to the national spotlight and said she wants to devote full time to that job Chris Plonsky a senior associate athletic director in the mens department will serve as womens athletic director on an interim basis and will get a new title senior associate athletic director for mens and womens athletics Patricia Ohlendorf UT vice president for institutional relations and legal affairs oversees both athletic departments She said she will chair a smal l committee that will study the mens and womens athletic departments to determine their future course The study probably will take about two months to complete and all signs point to a recommendation to combine the two departments Only five Division I universities have separate athletic departments for me n and women The others are Tennessee Arkansas Minnesota and Wisconsin In recent years the two departments have combined to operate together in several areas at Texas such as sports medicine strength and conditioning fundraising and development marketing ticket operations and media relations Sources close to the situation at UT say combining the two departments and having one director to oversee both would save more than million a year The sources also say UT President Larry Faulkner who will make the ultimat e call favors combining the two departments In this day of increasing expenses and tight budgets it would make a lot o f sense to join the other schools in the Big and the vast majority of t he other Division I schools in combining the two departments under one athleti c director It would eliminate a lot of duplication and save a lot of money Jamboree on TV in Austin The Longhorns Spring Football Jamboree highlighted by the OrangeWhite gam e will be telecast by time Warner Cable Monday and Tuesday on Austin Cable Channel Fox Sports and Time Warner Cable are teaming up to bring Austin cable viewers the tapedelay broadcast of the March jamboree and scrimmage It will be telecast Monday April at pm and Tuesday April at pm Umpire Boycott Silly The three Austinarea umpires who are boycotting nonconference baseball games at Texas DischFalk Field because of what they term insulting person al attacks by Longhorns assistant coaches are being silly David Wiley Tim Henderson and Wade Ford say they wont call Texas nonconference games the rest of the season because they are unhappy with t he way they have been treated by UT assistants Frank Anderson and Tommy Harmon Tim Wade and I have just decided it might be better for all parties involved if we worked elsewhere this year because the professional climate has deteriorated all year such that we felt it would be better for us to extract ourselves from that situation Wiley said Henderson and Wade were assigned before the season to work some Big game s at DischFalk and said they will honor that commitment The reason the boycott is silly is that umpires have the ultimate weapon in disputes with coaches They can eject them and that would be a far more reasonable approach than what Wiley Henderson and Ford have chosen to do A few ejections will make any coach see the light even if he is in the right because umpires have dictatorial power over coaches Its also strange that Wiley is talking about it to reporters The Big h as a strict gag rule on all Big coaches and Wiley knows he can say anythin g he wants

<3929683.1075857337166.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2000-07-17 04:52:00,True Orange July Part Scarbroughs True Orange The newsletter for the true Texas Longhorn faithful Volume No July Horns Snare Early Commitments Several Other Top Prospects Leaning UTs Way Coach Mack Brown and his staff have signed the best recruiting class in the Big the last two years and they are well on their way to making it three in a row The Longhorns have early commitments including two national top prospects and a junior college star who was a national top prospect two years ago And all three of those headliners are offensive linemen which is an area where the Longhorns needed to strike it rich this time around after signing only three of the big guys in their last class which was loaded with skill position players The national top prepsters are Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter and Abe Robinson of Jersey Village The JC star is Alfio Randall of Blinn JC Randall was one of the nations top prospects at Houston Yates an d signed with Texas in February of before failing to qualify academicall y and heading to Blinn Randall who says he will graduate in December plans to enroll at Texas ne xt January For a team that listed the offensive line as its greatest need heading into this recruiting season that trio is a great way to start But the Longhorns also have pledges from three other offensive linemen who were highly recruited including one from Mike Garcia of Galena Park who h ad committed to Texas AM and was the Aggies prize early pledge before visiti ng UT and deciding to switch to the Horns The other two offensive line recruits are Roman Reeves of Livingston and Wi ll Allen of Cypress Falls The offensive line class of recruits in Texas this year is the best I have seen since I started doing this years ago There are at least offensi ve linemen who are top notch and all five of the UT pledges come from that group The other recruits who have committed to the Longhorns are middle linebacke r Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison safety Kendal Briles of Frenship and defensive backs Brian Carter of The Woodlands and Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity Heres a little information on each of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter has more than scholarship offers and more are coming in all the time despite the fact that he was th e Longhorns first commitment back on June at Texas first summer camp He has the great first step that makes all the difference in trying to cut off an outside speed rusher He is on all the national top lists and is as good an offensive tackle prospect as there is in the country Abe Robinson Jersey Village is a tight end who projects as an offensive lineman in college He is one of the states top prospects and is on most of the national top lists Robinson is a power blocker with quick feet He had offers from other schools including Florida State when he committed to Texas on June Alfio Randall Blinn JC was one of the first players to commit to Texas in and has never wavered He says he will graduate fro m Blinn in December and enroll at UT in January so he can go through spring practice next year He was the states top offensive line prospect at Houst on Yates his senior year because of his quick feet and punishing blocking styl e Mike Garcia Galena Park was an early AM commitment before he and his mother took an unofficial trip to Austin He is as aggressive as any offensive line prospect in Texas A nice guy off the field he holds blocks and punishes defenders He specializes in the pancake block Will Allen Cypress Falls was the Longhorns second commitment Like Scott he committed after the first full summer camp at UT A threeyear starter at Cy Falls he is a very physical player who has the quickness and strength to play guard or tackle Roman Reeves Livingston is as impressive a physical specim en as any of the UT recruits He has the ability to dominate his opponents and the quickness to head them off Linebacker Yamil LeBron Killeen Ellison apparently was the middle linebacker UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese wanted all along He said Reese told him at the Longhorns summer camp that he liked his size speed and ferocity and wanted him to play middle linebacker He is a tough run stopper who also has the speed to cover backs on pass plays Defensive Back Kendal Briles Wolfforth Frenship was the Class A offensi ve player of the year last season after leading Stephenville to the state championship Playing QB he completed of passes for yards an d TDs and ran for yards and more scores That adds up to yards and touchdowns Nebraska wanted him as an option QB but he opted for a career as a safety at Texas His father Art Briles was his coach at Stephenville and now is on the coaching staff at Texas Tech Braden Johnson Euless Trinity is a talented athlete who wi ll move to QB for the Trojans this year after making AllDistrict as a hardhitting safety last year He is a centerfielder in baseball and runs o n the schools meter relay team He has a big frame and could be a candidate to become an outside linebacker in the future Brian Carter The Woodlands was a twoway star last season catching passes for yards and four TDs then switching over to defen se and intercepting three passes He was one of UT freshman QB Chance Mocks t op targets at The Woodlands last season All of the recruits who have committed to Texas except Randall and Garcia came to one of the UT summer camps RECRUITING NOTES The states top QB prospect Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bish op Lynch was in Austin today Monday visiting with UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis His family owns a ranch near Blanco and Nordgren really likes t he Horns The only other top QB prospect who is strongly considering Texas is Bret Rawls of Shreveport Evangel but the Horns only plan to take one QB an d Rawls is such a good baseball prospect that it would be risky making him th e only QB recruit One big plus is that Nordgren wants to commit early He ha s been to several camps alread including one at Texas and wants to visit several more before making a decision But if he does commit early and does commit to Texas the Longhorns can forget about recruiting QBs If he commi ts early to someone else then it will be on Plan B whether that is Rawls or a sleeper like Tye Gunn of La Grange a strongarmed kid who is big and fast and only gets to throw five or six times a game for the runoriented Leopards The Longhorns probably will sign about to recruits Wit h six offensive linemen three defensive backs and one linebacker already committed the remainder probably will go to one QB one or two RBs zero o r one FB zero or one TE one or two WRs one or two more OLs three or four DLs one or two LBs and two or three DBs At RB recordsetting Cedric Benson of twotime state champ Midland Lee plans to take an unofficial visi t to Texas in late July or early August He is a longtime Longhorn fan who says he might commit on his visit The most important report left on th e board is DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison Why There are two reasons First he is a great prospect probably as good a defensive line recruit as there is in the country Second he is the only great DT prospect who is strongly considering Texas and the Horns need to sign a top DT or two Thom as Derricks of Dallas Jesuit is a good DT but he has no interest in Texas After that the list includes several promising young DTs who need to have big senior years to become top prospects Texas is chasing two Louisiana stars Marcus Spears of Baton Rouge Southern Lab and Marquise Hill of N ew Orleans De La Salle but they have not show any major interest so far The UT coaches want to sign two DEs and two DTs but they might opt for three D Es because there are more top DEs The top prospects remaining who I think are at least shots to sign with Texas are Nordgren Benson Harris O L Jami Hightower of Jacksonville DEs Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson and Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn LBDE Lance McFarland of Jefferson LB Derrick Johnson of Waco CB Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple

news The number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Defensive coordinator Carl Reese is always a great interview because a he is an expert at his craft and b he is good at putting complex defensive schemes in terms we can all understand I interviewed him recently about his defense and his expectations for the season With most of the guys returning from a defense that was one o f the nations best in he is upbeat but he wants and expects to see major improvements in several areas Here are the highlights of our conversation Q Coach you lost both your defensive ends At the end of the spring you seemed pretty happy about the way Cory Redding was playing but you said yo u thought the guys on the other side were a lot better pass rushers than run stoppers The way the schedule shapes up it looks like most of the teams Texas plays are better passing teams than running teams so do you think it could be an advantage to have a better pass rush even if one side isnt as strong against the run A We were looking at the schedule the other day and it looks like about half the teams we play next fall are going to be four wideouts who throw t he ball a bunchAnd our ends can come of the edge better than they have That could help us against some teams like Stanford Oklahoma and Texas Tech three teams that are going to let it go pass a lot from the beginning Bu t I worry about that cottonpicking run because I dont want to let teams be twodimensional I like to start with any defense by being stroing agains t the run Q You have already had some outstanding defenses at Texas Do you think this years defense will be your best one at Texas A From a talent standpoint it could be The secondary has more depth tha n its had Of course the guys still have to come through We have got to get a great year out of Quentin Jammer at cornerback but going into the season we have the deepest secondary weve had Were a little thin at linebacker but we know what we have there and they can all run We know what we have a t tackle with Casey Hampton and Shawn Rogers and weve got some backups The glaring weakness is at end particularly against the run We want to ha ve the complete package at end guys who can stop the run and rush the pas ser Cory Redding still had to work on the run some but as far as giving an allout effort he does and hell improve as he gets some more experience He is our best end against the run but we want him to get better We need some of the other guys to step up on the other side and maybe one or two o f them will If they do this could be a pretty good defense Q Stevie Lee really looked good at tackle this spring in my opinions particularly considering the fact that he was playing high school football last fall then graduated early and enrolled in January What do you think about him and his chances of helping you this fall A I think Stevie Lee is going to be a real football player And youre right he should have been walking the halls of his high school in the spring What I really like about him is that we would work him against the firstteam offense and some of those firstteam offensive linemen would knock him back But the next play he would come right back He learns fast and he competes hard We play to play him quite a bit From what he and redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs showed this spring they will be the backu ps to Casey and Shawn at the start of fall practice We have some other player s who could move up too and there will be some competition because the guys who are the top backups this year will have the best chance to take it over the next season when Casey and Shawn are gone Q What do you think is the key to having a better defense this year A The secondary will be the key They have the best chance to step up Thats the key overall They improved last year and played good at times but we still didnt have a great defense because we gave up big plays too often to be a great defense Were going to stress this year that we cant give up big plays because you cant be a great defense if you do that Q What is you definition of a big play A Any pass over yards and any run over yards is a big play If we c an stop giving those up well be better than we have been Q Every time anybody talks about the strength of the Texas defense it centers around your two tackles How important are they and what do you expect from them this season A Both Casey and Shawn are strong physical guys When they go all out they can dominate They really work well together too It is really important that we be sure they give us a great year They have proved they can be great run stoppers but were going to try to push them into being good pass rush guys too Their reall challenge now is to go out and produc e again as run stoppers and get better on the pass rush They need to work to improve I havent been satisfied with the endurance part of it as far as they are concerned If Im sitting there in their shoes Im looking to be just as strong against the run and get better on the pass rush Q Speaking of young players Dakarai Pearson and Phillip Geiggar your tw o freshmen at safety made some big plays in the spring Do you think they ca n help you this season A That Dakarai just improved so much this spring Everytime I turned on a practice film I saw some improvement He just got better every day He als o has some leadership capabilities I think we are going to get a lot of big plays out of him and we might get some this year Hes going to be a real good strong safety if he keeps working at it Phillip has a lot of the same qualities You know Dakarai has been in the system longer hes a redshirt freshman and Phillip should have been walking those same high school halls with Stevie Lee Hes going to be a really good one too if he keeps improving He just needs some experience Hes probably going to get some kick returns and punt returns this year and hell probably get to play som e at safety too Q Is one of them more suited to strong safety and one more suited to free safety A Those kids are interchangeable The strong safety calls the defenses an d goes to pass strength so Dakarai probably would play there this year becau se Phillip hasnt been here as long but as they both get more experience th ey both can play either one Applewhite OK Simms Growing Recordsetting Texas QB Major Applewhites surgically repaired knee is fine and he will be ready to do battle with heralded sophomore Chris Simms for t he starting job when preseason football practice begins next month Simms meanwhile has been hitting the weights and is now packing pound s on his frame up from last season The UT coaches have said all along they plan to play two quarterbacks this season and no one in the country has a better pair to alternate Both are throwing the ball extremely well and both appear to be capable of leading the Longhorns in defense of their Big Southern Division crown If there is going to be a quarterback controversy at Texas its sure nice to know both of them are outstanding quarterbacks Some of Texas conference rivals probably will have a quarterback controversy too but it will be over whether any of the contenders are goo d enough to lead the team to a title The Longhorns have two championshipcalibre quarterbacks Schedule Revisions Reporting Dates The Longhorns seasonopener against

Longhorns hopes of getting Greg Barnum the great center prospect who left Tennessee after his freshman year are fading Vol coach Phil Fulmer has refused to give Barnum a release which would for ce him to pay his own way for a year if he comes to Texas as things now stand Since he would be a walkon it also would require him to meet UTs transfer guidelines for regular students As a regular student transer applicant with one year of college behind him he would have to have hours of C grades or above to transfer to UT Under Fulmer Tennessee football players have the worst graduation rate of any of the major NCAA Division I powers Barnum was a good high school student who might have hours of C or above grades at Tennessee If he does he would certainly have been one of the to p studentathletes on the Tennessee team UT Baseball Players Sign The pros have signed three UT baseball juniors second baseman Tommy Nicholson relief ace Charlie Thames and shortstop Todd West plus a to p recruit in catcher Scott Heard of Rancho Bernardo Cal Junior pitcher Phil Seibel is still negotiating with the pros but has not signed so far Basketball Recruiting Guard Carlos Hurt of Alief Elsik has committed to Louisville The Longhorns were recruiting him but their primary target for their only remaining scholarship is T J Ford who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the Class A state title Ford one of the nations top point guards is strongly considering the Longhorns But teams like Kentucky and Duke are also under strong consideration Maurice Williams a point guard at Murrah High School in Jackson Miss also is considering Texas Williams and Ford are both rated among the top four point guards in the country Texas already has a commitment from center Chris Wright of Redwater With only two seniors on the team coach Rick Barnes has only one more scholarship to give unless some underclassmen leave the team Aldrich Makes Olympic Team UT track and volleyball star Erin Aldrich made the U S Olympic Team Sunda y finishing second in the high jump with a leap at the Olympic Trials in California Aldrich was a senior last season but she gave the Longhorns some good publicity at the trials wearing her UT track uniform How About Those Odds Its been so long since Texas has been a preseason favorite in every regularseason game that I frankly cant remember it It probably was back in the glory days of Darrell Royal But there is an early line from the Imperial Palace in Las Vegas that alrea dy has posted early odds on three of the Longhorns key games The Imperial Palace has the Longhorns favored by points against Oklahoma in Dallas by points against Colorado in Boulder and by points against t he Aggies in Austin I thought the Boulder game might be the only one this season where the Horn s would rate as a preseason underdog I also thought the game against the Sooners in Dallas was the second toughest game on the schedule and the Agg ie game was in the running for the third toughest test So if Texas is a preseason favorite in those three big games I think I c an guarantee you that when the Imperial Palace publishes the odds for the remaining Longhorn games UT will be favored in each of them That of course doesnt mean Texas will go undefeated but I always prefer to be favored and thats what the Longhorns will be heading into the season in all of its games If they stumble early all that will change so lets hope they dont stumb le early or at all The s A Mixed Bag for Texas and Nebraska The Longhorn football team has had a lot of success historically but the s werent all that great Nebraska fans might disagree however The Huskers went in the s That was the second highest win total ever recorded in a decade Florida State went in the s to set the record But Nebraska went against Texas in the s If the Cornhuskers had won any of those three games they lost to the Horns they would have tied FSU f or the most wins in a decade If they had won two of them they would hold the record Baseball Recruit Shines Vincent Sinisi one of the Longhorns prize baseball signees led The Woodlands to the Class A State Championship last month He pitched a sixh it victory over powerful Duncanville

<23399704.1075848299795.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2001-04-23 05:01:00,True Orange April Part of Scarbroughs True Orange The newsletter for the true Texas Longhorn faithful Volume No April True Orange Crystal Ball Shows Season Will Be Longhorns BreakThrough Year My crystal ball was a little faulty last year because it didnt show TE Bo Scaife going down for the season in the first preseason practice Without that important piece of data I predicted the Longhorns would win a t least regular season games They won nine without Scaife and I think they would have won with him because the Stanford loss came before the great freshmen wide receivers became the goto guys on the team Im more confident this year because the Longhorns are deeper and even more talented than they were last season so Im going to go way out on a limb a nd predict the season will be remembered as the one we all will recall as the Horns breakthrough year By that I mean I think they will break into the top and stay there for years and years Since the Longhorns havent finished in the top since that sounds like a tall order for this team This will be coach Mack Browns fourth team at Texas and it should be his best one by far His fourth recruiting class will enroll in September and it will be his third straight great one that means the first group of great recruits will be starting their third years They will be juniors or redshirt sophomores The third year normally is one when players who have been able to play at a high level at times learn how to play at a high level consistently This team will have some flaws but every team has flaws The great teams simply have enough great players to win in spite of their flaws The Longhorns have offensive weapons that are almost off the chart With a healthy Scaife who is that rarity at TE a swift surehanded guy who can turn a sixyard pass into an yard score to go along with sophomorestobe Roy Williams and B J Johnson who broke every Longhorn freshman receiving record last year When a team has an awesome tight end and Scaife is one of those with sophomore Brock Edwards not too far behind it creates matchup problems fo r any defense Linebackers normally cover tight ends and good tight ends even one who arent really fast usually win those matchups Fast tight ends who can cat ch in a crowd usually draw coverage from a safety But then Williams and Johnson create problems because Williams almost alway s draws double coverage and Johnson is a huge threat to go all the way if one safety is worrying about Scaife and the other one is helping out on William s QB Chris Simms seems to be developing into the great player he was expected to be after all the recruiting services tabbed him as the No prospect in the country when he was a senior in high school The obvious solution for a defensive coordinator would be to play five or s ix defensive backs most of the time or to go to a zone defense But Brown says the Horns will be a better running team than they have been since Ricky Williams departed and a more experienced line and a bigger tailback should make that happen Hodges Mitchell was a great little tailback but this offense is designed primarily to pass or run between the tackles When you want to run between the tackles it helps to have a big powerful tailback The tailback this season whether it is one of the returnees or heralded recruit Cedric Benson will be bigger and more powerful than Mitchell The line was a good passblocking unit last year and with four of the five guys back it should be much better this year The only big question about the offense will be one of consistency When Simms who shared time with Major Applewhite last season was at the helm the team often had long long dry spells In the victory over Texas AM for example what most people remember is the Longhorns fourtouchdown explosion in the third quarter But I remember being scared silly at the half because the offense had made only one first down in the entire half and the defense was showing signs of tiring because of all those andouts And that was not an unusual happening In the bowl loss to Oregon Simms to ok the Longhorns on long backtoback scoring drives in the second quarter bu t the Horns generated little offense in the first and third quarters I could cite other examples because there are plenty to cite but Simms is a year older and wiser and so are the receivers who performed better last season than any of us have a right to expect true freshmen to perform A bigger stronger tailback also will be able to pick up more of those thirdandshort downs than the team did last year Defensively eight starters return from an outstanding unit The Longhorns lost two great defensive tackles but the power teams in the Southern Division of the Big rely a lot more on the pass than they do on the run and the tackles UT will play this year are quicker and might suppl y a better pass rush Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also made several position changes in the spring that are certain to generate a better pass rush If you remember the Oregon game the Ducks used quick undersized linemen t o harass Simms and it worked remarkably well most of the time With former DE Maurice Gordon now a super quick DT and former OLB O J McClintock now a super quick DE look for the Longhorns to be a much better pass rushing team in I do worry a lot about the Horns placekicking but the coaches are bringi ng in several walkons and hopefully one of them can kick off into the end zone and make most of the yard field goals Even if the kicking problems arent solved this is a team with enough weapons offensively and defensively to be a top team No one in the college ranks will be better or deeper at the receiving positions particularly when the tight ends are added to the mix and few teams will have better defensive secondaries The offensive line will be one of the best passblocking lines in the Big and the defensive line despite having two new tackles also will be one of the leagues best Heres the way I see the Big South race winding up and briefly why I place each team at its particular spot Texas Too many big play guys for the other teams to stop Oklahoma Defending national champs could do it again if they can find another great QB Texas Tech Big passing game too tough for everyone in South but Texas and Oklahoma Texas AM Even R C Slocum says the Ags will not dazzle anyone with talent Oklahoma State Team has too many holes and too tough a schedule to do any better Baylor Bears still find Big a tough row to hoe with little offense and overworked defense Nebraska should win the North mainly because the Huskers host the big game with Kansas State The Southern Division teams have beaten the North three times in the five championship games and I think Texas or Oklahoma will make it four this yea r The South is a lot stronger than the folks and particularly the pundi ts in the North think and its getting stronger every year Number Updated Frequently I update my number at least twice a week with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call UT Starts Another Great Recruiting Year with First Pledge The Longhorns have three great recruiting classes in succession and they made a good start on a fourth earlier this month when outstanding Brownwood junior OL Bret Valdez confirmed he has committed to the UT coaches Valdez one of the states great run blockers said he went to the UT sprin g game March and really liked what he saw He said the Texas coaches offered him a scholarship at the spring game They told me I was the first offensive lineman they have offered this year he said adding that he went home and talked to his parents about it and decided he wanted to be a Longhorn He said he came to Austin the weekend after the spring game and competed i n the Texas Relays throwing the shot and discus After I was through competing he said I went over to the coaches offices and talked to coach Mack Brown and coaches Tim Nunez and Mike Tolleson and told them I was ready to commit Im really excited about bein g a Longhorn He said he also was being recruited by about other schools including Florida State Texas AM Oklahoma Alabama and Notre Dame The first time they can come see us is in May and Florida State AM OU Notre Dame and Alabama coaches had all told my coach they were going to com e down and see me then But he said they need to change their travel plans because he is firmly committed to the Longhorns and will tell any other coaches who contact him that he is a future Longhorn Texas has really been recruiting well every year and I think they have a great shot at winning a national championship in the next year or two he said I like the way they emphasize academics too I think Ill have a good chance to start after a redshirt year he said The Longhorns probably will sign only three offensive line prospects next February and the coaches have not offered scholarships to any other offensive line prospects I have been talking to so they must consider Vald ez to be the states top OL prospect Brownwood went last year and Valdez was the teams top blocker He ha s thrown the shot feet and discus On tape Valdez is a very aggressive blocker who has an explosive start tha t allows him to make quick contact and then he simply drives his guy backward He has the quickest start of any of the big offensive line prospects I have seen this year One of the best things about him is that he is only and wont turn until June but he already benches and squats The Longhorns need a bumper crop of defensive linemen this year and they stand a very good chance to get an early commitment from one of the top one s around at their early June camp He is Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral a top DT who i s the No recruit in Arizona Sendlein is the son of former UT and NFL LB Robin Sendlein and he is the brother of UT redshirt freshman LB Austin Sendlein I talked to Sendlein Sunday and he told me he is coming to the June Longhorn camp I asked him if he is planning on going to any other camps this summer It depends on what happens at the Texas camp he said I might commit I really like Texas He said he also is being recruited by Notre Dame Arizona UCLA Arizona State USC and about other schools Another top DT prospect who is a strong Texas lean is Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo He is the son of David Studdard a former UT offensive line star who starte d for the Denver Broncos for about years after his career at Texas Studdard told me Sunday he probably isnt going to go to any summer camps but he said I really like Texas He said other schools recruiting him include Colorado Colorado State Nebraska Washington USC and Missouri His sister Katie recently accepted a basketball scholarship at Northern Colorado DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster who has thrown the shot nearly feet says he is bigger and also a little bit faster than I have him listed Im and I run a he said Hes also an honor student who carries a GPA on a scale and has already made a qualifying scor e on the SAT I want to take it again to try to do better but Ive already made a qualifying score he said When I asked him if he plans to go to any camps this summer Dibbles said Im going to the Nike camp at AM and a Texas camp probably in late June I might go to one more camp maybe at Oklahoma He said Oklahoma LSU TCU and SMU have already offered him a scholarship and said other schools recruiting him include UT Notre Dame AM Purdue Florida and Nebraska When asked what he is looking for in a school he said Academics has to b e first I want to major in something in the engineering or computer range I also want to know about the graduation rate for football players The coaches are important too and the chance to get playing time He said he went to the Longhorn coaches offices after competing in the Tex as Relays and met with head coach Mack Brown DE coach Hardee McCrary and RB coach Bruce Chambers who recruits the Lancaster area It was nice in Austin he said Im pretty interested in Texas He also said he thinks Lancaster has a chance to make a good run in the playoffs this year We got to the third round last year and lost to Ennis he said Ennis won state and we had a lot of young players so we think we have a chance to do better this year Some of the top football players in the state are also some of the top trac k performers UT CB signee Michael Huff won the District A sprints in and and anchored the meter relay to victory in Another Longhorn CB recruit Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes won the District A hurdles in and He also placed fourth in the triple jump with a leap There are always a lot of regional qualifier meets between the district and regional meets and junior RB DaBryan Blanton of Forney had some great times at the one in Glen Rose Friday running a meters and meters UT WR recruit Quan Cosby of Mart was second in both races running and Junior RBCB Edorian McCullough of North Garland who is undefeated in the dashes this year ran and and anchored his meter relay team to a win in in a regional qualifer meet in Mansfield Huff was second in the in and third in the in UT LB recruit Derrick Johnson ran a for third place in the in a regional qualifiers meet in McGregor He has run a this year
<29453772.1075857337742.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2000-08-07 04:54:00,True Orange August Part Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No August Strong Defense Promising Offense Favorable Schedule Propel Horns to No in First AP Poll Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns dont rate a top ranking in the wake of their threegame slide to end but the Associated Press preseason pollsters say the Horns are No Brown and his staff have simply done such and outstanding job of assemblin g talent and building a solid foundation to be overlooked in the preseason voting The Longhorns havent finished in the AP top since but there are four big reasons why they should end that year drought this season First the talent base is young but it is outstanding Browns first group of recruits will be juniors or redshirt sophomores this year and many of th em have been playing and playing well since they were true freshmen Second the defense was No in the nation last season and it will be eve n stingier this year Third the offense will be a lot more consistent throughout this season because there are so many more weapons at its disposal And last but certainly not least is the schedule Brown had to play Northern Division powers Nebraska preseason No and Kansas State preseason No in and He went against them in the regular season winning twice against Nebraska and losing two to KStat e The Longhorn schedule is no cakewalk It includes a road game at No Colorado the annual Dallas grudge match with No Oklahoma and some othe r dangerous dates But the early line has Texas favored in each of its regular season games and thats something no Longhorn teams has had in its favor in at least years As good as the Horns should be this year next season should be their year to really romp and stomp Why Because they have only five senior starters and Brown will have four straight awesome recruiting classes ready to roll But this season can be a very good one too In addition to the high nation al ranking in the preseason polls the Longhorns are heavy favorites to win t he Southern Division of the Big and set up a championship game with Nebrask a the Northern Division favorite and preseason choice to win the national title My theory is that the defense will be the best one Brown and his outstandin g defensive coordinator Carl Reese have put on the field at Texas That should give the young offense time to reload before playing the really big guys on the schedule With the Longhorns first three games against teams that will throw passe s a game LouisianaLafayette Stanford and Houston even Reeses young defensive ends wont be a liability because they are lightning fast pass rushers even if their runstopping techniques do leave a little to be desired Most of the other teams the Horns play during the regular season also are passoriented because Oklahoma and Texas Tech are pass teams Missouri probably will be and Oklahoma State Colorado and Baylor probably will thro w or more passes in most games I also think sophomore TE Bo Scaife and redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis wi th a little help from dimunitive sophomore WR Courtnee Garcia will be able t o slow down a lot of those blitzes that terrorized the Texas offense at the e nd of last season by allowing sacks in the final two games against Nebraska and Arkansas The Longhorns have an embarrassment of riches at quarterback where coBig Offensive Player of the Year Major Applewhite appears to healthy again afte r knee surgery but still might lose his job to immensely talented sophomore Chris Simms Ditto at running back where senior Hodges Mitchell made the AllBig team last year and is being challenged by big fast redshirt freshman Ivan Williams with sophomores Kenny Hayter and Victor Ike also in mix I can remember many past season when the Longhorns started and sometimes ev en won with a starting tailback who wasnt as good as any of this group and neither the Longhorns nor anyone else in this area has ever had two QBs as talented as Applewhite and Simms If we assume Scaife Ellis and Garcia can fill the hole left by the graduation of the teams top three receivers long enough for the talented wide receiver recruits to start getting comfortable with the offense then the only real problem left is the offensive line I know it had problems in those final quarters of the season and Ive explained in detail in past issues while it wasnt all the linemens fault but all of those guys are a year older now and should be a lot better this year The only spot in the offensive line that really concerns me is right tackle The Oline did a good job during the first games last year because UT wa s No in the league in total offense until the receivers started getting hurt thus opening the door to more allout blitzes The Longhorns even moved the ball well in the two losses in those first games but the problem at right tackle was exposed in one of those losses when Kansas State forced six Texas turnovers by applying fearsome pressure around the Horns right side on virtually every pass play When Simms a lefthander is in the game the right tackle will have to protect his blind side Either Mike Williams or Cory Quye who both started at times last year mus t step up this season or the coaches might do what they have done to fix problems in other areas move someone from another position Fullback t o linebacker DeAndre Lewis and linebacker to fullback Matt Trissel are two prime examples of moves that are paying dividends The prime candidate for a move could be guard Derrick Dockery who coach Brown called the best freshman offensive lineman Ive ever coached last year With his quick feet he would be an outside speed rushers worst nightmare That could open the door at guard to redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway wh o is the grandson of Longhorn legendary lineman Bud McFadin Holloway is talented and like his grandfather was nearly years ago is a fierce competitor The offensive line could use another player whose competitive juices run at a fever pitch One big problem for blitzers even if the problems at right tackle persist will be Scaife Nebraska and Arkansas were so good at delaying the Longhorn receivers at the line of scrimmage that they often brought eight and sometimes even nine pass rushers If anyone ever brings nine this season the other two defenders will try to chuck the two wide receivers and Scaife probably will score a touchdown if Applewhite or Simms has a split second to toss him a short pass because the re are few defenders who can run him down If they bring eight guys Ellis is and Scaife is and both are fast er than Kwame Cavil the teams ace receiver last season Cavil was a great receiver but at he was the only tall target among the key receiving corps last season Tall receivers are able to take advantage of short cornerbacks in allout blitz situations Remember that thirdandlong pass the tall Arkansas receiver caught over the short Texas cornerback after the Horns two obviou s safeties didnt count That was the difference in that game So my contention is that blitzing is not going to work as well against UT as it did late last season The Big had five teams in the APs preseason top headed by No Nebraska Texas followed at No one step ahead of No Kansas State Oklahoma was rated at No and Colorado came in at No After facing lots of ranked teams in his first two years at Texas Brown wi ll face only two top teams during the regular season this year Other than the big games against the Sooners and Buffaloes the most dangerous games for Texas during the regular season probably will be Texas Tech in Lubbock Stanford in Palo Alto and Texas AM in Austin Freshmen Report Sunday The freshmen report to campus next Sunday August The freshmen will practice Monday through Wednesday August at Frank Denius Fields corner of th and Red River The veterans will report on August UTs first fullteam practice is slated for Friday August at Whitaker Field st and Guadalupe The team will continue to practice at Whitaker Field until school starts at which time the practices will return to Deniu s All preseason practices are open to the public Coach Mack Brown has not released a full practice schedule but in the past his morning practices started around and his evening practices began around pm Browns Observations Coach Mack Brown was upbeat about the Longhorns prospects at the Big med ia meetings in Kansas City last week but he also said the team has to get better in every area Here are some of the highlights of his comments On last season We did not start like we wanted to last year and we did not finish well b ut we had a real good football team during the interim from game two through game eleven On overall needs We need to continue to work to develop depth on our team The Big is a physical league and it gets hot in Austin so we have to be at least two de ep at every position We played games last season and we got tired We have to develop more depth so we can play more people and not wear down during the season On the offense We need to continue to work to run the ball better and we have to be more patient in games when were playing against great defenses We dont have t o score every time but we do have to make some plays and take care of the ba ll better We dont want to put our defense in bad situations On the defense Weve got a really good defense but we feel like we gave up too many big plays at the end of the season Weve got to work on getting better at cutting down on the big plays and we need to get a better pass rush out of our front four so we dont have to blitz all the time On special teams We told your team its not against the rules to return punts or kickoffs Weve got to do a better job in those areas and were working on it Our n et punting needs to be better and we need to do a better job in puntblocking situations On the pressure to win at Texas I got more pressure at North Carolina in my last year being and then losing to Florida State than I got after the three losses as the end of las t year We lost those three games at the end and didnt look very good in som e of them and I didnt do a good job in some of them but Ive gotten more support from the university and our fans than anywhere else Ive ever coached The fans want us to win every game and I want expectations to be high If youre at Texas you want to win the national championship and you need to have a goal to win the national championship and you need to have a dream to win the national championship On the No ranking in the preseason AP poll Expectations are high but thats a good thing The only reason were rank ed that high is because were

Texas is up to early commitments now and appears headed for another top national class after getting CB Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes and OL Terrance Young of Longview both in July The Longhorn coaches cant comment on their recruits until they sign in February but Griffin the top prospect in San Antonio said the UT coaches told him they wanted him because they said I had the size speed and athletic ability they were looking for in their cornerbacks He had tackles last season broke up passes and had three interceptions two of which he returned for touchdowns Holmes coach David Sanchez said Griffin is the best cover corner in the district We went last year and reached the state Class A semifinals and his ability to take the other teams best receiver out of the game was a big reason Griffin who has run a meters said he had offers from Texas AM Oklahoma Colorado and Arkansas before he got a scholarship offer from Texa s on an unofficial visit on July and he said he didnt waste any time taking the UT offer I knew all along that Texas is where I wanted to go he said I really like Texas style of play and I was really impressed with the way the Texas coaches stress academics as well as athletics Young also had plenty of offers Miami UCLA Notre Dame Arkansas Tex as AM LSU and Mississippi State before he drove to Austin on July wi th his parents met with Brown and assistant coaches Darryl Drake and Tim Nune z and committed Drake recruits East Texas and Nunez is the offensive line coach Like Griffin he said the Longhorn offer was the one he was waiting on I really like Texas he said They have great coaches and great kids and they are going to do some grea t things in the next few years I want to be a part of that Young who already is a full qualifier with fine grades and and a SAT a nd ACT score said the Texas coaches told him they like the way he gets a quick jump on the defensive linemen and then maintains his blocks For those of you who are concerned about that time in the dont wor ry about it Young has a very quick start for a big offensive lineman and is adept at picking off speed rushers from the outside of his offensive tackle spot How fast an offensive lineman gets started is a lot more important than his time and Young gets started in a hurry Longview coach Pat Collins who coached an NCAA Division II national title team at Northeast Louisiana before getting back into the high school coachi ng ranks said The Longhorns got a great football player and a great young m an with an outstanding family Collins said Young Is one of the best high school prospects I have seen or coached he has worked really hard this summer and has excellent mobility a nd agility Seven of the Longhorns commitments are offensive linemen Texas has signed only three offensive linemen in each of Browns three previous recruiting classes and he said heading into this recruiting season that the offensive line was the No priority Since this is the best group of offensive linemen since I started doing thi s back in he couldnt have picked a better year to clean up on the big guys Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan

visit to Texas AM Saturday and he and his father will fly to Colorado this weekend for anoth er unofficial visit Nordgren said he liked AM and had a good time but Texa s is still No I really like the Longhorns Im pretty sure hell commit to Texas later this month While things are still looking bright for the states best QB its no quite that rosy for the top RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee He has been a Texas fan and has talked about committing early to the Longhorns but now he says he doesnt want to commit this summer and wants to wait take some official visits to other top programs before making his choice The Longhorn signees made good showings in the Texas High School AllStar Game in Houston last week QB Chance Mock of The Woodlands led the North to a victory by throwing two touchdown passes and was named the MVP an honor his father Mike won back in as a star QB fro m Longview The Mocks are the first fatherson duo in Texas history to win MV P awards in the NorthSouth game Matt McFadden of Coppell kicked off deep booted a field goal and even punted something he didnt do in high school Tony Jeffery of Klein Forest playing WR and Nathan Vasher of Texarkana playing WR and CB showed superb athletic ability for the North C Tre Bate s of Fort Bend Austin and T Lionel Garr of Diboll did a good job of blocking and DT Sonny Davis of Austin Lanier another UT signee who is headed to junior college looked great If you watched the game you know why Davis w as so heralded Packing about excess pounds on his normal pound frame he still was the quickest big man on either team Lets hope he gets his JC degree sheds those excess pounds to get even quicker and returns to Texas in two years RB Sneezy Beltran of Abilene was more tentative than he had been in his games at Abilene but I have seen enough tape of his exploi ts to know he is the real deal So far six members of the first team on Dave Campbells Texas Football magazines Super Team have committed to colleges Running

NFL draft Friday and Longhorn AllAmerican teammate DT Casey Hampton also went in the first round Arizona picked Davis after the Atlanta Falcons traded up to get the first choice and took Virginia Tech QB Michael Vick Hampton was chosen by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the th pick in the fir st round The Horns other outstanding DT Shaun Rogers was picked in the second rou nd by the Detroit Lions He was the st pick overall The last time Texas had three players chosen in the first round was in Texas coach Mack Brown noted that all three players were recruited by forme r coach John Mackovic and his staff and said he is hoping it starts a trend that sees several Longhorns being drafted every year There might be a little fall off next year but Longhorns should be very popular with NFL teams on a regular basis beginning in Football Notes Observations UT QB Chris Simms says he is sure he will stay at Texas for his senior year There had been some speculation that Simms might turn pro after this season but he said he will stick around for his senior year Things to watch for this season that should make a big positive difference include More weapons to pick up those shortyardage plays to keep drives alive like a bigger stronger running back a more experienced offensive line and dont forget great targets in TEs Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards from a twoTE set More misdirection plays particularly reverses and quick pitches to the outside More short passes to frustrate the pass rushers and to give the Horns swift and elusive receivers chances to turn short passes into long gains Bears Maul Longhorns The UT baseball players looked great Friday night in whipping Baylor in Austin but they looked lost when they went to Waco for the final two games of their series Saturday and Sunday Gerritt Simpson scattered six singles and struck out Friday night to giv e the Horns a triumph in the first game of the crucial series Ryan Brooks had three hits to pace the offense But the Bears got to apply the mercy rule twice in Waco throttling the Horns in seven innings and in eight innings Texas made seven errors in the two games in Waco and that coupled with spotty pitching and very little hitting turned the two games into routs Nebraska is running away with the regular season championship and Baylor and Texas are tied for second place Texas Tech is fourth and OSU is fifth

Coordinator Interview Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says there are two areas he always focuses on in spring practice The first is replacing the seniors and the second is schematics what we did last season and what changes we need to make what we should try to do better AllAmerican LT Leonard Davis and AllBig RB Hodges Mitchell were the on ly senior starters on last years offense and he said he feels a lot better a bo ut replacing Davis than he does about replacing Mitchell Robbie Doane had a real good spring at left tackle Davis said We also worked Derrick Dockery some at left tackle because weve got three really good guards Alfeo Randall incoming JC transfer also is a left tackle Considering all the possibilities I think well be okay at left tackle But I dont think we solved anything this spring at tailback he said A ll five guys did some good things and we could play all five of them but we wanted somebody to step up and nobody did The five tailbacks are juniors Victor Ike and Kenny Hayter sophomores Bret t Robin and Ivan Williams and redshirt freshman Sneezy Beltran Head coach Mack Brown said Robin had the best spring but he said none of t he five played at the level the Longhorns need their tailback to reach Davis concurred saying Were going into the preseason practices with an unsettled situation at tailback Obviously were going to find out what the youngster can do when he gets here he added The youngster of course needs no identification He is Cedric Benson the super recruit who is finishing his senior year at Midland Lee after leading the Rebels to three straight state A championships As for a changing some things in the overall scheme Davis said We wanted to add more misdirection this spring and we worked on that Its an area where we think we can add some things that will help us He said more work needs to be done on the reverses shovel passes and quick dashes to the outside Those things are not greased yet he said but Im glad we got to throw a lot of those things at them It gives us some more avenues to attack Davis also said the coaches worked hard this spring on developing a running game to pick up shortyardage situations Were not going to be a team that says we have to run for a certain amount of yardage he said We want to do whatever it takes to win the game but there are times when you have to be able to run the ball in short yardage particularly for first downs on the goal line and in the fourth quarter wh en were trying to protect a lead Other than the uncertainty at tailback Davis liked what he saw this spring Our linemen had a good spring he said Mike Williams at right tackle ha d a great spring I think Mike will be an outstanding right tackle this seaso n Derrick Dockery had a really good spring at right guard Davis said Mat t Anderson had a good spring at center and Jason Glynn got a lot of snaps behind Matt Im really pleased with Jason Glynns development Davis said the line will be much better when guards Antwan KirkHughes and Tillman Holloway who both missed the spring rehabilitating injuries retur n for preseason practice Tight end will be a really solid position he said Bo Scaife was able t o get back into things after knee surgery and he had a really solid spring Brock Edwards is a good young tight end and well get Mike Jones knee surgery back for the season Our young wide receivers are just going to get better and better Davis said Roy Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas all played really well as true freshmen and now theyre a year older and more experienced He also said walkon Kyle Shanahan redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and seni or Montrell Flowers also will see a lot of action Shanahan is the son of the Denver Broncos head coach and was a starter on a scholarship at Duke before deciding to transfer and walk on at Texas becaus e he wants to be a coach and felt this was the best place to learn the trade After sitting out last season Shanahan is a junior and he catches the ball as well as anybody on the team This is a really solid group with very good players and quality depth Davis said Were really pleased with our wide receivers At quarterback he said you would be hard pressed to find anybody who h as two like we do They are junior starter Chris Simms and senior Major Applewhite who shattered most of Texas passing records before severe injuries to both kne es sidelined him gave Simms a chance to win the job Davis also said he is very pleased with the development of redshirt freshma n QB Chance Mock Chance Mock is really talented Davis said He has really good skills Mock has outstanding speed for a quarterback and a strong arm He also has a very quick release He needs to get some experience but he has all the tools Davis said So looking at everything how good can this Longhorn offense be I think this group has a chance to be really good he said We have a lo t of talented players We just need to solidify the running game and were working on that UT Hires Volleyball Coach Jerritt Elliott former interim head womens volleyball coach at the University of Southern California is the new head womens volleyball

<30637709.1075857338405.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2000-08-28 03:17:00,True Orange August Part Scarbroughs True Orange The newsletter and faxemail service for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No August Stronger Defense Improved Punting Explosive Offense Give Horns Chance to Stay in Top With twoaday workouts almost over and the opening game just around the corner there is some great news for Longhorn football fans That year absence from the final top could be over for three big reasons The defense looks even stronger than last years unit which ranked No nationally Kris Stockton is punting so strongly that coach Mack Brown says the pros are interested The offense which couldnt score in the final ten quarters of last season is so explosive that it should be able to score on anybody But lets temper that great news with a word or two of caution about the offense While it is capable of breaking a long touchdown play against anyo ne on the schedule it still doesnt look like an offense that can make long timeconsuming drives against a quality opponent It wont be as quick to punt or score as the offenses at the really passhappy schools on the schedule this year but there might be a scary number of threeandouts against good defenses That wont necessarily be fatal to the Longhorns high hopes if the offens e and special teams can avoid costly mistakes that leave the defense a short field to defend The Longhorn defensive unit is so strong that it will force most teams to punt quickly too Another great asset this season will be defensive depth When the Longhorn offense sputtered down the stretch last year the defenders sometimes simpl y wore down through repeated exposure But the second defensive unit has been formidable in practice It allowed t he No offense one touchdown in seven possessions in Saturdays scrimmage Brown said the only big difference in the first and second units is at defensive tackle where the first team has AllAmerican Casey Hampton and a guy the pros like even better Shaun Rogers But Rogers says the dropoff at tackle isnt that great when the second unit comes in When Casey and I come out Stevie Lee and Marcus Tubbs are really good young players who are just going to keep on getting better and better While Hampton and Rogers are seniors Lee is a true freshman who enrolled in January so he could go through spring practice and Tubbs is a redshirt freshman who came to Texas as a tight end before growing into a formidable defensive tackle The Longhorns are still a very young team with Hampton Rogers and free safety Greg Brown the only senior starters on defense and tackles Leonard Davis and Cory Quye the only likely senior starters on defense Stockton w ho will handle the punting and place kicking also is a senior Brandon Healy is starting at wide receiver now but the fifthyear senior i s being pushed by the heralded freshmen who are developing rapidly Lets take a look at what the Longhorn offense did last year and what it meant to the team The figures below show gamebygame rushing passing and total offense yardage plus the number of sacks the opponents garnered Rush Pass Total Sacks NC State L Stanford W Rutgers W Rice W Baylor W KState L Oklahoma W Nebraska W Iowa State W OState W Texas Tech W Texas AM L Nebraska L Arkansas L It doesnt take a rocket scientist to see that the Longhorns were when they had more than yards offensively and an even more impressive wh en they had yards net rushing The flip side of that coin is that they were when they had less than yards offensively and an ever worse when they had less than yards n et rushing They also had five games in which they gave up more than four sacks and the only one of those they won was against Texas Tech To keep history from repeating itself the Horns need to start percolating on offense Now lets look at the upcoming season Coach Brown doesnt mind the pollsters picking UT No in the country and he also is glad they think t he Longhorns can contend for the national championship Weve sold season tickets because of the fans enthusiasm and support he said Sunday The fans are talking about winning a national championship too and we havent finished in the top in years but thats a good thing too We have high expectations and we want the fans to have high expectations for us Brown said the team has a chance to be good if it can eliminate some of the mental mistakes that cropped up last year and continue to improve Texas ranked near the bottom nationally last season in net punting averagi ng slightly under net yards per kick He said the goal this year is to average yards net punting and he said Stockton is punting so well in practice that the pro scouts are showing so me interest Overall our punting is so much better than it was last year he said Brown also said he thinks starting tailback Hodges Mitchell is even quicker than he was last year and will be able to get the Horns some yardage as the primary punt returner and he said backup tailbacks Ivan Williams and Victo r Ike will be the primary kickoff returners We think we will be better in all those areas he said True freshman CB Nathan Vasher ran a punt back yards for a touchdown in Saturdays scrimmage and Brown said he probably will use him as a punt returner at some point in the season Heres a look at how the team is developing on a positionbyposition basi s OFFENSE Quarterback Major Applewhite the Big CoOffensive Player of the Year last season after throwing for a school record yards and another school record touchdowns seems to be fully recovered from offseason knee surgery but h e is locked in a battle with super talented sophomore Chris Simms for the starting job Brown says he thinks both will play in the NFL and he says its a great problem to have Ive had teams with no quarterbacks he said I like th is a lot better Brown also says everyone has an opinion about who will start but Im the one who will make the decision because Im the one who will get fired if it doesnt work out He also said both will play a lot this season Beau Trahan a high school quarterback who switched to safety at UT has be en moved back to quarterback and he threw a touchdown pass in Saturdays scrimmage He is very mobile and has a good arm Chance Mock the heralded recruit from The Woodlands is a great prospect Hes built like a linebacker at but he runs like a wide receiver and has a powerful accurate arm Brown wants to redshirt him and he want s to redshirt Running Back All Big tailback Hodges Mitchell is back after rushing for yards a nd catching passes for more yards Converted linebacker Matt Trissel is the fullback and he is a good one He s an outstanding blocker good receiver and tough power runner Sophomore Victor Ike the fastest of the tailbacks has been looking good i n practice and currently is running ahead of Kenny Hayter and Ivan Williams for the backup tailback job Converted tight end Chad Stevens and Brett Robin are the backup fullbacks Freshmen TB Sneezy Beltran and freshman FB Will Matthews are looking good i n practice but could be redshirted because of the depth at their positions Tight End The coaches spent much of the spring building a passing attack around multitalented sophomore Bo Scaife a pounder with great speed He was slowed last season after undergoing knee surgery following his senior seaso n in high school but was sensational during spring drills On the very first day of fall practice he hurt the other knee in a noncontact drill and has already undergone surgery to fix it He is out for the season but Brown said the injury was not as severe as th e one to the other knee and said he should be ready to go by spring practice Since he played as a true freshman this will be his redshirt year Junior Mike Jones is an outstanding blocker and good receiver and he came back pounds lighter and a little quicker He will do a fine job but he wont scare people with his speed Freshman Brock Edwards is a big fast prospect and the coaches are working hard to get him ready to play He isnt as fast as Scaife but he is very fast for a pounder Wide Receiver Redshirt freshman Artie Ellis and fifthyear senior Brandon Healy are the starters but true freshmen Roy Williams and B J Johnson have been outstanding in practice and will play a lot even if they dont start Williams and probably the fastest player on the team has been making sensational catches almost every day in practice and Johnson and super fast too caught a yard scoring pass from Applewhite against the firstteam defense in Saturdays scrimmage Two other true freshmen Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery are speedsters who also are pushing for playing time There is little experience but a lot of young talent at wide receiver The youngsters may struggle in the early games but some of them will help a lo t this season and all of them are fast enough to scare defenses Line Four starters return and super sophomore Derrick Dockery the lone new starter might be the best of the bunch The line did a good job early last season but caught much of the blame for the lateseason collapse Center Matt Anderson is getting a strong challenge from sophomore Beau Bake r at center and Cory Quye is holding off Mike Williams at right tackle for now Dockery is a fixture at left guard Leonard Davis is getting some AllAmerica mention at left tackle and Antwan KirkHughes is in control at right guard Brown has called Dockery the best true freshman lineman I have ever coache d Sophomore Robbie Doane is a strong backup at tackle and redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway is a talented newcomer at guard The line will be better because of the extra years experience The key question is the degree of improvement DEFENSE End Nine starters return from a fine defense but both seniors in were the two defensive ends Sophomore Cory Redding the Big Defensive Newcomer of the Year last year looks like a future AllAmerican at right end He is a great pass rusher an d an improving run stopper Defensive coordinator Carl Reese plans to try to fill the left end spot by using three or four players Jermain Anderson quick but undersized at pounds is the starter He is a fine pass rusher but is too small to play full time Sophomore Cole Pittman has moved over from tackle because of his runstopping ability Maurice Gordon and Adam McConathy also will play The y like Anderson excel at rushing the passer Reese likes the size and quickness of true freshman Kalen Thornton who is about and He says he will try to work him in early this season to see what he can do Tackle Seniors Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers are a formidable duo and probably ar e the best pair of tackles in college football Hampton was a firstteam AP AllAmerican last year and Rogers is bigger quicker and at times even mor e dominating True freshman Stevie Lee who graduated from high school early so he could go through spring practice at UT and redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs are outstanding backups Another redshirt freshman Ryan Haywood has a lot of potential Linebacker Reese has four outstanding linebackers who are concentrated at two position s which is why he plans to play nickel five defensive backs only two linebackers defenses at least half the time Juniors DeAndre Lewis in the middle and Everick Rawls on the weak side opposite the tight end are returning starters who just keep getting bette r Sophomore O J McClintock also has been looking great on the weak side an d redshirt freshman Reed Boyd is pushing Lewis in the middle So there is great quality and depth at two of the three spots On the strong side however juniors Tyrone Jones and Marcus Wilkins have n ot drawn a lot of praise from Reese He just says the Longhorns play five or six teams who pass most of the time and he will pull his strong side backer and play an extra defensive back He likes to have his quickest players in the game and all of his cornerback s are good tacklers Look for five or six defensive backs to letter before either strongside backer letters Secondary All four starters return but junior Quentin Jammer and sophomore Roderick Babers appear to be beating out returning cornerback regulars Ahmad Brooks and Ervis Hill Jammer living up to his name is great when it comes to jamming receivers and keeping them from getting off the line He is big and physical Babers is a speedster who played a lot as the nickel back last year He has great manforman coverage skills and always looks for the pick Regardless of who wins the starting jobs all of the cornerbacks will play in Reeses nickel and dime packages He also plans to substitute them a lot because they do so much running True freshman Nathan Vasher also is pushing for playing time At safety senior Greg Brown and junior Lee Jackson are returning starters Backing them up are redshirt freshman Dakarai Pearson who is looking very good this fall and true freshman Phillip Geiggar who graduated early so h e could go through spring practice at Texas Geiggar also looks like a future star Reese usually plays extra cornerbacks in his nickel and dime lineups but h e has been working Pearson as a nickel back in some situations Football Notes Two freshmen running back Tyrone Richardson and linebacker Aurmon Satc hell have left the team at least temporarily to resolve some academic probl ems Richardson wont be back until January at the earliest Satchell said he hopes to get his problems resolved by the NCAA Clearinghouse in time to rejoin the team this week Backup linebacker O J McClintock and freshman cornerback Nathan Vasher ha ve intercepted a lot of passes in practice Coach Brown says junior guard Antwan KirkHughes is the most improved offensive lineman but he also said We feel like all five offensive line starters will be quality players Josh Doiron older both of freshman defensive end Adam Doiron is walking o n as a tight end Josh Doiron attended Kansas State for a year on a football scholarship but quit the team and attended Oklahoma last year He did not play football at OU After sitting out this year at UT he will have two years of eligibility remaining Redshirt freshman Monti Collier has been switched from cornerback to safety Coach Brown says the true freshmen will have their first chance to move up late this week We like to get through twoadays before we do a lot of moving up and down with the freshmen he said We have to be sure they ca n play at a high level on a consistent basis True freshman WR Roy Williams makes at least one or two sensational catches in every practice and fellow true freshman WR B J Johnson also is making a strong bid for early playing time Its a Great Time to Subscribe To The FaxEMail Service

Gets Top RB Cedric Benson as Lucky th Recruit Cedric Benson of Midland Lee the alltime Class A champ in yardage gained and touchdowns scored is a future Longhorn Thirteen is supposed to be an unlucky number but not in this case because Benson is the Longhorns th early commitment and he is a rare jewel He ran for an incredible yards and scored an equally incredible touchdowns last season to lead Lee to a State Championship season Benson scored TDs rushing and caught passes for yards and the oth er seven scores He ran roughshod over a very good Aldine Eisenhower team in the state final s rushing for yards and four touchdowns and bolting yards with a scree n pass for another TD in a victory That was just another typical day for Benson who had yards and five TD s in the state finals as a sophomore en route to a yard season and touchdowns Why did he pick the Longhorns over all the other top schools who offered scholarships Ive always liked the University of Texas he said I like the way they use their running backs and have a balanced offense The UT offense is a lo t like the one we run here at Lee Benson said he was pulling for Ricky Williams to win the Heisman Trophy in and said Texas has been his top choice since he started drawing recruiting attention Asked how many scholarship offers he has received Benson said he quit counting after He also said the only other team he seriously considered was Miami but I like Texas better and its a lot closer to home Legendary high school coach Gordon Wood who won multiple state titles at Stamford and Brownwood before retiring several years ago says Benson is the best running back I ever saw in high school Woods teams had some great backs and they played against some other great backs so he has seen more than his share of the great ones Benson is a back who sets up blockers extremely well and seems to sense whe re a hole will be before it opens He is an instinctive runner who is shifty a nd hard to bring down He is on all the national top lists as are fellow Texas pledges Jonatha n Scott of Dallas Carter and Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village both offensive linemen OL Alfio Randall of Blinn JC another Texas commitment was a national top prospect two years ago at Houston Yates Randall had hoped to enroll at Texas in January but he needs more hou rs at Blinn so he will have to remain at the junior college through the sprin g semester to graduate That will delay his enrollment at Texas until next fa ll Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter is a national top player He is super quick for his size and has the long arms college coaches want f or the key left tackle spot Abe Robinson Jersey Village is another national top player He plays tight end at Jersey Village and is the top blocker for sup er junior RB Selvin Young who ran for yards last year as a sophomore Alfio Randall Blinn JC was a national top player two years ago He is super strong and extremely quick Mike Garcia Galena Park broke the Aggies hearts by changi ng his early commitment to Texas He is an offensive lineman with a defensive linemens aggressive temperament Will Allen Cypress Falls is another highly recruited star who has quick feet and great lateral movement Roman Reeves another of the states top eight offensive linemen He is a physically dominating blocker with good footwork and a strong upper body Terrance Young Longview has a very quick start and like Garcia is aggressive with his blocks Running Back Cedric Benson Midland Lee the states top running back an d another national top player Linebacker Yamil LeBron Killeen Ellison was the middle backer the Longhorns targeted early He is very physical and tough and he has great quickness Defensive Back Cedric Griffin San Antonio Holmes one of the states top two cornerbacks He is the kind of tall fast meter time corner who loves manforman coverage and is very good at it Kendal Briles Wolfforth Frenship a great option QB who wi ll play safety at Texas He was the Class A Offensive Player of the Year last season while leading Stephenville to the Class A state title He moved to the suburbs of Lubbock because his father Art left his job as head coach at Stephenville to become an assistant at Texas Tech Braden Johnson Euless Trinity a fine athlete who will play QB this season He is a real head hunter Brian Carter The Woodlands a twoway star at WR and CB So far only seven member of Dave Campbells Texas Football magazines man Super Team have committed to colleges and the Longhorns have six of them Benson is the only high school player ever to grace the cover of the state s top football magazine and he is joined on the Super Team by Briles Griffin Scott Young and Robinson The other Super Team player who has committed is Madisonville running back David Underwood who says he will sign with Michigan RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns search for a quarterback recruit has been narrowed down to the best one in Texas and the best one in Louisiana Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch is the top Texas QB recruit and Bret Rawls of Shreveport Evangel is the top one in Louisiana Rawls backed up superstar Brock Berlin last year but has soared to the top of the recruiting charts after attending several major college summer camps Eric Hall the outstanding defensive end prospect from Clarksville Tenn still plans to take his official visit the Sept weekend With recruits already committed and no defensive lineman among them that is where at least five or six of the remaining scholarships will be awarded DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison is the key one because he is the toprated DT in the nation and because he is the only great one in the high school ranks in Texas this year Paul

Mich AM UT On the outofstaters UT has a shot at Hall and Rawls Jakes and Buchanan also are very seriously considering the Longhorns Cody says he definitely will visit UT so the Horns have a fair chance with him The odd s are much longer on Davis Shelton Spears and Hill Scouting LouisianaLafayette If the Longhorns dont break their quarter scoring drought quickly in their Sept season opener against LouisianaLafayette in Austin it will be a very bad sign The Ragin Cajuns didnt do much ragin last season going with their only victories coming over AA Wofford and Middle Tennessee They also gave up an average of yards per game rushing and allowed opposing backs to average yards per rush The Cajuns run a spread offense with four wideouts but they didnt score a touchdown until their fifth game last season Coach Mack Brown says you dont really know what you have until you start playing other teams He still wont know after this day in the park The game starts at am on Sept and will be televised by the Fox Network on a syndicated basis Baseball Adds Loses The Longhorn baseball coaches have signed shortstop Shaff Elkouri from Seward County JC in Kansas but they lost one of their prized recruits last weekend when slugger Jason Stokes of Coppell signed with Florida for million Elkouri will be a sophomore at Texas this season Big Basketball Recruiting Week Coming Up The season opener in football is always big news and its also going to be a big deal for basketball this year because both Longhorn teams have some bigtime recruits taking official visits the Sept weekend Its really big for the men who have only one scholarship remaining T J Ford the point guard who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the state Class A championship last season will visit Ford is the player the UT coaches want and there is a chance he will commi t on his visit The Longhorn women have three scholarships left and two outstanding player s have scheduled visits for the Sept weekend One of them has a name you will remember She is Lauren Selmon a guardforward from Norman Okla If that rings a bell you are right She is the daughter of Dewey Selmon o ne of those three great defensive line brothers who starred at Oklahoma a quarter of a century ago I was in Oklahoma working as a political reporter for The Associated Press when the Selmons played at OU Unlike some of the later Sooner stars who made the wrong kind of headlines off the field the Selmons are fine people The other is Jody Bell a forward from Chestermere HS in Alberta Canad a She averaged a triple double last season points

Volume No November Editors Note Im sending this in four pieces today because it is a bigger issue than usual due to the spring recruiting in basketball track and softball Volume No November Benson Defense Stifle Ags Huge Upsets Propel Horns Into Big Title Game Against Colorado As Longhorn defensive coordinator Carl Reese noted it was an oldfashioned rockem sockem game in College Station before a state record football crowd of Friday and Texas won it with a gritty defense and two late touchdowns by outstanding freshman RB Cedric Benson After taking the victory head coach Mack Brown congratulated the team on its fine season and said he wasnt worried about the Bowl Championship Series BCS because well be in it I dont know if had a crystal ball but immediately after the Longhorns expected victory toprated Nebraska was humiliated by Colorado and the next day No Oklahoma a point favorite lost at home to Oklahoma State It was only the fifth time OSU has won at OU The good news is those games moved Texas up to the No spot in both major polls and put the Longhorns back in control of their own destiny for the first time since that loss to OU back in October Texas plays Colorado Saturday at pm in Irvings Texas Stadium for the Big Championship and an automatic berth in one of the four BCS bowls possibly even the Rose Bowl in the national title game But the bad news is that a loss to the stampeding Buffaloes would knock the Longhorns out of the BCS mix Brown and his players are tickled orange however at the chance to play for the conference championship The BCS isnt an issue today Brown said Saturday after the huge upset in Norman The Bowl game isnt an issue today We said we needed to get to the championship game he said but once you get there you need to win After that you just look up and try to figure out where you are People have been asking us about the BCS for five weeks Brown said Obviously we said we needed to wait until the end of the season and the ends not even near where it should be People havent given us or Colorado a chance to be in this game for five weeks To our kids credit and to Colorados kids credit they kept working hard and now they are in this game The coaches and players have to forget the Aggie game and get ready for the Buffaloes but we can enjoy it just a little longer This was a game where the defenses werent going to give up a lot but the Longhorns got an early special teams touchdown when CB Roderick Babers blocked a punt and WR Tony Jeffery scooped it up and scored The Aggies tied it on a yard drive after a fine punt return in the third quarter when they had the benefit of the strong wind which was around miles per hour with frequent gusts to or miles per hour But Nathan Vasher made a couple of good punt returns and Texas started the pivotal fourth quarter with the wind and a drive into Aggie territory that changed the field position for the rest of the game After a short Aggie punt midway through the period the Longhorns rode Bensons strong legs to a touchdown then they got another from the powerful freshman after Everick Rawls interception in the final two minutes Here briefly is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred After each defense got a quick stop the Aggies were stymied a second time and Babers blocked the punt and Jeffery returned it yards for a Longhorn TD and a lead with left Another threeandout by the Aggies followed by a shanked punt gave Texas possession at the UT The Horns made one first down and Dusty Mangum missed a yard field goal try Defenses dominated the quarter AM led in first downs and in total yardage Second Quarter A shanked punt by UTs Brian Bradford set the Aggies up at the Longhorn AM couldnt move but punted the ball dead at the UT The Longhorn offense which had done little with the stiff wind couldnt move into it and Bradfords yard punt a good one into the wind gave AM possessiion at the UT The Aggies made a first down at the before stalling Cody Scates missed a yard field goal attempt An interception of a long pass at the UT by safety Ahmad Brooks with just under five minutes left in the half finally pumped a little life into the Longhorn offense which drove to midfield and killed all but seconds of the half before stalling Texas had a lead in first downs and a lead in total offense at intermission Third Quarter Texas got the ball going into the wind to start the second half The Horns couldnt move and punted AMs Mickey Jones almost tied the game on the punt return starting right then racing left and going down the sideline for yards before being pushed out of bounds at the UT The Aggies hit a pass to the UT then pound RB Keith Joseph took over powering to the left to the then taking a pitchout to the right for the TD to tie the game with left The Horns came right back with a good drive to midfield sparked by two passes from Simms to TE Bo Scaife But facing fourth down with an inch or two needed a lineman flinched and UT drew a yard penalty and had to punt Fourth Quarter Benson who had been stymied throughout the first three quarters got and then yards on his first two carries of the final period getting the Horns to the Aggie But the UT offense stalled again and Bradfords punt was killed at the Aggie The Texas defense force a quick punt into the wind and Vasher alertly ran up and caught the short punt at the AM and returned it to the Benson got loose for to the then got and to the On third and Simms hit Scaife coming across the middle to the AM Benson powered through the right side for the TD on the next play Mangums kick put UT on top with left Rawls interception at the AM and return to the with left set up the final UT touchdown Benson got then ran through a big hole and powered through two defenders for the TD and the final count Rose Bowl Road Full of Thorns If you still have some hope the Longhorns will be playing for the national title in the Rose Bowl on January heres what it would take A victory over Colorado Saturday A loss for either Florida or Miami and probably a loss for Oregon too because the Ducks were ahead of Texas in the last BCS ratings The Horns have to be No or No in the final BCS ratings on December to get to Pasadena Miami plays at Virginia Tech Saturday while Florida hosts Tennessee and Oregon also is at home against Oregon State If Florida beats Tennessee the Gators would have to win the SEC title game on December against the winner of Saturdays game between Auburn and LSU Since that game is in Baton Rouge and Auburns outstanding running back broke his shoulder two weeks ago LSU probably will be the Gators Dec opponent Its asking a lot for two of those three teams to lose a game but after the games in Boulder and Norman last weekend anything is possible Longhorn Notes Saturdays meeting between Texas and Colorado will be the sixth Big Championship Game Texas won the inaugural title game in Nebraska triumphed in and Texas AM won the title in and Oklahoma took the crown in If Texas wins Saturday the Longhorns will join Nebraska as the only twotime champs Since the Big Championship Game counts in statistical manners RB Cedric Benson has a great chance to become the first Longhorn freshman to rush for more than yards in a season He has yards and ranks second among Longhorn freshmen behind Ricky Williams who rushed for yards in Benson broke the UT freshman record for touchdowns with his pair of fourthquarter rushing scores He has touchdowns on the season rushing and one on a shovel pass reception breaking the record of set by Roy Williams last year Benson had only yards on carries after three quarters Friday in College Station but he finished strong carrying times for yards and scoring the Longhorns only two offensive touchdowns in the final period He finished with carries for yards and two touchdowns The UT defense is allowing yards a game rushing the fourth lowest average in school history trailing only teams from the old oneplatoon days when defense dominated and games were the norm The only lower season averages were in in and in This is Texas first win season since which was the last time Texas won at Kyle Field The Longhorns have had teams with or more wins in a season but this is just the third since Texas evened the series in College Station UT leads the overall series The Texas defense has held its last eight opponents to less than yards of total offense Texas AM gained yards which was the fourth time Texas has held its opponent to less than yards in Sophomore WR BJ Johnson extended his streak of consecutive games with a catch to a UT record to start a career and the thirdlongest in school history Mike Adams holds the school record of which he set from Sophomore WR Roy Williams has caught a pass in straight games He had eight receptions o move into sixth place on the UT career receptions list He also moved into second place on UTs singleseason list with receptions Junior QB Chris Simms passed for yards giving him yards on the season and placing him second on the UT singleseason chart Major Applewhite holds the UT record with yards in Senior LB DD Lewis tied the UT record with his th straight start He now shares the record with Dan Neil Freshman WR Tony Jeffery scored his second career touchdown when he returned Rod Babers blocked punt yards in the first quarter His first score came against Houston when he had a yard touchdown reception Texas has returned two blocked punts for touchdowns in the first was by sophomore safety Phillip Geiggar against New Mexico State Junior CB Rod Babers blocked a punt for the second straight game It was his second blocked kick of the season and the fifth for Texas as a team Texas has blocked seven kicks overall this season Fridays victory marked UTs eighth straight road victory and th in its last games Texas has produced seven defensive or special teams scores in including four in the last three games The Texas defense has had an interception in six straight games and eight of games this season Texas is when scoring first when leading at halftime and when outrushing its opponent during the Mack Brown era The Horns are when they are outrushed during the Brown era Subscribe To The EMailFax To Get YearRound Football Recruiting Scoops Save Big As An Internet Subscriber Whether you live close to Austin or far

to call Texas the BCS and the Bowl Situation Forget calculating the Longhorns BCS standings and their chances of getting into a BCS bowl It all got simplified when Nebraska and Oklahoma both lost last weekend Now two improbable division winners Texas in the South and Colorado in the North will meet Saturday for the Big Championship and the automatic BCS berth that goes with it It would take another big round of upsets for Texas to make it to the National Championship Game in the Rose Bowl but a second victory over the Buffs Saturday would guarantee the Horns a BCS bowl bid It could be the Fiesta Bowl in Phoenix which normally gets the Big champion if the Big champ isnt in the national title game But the BCS bowls can trade things around and the Rose Bowl normally the meeting place for the Big and Pac champs wont have a team from either of those conferences in it unless Oregon gets lucky So some Fiesta Bowl folks would like to turn their bowl into Rose Bowl II by inviting the Big and Pac champs They reportedly have been talking to the Sugar Bowl folks about switching teams and the New Orleans folks reportedly would love to have the Longhorns assuming they take care of business Saturday in Texas Stadium There also is an outside chance the Orange Bowl will get in on the swapping so the Horns could wind up there And what if Colorado pulls another big upset Saturday Then we hope all of you love the Cotton Bowl because that is where Texas will be when the new year begins The new BCS standings will be issued Monday but for the first time since that all started it really wont matter where Texas stands because a win Saturday will guarantee a BCS bowl berth and a loss will guarantee there wont be a BCS bowl berth for Texas

working so we went back to our regular block ande I just had to beat the guy in front of me When I saw it was a linebacker I knew he was in trouble Linebackers arent quick enough to block me If I cant get by a big old guy like that I dont deserve my scholarship Longhorn cornerback Rod Babers who blocked the punt that resulted in UTs firstquarter touchdown We were both on the right side he and Babers and they werent zone blocking like we do They were in manforman and all we had to do was beat the guy in front of us Thats my first touchdown as a special teams player Texas wide receiver Tony Jeffery who scooped up the ball Babers blocked and ran it in for the games first touchdown We did a good job against the run I thought Maurice Gordon probably played as good as hes every played for us Their center AllBig Seth McKinney is a good ball player and at times he couldnt block him I thought all our guys played pretty well today This was a good oldfashioned football game with both teams playing good defense and a break or two deciding the outcome UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese We felt like if we would just hang in there and hang in there wed eventually get the running game going and Cedric Benson and the offensive line did a great job in the fourth quarter With Cedric you dont have to abandon the running game because you know hell break loose sooner or later We didnt want to take too many chances and give them a short field because we knew they would have a hard time making a long drive with our defense playing so well Texas defensive coordinator Greg Davis It never got easier but it did get better I think our linemen finally wore them down and I started getting a little more room It would have been nice to get yards but winning the game is the main thing and we did that Texas running back Cedric Benson Give the Longhorns some credit Their defense is really good It ranks with any we have seen this year AM quarterback Mark Farris The game was up for grabs in the fourth quarter They just made some plays It was and they did what they had to do in the fourth quarter to go up They have some great offensive weapons and we held them in check for most of the game AM

and Colorado meet for the second time Saturday at pm in Irvings Texas Stadium in the Big Conference Championship Game It will be televised nationally by ABC and it should be a good one Texas is an point favorite The Longhorns mauled the Buffaloes on Oct in Austin but that Colorado team bore little resemblance to the one that hung a lashing on No ranked Nebraska Saturday For starters Bobby Pesavento who passed for yards against Nebraska got his first start against Texas and he looked like a firsttime starter He was a poised confident sharpshooter Saturday against Nebraska the perfect complement for the Buffs power running game that produced yards and eight rushing touchdowns against the proud Blackshirt defense of Nebraska Sophomore Chris Brown scored a school record six rushing touchdowns while rushing for yards He had yards against Texas in October Colorado is Its only losses were in the season opener with Fresno State and the one at Texas The nine victories were over Colorado State over San Jose State over Kansas over Kansas State over Texas AM over giantkiller Oklahoma State over Missouri over Iowa State and of course the big one over Nebraska Texas won the first game against Colorado by using four firsthalf turnovers to take a lead and force the Buffaloes the abandon their running game and try to play catchup In that game Colorado had yards offensively in the first half but was stymied by a fumble at the UT on firstand goal a fumble at the CU that set up a Texas field goal and another fumble at the Buff that set up another UT touchdown Unless history repeats and the Horns force more early turnovers this game will be a terrific challenge for Texas I think there are three keys to a UT victory Win the turnover battle again Keep balance between running and passing but challenge the Buffs suspect pass defense frequently Slow down Colorados power running game which ranks No nationally at yards a game Heres how the teams compare statistically

four gameturning turnovers Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown has told his team and Longhorn fans all season that good things happen to teams who keep winning After a midseason loss to Oklahoma the Longhorns have reeled off six straight wins and Oklahoma States stunning upset of Oklahoma Saturday gave Texas the Big Southern Division title Obviously he said we are excited about it because it proves to our guys that when people questioned whether their season was over after the Oklahoma game that it wasnt They realized that what they needed to do was take care of their business and there might be some good things that happen at the end Our team couldve taken the Missouri game or the Baylor game for granted but they didnt They took care of their business every week They didnt worry about the BCS and now theyve got themselves in position for a championship game for the second time in three years We are really really excited I am proud of our team and of the way they played at College Station What an awful thing it would have been if we had not taken care of business Friday in College Station and this would have happened OUs loss Saturday So give credit to our team for being mature playing hard and putting themselves in position to have a rematch with Colorado He also said the Longhorns victory over Colorado in Austin back on October means little because this isnt the same Colorado team we played at midseason Any team that can get points against Nebraska gets your attention he said I think it is obvious that Colorado is a great football team They are running the ball as good as anybody in the country right now What a great challenge it will be for our defense which has played as good as any defense in the country he said That will be a great matchup Brown said the Longhorn offense had a tough day against AM We will need to play better on offense in this game and what a great challenge it will be to try to stop Colorado from running the ball as well as they ran it against Nebraska he said Brown also said Saturdays game is huge because it is for the Big Championship You always want to win your conference championship he said It is one of your first goals each year This is our second opportunity to win a conference championship in four years here and are we excited The BCS is not an issue today and a bowl game is not an issue today he said This is what you fight to get into but when you get there youve got to win After that you try to look up and figure out where you are But Brown said beating Colorado again is a huge challenge for the Longhorns If our guys werent convinced before the Nebraska game we will convince them that this Colorado team is different he said Give Colorado coach Gary Barnett credit He took his kids to Texas Stadium this summer and said that is where we want to end up and as of Saturday nobody thought that Colorado and Texas would end up in this ball game So give both teams credit Brown said It is two teams that have been down this year and have gotten themselves back up gone back to work and are playing as well as anyone in the country at the end of the year One of the things that we have talked about with this team is respect You need to respect yourself and your teammates but you also need to respect your opponent Every Saturday has to be a real important game for us and a really exciting game for us Our guys will play hard this Saturday because they understand what is at stake To win the conference championship in this league Brown said you have to beat the same team twice a lot of the time That is something that is just there To be the champion you have to do it so we are excited about it There is no question that it is harder because they will have a lot of motivation coming in But we are also going to have a lot of motivation coming in to try to be the champions of the Big He said the players and coaches are excited about the challenge This is a championship game week he said You understand that this is like playing your biggest rival and that makes it fun What we have to do to win the championship every year is play a huge rival like Texas AM and then play this game the next week We need to get used to that There are a lot of things that are different now in the Big that they were around here for a long time with the Southwest Conference One of them is being able to play big game after big game and especially at the end of the year We have been here before but we havent taken the other step yet This is the week for us to take the other step and win the championship Our players are the reason why we are here Different things have happened throughout the year and this was just the latest one The reason we are playing in this game is our assistant coaches and our players have worked really hard to take advantage of every opportunity that they have had since the Oklahoma game They never got their head down and still believed They kept themselves in a position to win if the opportunity came up Brown had planned a big recruiting push this week but said We will put our recruiting on hold All of the coaches could go out on Monday for the first time and be in schools and the homes but the players out there will understand that our recruiting will be better by winning the championship game

another big recruiting push by going to top recruits schools and homes but the big game Saturday has pushed that back a week But dont worry about it Coach Mack Brown wrote the book on recruiting and his previous four classes at Texas have been very good and some of them have been great This years class has a chance to be as good as any Brown and his assistants have signed Theres a chance it could be the best of the bunch even better than the toprated Chris Simms Cory Redding class They already have commitments about half of them from players who have been on at least one national top list and their class already is ranked as one of the top five in the nation Lets take a look at where they are and where they are going OFFENSE Quarterback UT has a commitment from Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar who is a lot better than most of the gurus think and the Horns have close to a shot at Vincent Young the wonder kid at Houston Madison who had his usual game Friday for the undefeated Marlins doing everything on offense and even running an interception back for a touchdown Yes he plays defense too when needed Running Back The Horns have a commitment from Clint Haney of unbeaten

Winston the humongous pass catcher and blocker deluxe at Midland Lee Wide Receiver National top star Marquis Johnson of Champaign Ill and Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood are already committed

nations top DT and at Marco Martin of Mesquite another national top player Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo who excels at DT and OG also is a strong possibility Its on whether he will play offense or defense in college He is the son of David Studdard a former UT offensive line star who had a long career with the Denver Broncos Linebacker Texas starts three seniors and needs a great group Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar Brian Robison of of Splendora and Marcus Myers of Pflugerville are already committed and the Horns are still recruiting several top one from Texas and across the

No October Simms Throws TD Passes Benson Rushes For Yards as Longhorns Gore Tigers Junior QB Chris Simms and true freshman RB Cedric Benson had careerbest days and the UT defense held Missouri to just one first down in the first and third quarters Saturday in Columbia to lead Texas to a victory On a day when upsets reigned across the country particularly in the top and five of the eight previously unbeaten teams lost the Longhorns took care of business and ran their record to overall and in the Big With Oklahomas loss at Nebraska the Sooners Longhorns and Aggies are all tied atop the standings in the Big South But the Longhorns have to win out and Oklahoma has to lose another conference game for the Longhorns to make it to the Big Championship Game Saturdays victory at Missouri was a fairly easy conquest thanks to the stout UT defense and a great performance by the offensive line that allowed Simms to complete of passes for yards and four touchdowns and Benson to run for yards on carries an average of yards a pop But some strange things happened to thwart the Longhorns in the early going On their first drive for example they held the ball almost minutes rolling yards in plays but they got zero points because they stalled at the Tiger and Dusty Mangum missed the chipshot field goal They also drove into Missouri territory on their second possession but again stalled Missouri finally got rolling to start the second quarter and scored first That seemed to wake up the Longhorn offense and it took control and wore out the Missouri defenders Here briefly is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred Missouri took the ball and Marcus James ran the UT kick back to the The Longhorn defense forced a quick threeandout and the UT offense had its most timeconsuming drive of the year going yards in a laborious minute play drive to the Tiger but Dusty Mangum missed the chipshot field goal Missouri went threeandout again The Horns drove to midfield again but stalled as the quarter ended Texas had a huge lead in statistics with first downs to for Missouri a edge in total offense and a to bulge in time of possession but the game was all even at in the only statistic that counts Second Quarter The Tigers finally got their offense untracked to start the second quarter and drove yards primarily on the passing of QB Kirk Farmer to take a lead with left Victor Ike ran the kickoff back to the and the Longhorns went yards in plays to tie it up Simms connected with WR B J Johnson on the yard TD toss but the big play was a yarder from Simms to TE Bo Scaife on thirdand at the Missouri Mangums kick tied it with left After the UT defense forced another quick andout and got a short punt Simms found Scaife again on the first play for a yard gain to the MU A WR reverse by Johnson got yards and Benson got more and a first down at the before Simms faked to Benson and hit TE Brock Edwards for the final yards and the TD Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left The Tigers stormed down the field in the final two minutes primarily on the running of pound Zack Abron who gained yards in three carries His yard tacklebreaking run to the gave the Tigers a firstandgoal but his next try gained only a yard and Farmer threw two incompletions before Brad Hammerich booted a yard field goal to cut the UT lead to with seconds left The Tigers outgained the Longhorns in the quarter to yards and had a edge in first downs Third Quarter Texas got the ball and again made a long timeconsuming drive but this time it counted because Simms scored from the to cap a yard drive and Mangum converted for a lead with left the Longhorns overcame a thirdand early in the drive when Simms scrambled and found Brett Robin for yards Vasher intercepted Farmer four plays later to give the Horns great field position at the MU The Longhorns couldnt move but the pick kept Missouri bottled up deep in its own territory throughout the quarter and allowed Texas to start its possessions around midfield in a quarter that was dominated by defense after Texas impressive opening drive The Tigers made only one first down in the quarter and Texas after getting five first downs on that opening TD drive managed only one more in the entire quarter Fourth Quarter The Tigers finally figured out their best offense was to hand the ball to Abron and he bulled for and then more for a TD Missouris pass for a point conversion failed and left UT on top with left Not to be outdone Benson shredded the Missouri defense for and then before Simms scrambled left and found Robin who scampered the final yards to complete a yard scoring play Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left Texas and the BCS The next Bowl Championship Series BCS standings will be a lot different from the first ones that were announced last week and Texas will be a lot higher than it was in the last one In the first standings which were announced last Monday Texas was ranked No behind five teams with perfect records The BCS standings are like golf in that the lowest score is the best score Oklahoma came in at No in the first standings at followed by Nebraska at UCLA at Miami at Virginia Tech at Texas at and Michigan at to round out the top seven But a rash of upsets claimed OU UCLA and Virginia Tech Since OU lost to Nebraska the Sooners wont tumble far but Texas should pass UCLA and VT Of course Michigan is so close to Texas that the Wolverines might pass the Horns if they keep winning Under the BCS formula the top four teams in the final standings are guaranteed berths in one of the four BCS Bowls which are the Rose Orange Fiesta and Sugar The Rose Bowl will get the national title game this year Right now that looks like a NebraskaMiami battle but both teams have some big games left before making that date Texas could make it to the Rose Bowl but it would require some big upsets like Texas AM or Texas Tech upsetting Oklahoma and then Texas beating Nebraska in the Big title game But the Longhorns will make it to one of the big BCS bowls if they keep winning Key Games for BCS Watchers If you want to keep tabs on the Longhorns chances to wind up in good shape in one of the big four BCS bowls the key is that they have to win their final three regular season games Assuming that happens here are some key games to watch for the rest of the season This Saturdays key games are Michigan at Michigan State Tennessee at Notre Dame and UCLA at Washington State The big ones the following Saturday Nov are Texas AM at Oklahoma and UCLA at Oregon On Nov Texas Tech hosts Oklahoma Syracuse is at Miami Michigan is at Wisconsin and Virginia Tech is at Virginia On Thanksgiving weekend Michigan hosts Ohio State Nebraska goes to Colorado and Oklahoma State plays at Oklahoma The big games on Dec are Miami at Virginia Tech Tennessee at Florida and Oregon State at at Oregon If Oklahoma loses to AM Tech or OSU and the Longhorns win out Texas would qualify for the Big Championship Game on Dec The final BCS rankings will be released on December the day after the Big and Southeastern Conference have their championship games Texas probably will be fourth or fifth in the BCS rankings to be released today and the games mentioned above will be big determining factors in where the Horns wind up Jackson McClintock to Redshirt It looks like senior LB Lee Jackson and junior DE O J McClintock will redshirt Both have been out with injuries all season and head coach Mack Brown said last week there are no plans to play them He said Jackson is still having troubles with his toe and his leg He said McClintock wont play unless the team suffers some injuries at DE Number Updated Daily I update my number every day with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call Coachs Corner The Longhorns now ranked No in both polls after a rash of upsets Saturday are playing well but they need to keep working to get better head coach Mack Brown said Sunday After studying films of the victory over Missouri Brown said he and his assistants were generally pleased with the teams play But he said the defense will work on hard on tackling this week We werent pleased with out tackling Brown said We werent pleased one back gained over yards on us Weve got to get back to work on that He also said the defense did a good job in permitting Missouri to get into the red zone only three times all day but they scored all three times Thats not what we want The offense played a pretty good game he said adding that tackle Mike Wiliams played great Hes our offensive player of the week Defensively he said the player of the week is CB Quentin Jammer who held the Tigers nationally ranked WR Justin Gage to two receptions for yards He was averaging receptions per game and ranked second in the Big in that department Brown also said he is concerned about some aspects of the kicking game We kicked two balls out of bounds on kickoffs he said Weve got some issues there weve got to correct He said backup LB Reed Boyd who plays on several of the kicking teams was our special teams player of the week Asked how he prepares his team for games like the next two against Baylor and Kansas when the opponents are losing and struggling he said Baylor played AM and Oklahoma tough Our guys need to play football because they like playing it If they cant get excited about playing football they dont need to be playing football at the University of Texas He also said Our guys need to understand that everyone wants to knock them

rather murky at this time LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar is committed to Texas but is setting up visits to Oklahoma he was once committed to the Sooners and several other schools WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus committed to Florida and LB Michael Williams of Lindale committed to Oklahoma last week but then they both decommitted Williams attended Texas AMs game Saturday and plans to come to take an official visit to Texas the December weekend The Longhorns commitments include nine players who are listed on one or more national top teams They are WR Marquis Johnson of Centennial High School in Champaign Illinois DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar DTs Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier Earl Anderson of San Marcos Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral the twotime defending Class A champion in Arizona OLs Brett Valdez of Brownwood and Neale Tweedie of Allen and TE David Thomas of Wolfforth Frenship Davis made all of the top national lists last year However he injured a knee and has undergone surgery and his coach at Gulf Coast JC says he has a lot of academic ground to cover to graduate The other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen of Keller LBs Brian Robison of Splendora and Marcus Myers of Pflugerville Connally WR Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar DB Matt Melton of Tyler and RBAth Clint Haney of Smithson Valley The Longhorns will give about to more scholarships and I think most of them will be awarded to members of a player group that includes QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison RBs Albert Hardy of Galena Park and Selvin Young of Houston Jersey Village WRs Timmons Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and Anthony Wright of Klein Forest TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee OLs Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield DEs Bryan Pickryl of Jenks Okla Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands DTs Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings Marco Martin of Mesquite and Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo LBs Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and Lindales Williams and DBs Edorian McCullough of North Garland Brodney Pool of Houston Westbury and Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln If the Longhorns finish strong they have a very good chance to get the four top players on my man differencemaker list They already have No in Earl Anderson and they have very good shots at No Wright No Young and No Dibbles If Pikryl lived in Texas he would be in my top and he says Texas is the leader right now He took his official visit the weekend of the Colorado game The Longhorns might take a kicker if they find one who is consistent at kicking off into the end zone Trey DeCarlo at Carrollton Creekview is the best Ive seen this year at booting them deep College kickers start five yards farther back but DeCarlos kicks usually carry out of the end zone INTERESTING RECRUITING TIDBIT The Longhorns lost

because tight end Bo Scaife made some great catches and that opened things up I think Bo gives us the ability to stretch the field even when the ball doesnt come to him because the defense has to be aware of where he is at all times Quarterback Chris Simms did a great job looking off on his big catch just before the half Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis This was a great team win for us The offense did a great job of hanging on the ball and running the clock and the defense did a good job of getting some threeandouts Thats the way its supposed to work when you draw it up I give a lot of credit to CB Quentin Jammer and nickel back Dakarai Pearson for shutting down their bigplay receivers Jammer held WR Justin Gage to two catches and Dak really did a good job on their tight end after we decided to give him the primary coverage on him UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese I dont think I was running any harder in the fourth quarter I think our offensive line just wore them down a little Coach Brown and coach Davis told me I needed to take charge in the fourth quarter and I just tried to keep running and pounding as hard as I could It feels good to be part of the record book UT freshman RB Cedric Benson talking about his game and the fact that he is the first true freshman to rush for yards in three straight games at Texas I was getting real clean releases I used my speed to my advantage I was getting single coverage because they were worrying about our running game and our wide receivers They were just sitting back waiting for me to come to them Longhorn TE Bo Scaife who caught five passes for yards including ones for and yards that set up firsthalf touchdowns We won and Oklahoma lost Virginia Tech lost and Stanford is ahead of UCLA Stanford won Thats what I call a good day UT quarterback Chris Simms When I heard the Oklahoma score I was a little happy Then I heard the Virginia Tech score and I was a little happier then the UCLAStanford game came as quite a

Buckman Picks Horns Brad Buckman a pound power forward from Austin Westlake who was recruited by most of the nations top programs picked Texas Tuesday saying he thinks the Horns are on the verge of joining the national elite in basketball He chose Texas over North Carolina at the end but also had considered Kentucky UCLA Missouri and others He had said earlier that the lure of the ACC where basketball reigns supreme was very strong and almost pulled him to North Carolina But he told me Tuesday Ive always wanted to go to Texas This is where my heart is He also said his head turned Texas way at the end because coach Rick Barnes has established a consistent winning program and has been wooing and winning bigtime recruits After looking at it closely he said I think Texas basketball is really on the upswing Theyve signed two McDonalds All Americans freshman point guard T J Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge and sophomore forward Brian Boddicker of Duncanville in the last two years They could make it three in three years because Buckmans stock soared this summer when he starred in several top AAU tournaments Brick Oettinger publisher of Prep Stars Recruiters Handbook was asked who was the biggest surprise of the summer Oettinger said In terms of from out of nowhere not in anybodys top to everybodys top it would be Brad Buckman Big forward very aggressive and a whole lot of skills just about as many skills as anybody in the class Ive got him No now and he wasnt in my top Dave Telep another national recruiting analyst agreed Buckman is a national top recruit The reality is that while there are guys with larger names there probably arent better players in the class Telep said He is athletic can handle it some he blocks shots he shoots to mediumrange and he scores in the post Clifton McNeely the Westlake coach also says his stars work ethic is off the chart Hes a very gifted player with a lot of talent McNeely said but the best thing about him is his strong heart and work ethic I dont think you could find anyone who works harder than he does McNeely also said he thinks Buckman is the best player in Texas There are some guards in the Dallas area who ranked higher nationally including Bracy Wright of The Colony who chose Indiana Daniel Horton of Cedar Hill who picked Michigan and Bryan Hopkins of Dallas Lincoln who committed to SMU The Longhorns recruited all three of those star guards but lost out on them at the end Buckman averaged points rebounds and blocks for Westlake as a junior And hes the kind of bluecollar inside player Barnes loves McNeely said Buckman can play a power game inside and shoot from point range Asked to compare him to Luke Axtell and Chris Mihm two other Westlake players he coached who played at UT he said He has the physical presence of Mihm and is a lot stronger coming out of high school and he has the range of Luke He is the first recruit to commit to Texas for the early signing period next month Barnes and his assistants are recruiting several other players most of them in other states and hope to sign a sharp shooting guard and a wing Buckmans father Brent played on two national championship golf teams at UT Basketball Team Has New Look The Longhorn basketball team will have a new look this season with the addition of heralded point guard T J Ford who led Fort Bend Willowridge to backtoback Class A state titles When the season starts next month Ford will be called upon to speed up the Horns offense and also create more opportunities for the teams inside players with his lightningquick passes Coach Rick Barnes is hoping Fords creativity in the halfcourt offense will improve the scoring punch of center James Thomas who averaged points and rebounds a game last year Ford also should be able to provide better shooting opportunities for senior forward Chris Owens sophomore wings Brandon Mouton and Royal Ivey and forward Brian Boddicker Barnes had to operate without a true point guard last year Fredie Williams Ivey and shooting guard Darren Kelly took turns at the point Barnes and the Horns coped with it admirably going overall and in the tough Big but they shot only percent from the field and had more turnovers than assists Ford should help raise the former and lower the latter They also lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Temple and Barnes hopes Ford will be a key to helping the team get farther into the playoffs this season Replacing departed wing Maurice Evans and Kelley who combined for of UTs pergame scoring average creates scoring opportunities for other shooters Now Barnes just needs some of them to seize that opportunity He expects Mouton and Ivey to step up there Sydmill Harris a freshman from The Netherlands has been a consistent shooter in preseason workouts Owens was a star in the World University Games during the summer and is expected to be one of the top players in the Big and a more dependable scoring threat Ever since last year the Temple game it started coming together Owens said It clicked I didnt do what I wanted to do and I knew I had the ability Now I have the mental concentration UT Women Looking Sharp Coach Jody Conradts Longhorn womens basketball team is picked to finish in the middle of the Big pack but early practices and stiff competition at several positons indicate it might be a lot better than that The Longhorns were looking good early last season before losing centerforward Annissa Hastings and guardTai Dillard to knee injuries Hastings and Dillard are hale and hearty once again but equally important is the fact that the Horns heralded recruiting class is living up to its hype Stacy Stephens a sophomore returns as the starting center and senior Tracy Cook and the Hastings can back her up and also play power forward Jody Bell a freshman from Canada and freshman Mercedes Williams also are looking good at power forward Two freshmen Heather Schreiber the high school player of the year in Texas last year and Kala Bowers last years high school player of the year in Oklahoma are battling for the small forward job it shows you are on the right track when you can call and women small forwards Hastings is so versatile that she probably will see action at all three inside positions Kenya Larkin returns as the point guard and other guards who will see a lot of action include sophomore Kaira White who has been looking great in practice plus Dillard and freshman CoCo Reed Alisha Sare and Asha Hill are other guards who could figure into the rotation RECRUITING NOTES LaToya Davis of Houston South Houston picked Texas Tech over Texas last week Nichelle Roberts a centerforward who teamED with Mercedes Williams to lead Spring Westfield deep into the state playoffs last year is the only remaining uncommitted blue chipper and the Longhorns have a great chance to sign her No Horns Win Soccer Title The No Texas womens soccer team clinched its first Big Conference title Sunday with a victory over Oklahoma The Longhorns are overall and in the Big and have one regular season match remaining against Texas AM Coach Chris Petrucelli in his third year at the helm said This

Volume No May Brown Says Longhorns Should Be Very Good Offensively with Chance for Stout Defense Too Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns will head into the football season with just one problem on offense and fewer than expected on defense if his young tackles come through In an interview with coach Brown last week I asked him how the Longhorns compare with his best teams at North Carolina In a nutshell he said Texas is better offensively than those North Carolin a teams but is not quite as imposing defensively His last two teams at North Carolina lost only to Florida State posting th e best twoyear record ever for the Tar Heels and finishing in the top twice something Texas hasnt accomplished once in nearly two decades Our offensive line is better here he said We have two quarterbacks who can play We had that at North Carolina too but our upside is better here Our receivers at North Carolina were very good but the ones we have now ca n be the best weve had He said North Carolinas fullback and tight end from his last team there a re still playing in the NFL but he also noted that UT TEs Bo Scaife and Broc k Edwards who are only sophomores in eligibility have NFL potential too He said one big plus offensively at UT is the depth the incoming freshmen will provide in the line We had good offensive linemen at North Carolina but we had trouble findin g good ones in numbers he said We didnt have good numbers here and had to force some guys to play too early he said but that got them ready to play and now we have good experience and good numbers and we hope we can start redshirting our freshm en offensive linemen We need to get to that point Hesaid the only problem he sees offensively this season is at tailback and that isnt as big a problem as it seems because all five of the returnees competing for the job are competent players and several of them have the ability to step it up And if they dont step it up there is a young fellow coming to twoadays in August who has everyone excited Ive written enough about Cedric Benson th at I wont go through it all again but he is something special If you doubt it just remember this Three state championship games in Clas s A at Midland Lee with five touchdowns in each game No one else has ever come close to doing that once in Class A much less three times Defensively Brown has high expectations and thats only natural because of the starters and of the backups on his North Carolina team were N FL draft picks Three of his defensive linemen went in the first round But he says the Longhorns have some talent on defense and could be very goo d if his young tackles come through The departures of twotime AllAmerican Casey Hampton and his equally formidable sidekick Shaun Rogers left a giant hole in the middle of the Longhorn defense They were the runstoppers deluxe who led a unit that ranked th nationall y in rushing defense yielding yards a game last year Eight starters return from a Longhorn defense that also ranked seventh in t he nation in total defense yielding only yards per game Brown also said Rogers who missed several games with a badly sprained ankl e was never close to last year after being injured early in the season Shaun was one of the best players of his size I have seen at rushing the passer he said When we lost him it really hurt our pass rush I have speculated in previous issues that the Longhorns probably will have a better pass rush from their front four this season because sophomoretobe Marcus Tubbs got sacks second on the team last year while standing in for Rogers and because the defensive ends are a year older and there is mo re speed at tackle than before Brown said the coaches are counting on a better pass rush from their lineme n Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton have the potential to be as good as anybod y at defense end he said We have high expectations for them At tackle he said Tubbs weighs and he can run Hes got a great upsid e Hes a young guy who has played well already and should just get better and better Were excited about him Brown also said the move of Maurice Gordon from end to tackle looks like a good one He runs a and he looked really good this spring We just need him to keep on working hard and hell be a good one Hes already a good pass rusher and hes working on getting stronger to stop the run While Gordon is a passrushing whiz the likely starter at tackle opposite Tubbs is redshirt freshman Stevie Lee if he is able to recover fully from foot surgery Lee played well last year in spots as a true freshman but was injured earl y and was able to get a medical redshirt year which means he is a freshman again this year If Lee is healthy Brown said the key for him is offseason conditioning work Stevie can play at about pounds but he doesnt need to play at he said In this league everybody spreads people out forcing the front four to ma ke offschedule plays You cant just be a run stopper anymore Youve got to be quick enough to make adjustments Were emphasizing speed and quickness he added Thats why we made some moves in the spring like moving Maurice Gordon to tackle O J McClintock to end from linebacker and Lee Jackson to linebacker from safety Brown also said sophomore Adam Doiron who also played well in relief last season as a true freshman has a bright future at tackle He needs to get get stronger Brown said Hes real smart and real tough He just needs to get more experience and use the offseason program to get stronger He likes his secondary saying I feel like we are in real good shape with our secondary We have guys who have the ability to cover and the speed to make up ground We also are two deep in the secondary for the first time since weve been here The area where he wants to see the most improvement on defense is a linebacker where all three starters return We have asked our linebackers to step it up he said They have played really well for us but we want them to just take an extra step to get even better The Longhorns had troubles with their place kicking in the spring and Brow n said the returnees and three walkons will compete for the starting job whe n twoadays begin in early August Summing up he said the Longhorns strengths are at quarterback wide receiver tight end the offensive line the defensive ends and the seconda ry He said defensive tackle will be a strong position too if Lee returns healthy and all the young players continue to improve When asked to comment on the most pleasant surprises from spring training Brown said Bo Scaife returning and looking like he is ready to play is on e Kyle Shanahan a walkon wide receiver did some really good things Derric k Dockery finally being healthy again was a big positive development He said all of the spindown moves the coaches made on defense this sprin g are looking good at this point We wanted to improve our speed on defense and these moves have helped us accomplish that Asked about the biggest disappointment in the spring drills he said It w as nobody emerging at tailback They all played good but after Ricky William s and Hodges Mitchell our expectations are very high True Orange Observations Look for the Longhorns to use more oneback formations this season Why Th e backup wide receivers and tight ends are more dangerous than the fullbacks WR Sloan Thomas and TE Brock Edwards would start and star for many teams b ut they are backups at Texas Also look for a lot more misdirection plays and other plays designed to ma ke the offense less predictable than it was last season With coach Mack Browns first great class of recruits heading into their third seasons and two other great classes following it this is the season the Longhorns should be able to finish in the top for the first time sin ce For those of you who seem to get a little impatient at times it is worth noting that the Longhorns have finished in the top just seven times sinc e and three of those seven times were in Browns first three years here th in st in and th in This Longhorn team probably will start out about fifth or sixth in the country and it should be able to stay in the top unless some wheels fall off The great thing about the way Brown has built this program is that he and h is assistants recruit great prospects every year and develop them I think this year will start a long string of years for UT to be contendin g for high national honors The only way you can win the highest national honor a national champio nship is to get to the championship game Since only two teams get to the championship game some very deserving team s are left out Miami and Washington for example were certainly deserving last year but unbeaten Oklahoma and oncebeaten Florida State got the nod So having an outstanding team doesnt guarantee a berth in the national title game I wont predict the Longhorns will wind up in the Rose Bowl playing for the national title this year but I will predict that Brown will have us playin g in a national championship game very soon Teams in the Big and SEC have the extra burden of having to play a postseason game for their conference titles which means they have to play two godzillas back to back to be No But great teams can do it and Texas will be a great team in the very near future It might not be this year but it could be if things break the Longhorns way Number Updated Frequently I update my number at least twice a week with football and football rec rui ting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call

Observations Texas specific problems on offense defense and special teams were addressed in the lead story but I think there are two general areas one on offense and one on defense where improvement must be made for the team to finish in the top for the first time since Offensively the Longhorns were a feastorfamine team in all the big games last year and even in some of the ones that wound up being laughers I am referring to their problem with threedown possessions In the rout of the Aggies for example Texas had one first down in the entire first half before exploding for four touchdowns in the third quarter Thats a bunch of threeandouts In the Oklahoma debacle Texas made one first down while the Sooners were scoring six touchdowns to put the game on ice early In the bowl loss to Oregon Texas fell behind in the first quarter had two long backtoback scoring drives to start the second quarter but had minus yardage on its other secondquarter possession and then had only two first downs in the entire third quarter when the Ducks came from behind to start taking control I could cite more examples but you saw the games and you know the team had a problem with too many threedown possessions in a row in the losses and in some of the victories Threedown possessions also hurt the defense because the defenders wind up being on the field too long with little opportunity to rest One seldom mentioned reason Josh Heupel was such an effective quarterback for OU was that he almost always moved the team for a first down or two even on drives that fizzled out That kept his defense fresh and gave it a long field to defend The Longhorn defenders conversely frequently had to defend very short fields Lets hope the team is better at consistently moving the ball this year Defensively the Longhorns ran manforman defenses a lot more than zones I know a couple of pro coaches who tell me the most effective pass defense is one that keeps the opponents guessing about the coverage The hiring of Duane Akina as secondary coach coupled with Mack Browns stated desire to mix up the pass coverage should help in that area Another problem with manforman is that teams like OU frequently have a pickoff man to block a cornerback and that can leave the cornerbacks guy wide open Still another negative against using all manforman is that zones are usually more effective on long yardage plays because the zone can be used to keep the defenders from getting deep quickly That was one reason the Longhorn defense gave up so many thirdandlong plays last season Lets hope that improves this year too and a more diversified coverage would help a lot Four UT Games Already on TV The Longhorns first three games and the regularseason finale at Texas AM will be televised The most recent one to be announced is the Sept game at Houston ESPN had picked it for an pm national telecast That is very good news because the game will be played in Robertson Stadium which seats only slightly more than The Sept opener against New Mexico State will have a pm kickoff and will be televised nationally by the Fox Network The Sept game against North Carolina also will be televised Thats the good news The bad news is that it is set for an am kickoff ABC will televise the game regionally Lets hope its a cloudy day because the sun will keep the stadium very hot unless some cloud cover is available If Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds and his party gave up their plush box and sat out in the stands with the regular folks for the Carolina game I dont think we would have many midday kickoffs in September in the future The AM game on Nov in College Station will be televised nationally by ABC at am too but that wont pose a heat problem in late November It will pose a problem on where the Longhorn teams stays the night before the game because I dont think Mack Brown will try College Station again after the problems last time around The Aggies wont have that problem in when they come to Austin for an am game because visiting teams can count on Austin hotels to protect them from harassment like annoying phone calls all night no pregame meal and all the other little annoying things that happend to the Horns in College Station last year ABC has worked out a deal with the Big to televise the TexasTexas AM and NebraskaColorado games for the next four years with Texas and AM getting the am kickoffs and Nebraska and Colorado getting the pm kickoffs for the first two years then switching times for the next two years Times for the remaining seven regular season games will be set later and most starting times wont be known until the television networks exercise their options days before each game Heres the complete schedule Sept New Mexico State pm Fox national TV Sept North Carolina am ABC

Horns Get Dutch Basketball Star Sydmill Harris a pound shooting guard for The Netherlands National Team has enrolled as a freshman at Texas and is eligible to play for the UT basketball team this year Harris averaged points in his first season with the national team after leading the Dutch Junior National Team in scoring for four seasons Longhorn players who have been working out with Harris report he lives up to his reputation as a super shooter with outstanding range Two top juniors who are being nationally recruited also are strongly considering Texas They are Brad Buckman a pound forward from Austin Westlake and Rashad Anderson a shooting guard from Lakeland Florida Buckman and Anderson have shot to the forefront of the top national juniors with outstanding play in AAU ball this summer Buckman averaged points and rebounds last season and Anderson averaged points a game T J Ford the great point guard prospect who is a freshman at Texas this year has been diagnosed with a chronic spinal condition stemming from abnormal openings in the spinal column that the spinal cord runs through Originally surgery was planned to correct it but team doctors and Ford and his family decided not to have surgery at this time He has played and starred with the condition for several years He has resumed working out I might have put the two shorties below in one of the earlier parts If so I apologize Stephens Makes National Team UT sophomore Stacy Stephens was one of top players aged andyounger who made the USA Basketball Womens Junior National Team Stephens a centerforward was

commitments since my June newsletter including two who have made one or more national top lists a third who is one of the nations top track stars and a fourth one who is big and fast Headlining the commitments are two players who are on one or more national top s this year and who were being recruited by top schools across the country The two who are top national recruits are TE David Thomas of Wolfforth Frenship and OL Neal Tweedie of Allen The top track man is MLB Brian Robison of Splendora one of the nations top shot and discus throwers and the one with the extra gear is LB Marcus Myers of Pflugerville Connally Thomas who caught passes from UT recruit Kendal Briles for yards and TDs last year chose the Horns over Oklahoma and Texas Tech He also had offers from Texas AM LSU Purdue Oklahoma State and Baylor He had attended camps at his big three Texas Oklahoma and Texas Tech before picking the Longhorns When I asked him what factors led him to choose Texas he said It has been a dream of mine since I was a little boy to play football for the University of Texas This is a dream come true for me He also is an outstanding linebacker and had tackles last yearHe is on Dave Campbells Texas Football Super Team as a linebacker But Texas and most of the other schools after him see him as a tight end He will make the tough catch across the middle and then do something with it He also is very sure handed and is a devastating blocker Hes also a fine student with a GPA on a point scale and a ACT score College coaches love to talk about offensive line prospects who have quick feet Tweedies feet are so quick that he is one of the best pass blockers I have seen in recent years and they also are so quick that he had scholarship offers when he committed to Texas in June Tweedie said he was planning to look around a lot before I did anything but Texas just kind of blew me away and I committed to coach Hardee McCrary and coach Mack Brown I didnt go to any camps he said but I went to Notre Dame and Texas AM and Texas to look around I had planned to go to Oklahoma too to take a look but Texas just really impressed me and I decided to go ahead and commit to Texas and get it all behind me Tweedie also is a very good student with a GPA on a scale and a SAT score Robison is one of the rare high school track performers who has thrown the shot more than feet and hurled the discus more than feet There are some foot shot putters every year and a few foot guys in the discus but there have only been a handful of guys in the last decade who have done both He broke the AAU national age group record with a discus throw in June at an AAU track meet in San Antonio and also has a shot put and a javelin throw He has qualified for the national AAU Junior Olympic finals in Virginia later this week in all three events Robison said he plans to compete in both sports at Texas He said he met Brown and several other UT coaches and players after competing in the State Track Meet in May Asked what caused him to pick Texas he said Coach Brown was just totally honest with me and answered all my questions without hesitation The players at Texas all told me hes a straight shooter Robison who plays middle linebacker at Splendora said the Texas coaches recruited him as a middle backer He had tackles sacks passes broken up fumble recoveries and a pass interception last season He also had offers from LSU and Houston and said coaches from Arkansas Penn State Oklahoma and Texas AM had told him they would offer if he would visit their schools Robison is a strong student with a GPA on a scale and a qualifying SAT score Myers committed to the Longhorns after getting an offer following a summer camp at Texas His parents are both Texas Tech graduates and his father Rufus was a running back for the Red Raiders in the late s Myers said he had offers from Iowa State TCU and Oklahoma State and he said Nebraska and Oklahoma coaches had told him he would get an offer if he came to their summer camps but he said he just wanted to play for Texas Connally coach Matt Monzingo said Myers is one of his fastest players despite his big frame But Monzingo also said Myers future is at linebacker because hes got a great nose for the ball Hes really good at sniffing out where the play is going and hes very aggressive With his size and speed hes got the whole package to be an outstanding linebacker Monzingo said Myers played inside linebacker in a fourbacker set last year and will play middle linebacker in a threelinebacker set this season Myers also is a fine student He has a on a scale ranks in the top of his class and scored a on the SAT last October The Longhorns still have commitments including six guys who have been on one or more national top lists They are Tweedie Thomas OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood and DTs Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi who was on all the top lists last year when he was a senior at Austin Lanier Earl Anderson of San Marcos and Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral The other commited players are QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar RBAthlete Clint Haney of Smithson Valley and WR Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood Super Longhorn LB signee Derrick Johnson of Waco ran an intercepted screen pass back yards for the only Texas touchdown and it was enough to lead his AllStar team to a victory over the California AllStars It was a sweet victory for the Texas AllStars who had lost the first six games in the series California DT Kaelen Jakes another Longhorn signee had a sack for the losers and he told me Mike Garcia the Galena Park offensive lineman who also signed with UT is by far the best offensive lineman Ive ever played against and I played against some guys in California who were supposed to be among the best in the country OL Will Allen of Cypress Falls another UT signee who played in the game told me he helped block Jakes and hes every bit as good as Shaun Cody Cody a heralded California DL who signed with USC also played in the game The stout Texas defense held California to minus yards rushing All of Texas signees except LB Yamil LeBron of Killeen Ellison have qualified LeBron will attend a junior college WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign Illinois made it to the state of Texas this weekend but he never made it to Austin He says he visited a friend in the Dallas area and wanted to get to Austin but never made it He said he definitely will take an official visit to Texas and is still strongly considering the Longhorns QBAthlete Paul Thompson of Leander picked Oklahoma over Texas Sunday primarily because he wants to play quarterback and the Sooners were recruiting him for that position while the Horns were recruiting him to play wide receiver FBLB Brandon Hancock of Clovis Cal told me he really enjoyed his unofficial visit to Texas but is sure hell sign with a California school Heres a quick look at the main players Texas is still recruiting QB Vincent Young Houston Madison RB Albert Hardy Galena Park TE Eric Winston Midland Lee WR Marquis Johnson Champaign Ill Robert Timmons Flower Mound Marcus Anthony Wright Klein Forest Damien Collins Dallas Bryan Adams and Biren Ealy Cypress Falls OL Justin Blaylock Plano East and Tony Ugoh Spring Westfield DE Travis Leitko The Woodlands Larry Dibbles Lancaster Dontriel Coates Anahuac Tully Janszen Keller Chase Pittman Shreveport

Arlington Lamar Glenn Jackson Carrollton Turner Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and Roman Taylor of Diboll DB Ricky Wilson Port Arthur Lincoln Donald Burgs Houston Madison Vickiel Vaughn Plano West Brodney Pool Houston Westbury and Matthew Melton Tyler Ath Edorian McCullough North Garland and DaBryan Blanton Forney The Horns obviously cant take all those receivers defensive linemen linebackers and defensive backs but they are recruiting the ones mentioned right now and hope to sign several of the top ones Stephens Makes National Team UT sophomore Stacy Stephens was one of top players aged andyounger who made the USA Basketball Womens Junior National Team Stephens a centerforward was one of the teams top rebounders and got boards in the final game in the Junior World Championships in the Czech Republic to help the USA team win the bronze medal with a record Slugger Commits to UT Brent Clevlen of Round Rock Westwood one of the states top junior baseball hitters has committed to play for Texas Clevlen who also is a fine quarterback in football hit and blasted home runs last season after hitting as a sophomore He also had offers from several other top baseball schools including Baylor Rice Texas AM Houston and Tulane

Faithful Volume No July Longhorns Enter Fall Football Workouts With Lofty Ranking but Several Problem Areas Coach Mack Brown speaking at the annual Big football coaches and media meeting in Dallas Friday cited three primary areas of concern heading into this season He also scoffed at preseason polls which have UT high in the top saying The only polls that matter are the ones at the end of the season Offensively he said We do not have a tailback who stepped out during the spring and showed he is ready to start On defense Brown said Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers were great players at defensive tackle last year Casey was a firstround draft choice and Shaun would have been if he had been healthy Replacing them is a real concern On special teams he cited the departure of Kris Stockton who handled all the kicking duties last season and said developing a good kicking game will be a key to having a succesfful season The freshmen report next Monday August and the varsity on August a full practice schedule is on page My view is that the first two problem areas he mentioned are minor ones compared to the placekicking woes In the spring the tailbacks looked solid if not spectacular and with super recruit Cedric Benson coming in to bolster that spot it shouldnt be a lingering problem At defensive tackle sophomore Marcus Tubbs started three games last season when Rogers sore ankle limited his availability and he played extensively in all games Tubbs had sacks and other tackles for losses and showed great promise for the future He and most of the other defensive tackles are smaller and quicker than Hampton and Rogers which should help the front four show a lot of improvement in pass rushing The tackles this year wont be as good against the run as Hampton and Rogers who were runstoppers deluxe but they will be pretty good at it and lets face it the best teams on the UT regularseason schedule are geared to passing So two of the three problem areas Brown cited probably can be handled without much difficulty But lets hope some of the walkon kickers the UT staff rounded up after the spring problems surfaced can kick field goals If they cant and if this team is as good as it has a chance to be Brown could find himself in the same boat as Florida State coach Bobby Bowden who lost a couple of national championships in the s because he didnt have guys who could make a chipshot field goal when the game was on the line I havent seen any of the walkon kickers in action so Ill report on them in depth in my next newsletter They are supposed to be pretty good and they will need to be Brown said the Longhorns will have more experience this year and that will help the team Weve had a lot of participation in the voluntary workouts this summer probably the most weve had he said There is more excitement and maturity on the team and thats always a positive When asked if he thinks there is a lot of pressure on him this year he said he wants a job where there is pressure because that means people want to win but he said some folks are chronic gripers My wife told me when we first got married years ago that if you look at the gripers that are negative people they probably griped about the meal they had for lunch they didnt like the last movie they saw and theyre mad at their wife before they get home So theyre just mad at me I dont worry about those folks I figure when youre selling season tickets and luxury suites and youve sold out straight at home somebodys happy Number Updated Daily I update my number nearly every day with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call My Big Picks I think this is the year the Big s Southern Division really becomes a dominant force So instead of picking the Southern and Northern Divisions Im going to pick the way I think the Big shapes up from top to bottom as a single entity Here goes Texas Texas AM Oklahoma Iowa State Nebraska Missouri Kansas State Oklahoma State Colorado Kansas Texas Tech Baylor Obviously the way I picked them means I think the winner of the TexasOklahoma showdown in Dallas on Oct will win the whole thing Big Coaches Give OU Edge The Big coaches picked Oklahoma to edge Texas in the South and Nebraska to nose out Kansas State in the North Since they picked Texas last year and the Sooners won the national title lets hope what goes around comes around The vote was really close in the South with the Sooners nipping the Horns with Texas coach Mack Brown abstaining Brown says he isnt going to get caught up in preseason hype this year because it doesnt make sense to try to predict how a team will do when it hasnt even started practicing The media picked a preseason AllBig Team and it included four Longhorns on the first team They are senior OT Mike Williams sophomore WR Roy Williams junior DE Cory Redding and senior CB Quentin Jammer Nebraska QB Eric Crouch was chosen the top preseason offensive player and Oklahoma LB Rocky Calmus won the defensive honors McClintock Undergoes Surgery DE O J McClintock was released from the hospital Saturday after undergoing emergency surgery Friday to repair what UT trainer Tom McVan said was significant damage to muscles and tendons in his right arm McClintock a pound junior said Sunday he suffered some pretty deep cuts when a relative stumbled and he rammed his hand and arm through a window trying to grab the relative and keep him from falling Ive got to do some rehabilitation for my hand he said Sunday The doctors told me I could start working out again in three or four weeks and if I miss any games it shouldnt be more than the first one or two The Longhorns were already thin at defensive end and they could be critically short if McClintock is out for a significant period of time Its very unfortunate that O J was injured said head coach Mack Brown He did a tremendous job making the transition to defensive end from linebacker in the spring and is a guy we have high hopes for this season If McClintocks injury is serious enough to cause him to miss part of the season it will leave Texas with only senior Jermain Anderson and incoming freshman Lance McFarland to back up starters Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding Another DE Adam McConathy was granted a release to transfer earlier He said he wanted to go to a school where he has a better chance to log some playing time If the injury does cost McClintock significant playing time the coaches will make some moves to provide more depth Incoming freshman Eric Hall who had been ticketed forfullback would be a good candidate for a switch to defensive end Mack Brown Notes Quotes Coach Mack Brown speaking at the Big coaches meeting in Dallas Friday said the Longhorns can be really really good but weve got to do a better job day to day and week to week We had three games we let get away last year Our goal is always to win every game we play He also said the coaches and players are proud that our team is being looked at as one of the best in the country in the preseason but then he said preseason rankings mean absolutely nothing We have to go out and take care of business He also downplayed expectations for heralded running back recruit Cedric Benson saying Were not sure if freshmen will be involved in major roles as early as they have Hopefully he said we can let a freshman grow into it instead of just throwing him out there But he also said the coaches plan to play the best players at each position If Benson lives up to all the hype and if none of the other tailbacks emerge quickly I think hell play and play a lot early in the season Dollars and More Dollars Texas and Nebraska far outdistance the other teams in the Big when it comes to raising and spending money The Collegiate Financial Service of Madison Wis compiles budget total every year and here are the most recent ones for all conference members Texas Nebraska Oklahoma Colorado Texas AM

<28483949.1075848301703.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2001-05-14 05:07:00,True Orange May Part of Parts Big Recruiting Push Will Start at June Summer Camps The Longhorns are being very selective in making offers to recruits so far this spring but that will change next month when they host some of the top blue chippers at their summer camps The Aggies have two commitments to the Longhorns one pledge from my man differencemaker list on page but that will all change in June Coach Mack Brown is the one who invented early recruiting in Texas and he did it through his June camps That hasnt changed The only thing that has changed is that the Aggies went out in March and April and gave offers to about kids Theres nothing wrong with that and I am not knocking their strategy But Browns strategy works and there is no reason for him to change it If you look at the last three February signing days youll know why he doesnt need to change it Meanwhile the Horns got one offensive lineman they wanted when they got a pledge from terrific run blocker Bret Valdez of Brownwood The Aggies got commitments last week from center Bob Morton of McKinney the guy I have rated as the best offensive lineman in the state and LTydrick Riley of Crockett the top recruit in the state in the athlete category Texas probably would have offered Riley a scholarship at some point if he had not committed to AM but the Longhorn coaches did not recruit Morton as hard as they are recruiting several other offensive linemen in the state I think when the dust settles in February the Longhorns will have another great class signed and ready for delivery They got commitments last June en route to a national top five recruiting class and they probably will have close to that number at the end of June this year Most of those commitments last June were from big offensive linemen who were just what the Longhorns needed Several of them this June could be from big defensive linemen and thats where the Longhorns need to load up this season DT Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Arizona younger brother of current UT LB Austin Sendlein and son of former UT and pro LB Robin Sendlein told me he probably will commit to Texas when he attends the Longhorns early June camp He is the top recruit in Arizona and is being heavily recruited by top schools all over the country DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos also plans to attend a UT camp next month and he is another possibility for an early commitment In a year when the state is loaded with top defensive line prospect he is a star among stars The best DT of them all however is Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings He probably wont commit early but he likes the Longhorns Wright is a pounder with outstanding quickness and he does the best job of staying low and collapsing the line of scrimmage of anyone I have seen in the nation If Texas can sign Wright Anderson Sendlein and Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo they will be set at defensive tackle and they have the inside track with all four of them Studdard is the son of former UT and Denver Bronco offensive line star David Studdard Anderson like Keller DT Tully Janszen is a super quick starter who could play end or tackle in college At DE the top guy in Texas is Travis Leitko of The Woodlands He is a super student who is pretty wide open but he likes the Longhorns and he also is friends with redshirt freshman QB Chance Mock and incoming freshman WRDB Brian Carter two Longhorns who are former Woodlands stars Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel brother of Cole Pittman who was expected to contend for a starting job at DT with Texas this year before being killed in a tragic auto accident also is an outstanding DE prospect who is like Leitko very quick and very physical He is strongly considering Texas The coaches also want a super quick DE and their best hope in Texas might be Nick Owino of Alief Elsik They also are trying to get in on Zack Latimer who led Colorado in sacks last year with at Aurora Gateway But Latimer is AllState in both football and basketball and could opt for the latter in college Owino and Latimer are the kind of outside speed rushing defensive ends the Longhorn coaches have been seeking since they arrived at Texas The two fastest junior football players in the state are also two of the best ones And thats no coincidence because you cant tackle something you cant catch RB DaBryan Blanton of Forney broke the sprint records in Class A with a smoking in the meters and a in the meters Not since the days of Roy Martin a quarter century ago have I seen a high school sprinter run a meters like that The times at the state meet are all fully automatic which makes them officially seconds slower than hand times In the old handtimed days he would have had a He also anchored Forneys meter relay team to victory in Blanton is an outstanding running back but he probably will be a wide receiver or defensive back in college He is pretty wide open on his college choices but he is considering Texas CB Edorian McCullough of North Garland won thge A in finished second in the in flat and anchored his teams meter relay team to second place making up a lot of ground to pull from fourth to second McCullough was undefeated in the meters this year He is a top RBCB prospect who favors Texas over Oklahoma The talent level in Texas this year is very high About Texas players have been listed on one or more national groupings and there are some other outstanding players who are equally talented but who are not as well known yet One interesting factor this year is geography In most year the Houston area has most of the really elite prospects Houston is very strong at the top again with the top two and three of the top five players on my differencemaker list on page But the DallasFort Worth area runs deeper in talent this year than the HoustonGulf Coast area with a edge on my list of the top The other nine players on the list include four from East Texas three from West Texas and two from the Austin area The talent runs very deep at defensive tackle and defensive end this year for the first time since Brown and his staff arrived in Austin There also are some big linebackers like Glenn Jackson of Carrollton Turner who are bigframed guys who already weigh and might grow into pound defensive ends in college Jackson runs a and is an outstanding pass rusher from the corner There also is a lot of talent at quarterback and if a school misses on a top signal caller in this recruiting class there are a pair of kids who will be juniors this season who already have college recruiters salivating They are James Battle who ran Recruiting continued from page and passed a Denton Ryan team that was in deep into the Class A playoffs last year and Devon Williams of Arlington Houston a quickfooted runner with a powerful arm Both will be top national recruits next year The Longhorns also want to sign a great running back every year and while the class of running backs doesnt run very deep Albert Hardy of Galena Park is a power runner deluxe with fine speed and he likes the Longhorns There are some very good wide receivers in Texas this year but the best one I have seen on tape is Marquis Johnson of Champaign Ill If he played in Texas he would be high in my top and would be easily the No wide receiver He likes the Longhorns and super UT recruiter Tim Brewster was in Champaign last week to visit his high school He only lives three blocks from the Illinois campus so lets hope he has a yen to travel He is a big physical receiver who has speed moves and great hands There is one receiver in Texas I havent seen play but I have heard good things about him and I saw him run a fine leg on Klein Forests thirdplace meter relay team at the state meet He is Anthony Wright another big guy with speed who has a reputation for being physical I plan to see him play in early September and might move him up on the list after that Texas needs to sign a tight end too and it will be an uphill fight to land Eric Winston of Midland Lee who is easily the top one in the state He comes from an Aggie family but says he will consider Texas too Horns rd in Baseball Play Ags Texas wound up third in the Big baseball race and will play No seed Texas AM Wednesday at am in Oklahoma City in the first round of the conference tournament Texas finished in the Big and overall The Aggies were in conference play and overall The Longhorns beat the Aggies twice in Austin and lost to them once in College Station during the regular season The winner of the UTAM game will play the winner of a game between No Texas Tech and No Oklahoma at pm Thursday in a game that will be televised by College Sports Southwest The loser of the UTAM will play the loser of the TechOU game at am Thursday in an elimination game The thirdplace finish was the Longhorns highest placing in the five years of the Big s existence Junior outfielder

Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No August Horns Happy About No PreSeason Ranking But Coaches Players Say They Have to Earn It Coach Mack Brown and the Longhorn players are happy about their No ranking in The Associated Press preseason poll because they say it shows respect for the program But they also say it means nothing unless they prove they deserve it We can embrace the preseason predictions because they show respect for the University of Texas Brown said Saturday following the first fullteam practice but starting today Ive got to do a better job of putting it behind us Its really a beauty contest he said Its a farce that sells papers and hypes the season but it means absolutely nothing Whats important is todays practice and tonights practice and whats important tomorrow will be tomorrows practice Weve got to take care of our business on the field every day History certainly supports Browns feeling The Longhorns havent finished in the top since but theyve been there in the preseason several times And while it is painful to recall Oklahoma was ranked No in the preseason poll a year ago well below Nebraska Kansas State and Texas and we all know the Sooners went beat all three of those teams handily and won the national title This preseason poll had Florida No Miami No OU No Nebraska No and Texas No Brown said it was nice to have three big teams in the top because it shows respect for our conference but he also said it will be very difficult for us to have three teams in the top five when the season ends Thats definitely true because Oklahoma plays Nebraska and Texas and whoever wins the South title will have to play Nebraska or whoever whip the Huskers in the Big s Northern Division The good news for the Longhorns is that Oklahoma is the only preseason team in the top on the regular season schedule That is countered by a double dose of bad news First the AP writers and the Big coaches ranked the Sooners over the Longhorns and they are pretty familiar with both teams Second if the Longhorns beat the Sooners they will have two killer postseason games one against a powerful and probably undefeated team from the Northern Division and if they win that one a Rose Bowl date against someone like Florida or Miami for the national title But the Horns best chance to get there is to take it one step at a time and the coaches and players are saying thats what they are going to do Its one thing for people to pick us but its up to us to do it on the field said senior LB DeAndre Lewis We control our destiny and we have to work hard and take care of business daytoday and gametogame If we work hard every day and show up ready to play hard every game the other stuff will take care of itself Junior QB Chris Simms echoed those sentiments saying This team is more experienced now We know we have to do it on the field and the stuff in the papers and in the polls wont mean anything unless we do it on the field For those of you who want to know how the Longhorns are rated in everyones preseason articles I havent seen all of them but I have seen the major ones and Texas is ranked No by the Sporting News No by Lindys and ESPN No by Sports Illustrated No by the AP No by USA TodayESPN the coaches poll and Street Smith No by Football Diges and No by Athlon And like Mack Brown Ill tell you it means absolutely nothing Last year is proof of that Some people also say Texas schedule will keep the Horns out of the national title game even if they win all their games because it doesnt include enough tough teams That talk means nothing too Any team that wins a Big division title then wins the league championship game and is undefeated will be in the Rose Bowl on Jan Now that weve covered the whatifs lets look at what is happening with the Longhorns as they begin preparations to live up to those lofty preseason rankings The highly ranked freshman class had four workouts last week before the first full team workouts started Saturday The freshmen werent in full pads but it was clear from watching the limited contact that was allowed that DT Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal DE Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn LB Derrick Johnson of Waco RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee and several of the great group of offensive line recruits are as big and fast and talented as advertised Players cant really dominate until they don full pads which will happen Wednesday but Benson while working with the freshmen Tuesday and Wednesday and then with the full team Saturday and Sunday simply explodes after taking a handoff High school coaches and players who faced him always said he had great speed and power and moves but they said the one thing that set him apart from other great backs was the way he accelerated into the hole He hasnt lost any of that acceleration and even without getting an opportunity to work in pads he was running with the third team in practice Saturday and Sunday behind junior Victor Ike and sophomore Brett Robin Ike worked very hard during the off season and is sporting more muscles than ever before He doesnt seem to have lost any of his great speed Lets look at the team on a positionbyposition basis based on the limited practices so far OFFENSE Quarterback Simms is clearly No There is no quarterback controversy like there was last season when Simms lacked experience and Major Applewhite wasnt fully recovered from knee surgery Applewhite underwent surgery on his other knee last season and the severe knee injuries have eroded some of his once lethal talents He is No Redshirt freshman Chance Mock is big and fast and has a strong arm and the coaches will make sure he plays this season Freshman Matt Nordgren is very big has good speed and a strong arm and he will redshirt unless disaster strikes The Sporting News not only picked UT to win the national crown it picked Simms to win the Heisman Trophy He threw more interceptions than touchdowns last season and he has to get better at looking off receivers or hell have more interception problems this season In the three practices he had Saturday and Sunday he still seemed to home in on his intended receiver very early His progress in that problem area in my opinion will determine whether Texas can compete for conference and national honors Running Back Ikes main asset is blinding speed and the coaches want him to show more consistent power Robins main asset is his steadiness He runs every play perfectly and gives great effort Will Ikes speed and Robins dependability hold off Benson I doubt it We wont know for sure until the team starts some serious contact but unless he gets hurt Benson will play a lot in the Sept opener against New Mexico State and I think he will be either be starting or splitting time with the starter before midseason Junior Kenny Hayter and sophomore Ivan Williams also are in contention but Brown said Sunday they both need to cut down on fumbling to have a chance to play Fullback Junior Matt Trissel is the returning starter but redshirt freshman Will Matthews is bigger and faster and will push him for the top job Junior Chad Stevens is a good blocker and receiver and also will play particularly on passing downs Wide Receiver Sophomores Roy Williams and B J Johnson starred last season as true freshmen and will be even better this year if they stay healthy Sophomore Sloan Thomas also looked very good as a true freshman Junior walkon Kyle Shanahan suffered a cut in his leg jumping over a fence but should be back in time for the first game He is an outstanding receiver Senior Montrell Flowers also will play a lot Redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery also will get some playing time All of them are dangerous This position is loaded Tight End Sophomore Bo Scaife has remarkable speed and receiving skills for a tight end and he appears to be completely recovered from knee surgery Sophomore Brock Edwards is much bigger and also has very good speed He started some games as a true freshman last year Senior Mike Jones is the best blocker of the group and is sure handed but he lacks the speed of Scaife and Edwards Left Tackle Junior Robbie Doane held the job throughout the spring but is getting a big challenge from JC transfer Alfio Randall Left Guard Junior Derrick Dockery and sophomore Tillman Holloway both started at times last year and both are very talented The Horns usually dont substitute much in the offensive line but coach Brown says both Dockery and Holloway will play a lot Center Senior Matt Anderson is the returning started and clear No center Junior Beau Baker is working at center and guard and redshirt freshman Jason Glenn is a talented newcomer who will push for playing time Right Guard Senior Antwan KirkHughes is one of the top offensive linemen around when his shoulder is healthy and Brown says it appears to be sound and ready for the season The loser of the DockeryHolloway battle at left guard probably will be the backup at both guard slots Right Tackle Senior Mike Williams is the returning starter and one of the top tackles in the country He will be backed by talented redshirt freshman Lionel Garr DEFENSE Left End Junior Cory Redding led the team in sacks last season with and is bigger and stronger this year Junior O J McClintock was his backup but he suffered severe cuts to his right hand and arm in a household accident and the coaches are trying linebackers Reed Boyd and Marcus Wilkins at end until he recovers Brown said McClintock probably will miss the first three or four games Left Tackle Sophomores Adam Doiron and redshirt freshman Stevie Lee are battling for the starting job Both have talent and both played well last year as true freshmen Lee got a medical hardship because he broke a bone in his foot in the second game so he is again a freshman Right Tackle Sophomore Marcus Tubbs played well last year standing in for injured senior star Shaun Rogers and he has been looking great in the early oneonone drills Maurice Gordon an end last year was a great pass rusher in the spring after moving inside and looks like he is ready to be a primetime player particularly against passing teams Right End Sophomore Kalen Thornton started the final nine games last year as a true freshman and looks like he is ready to emerge as one of the top ends in the Big He was a freshman AllAmerican last year Senior Jermian Anderson is his backup and is a good pass rusher Strongside Linebacker Senior Lee Jackson a former starting strong safety is the starter and is a sure tackler with the speed to blitz or cover tight ends or backs on pass plays He is backed by former starter Tyrone Jones another senior Middle Linebacker Senior DeAndre Lewis is a big fast linebacker who has been a starter since his redshirt freshman year He is backed by redshirt freshman Austin Sendlein a tough run stopper Weakside Linebacker Senior Everick Rawls has started since his sophomore year He is a good run stopper withe speed to blitz and help on pass coverage With Boyd and Wilkins helping at end speedy true freshman Derrick Johnson will have an opportunity to earn playing time Left Cornerback Senior Quentin Jammer is rated by the pro scouts as the nations top cornerback prospect He is big and fast and true to his name is very good at jamming receivers at the line of scrimmage Senior Ervis Hill is a fine backup Right Cornerback Junior Roderick Babers started last year and is a strong cover corner with excellent speed Sophomore Nathan Vasher who also is contending for a starting safety job is his backup Strong Safety Vasher and fellow sophomore Dakarai Pearson are battle for the starting job Both are very talented Free Safety Again it is Vasher competing with senior Ahmad Brooks for the starting job Both are former cornerbacks with good speed and coverage skills SPECIAL TEAMS Punter Junior college transfer Brian Bradford is running ahead of redshirt freshman Justin Smith Both kick for good distance and get good hang time but Bradfor has been more consistent Placekicker Two freshmen walkons David Pino of Wichita Falls Rider and Dusty Mangum of Mesquite have both been impressive in the first week of drills Both have been accurate consistently up to yards and both have had some success at longer distances Pino had scholarship offers from Nebraska and Tennessee and actually committed to the Cornhuskers at one point before deciding to walk on at Texas If one of the walkon freshmen can solidify this position it will really help the teams chances in close games SUMMARY The Longhorn receiving corps including the tight ends is unequalled in the country in terms of quality and quantity The defensive backfield is very good and will be one of the nations best At quarterback and in the defensive line the Longhorns are very talented The offensive line is a strong passblocking unit and is working on getting better at run blocking The linebackers as a group are solid The question marks are at running back and place kicker and talented freshmen could answer both those needs This should be Mack Browns best team at Texas Number Updated Daily I update my number every day with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call

after getting a pledge from DT Tully Janszen of Keller on August He picked Texas over Oklahoma He had considered only Texas OU and AM and had offers from all three The Longhorns who have had three straight top five national recruiting classes are on track to make it four in a row They already have pledges from six recruits who have been on one or more national top lists including three other DT prospects Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier Earl Anderson of San Marcos and Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral the twotime defending Arizona state champion The other UT commitments who have been on some top national lists are OLs Brett Valdez of Brownwood and Neale Tweedie of Allen and TE David Thomas of Wolfford Frenship a complete list of all the Longhorn pledges is on page Janszen said the Longhorn coaches told him they want him to play DT and he said they told him they like his quickness and aggressiveness He said when he called Texas head coach Mack Brown to tell him he wanted to play for the Longhorns He seemed real happy to hear from me While Brown cant talk about specific recruits until they sign he has said he wants defensive linemen who can really run because of all the spread offenses that are the vogue in the Big Janszen has great explosion at the line of scrimmage and is very fast for a DT He said he picked Texas because I liked the way I was treated by the coaches and players They are like a big family After informally visiting all three of his finalists he said UT was an easy choice The players and coaches are so much friendlier than at other places I really felt at home there He alo said his sister lives at New Braunfels which is between Austin and San Antonio Her husband is a coach at Converse Judson he said It will be good to have family that close Janszen said he had sacks and about other tackles for losses last year He has a GPA on a scale and has a ACT score which is well above the qualifying score When I quoted Marquis Johnsons mother in my last issue as saying he made it to Texas but never got to Austin it turns out she didnt know the whole story Johnson a national top receiver from Champaign Ill visited with a friend in the Dallas area and told me they drove to Austin one weekend and looked around but said his mother didnt know that when I talked to her The coaches didnt know I was coming that day and they werent around he said but we looked around a lot and I really liked what I saw Austin is a nice town and Ive always been a fan of the University of Texas football team Johnson told me he is very close to committing to Texas and probably will take his official visit the August weekend and see the Horns September opener against New Mexico State He said there is a good chance he will commit during his visit Outofstate recruits can take official visits during football season Texas recruits have to wait until their seasons are over or under UIL rules they would lose their eligibility to finish their high school football season Johnson is a great prospect because he is big and fast and doesnt mind making the tough catch in traffic He also has great hands and seldom misses a catchable ball I like to make the catch and get out of trouble as quick as I can he said but I dont mind taking a hit too Its a challenge to hang on to the ball when someone is hitting on you There are three bigtime recruits I think the Longhorns are almost certain to sign They are Johnson DT Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo and DT Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings Wright is the top defensive tackle prospect in the country and the best player in Texas Studdard is one of the top players in Colorado and Johnson is one of the top recruits in Illinois Texas also leads with several other top players including LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and DT Marco Martin of Mesquite Harris is the states top inside linebacker DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel the younger brother of Cole Pittman the sophomore DT at UT who was tragically killed in an automobile accident in February has narrowed his choices to Texas and LSU The Longhorns have dedicated their second game against North Carolina to Cole Pittman and the Pittman family will be in attendance I expect Chase Pittman to announce his college choice very quicly after that Pittman and another nationally recruited DE Bryan Pickryl of Jenks Okla both plan to graduate in December and enroll in college in January so they can go through spring training Pickryl hasnt narrowed his choices to two teams but he has a big three of UCLA Texas and Missouri and the Longhorns are at least tied with UCLA for the lead at this point Oklahoma cant be counted out but he took an unofficial visit to OU about days ago and came home saying the Sooners still hadnt moved into his top three His grandmother and two uncles live in Austin but his father graduated from UCLA Hes also an excellent student who wants to go to a very good academic school which probably is a major reason Texas UCLA and Missouri rank ahead of OU My list of the top players in Texas includes three players No DT Earl Anderson No LB Brian Robison and No OL Brett Valdez who are already committed to Texas The Longhorns also are in strong contention for No DT Wright No DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands No RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park No DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster No Ath Edorian McCullough of North Garland No LB Harris No LB Garnett Smith of Arlington Lamar No OL Justin Blalock of Plano East No DT Martin No CB Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln No DE Dontriel Coates of Anahuac and No Ath DaBryan Blanton of Carrollton Turner Wright and Hardy both attended UT practices last week There are some other guys in my top who are interested in UT including No QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison and No WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus but Young seems to be leaning toward going out of state and Timmons drew a threegame suspension from his coach last week for unidentified transgressions There are some other great players in the group who have serious academic deficiencies FBLB Brandon Hancock of Clovis Cal has committed to USC As I noted in my last newsletter he said he enjoyed his unofficial visit to Texas but was almost certain he would sign with a California school A national top prospect in California who has expressed some interest in Texas is QB Trent Edwards of Los Gatos who completed an incredible of his passes last year for yards and TDs Stanford leads however Texas Early Commitments These are the recruits who already have committed to Texas OL Brett Valdez Brownwood DT Sonny Davis Austin Lanier and Gulf Coast Miss JC DT Earl Anderson San Marcos DT Lyle Sendlein Scottsdale Chaparral Ath Clint Haney Smithson Valley QB Billy Don Malone Paris North Lamar WR Dustin Miksch Round Rock Westwood TE David Thomas Wolfforth Frenship LB Marcus Myers Pflugerville Connally OL Neale Tweedie Allen LB Brian Robison Splendora DT Tully Jantzen Keller Robison was named the outstanding male performer at the AAU Junior Olympics in Norfolk Va He broke his own national AAU Junior Olympic record by winning the discus with a throw and was second in the shot and sixth in the javelin FUTURE RECRUITING NOTE John David Booty will be the starting QB in the Shreveport Evangels famed passing offense this year and as a sophomore hes already being featured in national sports magazines and compared favorably with past Evangel QBs like Brock Berlin He has been a visitor at Longhorn practices and mentions Texas as one of his favorite schools I know he wont be a senior for a long time but write his name in your futures book if you have one because hell be the top recruit in the country in two years unless he gets hurt He already has a powerful arm quick release great accuracy and real speed for a QB and was the top signal caller at the Nike camp in Baton Rouge Longhorn Notes Although the team isnt in full pads yet the oneonone drills between offensive and defensive linemen get pretty fierce at times DT Marcus Tubbs DE Kalen Thornton and DT Maurice Gordon have been very impressive getting around and through the blockers and OTs Mike Williams and Alfio Randall have been the best at keeping the rushers at bay in the drills Ive watched The Longhorn defense is going to be less predictable this season The team has been working on zone blitzes and other innovative schemes and even has defensive ends dropping off into pass coverage at times We want to disguise what we are doing and try to confuse the quarterback and make him hold on to the ball longer which gives us a better chance to get to him said head coach Mack Brown Senior WR Montrell Flowers has been one of the stars of the early practices He got behind the secondary and caught two long touchdown passes from QB Chris Simms in the Saturday and Sunday workouts The early battles between the receivers and the secondary have been exciting to watch Brown says TE Bo Scaife appears to be completely recovered from his knee surgeries Bos a valuable part of this football teamm when he is healthy he said and hes looking great Hes in the best shape hes been in and he knows hes well now He can help us a lot this season

both ranked among the nations elite players at their positions Good national basketball ratings are hard to find but Student Sports Magazine recently came out with a ranking of the top players at each position for a national top overall Point guard T J Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge ranked No at his position and center Chris Wright of Redwater ranked No among the b ig guys in the middle Most rating services had Ford much higher but it is a great tribute to Wrights potential that he made the list of the top centers because he missed almost all of his senior year with a torn ACL that required surgery Fords Willowridge team also was ranked No in the nation by Student Sports and the Eagles were the topranked public school team Mouth of Wilson Va which gives scholarships and recruits all over the nation was ranked No but the Warriors are an allstar team with player s from several states and countries Ford also made the magazines man first team senior AllAmerican list which was surprising since he was rated only No in the pointguard category I suppose they have two gurus with different views of the point guards I g o along with the one who rated Ford as one of the top two point guards becaus e every other rating service I saw had him as one of the top two or three poi nt guards in the nation Evans Testing Pro Waters Junior Longhorns swingman Maurice Evans has declared himself eligible for June NBA draft Evans who led the Horns in scoring last year with a average has not hired an agent and can return to Texas for his senior season if he doesnt elect to turn pro While Evans is a fine college player he lacks great dribbling skills at th is point and probably wont be drafted He could benefit from another year und er coach Rick Barnes tutelage Horns Recruiting Top JC Guard The Longhorns are in the running for a top junior college combo guard Terrell Ross a point guard with fine shooting skills at Allegany JC i n Meadville Md visited UT three weeks ago and has narrowed his picks to Texas Mississippi State and Michigan State Tuesday is the deadline for signing letters of intent in basketball so he will sign with someone right away or his recruiting will drag on until he shows up on a college campus to start classes He led Allegany to a record and the National JC championship game He averaged only points a game for a loaded team that features four oth er Division I

Horns Snare Early Commitments Several Other Top Prospects Leaning UTs Way Coach Mack Brown and his staff have signed the best recruiting class in the Big the last two years and they are well on their way to making it three in a row The Longhorns have early commitments including two national top prospects and a junior college star who was a national top prospect two years ago And all three of those headliners are offensive linemen which is an area where the Longhorns needed to strike it rich this time around after signing only three of the big guys in their last class which was loaded with skill position players The national top prepsters are Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter and Abe Robinson of Jersey Village The JC star is Alfio Randall of Blinn JC Randall was one of the nations top prospects at Houston Yates an d signed with Texas in February of before failing to qualify academicall y and heading to Blinn Randall who says he will graduate in December plans to enroll at Texas ne xt January For a team that listed the offensive line as its greatest need heading into this recruiting season that trio is a great way to start But the Longhorns also have pledges from three other offensive linemen who were highly recruited including one from Mike Garcia of Galena Park who h ad committed to Texas AM and was the Aggies prize early pledge before visiti ng UT and deciding to switch to the Horns The other two offensive line recruits are Roman Reeves of Livingston and Wi ll Allen of Cypress Falls The offensive line class of recruits in Texas this year is the best I have seen since I started doing this years ago There are at least offensi ve linemen who are top notch and all five of the UT pledges come from that group The other recruits who have committed to the Longhorns are middle linebacke r Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison safety Kendal Briles of Frenship and defensive backs Brian Carter of The Woodlands and Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity Heres a little information on each of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter has more than scholarship offers and more are coming in all the time despite the fact that he was th e Longhorns first commitment back on June at Texas first summer camp He has the great first step that makes all the difference in trying to cut off an outside speed rusher He is on all the national top lists and is as good an offensive tackle prospect as there is in the country Abe Robinson Jersey Village is a tight end who projects as an offensive lineman in college He is one of the states top prospects and is on most of the national top lists Robinson is a power blocker with quick feet He had offers from other schools including Florida State when he committed to Texas on June Alfio Randall Blinn JC was one of the first players to commit to Texas in and has never wavered He says he will graduate fro m Blinn in December and enroll at UT in January so he can go through spring practice next year He was the states top offensive line prospect at Houst on Yates his senior year because of his quick feet and punishing blocking styl e Mike Garcia Galena Park was an early AM commitment before he and his mother took an unofficial trip to Austin He is as aggressive as any offensive line prospect in Texas A nice guy off the field he holds blocks and punishes defenders He specializes in the pancake block Will Allen Cypress Falls was the Longhorns second commitment Like Scott he committed after the first full summer camp at UT A threeyear starter at Cy Falls he is a very physical player who has the quickness and strength to play guard or tackle Roman Reeves Livingston is as impressive a physical specim en as any of the UT recruits He has the ability to dominate his opponents and the quickness to head them off Linebacker Yamil LeBron Killeen Ellison apparently was the middle linebacker UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese wanted all along He said Reese told him at the Longhorns summer camp that he liked his size speed and ferocity and wanted him to play middle linebacker He is a tough run stopper who also has the speed to cover backs on pass plays Defensive Back Kendal Briles Wolfforth Frenship was the Class A offensi ve player of the year last season after leading Stephenville to the state championship Playing QB he completed of passes for yards an d TDs and ran for yards and more scores That adds up to yards and touchdowns Nebraska wanted him as an option QB but he opted for a career as a safety at Texas His father Art Briles was his coach at Stephenville and now is on the coaching staff at Texas Tech Braden Johnson Euless Trinity is a talented athlete who wi ll move to QB for the Trojans this year after making AllDistrict as a hardhitting safety last year He is a centerfielder in baseball and runs o n the schools meter relay team He has a big frame and could be a candidate to become an outside linebacker in the future Brian Carter The Woodlands was a twoway star last season catching passes for yards and four TDs then switching over to defen se and intercepting three passes He was one of UT freshman QB Chance Mocks t op targets at The Woodlands last season All of the recruits who have committed to Texas except Randall and Garcia came to one of the UT summer camps RECRUITING NOTES The states top QB prospect Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bish op Lynch was in Austin today Monday visiting with UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis His family owns a ranch near Blanco and Nordgren really likes t he Horns The only other top QB prospect who is strongly considering Texas is Bret Rawls of Shreveport Evangel but the Horns only plan to take one QB an d Rawls is such a good baseball prospect that it would be risky making him th e only QB recruit One big plus is that Nordgren wants to commit early He ha s been to several camps alread including one at Texas and wants to visit several more before making a decision But if he does commit early and does commit to Texas the Longhorns can forget about recruiting QBs If he commi ts early to someone else then it will be on Plan B whether that is Rawls or a sleeper like Tye Gunn of La Grange a strongarmed kid who is big and fast and only gets to throw five or six times a game for the runoriented Leopards The Longhorns probably will sign about to recruits Wit h six offensive linemen three defensive backs and one linebacker already committed the remainder probably will go to one QB one or two RBs zero o r one FB zero or one TE one or two WRs one or two more OLs three or four DLs one or two LBs and two or three DBs At RB recordsetting Cedric Benson of twotime state champ Midland Lee plans to take an unofficial visi t to Texas in late July or early August He is a longtime Longhorn fan who says he might commit on his visit The most important report left on th e board is DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison Why There are two reasons First he is a great prospect probably as good a defensive line recruit as there is in the country Second he is the only great DT prospect who is strongly considering Texas and the Horns need to sign a top DT or two Thom as Derricks of Dallas Jesuit is a good DT but he has no interest in Texas After that the list includes several promising young DTs who need to have big senior years to become top prospects Texas is chasing two Louisiana stars Marcus Spears of Baton Rouge Southern Lab and Marquise Hill of N ew Orleans De La Salle but they have not show any major interest so far The UT coaches want to sign two DEs and two DTs but they might opt for three D Es because there are more top DEs The top prospects remaining who I think are at least shots to sign with Texas are Nordgren Benson Harris O L Jami Hightower of Jacksonville DEs Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson and Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn LBDE Lance McFarland of Jefferson LB Derrick Johnson of Waco CB Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple

news The number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Defensive coordinator Carl Reese is always a great interview because a he is an expert at his craft and b he is good at putting complex defensive schemes in terms we can all understand I interviewed him recently about his defense and his expectations for the season With most of the guys returning from a defense that was one o f the nations best in he is upbeat but he wants and expects to see major improvements in several areas Here are the highlights of our conversation Q Coach you lost both your defensive ends At the end of the spring you seemed pretty happy about the way Cory Redding was playing but you said yo u thought the guys on the other side were a lot better pass rushers than run stoppers The way the schedule shapes up it looks like most of the teams Texas plays are better passing teams than running teams so do you think it could be an advantage to have a better pass rush even if one side isnt as strong against the run A We were looking at the schedule the other day and it looks like about half the teams we play next fall are going to be four wideouts who throw t he ball a bunchAnd our ends can come of the edge better than they have That could help us against some teams like Stanford Oklahoma and Texas Tech three teams that are going to let it go pass a lot from the beginning Bu t I worry about that cottonpicking run because I dont want to let teams be twodimensional I like to start with any defense by being stroing agains t the run Q You have already had some outstanding defenses at Texas Do you think this years defense will be your best one at Texas A From a talent standpoint it could be The secondary has more depth tha n its had Of course the guys still have to come through We have got to get a great year out of Quentin Jammer at cornerback but going into the season we have the deepest secondary weve had Were a little thin at linebacker but we know what we have there and they can all run We know what we have a t tackle with Casey Hampton and Shawn Rogers and weve got some backups The glaring weakness is at end particularly against the run We want to ha ve the complete package at end guys who can stop the run and rush the pas ser Cory Redding still had to work on the run some but as far as giving an allout effort he does and hell improve as he gets some more experience He is our best end against the run but we want him to get better We need some of the other guys to step up on the other side and maybe one or two o f them will If they do this could be a pretty good defense Q Stevie Lee really looked good at tackle this spring in my opinions particularly considering the fact that he was playing high school football last fall then graduated early and enrolled in January What do you think about him and his chances of helping you this fall A I think Stevie Lee is going to be a real football player And youre right he should have been walking the halls of his high school in the spring What I really like about him is that we would work him against the firstteam offense and some of those firstteam offensive linemen would knock him back But the next play he would come right back He learns fast and he competes hard We play to play him quite a bit From what he and redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs showed this spring they will be the backu ps to Casey and Shawn at the start of fall practice We have some other player s who could move up too and there will be some competition because the guys who are the top backups this year will have the best chance to take it over the next season when Casey and Shawn are gone Q What do you think is the key to having a better defense this year A The secondary will be the key They have the best chance to step up Thats the key overall They improved last year and played good at times but we still didnt have a great defense because we gave up big plays too often to be a great defense Were going to stress this year that we cant give up big plays because you cant be a great defense if you do that Q What is you definition of a big play A Any pass over yards and any run over yards is a big play If we c an stop giving those up well be better than we have been Q Every time anybody talks about the strength of the Texas defense it centers around your two tackles How important are they and what do you expect from them this season A Both Casey and Shawn are strong physical guys When they go all out they can dominate They really work well together too It is really important that we be sure they give us a great year They have proved they can be great run stoppers but were going to try to push them into being good pass rush guys too Their reall challenge now is to go out and produc e again as run stoppers and get better on the pass rush They need to work to improve I havent been satisfied with the endurance part of it as far as they are concerned If Im sitting there in their shoes Im looking to be just as strong against the run and get better on the pass rush Q Speaking of young players Dakarai Pearson and Phillip Geiggar your tw o freshmen at safety made some big plays in the spring Do you think they ca n help you this season A That Dakarai just improved so much this spring Everytime I turned on a practice film I saw some improvement He just got better every day He als o has some leadership capabilities I think we are going to get a lot of big plays out of him and we might get some this year Hes going to be a real good strong safety if he keeps working at it Phillip has a lot of the same qualities You know Dakarai has been in the system longer hes a redshirt freshman and Phillip should have been walking those same high school halls with Stevie Lee Hes going to be a really good one too if he keeps improving He just needs some experience Hes probably going to get some kick returns and punt returns this year and hell probably get to play som e at safety too Q Is one of them more suited to strong safety and one more suited to free safety A Those kids are interchangeable The strong safety calls the defenses an d goes to pass strength so Dakarai probably would play there this year becau se Phillip hasnt been here as long but as they both get more experience th ey both can play either one Applewhite OK Simms Growing Recordsetting Texas QB Major Applewhites surgically repaired knee is fine and he will be ready to do battle with heralded sophomore Chris Simms for t he starting job when preseason football practice begins next month Simms meanwhile has been hitting the weights and is now packing pound s on his frame up from last season The UT coaches have said all along they plan to play two quarterbacks this season and no one in the country has a better pair to alternate Both are throwing the ball extremely well and both appear to be capable of leading the Longhorns in defense of their Big Southern Division crown If there is going to be a quarterback controversy at Texas its sure nice to know both of them are outstanding quarterbacks Some of Texas conference rivals probably will have a quarterback controversy too but it will be over whether any of the contenders are goo d enough to lead the team to a title The Longhorns have two championshipcalibre quarterbacks Schedule Revisions Reporting Dates The Longhorns seasonopener against

Longhorns hopes of getting Greg Barnum the great center prospect who left Tennessee after his freshman year are fading Vol coach Phil Fulmer has refused to give Barnum a release which would for ce him to pay his own way for a year if he comes to Texas as things now stand Since he would be a walkon it also would require him to meet UTs transfer guidelines for regular students As a regular student transer applicant with one year of college behind him he would have to have hours of C grades or above to transfer to UT Under Fulmer Tennessee football players have the worst graduation rate of any of the major NCAA Division I powers Barnum was a good high school student who might have hours of C or above grades at Tennessee If he does he would certainly have been one of the to p studentathletes on the Tennessee team UT Baseball Players Sign The pros have signed three UT baseball juniors second baseman Tommy Nicholson relief ace Charlie Thames and shortstop Todd West plus a to p recruit in catcher Scott Heard of Rancho Bernardo Cal Junior pitcher Phil Seibel is still negotiating with the pros but has not signed so far Basketball Recruiting Guard Carlos Hurt of Alief Elsik has committed to Louisville The Longhorns were recruiting him but their primary target for their only remaining scholarship is T J Ford who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the Class A state title Ford one of the nations top point guards is strongly considering the Longhorns But teams like Kentucky and Duke are also under strong consideration Maurice Williams a point guard at Murrah High School in Jackson Miss also is considering Texas Williams and Ford are both rated among the top four point guards in the country Texas already has a commitment from center Chris Wright of Redwater With only two seniors on the team coach Rick Barnes has only one more scholarship to give unless some underclassmen leave the team Aldrich Makes Olympic Team UT track and volleyball star Erin Aldrich made the U S Olympic Team Sunda y finishing second in the high jump with a leap at the Olympic Trials in California Aldrich was a senior last season but she gave the Longhorns some good publicity at the trials wearing her UT track uniform How About Those Odds Its been so long since Texas has been a preseason favorite in every regularseason game that I frankly cant remember it It probably was back in the glory days of Darrell Royal But there is an early line from the Imperial Palace in Las Vegas that alrea dy has posted early odds on three of the Longhorns key games The Imperial Palace has the Longhorns favored by points against Oklahoma in Dallas by points against Colorado in Boulder and by points against t he Aggies in Austin I thought the Boulder game might be the only one this season where the Horn s would rate as a preseason underdog I also thought the game against the Sooners in Dallas was the second toughest game on the schedule and the Agg ie game was in the running for the third toughest test So if Texas is a preseason favorite in those three big games I think I c an guarantee you that when the Imperial Palace publishes the odds for the remaining Longhorn games UT will be favored in each of them That of course doesnt mean Texas will go undefeated but I always prefer to be favored and thats what the Longhorns will be heading into the season in all of its games If they stumble early all that will change so lets hope they dont stumb le early or at all The s A Mixed Bag for Texas and Nebraska The Longhorn football team has had a lot of success historically but the s werent all that great Nebraska fans might disagree however The Huskers went in the s That was the second highest win total ever recorded in a decade Florida State went in the s to set the record But Nebraska went against Texas in the s If the Cornhuskers had won any of those three games they lost to the Horns they would have tied FSU f or the most wins in a decade If they had won two of them they would hold the record Baseball Recruit Shines Vincent Sinisi one of the Longhorns prize baseball signees led The Woodlands to the Class A State Championship last month He pitched a sixh it victory over powerful Duncanville in the simfinals then after a fourday rain delay hit a twoout double in the sixth inning to score the winning run over Corpus Chrisi Moody in a championship game Speaking of baseball the Longhorns have signed another lefthanded pitcher He is Brantley Jordan of Texarkana JC and formerly of Round Rock He was last season and he has two great pitches a mph fastball and a hardbreaking curve He was a freshman at Texarkana so he has three year s of eligibility remaining High School Subs at True Orange is going to schools thanks to several generous subscribers Neil Kidwell of Phoenix Arizona renewed

<20700634.1075857349722.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2000-08-07 04:54:00,True Orange August Part Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No August Strong Defense Promising Offense Favorable Schedule Propel Horns to No in First AP Poll Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns dont rate a top ranking in the wake of their threegame slide to end but the Associated Press preseason pollsters say the Horns are No Brown and his staff have simply done such and outstanding job of assemblin g talent and building a solid foundation to be overlooked in the preseason voting The Longhorns havent finished in the AP top since but there are four big reasons why they should end that year drought this season First the talent base is young but it is outstanding Browns first group of recruits will be juniors or redshirt sophomores this year and many of th em have been playing and playing well since they were true freshmen Second the defense was No in the nation last season and it will be eve n stingier this year Third the offense will be a lot more consistent throughout this season because there are so many more weapons at its disposal And last but certainly not least is the schedule Brown had to play Northern Division powers Nebraska preseason No and Kansas State preseason No in and He went against them in the regular season winning twice against Nebraska and losing two to KStat e The Longhorn schedule is no cakewalk It includes a road game at No Colorado the annual Dallas grudge match with No Oklahoma and some othe r dangerous dates But the early line has Texas favored in each of its regular season games and thats something no Longhorn teams has had in its favor in at least years As good as the Horns should be this year next season should be their year to really romp and stomp Why Because they have only five senior starters and Brown will have four straight awesome recruiting classes ready to roll But this season can be a very good one too In addition to the high nation al ranking in the preseason polls the Longhorns are heavy favorites to win t he Southern Division of the Big and set up a championship game with Nebrask a the Northern Division favorite and preseason choice to win the national title My theory is that the defense will be the best one Brown and his outstandin g defensive coordinator Carl Reese have put on the field at Texas That should give the young offense time to reload before playing the really big guys on the schedule With the Longhorns first three games against teams that will throw passe s a game LouisianaLafayette Stanford and Houston even Reeses young defensive ends wont be a liability because they are lightning fast pass rushers even if their runstopping techniques do leave a little to be desired Most of the other teams the Horns play during the regular season also are passoriented because Oklahoma and Texas Tech are pass teams Missouri probably will be and Oklahoma State Colorado and Baylor probably will thro w or more passes in most games I also think sophomore TE Bo Scaife and redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis wi th a little help from dimunitive sophomore WR Courtnee Garcia will be able t o slow down a lot of those blitzes that terrorized the Texas offense at the e nd of last season by allowing sacks in the final two games against Nebraska and Arkansas The Longhorns have an embarrassment of riches at quarterback where coBig Offensive Player of the Year Major Applewhite appears to healthy again afte r knee surgery but still might lose his job to immensely talented sophomore Chris Simms Ditto at running back where senior Hodges Mitchell made the AllBig team last year and is being challenged by big fast redshirt freshman Ivan Williams with sophomores Kenny Hayter and Victor Ike also in mix I can remember many past season when the Longhorns started and sometimes ev en won with a starting tailback who wasnt as good as any of this group and neither the Longhorns nor anyone else in this area has ever had two QBs as talented as Applewhite and Simms If we assume Scaife Ellis and Garcia can fill the hole left by the graduation of the teams top three receivers long enough for the talented wide receiver recruits to start getting comfortable with the offense then the only real problem left is the offensive line I know it had problems in those final quarters of the season and Ive explained in detail in past issues while it wasnt all the linemens fault but all of those guys are a year older now and should be a lot better this year The only spot in the offensive line that really concerns me is right tackle The Oline did a good job during the first games last year because UT wa s No in the league in total offense until the receivers started getting hurt thus opening the door to more allout blitzes The Longhorns even moved the ball well in the two losses in those first games but the problem at right tackle was exposed in one of those losses when Kansas State forced six Texas turnovers by applying fearsome pressure around the Horns right side on virtually every pass play When Simms a lefthander is in the game the right tackle will have to protect his blind side Either Mike Williams or Cory Quye who both started at times last year mus t step up this season or the coaches might do what they have done to fix problems in other areas move someone from another position Fullback t o linebacker DeAndre Lewis and linebacker to fullback Matt Trissel are two prime examples of moves that are paying dividends The prime candidate for a move could be guard Derrick Dockery who coach Brown called the best freshman offensive lineman Ive ever coached last year With his quick feet he would be an outside speed rushers worst nightmare That could open the door at guard to redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway wh o is the grandson of Longhorn legendary lineman Bud McFadin Holloway is talented and like his grandfather was nearly years ago is a fierce competitor The offensive line could use another player whose competitive juices run at a fever pitch One big problem for blitzers even if the problems at right tackle persist will be Scaife Nebraska and Arkansas were so good at delaying the Longhorn receivers at the line of scrimmage that they often brought eight and sometimes even nine pass rushers If anyone ever brings nine this season the other two defenders will try to chuck the two wide receivers and Scaife probably will score a touchdown if Applewhite or Simms has a split second to toss him a short pass because the re are few defenders who can run him down If they bring eight guys Ellis is and Scaife is and both are fast er than Kwame Cavil the teams ace receiver last season Cavil was a great receiver but at he was the only tall target among the key receiving corps last season Tall receivers are able to take advantage of short cornerbacks in allout blitz situations Remember that thirdandlong pass the tall Arkansas receiver caught over the short Texas cornerback after the Horns two obviou s safeties didnt count That was the difference in that game So my contention is that blitzing is not going to work as well against UT as it did late last season The Big had five teams in the APs preseason top headed by No Nebraska Texas followed at No one step ahead of No Kansas State Oklahoma was rated at No and Colorado came in at No After facing lots of ranked teams in his first two years at Texas Brown wi ll face only two top teams during the regular season this year Other than the big games against the Sooners and Buffaloes the most dangerous games for Texas during the regular season probably will be Texas Tech in Lubbock Stanford in Palo Alto and Texas AM in Austin

report on August UTs first fullteam practice is slated for Friday August at Whitaker Field st and Guadalupe The team will continue to practice at Whitaker Field until school starts at which time the practices will return to Deniu s All preseason practices are open to the public Coach Mack Brown has not released a full practice schedule but in the past his morning practices started around and his evening practices began around pm Browns Observations Coach Mack Brown was upbeat about the Longhorns prospects at the Big med ia meetings in Kansas City last week but he also said the team has to get better in every area Here are some of the highlights of his comments On last season We did not start like we wanted to last year and we did not finish well b ut we had a real good football team during the interim from game two through game eleven On overall needs We need to continue to work to develop depth on our team The Big is a physical league and it gets hot in Austin so we have to be at least two de ep at every position We played games last season and we got tired We have to develop more depth so we can play more people and not wear down during the season On the offense We need to continue to work to run the ball better and we have to be more patient in games when were playing against great defenses We dont have t o score every time but we do have to make some plays and take care of the ba ll better We dont want to put our defense in bad situations On the defense Weve got a really good defense but we feel like we gave up too many big plays at the end of the season Weve got to work on getting better at cutting down on the big plays and we need to get a better pass rush out of our front four so we dont have to blitz all the time On special teams We told your team its not against the rules to return punts or kickoffs Weve got to do a better job in those areas and were working on it Our n et punting needs to be better and we need to do a better job in puntblocking situations On the pressure to win at Texas I got more pressure at North Carolina in my last year being and then losing to Florida State than I got after the three losses as the end of las t year We lost those three games at the end and didnt look very good in som e of them and I didnt do a good job in some of them but Ive gotten more support from the university and our fans than anywhere else Ive ever coached The fans want us to win every game and I want expectations to be high If youre at Texas you want to win the national championship and you need to have a goal to win the national championship and you need to have a dream to win the national championship On the No ranking in the preseason AP poll Expectations are high but thats a good thing The only reason were rank ed that high is because were Texas Were not as good as the expectations and the ranking right now but we hope to grow into it Its a Great Time to Subscribe To The FaxEMail Service Ill Have Reports Almost Daily During PreSeason

Among Nations Elite The early recruiting blitz coach Mack Brown and his staff have worked to ne ar perfection in reeling in three nationally ranked recruiting classes in succession is paying off again Texas is up to early commitments now and appears headed for another top national class after getting CB Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes and OL Terrance Young of Longview both in July The Longhorn coaches cant comment on their recruits until they sign in February but Griffin the top prospect in San Antonio said the UT coaches told him they wanted him because they said I had the size speed and athletic ability they were looking for in their cornerbacks He had tackles last season broke up passes and had three interceptions two of which he returned for touchdowns Holmes coach David Sanchez said Griffin is the best cover corner in the district We went last year and reached the state Class A semifinals and his ability to take the other teams best receiver out of the game was a big reason Griffin who has run a meters said he had offers from Texas AM Oklahoma Colorado and Arkansas before he got a scholarship offer from Texa s on an unofficial visit on July and he said he didnt waste any time taking the UT offer I knew all along that Texas is where I wanted to go he said I really like Texas style of play and I was really impressed with the way the Texas coaches stress academics as well as athletics Young also had plenty of offers Miami UCLA Notre Dame Arkansas Tex as AM LSU and Mississippi State before he drove to Austin on July wi th his parents met with Brown and assistant coaches Darryl Drake and Tim Nune z and committed Drake recruits East Texas and Nunez is the offensive line coach Like Griffin he said the Longhorn offer was the one he was waiting on I really like Texas he said They have great coaches and great kids and they are going to do some grea t things in the next few years I want to be a part of that Young who already is a full qualifier with fine grades and and a SAT a nd ACT score said the Texas coaches told him they like the way he gets a quick jump on the defensive linemen and then maintains his blocks For those of you who are concerned about that time in the dont wor ry about it Young has a very quick start for a big offensive lineman and is adept at picking off speed rushers from the outside of his offensive tackle spot How fast an offensive lineman gets started is a lot more important than his time and Young gets started in a hurry Longview coach Pat Collins who coached an NCAA Division II national title team at Northeast Louisiana before getting back into the high school coachi ng ranks said The Longhorns got a great football player and a great young m an with an outstanding family Collins said Young Is one of the best high school prospects I have seen or coached he has worked really hard this summer and has excellent mobility a nd agility Seven of the Longhorns commitments are offensive linemen Texas has signed only three offensive linemen in each of Browns three previous recruiting classes and he said heading into this recruiting season that the offensive line was the No priority Since this is the best group of offensive linemen since I started doing thi s back in he couldnt have picked a better year to clean up on the big guys Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter a national top player Abe Robinson Jersey Village another national top playe r Alfio Randall Blinn JC was a national top player two years ago Mike Garcia Galena Park broke the Aggies hearts by changi ng his early commitment to Texas Will Allen Cypress Falls is another highly recruited star Roman Reeves another of the states top eight offensive linemen Terrance Young Longview Linebacker Yamil LeBron Killeen Ellison was the middle backer the Longhorns targeted early Defensive Back Cedric Griffin San Antonio Holmes one of the states top two cornerbacks Kendal Briles Wolfforth Frenship a great option QB who wi ll play safety at Texas Braden Johnson Euless Trinity a fine athlete who will play QB this season Brian Carter The Woodlands a twoway star at WR and CB RECRUITING NOTES Matt Nordgren the Dallas Bishop Lynch star who is easily the states top QB prospect is still a big Texas fan but he isnt through looking around He and his parents took an unofficial visit to Texas AM Saturday and he and his father will fly to Colorado this weekend for anoth er unofficial visit Nordgren said he liked AM and had a good time but Texa s is still No I really like the Longhorns Im pretty sure hell commit to Texas later this month While things are still looking bright for the states best QB its no quite that rosy for the top RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee He has been a Texas fan and has talked about committing early to the Longhorns but now he says he doesnt want to commit this summer and wants to wait take some official visits to other top programs before making his choice The Longhorn signees made good showings in the Texas High School AllStar Game in Houston last week QB Chance Mock of The Woodlands led the North to a victory by throwing two touchdown passes and was named the MVP an honor his father Mike won back in as a star QB fro m Longview The Mocks are the first fatherson duo in Texas history to win MV P awards in the NorthSouth game Matt McFadden of Coppell kicked off deep booted a field goal and even punted something he didnt do in high school Tony Jeffery of Klein Forest playing WR and Nathan Vasher of Texarkana playing WR and CB showed superb athletic ability for the North C Tre Bate s of Fort Bend Austin and T Lionel Garr of Diboll did a good job of blocking and DT Sonny Davis of Austin Lanier another UT signee who is headed to junior college looked great If you watched the game you know why Davis w as so heralded Packing about excess pounds on his normal pound frame he still was the quickest big man on either team Lets hope he gets his JC degree sheds those excess pounds to get even quicker and returns to Texas in two years RB Sneezy Beltran of Abilene was more tentative than he had been in his games at Abilene but I have seen enough tape of his exploi ts to know he is the real deal So far six members of the first team on Dave Campbells Texas Football magazines Super Team have committed to colleges Running back David Underwood of Madisonville committed to Michiga n and the other five Briles Robinson Scott Young and Griffin com mited to UT The nations top FB James Buchanan of Sarasota Fla Cardinal Mooney ranks UT in his top three with Florida State and Miami and one of the top DEs in the nation Shaun Cody of Los Altos High in Hacienda Heights Cal who had sacks last season say s he will visit Texas Look for the Horns to sign between and recruits
<28928473.1075857350382.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2000-08-28 03:17:00,True Orange August Part Scarbroughs True Orange The newsletter and faxemail service for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No August Stronger Defense Improved Punting Explosive Offense Give Horns Chance to Stay in Top With twoaday workouts almost over and the opening game just around the corner there is some great news for Longhorn football fans That year absence from the final top could be over for three big reasons The defense looks even stronger than last years unit which ranked No nationally Kris Stockton is punting so strongly that coach Mack Brown says the pros are interested The offense which couldnt score in the final ten quarters of last season is so explosive that it should be able to score on anybody But lets temper that great news with a word or two of caution about the offense While it is capable of breaking a long touchdown play against anyo ne on the schedule it still doesnt look like an offense that can make long timeconsuming drives against a quality opponent It wont be as quick to punt or score as the offenses at the really passhappy schools on the schedule this year but there might be a scary number of threeandouts against good defenses That wont necessarily be fatal to the Longhorns high hopes if the offens e and special teams can avoid costly mistakes that leave the defense a short field to defend The Longhorn defensive unit is so strong that it will force most teams to punt quickly too Another great asset this season will be defensive depth When the Longhorn offense sputtered down the stretch last year the defenders sometimes simpl y wore down through repeated exposure But the second defensive unit has been formidable in practice It allowed t he No offense one touchdown in seven possessions in Saturdays scrimmage Brown said the only big difference in the first and second units is at defensive tackle where the first team has AllAmerican Casey Hampton and a guy the pros like even better Shaun Rogers But Rogers says the dropoff at tackle isnt that great when the second unit comes in When Casey and I come out Stevie Lee and Marcus Tubbs are really good young players who are just going to keep on getting better and better While Hampton and Rogers are seniors Lee is a true freshman who enrolled in January so he could go through spring practice and Tubbs is a redshirt freshman who came to Texas as a tight end before growing into a formidable defensive tackle The Longhorns are still a very young team with Hampton Rogers and free safety Greg Brown the only senior starters on defense and tackles Leonard Davis and Cory Quye the only likely senior starters on defense Stockton w ho will handle the punting and place kicking also is a senior Brandon Healy is starting at wide receiver now but the fifthyear senior i s being pushed by the heralded freshmen who are developing rapidly Lets take a look at what the Longhorn offense did last year and what it meant to the team The figures below show gamebygame rushing passing and total offense yardage plus the number of sacks the opponents garnered Rush Pass Total Sacks NC State L Stanford W Rutgers W Rice W Baylor W KState L Oklahoma W Nebraska W Iowa State W OState W Texas Tech W Texas AM L Nebraska L Arkansas L It doesnt take a rocket scientist to see that the Longhorns were when they had more than yards offensively and an even more impressive wh en they had yards net rushing The flip side of that coin is that they were when they had less than yards offensively and an ever worse when they had less than yards n et rushing They also had five games in which they gave up more than four sacks and the only one of those they won was against Texas Tech To keep history from repeating itself the Horns need to start percolating on offense Now lets look at the upcoming season Coach Brown doesnt mind the pollsters picking UT No in the country and he also is glad they think t he Longhorns can contend for the national championship Weve sold season tickets because of the fans enthusiasm and support he said Sunday The fans are talking about winning a national championship too and we havent finished in the top in years but thats a good thing too We have high expectations and we want the fans to have high expectations for us Brown said the team has a chance to be good if it can eliminate some of the mental mistakes that cropped up last year and continue to improve Texas ranked near the bottom nationally last season in net punting averagi ng slightly under net yards per kick He said the goal this year is to average yards net punting and he said Stockton is punting so well in practice that the pro scouts are showing so me interest Overall our punting is so much better than it was last year he said Brown also said he thinks starting tailback Hodges Mitchell is even quicker than he was last year and will be able to get the Horns some yardage as the primary punt returner and he said backup tailbacks Ivan Williams and Victo r Ike will be the primary kickoff returners We think we will be better in all those areas he said True freshman CB Nathan Vasher ran a punt back yards for a touchdown in Saturdays scrimmage and Brown said he probably will use him as a punt returner at some point in the season Heres a look at how the team is developing on a positionbyposition basi s OFFENSE Quarterback Major Applewhite the Big CoOffensive Player of the Year last season after throwing for a school record yards and another school record touchdowns seems to be fully recovered from offseason knee surgery but h e is locked in a battle with super talented sophomore Chris Simms for the starting job Brown says he thinks both will play in the NFL and he says its a great problem to have Ive had teams with no quarterbacks he said I like th is a lot better Brown also says everyone has an opinion about who will start but Im the one who will make the decision because Im the one who will get fired if it doesnt work out He also said both will play a lot this season Beau Trahan a high school quarterback who switched to safety at UT has be en moved back to quarterback and he threw a touchdown pass in Saturdays scrimmage He is very mobile and has a good arm Chance Mock the heralded recruit from The Woodlands is a great prospect Hes built like a linebacker at but he runs like a wide receiver and has a powerful accurate arm Brown wants to redshirt him and he want s to redshirt Running Back All Big tailback Hodges Mitchell is back after rushing for yards a nd catching passes for more yards Converted linebacker Matt Trissel is the fullback and he is a good one He s an outstanding blocker good receiver and tough power runner Sophomore Victor Ike the fastest of the tailbacks has been looking good i n practice and currently is running ahead of Kenny Hayter and Ivan Williams for the backup tailback job Converted tight end Chad Stevens and Brett Robin are the backup fullbacks Freshmen TB Sneezy Beltran and freshman FB Will Matthews are looking good i n practice but could be redshirted because of the depth at their positions Tight End The coaches spent much of the spring building a passing attack around multitalented sophomore Bo Scaife a pounder with great speed He was slowed last season after undergoing knee surgery following his senior seaso n in high school but was sensational during spring drills On the very first day of fall practice he hurt the other knee in a noncontact drill and has already undergone surgery to fix it He is out for the season but Brown said the injury was not as severe as th e one to the other knee and said he should be ready to go by spring practice Since he played as a true freshman this will be his redshirt year Junior Mike Jones is an outstanding blocker and good receiver and he came back pounds lighter and a little quicker He will do a fine job but he wont scare people with his speed Freshman Brock Edwards is a big fast prospect and the coaches are working hard to get him ready to play He isnt as fast as Scaife but he is very fast for a pounder Wide Receiver Redshirt freshman Artie Ellis and fifthyear senior Brandon Healy are the starters but true freshmen Roy Williams and B J Johnson have been outstanding in practice and will play a lot even if they dont start Williams and probably the fastest player on the team has been making sensational catches almost every day in practice and Johnson and super fast too caught a yard scoring pass from Applewhite against the firstteam defense in Saturdays scrimmage Two other true freshmen Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery are speedsters who also are pushing for playing time There is little experience but a lot of young talent at wide receiver The youngsters may struggle in the early games but some of them will help a lo t this season and all of them are fast enough to scare defenses Line Four starters return and super sophomore Derrick Dockery the lone new starter might be the best of the bunch The line did a good job early last season but caught much of the blame for the lateseason collapse Center Matt Anderson is getting a strong challenge from sophomore Beau Bake r at center and Cory Quye is holding off Mike Williams at right tackle for now Dockery is a fixture at left guard Leonard Davis is getting some AllAmerica mention at left tackle and Antwan KirkHughes is in control at right guard Brown has called Dockery the best true freshman lineman I have ever coache d Sophomore Robbie Doane is a strong backup at tackle and redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway is a talented newcomer at guard The line will be better because of the extra years experience The key question is the degree of improvement DEFENSE End Nine starters return from a fine defense but both seniors in were the two defensive ends Sophomore Cory Redding the Big Defensive Newcomer of the Year last year looks like a future AllAmerican at right end He is a great pass rusher an d an improving run stopper Defensive coordinator Carl Reese plans to try to fill the left end spot by using three or four players Jermain Anderson quick but undersized at pounds is the starter He is a fine pass rusher but is too small to play full time Sophomore Cole Pittman has moved over from tackle because of his runstopping ability Maurice Gordon and Adam McConathy also will play The y like Anderson excel at rushing the passer Reese likes the size and quickness of true freshman Kalen Thornton who is about and He says he will try to work him in early this season to see what he can do Tackle Seniors Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers are a formidable duo and probably ar e the best pair of tackles in college football Hampton was a firstteam AP AllAmerican last year and Rogers is bigger quicker and at times even mor e dominating True freshman Stevie Lee who graduated from high school early so he could go through spring practice at UT and redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs are outstanding backups Another redshirt freshman Ryan Haywood has a lot of potential Linebacker Reese has four outstanding linebackers who are concentrated at two position s which is why he plans to play nickel five defensive backs only two linebackers defenses at least half the time Juniors DeAndre Lewis in the middle and Everick Rawls on the weak side opposite the tight end are returning starters who just keep getting bette r Sophomore O J McClintock also has been looking great on the weak side an d redshirt freshman Reed Boyd is pushing Lewis in the middle So there is great quality and depth at two of the three spots On the strong side however juniors Tyrone Jones and Marcus Wilkins have n ot drawn a lot of praise from Reese He just says the Longhorns play five or six teams who pass most of the time and he will pull his strong side backer and play an extra defensive back He likes to have his quickest players in the game and all of his cornerback s are good tacklers Look for five or six defensive backs to letter before either strongside backer letters Secondary All four starters return but junior Quentin Jammer and sophomore Roderick Babers appear to be beating out returning cornerback regulars Ahmad Brooks and Ervis Hill Jammer living up to his name is great when it comes to jamming receivers and keeping them from getting off the line He is big and physical Babers is a speedster who played a lot as the nickel back last year He has great manforman coverage skills and always looks for the pick Regardless of who wins the starting jobs all of the cornerbacks will play in Reeses nickel and dime packages He also plans to substitute them a lot because they do so much running True freshman Nathan Vasher also is pushing for playing time At safety senior Greg Brown and junior Lee Jackson are returning starters Backing them up are redshirt freshman Dakarai Pearson who is looking very good this fall and true freshman Phillip Geiggar who graduated early so h e could go through spring practice at Texas Geiggar also looks like a future star Reese usually plays extra cornerbacks in his nickel and dime lineups but h e has been working Pearson as a nickel back in some situations Football Notes Two freshmen running back Tyrone Richardson and linebacker Aurmon Satc hell have left the team at least temporarily to resolve some academic probl ems Richardson wont be back until January at the earliest Satchell said he hopes to get his problems resolved by the NCAA Clearinghouse in time to rejoin the team this week Backup linebacker O J McClintock and freshman cornerback Nathan Vasher ha ve intercepted a lot of passes in practice Coach Brown says junior guard Antwan KirkHughes is the most improved offensive lineman but he also said We feel like all five offensive line starters will be quality players Josh Doiron older both of freshman defensive end Adam Doiron is walking o n as a tight end Josh Doiron attended Kansas State for a year on a football scholarship but quit the team and attended Oklahoma last year He did not play football at OU After sitting out this year at UT he will have two years of eligibility remaining Redshirt freshman Monti Collier has been switched from cornerback to safety Coach Brown says the true freshmen will have their first chance to move up late this week We like to get through twoadays before we do a lot of moving up and down with the freshmen he said We have to be sure they ca n play at a high level on a consistent basis True freshman WR Roy Williams makes at least one or two sensational catches in every practice and fellow true freshman WR B J Johnson also is making a strong bid for early playing time Its a Great Time to Subscribe To The FaxEMail Service

Gets Top RB Cedric Benson as Lucky th Recruit Cedric Benson of Midland Lee the alltime Class A champ in yardage gained and touchdowns scored is a future Longhorn Thirteen is supposed to be an unlucky number but not in this case because Benson is the Longhorns th early commitment and he is a rare jewel He ran for an incredible yards and scored an equally incredible touchdowns last season to lead Lee to a State Championship season Benson scored TDs rushing and caught passes for yards and the oth er seven scores He ran roughshod over a very good Aldine Eisenhower team in the state final s rushing for yards and four touchdowns and bolting yards with a scree n pass for another TD in a victory That was just another typical day for Benson who had yards and five TD s in the state finals as a sophomore en route to a yard season and touchdowns Why did he pick the Longhorns over all the other top schools who offered scholarships Ive always liked the University of Texas he said I like the way they use their running backs and have a balanced offense The UT offense is a lo t like the one we run here at Lee Benson said he was pulling for Ricky Williams to win the Heisman Trophy in and said Texas has been his top choice since he started drawing recruiting attention Asked how many scholarship offers he has received Benson said he quit counting after He also said the only other team he seriously considered was Miami but I like Texas better and its a lot closer to home Legendary high school coach Gordon Wood who won multiple state titles at Stamford and Brownwood before retiring several years ago says Benson is the best running back I ever saw in high school Woods teams had some great backs and they played against some other great backs so he has seen more than his share of the great ones Benson is a back who sets up blockers extremely well and seems to sense whe re a hole will be before it opens He is an instinctive runner who is shifty a nd hard to bring down He is on all the national top lists as are fellow Texas pledges Jonatha n Scott of Dallas Carter and Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village both offensive linemen OL Alfio Randall of Blinn JC another Texas commitment was a national top prospect two years ago at Houston Yates Randall had hoped to enroll at Texas in January but he needs more hou rs at Blinn so he will have to remain at the junior college through the sprin g semester to graduate That will delay his enrollment at Texas until next fa ll Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter is a national top player He is super quick for his size and has the long arms college coaches want f or the key left tackle spot Abe Robinson Jersey Village is another national top player He plays tight end at Jersey Village and is the top blocker for sup er junior RB Selvin Young who ran for yards last year as a sophomore Alfio Randall Blinn JC was a national top player two years ago He is super strong and extremely quick Mike Garcia Galena Park broke the Aggies hearts by changi ng his early commitment to Texas He is an offensive lineman with a defensive linemens aggressive temperament Will Allen Cypress Falls is another highly recruited star who has quick feet and great lateral movement Roman Reeves another of the states top eight offensive linemen He is a physically dominating blocker with good footwork and a strong upper body Terrance Young Longview has a very quick start and like Garcia is aggressive with his blocks Running Back Cedric Benson Midland Lee the states top running back an d another national top player Linebacker Yamil LeBron Killeen Ellison was the middle backer the Longhorns targeted early He is very physical and tough and he has great quickness Defensive Back Cedric Griffin San Antonio Holmes one of the states top two cornerbacks He is the kind of tall fast meter time corner who loves manforman coverage and is very good at it Kendal Briles Wolfforth Frenship a great option QB who wi ll play safety at Texas He was the Class A Offensive Player of the Year last season while leading Stephenville to the Class A state title He moved to the suburbs of Lubbock because his father Art left his job as head coach at Stephenville to become an assistant at Texas Tech Braden Johnson Euless Trinity a fine athlete who will play QB this season He is a real head hunter Brian Carter The Woodlands a twoway star at WR and CB So far only seven member of Dave Campbells Texas Football magazines man Super Team have committed to colleges and the Longhorns have six of them Benson is the only high school player ever to grace the cover of the state s top football magazine and he is joined on the Super Team by Briles Griffin Scott Young and Robinson The other Super Team player who has committed is Madisonville running back David Underwood who says he will sign with Michigan RECRUITING NOTES The Longhorns search for a quarterback recruit has been narrowed down to the best one in Texas and the best one in Louisiana Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch is the top Texas QB recruit and Bret Rawls of Shreveport Evangel is the top one in Louisiana Rawls backed up superstar Brock Berlin last year but has soared to the top of the recruiting charts after attending several major college summer camps Eric Hall the outstanding defensive end prospect from Clarksville Tenn still plans to take his official visit the Sept weekend With recruits already committed and no defensive lineman among them that is where at least five or six of the remaining scholarships will be awarded DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison is the key one because he is the toprated DT in the nation and because he is the only great one in the high school ranks in Texas this year Paul Broussard is a great one at Blinn JC and he is very interested in Texas but he has a lot of work to do in the classroom The Longhorns are recruiting some big DEs who good grow into tackles like Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal He lived in Plano during junior high Last Open Scrimmage Wednesday The Longhorns will end twoadays Monday and Tuesday with am and pm practices at Whitaker Field then have their last open scrimmage Wednesday at pm at Royal Memorial Stadium Coach Mack Brown said he plans to give the team Friday Satuday and Sunday off then begin game week preparations next Monday

chance with him The odd s are much longer on Davis Shelton Spears and Hill Scouting LouisianaLafayette If the Longhorns dont break their quarter scoring drought quickly in their Sept season opener against LouisianaLafayette in Austin it will be a very bad sign The Ragin Cajuns didnt do much ragin last season going with their only victories coming over AA Wofford and Middle Tennessee They also gave up an average of yards per game rushing and allowed opposing backs to average yards per rush The Cajuns run a spread offense with four wideouts but they didnt score a touchdown until their fifth game last season Coach Mack Brown says you dont really know what you have until you start playing other teams He still wont know after this day in the park The game starts at am on Sept and will be televised by the Fox Network on a syndicated basis Baseball Adds Loses The Longhorn baseball coaches have signed shortstop Shaff Elkouri from Seward County JC in Kansas but they lost one of their prized recruits last weekend when slugger Jason Stokes of Coppell signed with Florida for million Elkouri will be a sophomore at Texas this season Big Basketball Recruiting Week Coming Up The season opener in football is always big news and its also going to be a big deal for basketball this year because both Longhorn teams have some bigtime recruits taking official visits the Sept weekend Its really big for the men who have only one scholarship remaining T J Ford the point guard who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the state Class A championship last season will visit Ford is the player the UT coaches want and there is a chance he will commi t on his visit The Longhorn women have three scholarships left and two outstanding player s have scheduled visits for the Sept weekend One of them has a name you will remember She is Lauren Selmon a guardforward from Norman Okla If that rings a bell you are right She is the daughter of Dewey Selmon o ne of those three great defensive line brothers who starred at Oklahoma a quarter of a century ago I was in Oklahoma working as a political reporter for The Associated Press when the Selmons played at OU Unlike some of the later Sooner stars who

<6471826.1075857351234.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2000-09-11 04:49:00,True Orange September Part Scarbroughs True Orange The Internet Newsletter and EMail Service for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No September Applewhite Freshmen Receivers Lead Horns To Opening Win UT No in AP Poll The Longhorns opened their season at home Saturday by falling behind a point underdog LouisianaLafayette team but Major Applewhite came off t he bench to spark a point second quarter that paved the way for a victory and a No ranking in the latest Associated Press Poll Heralded sophomore Chris Simms got the starting nod at quarterback over Applewhite who underwent offseason knee surgery after earning Big Offensive Player of the Year honors in But Simms had a rocky start and when his sideline pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown that gave the Ragin Cajuns a shocking lead with left in the first quarter the coaches turned to Applewhite to tr y to pump some life into the dormant Longhorn offense And he delivered big time He led the Longhorns to seven straight scores six touchdowns and a field goal before retiring for the day and lettin g Simms handle the mopup duties For the day Applewhite was of for yards and four touchdowns and that was in less than two quarters He came in for the final of the first quarter played all the second quarter and then left for keeps just deep into the third quarter with the Longhorns on top Coach Mack Brown still says the team has two firstteam quarterbacks and he still says he wont name a starter for the Stanford game but there is litt le doubt that the quarterback controversy is over and Applewhite is the starti ng quarterback once again These coaches grade on performance and his scoring percentage Saturday was perfect seven possessions seven scores that turned a hole into a romp when he left the game True freshmen wide receiver Roy Williams also had a big day He caught six passes for yards including a super onehanded grab for yards to get the Longhorns off their twoyard line Heading into this game the Longhorns had four big questions and three of them got positive answers Unfortunately the one that didnt get the positive answer was the key one Here are the questions and the answers at least for the short term Will the offensive line do a better job of blocking This is the one that didnt get the positive answer It actually did a good job of pass protecting but the Longhorns couldnt run the football against a bad team that has small defensive linemen Unless the line improves and the Horns can run with some success the good defensive linemen will do just what our defensive linemen do against the Oklahomas of the world which is pin their ears back and harass the quarterback on every play Will those young wide receivers be able to pick up the slack for Kwame Cavil Ryan Nunez and Jeremy Jones last years big three Yes Yes Yes Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas the three heralded true freshmen combined to catch passes for yards and another gjuy seeing his first action redshirt freshman Artie Ellis tacked on four more catches for more yards and two touchdowns As Darrell Royal used to say if a dog will bite hell bite as a pup These pups have big teeth and th ey know how to use them Will the special teams be better They were Saturday Brown said the kicking game was the best since weve been here and that tells the story Kris Stockton punted for a yard average the kickoffs went team and the Longhorn punt and kickoff returner s got some positive yardage Will the young defensive ends be able to fill in for fouryear starter Aaron Humphrey and Cedric Woodard a threestarter first at tackle then a t end Sophomores Cole Pittman and Cory Redding who was still bothered by a knee sprain and true freshman Kalen Thornton all played well and junior Jermai n Anderson who is swift but undersized did a good job of rushing the passer This is a Longhorn team with a lot going for it in terms of talent coachin g and a more favorable schedule but the lack of a dependable running game could prove fatal against a team that can pressure the quarterbacks Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER With the temperature at and rising the Longhorns won the toss and deferred The Cajuns ran the deep kickoff back to the then drove yard s in plays using up nearly half of the first quarter before stalling at the Longhorn and settling for a field goal to take a lead with left Simms getting the start over Applewhite at quarterback led the Horn s on a yard drive that ended when Kris Stockton was wide on a yard fiel d goal try The Cajuns couldnt move and had to punt but Simms thirddown pass was picked off by Terrance Hunter at the UT and he dashed in for th e score to give the point underdog Cajuns a lead with left Vict or Ike ran the kickoff back to the and Applewhite came in and hit TB Hodge s Mitchell for yards then found Williams twice for and yards to reach the Cajun as the quarter ended SECOND QUARTER Mitchell darted over right tackle for four yards and the touchdown on the first play of the quarter to get UT back in the game at On the Horns remaining four possessions in the half Applewhite swiftly moved them an d yards for touchdowns nine yards for a field goal and yards for a touchdown after a Joe Walker interception That point explosion put Texa s comfortably on top at at intermission In that decisive second quarte r Texas had yards offensively and Louisiana had THIRD QUARTER Ivan Williams ran the kickoff back to the UT and Applewhite took Texas o n two more quick scoring jaunts first zipping yards in five plays and the n going yards in four plays for two more TDs to push score to and gi ve him a perfect seven scores in seven tries Simms relieved him at that point and hit three straight passes to lead Texas to its final touchdown with left in the quarter Neither team threatened serious for the remainder of t he quarter FOURTH QUARTER The Longhorns went back to trying to run the ball in the final quarter without much success The Cajuns did have one late drive that got to the Texas before stalling but that was the last serious drive by either tea m True Orange Observations It was feast or famine for the Longhorns in the running game Heres the ne t gain on each running play in chronological order minus minus minus That is the primary reason Texas had the ball only and Louisiana had it Most of the successful runs were draw plays There were very few times when normal running plays made any yardage In a romp past an overmatched opponent this is no big deal But it could cost the team two or three games down the line unless the regular running plays start being more productive on a consistent basis Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting scoops The number is It costs a minute You must be to ca ll Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns had to quit trying to run the ball Saturday because LouisianaLafayette had guys lined up in every gap and they blitzed on every play He said he really wanted to establish a running game early but it was much more sensible to go to an allout passing attack because of the defense the Ragin Cajuns were playing Brown said I was surprised Major Applewhite was able to play as well a s he did the first time back after knee surgery Major played really well he said The protection was great The momentu m really changed when we put Major in but we also changed our offense and starting putting four wide receivers out on every play He said Applewhite and Chris Simms who started the game and played the fir st two series before giving way to Applewhite are both starting quarterbacks Chris had the great spring and he had an outstanding fall but it wasnt that Major got beaten out We just think we have two starting quarterbacks He also said You just as well not ask me about next weeks starter becaus e Im not going to say I didnt know who it would be in the opener but Im betting on Applewhite to get the nod Saturday night in Palo Alto against the dangerous Stanford Cardinal because of his outstanding relief duty Brown said he was pleasantly surprised with the way his young receivers performed Its been a long time since Ive seen freshmen play with composure like that he said Roy Williams became the first UT freshman ever to pick up a yard receiving game in his first start He grabbed six passes for yards including a spectacular onehanded catch on a yarder from Applewhite Roy really played well Brown said One of the catches he made was phenomenal Two other true freshman wide receivers B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas also had outstanding debuts B J made some great catches Brown said and Sloan comes in makes a catch on the sideline then makes two guys miss Im really pleased with the way the freshmen played Brown said They ke pt their poise and helped us win the game Artie Ellis a redshirt freshman also had a good day catching four passes for yards including two touchdowns Ellis was a smashing success during spring practice and was expected to mak e a big impact this year because of his pound frame and good speed a nd his ability to catch the ball in a crowd The four freshmen receivers accounted for of the Longhorns reception s and of their passing yards Littleused fifthyear senior Brandon Healy also made up for lost time wit h four catches two of them for touchdowns for a total of yards Getting back to the quarterback duel Brown said both players are handling the situation well and the team has confidence in both of them to get the job done We have to keep both of these quarterbacks upbeat Brown said Well nee d both of them to accomplish the goals we have set He said he and offensive coordinator Greg Davis talked to the guys long an d hard about playing two quarterbacks We will always talk to the players about the quarterback situation before anyone else he said Were not going to throw one in or out because of a fan poll At his Sunday press conference Brown said he was very pleased with the teams firstdown efficiency offensively and defensively and was happy with the special teams play Looking at the lack of run production he said When you score points its not important but for the season it is important He said the Longhorns will work hard on improving their running game this week We have to do a better job on running the football he said This was the fourth straight game in which the Horns had less than yard s rushing but they lost the other three to end last season so this time it wasnt fatal Brown said LouisianaLafayette deserves a lot of credit for playing hard an d he said Cajun QB Derek Dyer played really great But I thought our team was focused he said Louisiana had nothing to lose but he had a lot to lose and nothing to gain He said all aspects of the kicking game pleased him Saturday The kicking game was the best since weve been here he said Freshmen Play Fifteen freshmen played in Saturdays opening game Eight of them were true freshmen and seven were redshirt freshmen The eight true freshmen were WRs Roy Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas TE Brock Edwards DE Kalen Thornton DT Stevie Lee CB Nathan Vashe r and S Phillip Geiggar Williams Johnson Thornton and Lee played very early in the game The seven redshirt freshmen were WR Artie Ellis RB Ivan Williams FB Brett Robin OG Tillman Holloway DT Marcus Tubbs MLB Reed Boyd and S Dakarai Pearson Holloway started due to weakened condition of Derrick Dockery who was hospitalized last week with an infected cyst Pearson also started because he is the nickel back and defensive coordinato r Carl Reese came out with a fivedefensiveback formation to start the game Ellis and Boyd also saw a lot of early action Inexperience at wide receiver was expected to be a problem for the Longhorn s this season but the trio of big fast freshmen and Ellis combined Saturday to show it as a team strength Those guys dont play like freshmen Applewhite said Its a Great Time to Subscribe To The FaxEMail Service Ill Have Frequent Reports on Recruiting And Practice Throughout the

defensive backs about of the time They had three wideouts and another wideout in the backfield most of the time UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese I dont care who starts It really doesnt bother me as long as we stay undefeated and win the national championship It was exciting to be back ou t there Our line did a great job I only got hit one or two times Roy Williams is a phenomenal receiver Hes going to be great Texas QB Major Applewhite If I had known it was one on one I could have kept on running and made an even bigger play but I thought there was a safety coming over and I wanted to wrap it up before he got there If I hadnt seen that imaginary guy I might have had a really long play UT freshman WR Roy Williams explaining his onehanded grab of a ya rd pass to get the Longhorns started on a yard scoring drive They were bringing their safeties and blitzing all the time so we just we nt to our passing game Isnt that Roy Williams something He looks like hes been playing college football for years Longhorn RB Hodges Mitchell I was hungry to get out there When I came out of that tunnel and saw all those people it really fired me up I had fun out there and thought I didn t do bad for a first game Texas freshman WR B J Johnson They just came out and played hard We just had to gather oursevles After a couple of series we got things together UT AllAmerican DT Casey Hampton We drove the ball well at the start but we just werent able to put it in the end zone On the other end Major Applewhite was making good reads on h is completions He really got them going Louisiana QB

Stanford The Longhorns face their first major test Saturday night when they play defending Pac champion Stanford in Palo Alto The game will start at Texas time and will be televised by the Fox Network Texas clobbered Stanford last year in Austin and the Cardinal will be trying to turn the tables this year Stanford went overall last season and won the Pac with a record But all four of the seniors they lost on offense were firstteam AllPac players They included QB Todd Husak and WR Troy Walters the leagues alltime leading receiver plus two veteran offensive linemen Six defensive starters return from last year including four linemen But only one linebacker and one defensive back who started a year ago are on ha nd Stanford opened the season with a victory over Washington State and the Cardinal defense did not allow an offensive touchdown but then the Cardinal fell to San Jose State Saturday night San Jose State beat Stanford with a powerful running game Spartan TB Deonc e Whitaker gained yards on carries scoring on runs of and yards and setting up two other TDs with long runs Stanford QB Randy Fasani threw for yards and four touchdowns in the offensive slugfest If the Longhorns are going to have a running game anytime soon this will b e their best chance to do it Texas probably will be at least a point favorite but this could be a dangerous game unless the Longhorns tackle better than they did last week a nd force a few turnovers The Horns also need to get their running game going or it will be one of those fourhour pass shootouts Here are the three keys to victory in my opinion Win the rushing battle That doesnt sound like a big order against the passhappy Cardinal but the Longhorns havent had a yard rushing game in their last four outings Put a lot of pressure on Fasani and do a good job of protecting the Texa s quarterbacks Take care of the ball Texas needs to win the turnover battle I think this is a dangerous road trip but Ill go out on a limb and pick t he Longhorns to win by a score I think Texas will pressure Fasani and take care of the ball Hopefully the Horns can run the ball too but two out of three should be good enough Big Roundup Texas plays at

Dallas Carter are UT commitments who are on USATodays Top national players Two other UT pledges OL Abe Robinson of Jersey Village and QBAthlete Kendal Briles of Frenship are on some national top lists Benson running behind an allnew offensive line is still racking up impressive numbers He had carries for yards and a TD plus a yar d reception in the defending state champions victory over a good Victoria team in the season opener then scored four touchdowns on just nin e carries good for yards in a romp past Longview His four TDs came on runs of and yards For the year he has carries yards and five touchdowns Behind an inexperienced OL he is averaging yards per carry and a touchdown every carries Terrance Young the huge Longview OL who also has committed to UT said it was a long way to go for a high school football game but he said it was worth it just to see Benson run I heard he was the best running back in the nation and he is awesome You ng said Blocking for him is going to be a lot of fun He is an awesome player Benson wont have the monster year he had last year at his present pace simply because he isnt carrying the ball as much Lee coach John Parchman trying for a third consecutive state title is working on a more diversified attack to try to spread things out a little more When you lose as many seniors as he did you have to improvise Briles the Class A Offensive Player of the Year while leading Stephenvill e to the state title in is at a new A school Wolfforth Frenship near Lubbock because his dad former Stephenville coach Art Briles is on the coaching staff at Texas Tech But dont worry about him requiring any time to get adjusted Frenship open ed its season Friday and Briles passed for yards and four touchdowns and r an for more yards and two more

Rodrique Wright a junior who is listed in the program as If he is No as the program state s he looks about but he is a fine player He stuffs the run and he has great quickness to chase the passer Look for him to be a bigtime recruit next year Aldine played Madison in a battle of Class A Houston powers Aldine won b ut the most impressive players in the game were Madison OL William Winston and his teams junior QB Vincent Young Winston has the quickest feet of any pounder Ive seen this year Aldines Lawrence Hooper is a highly recruited DE Some people think hes t he best one in the state but Winston definitely won their individual battle At he is big enough to overpower most opponents and he is incredibl y quick at sliding out to pick up speed rushers He is still considering Texa s AM and a lot of other people and he is a prize Young is and he runs a sub He has a powerful arm but Aldine is a groundoriented team and he is outstanding on the option He wi ll be one of the states top recruits next year Selvin Young the great Jersey Village junior running back who topped the yard rushing mark as a sophomore is still bothered by the badly sprained ankle he suffered at the end of last season and he saw only limit ed action in his teams opener Eric Hall the fine defensive end from Clarksville Tenn took his officia l visit to Texas last weekend and his mother said he had a great

Mich AM UT Recruiting Proof Is in the Pudding Ive been covering recruiting since and there definitely is a correlation between recruiting success and success on the field But Dave Campbells Texas Football Magazine has been around a lot longer th an that and subscriber Grant Erwin of Dallas went back to the year befo re the Aggies finally started having success against Texas after decades of being hammered and compiled the results The magazine ranks recruiting classes in June of the following year so it is able to study every other ranking in detail before coming up with its own list of top recruits That should give it a great degree of accuracy Here is what the study showed DCTF Recruiting Rankings in the Southwest Conference plus results of UTA M game AM Texas UT won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won Texas AM AM won AM Texas Texas won AM Texas AM won AM Texas AM won Texas AM AM won AM Texas AM won Texas AM Texas won DCTF Recruiting Rankings in the Big XII South AM Texas Texas won Texas AM AM won Texas AM Texas won Texas AM AM won Texas AM Indicates recruiting battle won by a wide margin according to Dave Campbells rating system AM put together several outstanding classes in a row in the early s and kept it going with the exception of until Texas started having good recruiting success again in Its no coincidence that the Aggies who had never won more than three in a row against the Longhorns and that was way back in won five i n a row and nine times in years during their recruiting dominance over the Longhorns Team with superior talent rarely lose to less talented teams and that is w hy the Aggies enjoyed their decade in the sun But look at those recent classes All the strange happenings at AM last season delayed the inevitable in my opinion and if those recruiting rankings continue to prove as accurate a crystal ball as they have in the last two decades the Longhorns supremacy in recruiting should make this first decade of the new century a great one for UT in this long series whi ch the Horns already lead Four Baseball Stars Commit The Longhorn baseball coaches already have commitments from four top baseball players They are catcher Jack Sweeney of powerhouse Houston Bellaire and three hardthrowing righthanded pitchers Joey Guajardo wh o threw three nohitters as a junior at Round Rock and Austin Westlake aces Chaz Taylor and Huston Street Street who was with a ERA last season is the son of former UT football and baseball star James Street Taylor pitched a twohitter this summer against the Dallas Mustangs a powerful team that included seven college players or signees including Jas on Stokes of Coppell He struck Stokes out twice in that game Stokes a UT signee signed a million pro contract last week Sweeney started games as a freshman at Bellaire and has been a starter ever since He is the best defensive catcher in the country and also wields a powerful bat Basketball Recruiting The weekend of the first Longhorn football game also was a huge recruiting weekend for both Texas basketball teams T J Ford the point guard who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the Class A State Championship last season took his official visit to UT He said he enjoyed the trip I really like the coaches and the players and there are a lot of things to do at UT and in Austin he said He said he plans to visit Cincinnati and possibly Louisville and Houston before making a decision Ford is one of the top three point guards in the country The Longhorn women had two top recruits in town for official visits They a re forward Jody Bell of Chestermere HS in Calgary Canada and guard Lauren Selmon of Norman Okla Selmon is the daughter of former OU and pro football star Dewey

Volume No September Late Great Rally Comes Up Short at Stanford Texas Falls From No to No After Loss The Longhorns couldnt run couldnt protect the quarterback got a punt blocked for a Stanford touchdown and still almost won the game against the defending Pac champion Cardinals But they didnt Stanford won a verdict with a late touchdown that negated a point fourthquarter Texas rally Coach Mack Brown praised the Longhorns fight and they did fight and he said the team can build on the loss because it showed the young players the y have a chance to win tough games on the road We tried he said This one was tough because of the mistakes we made W e came back and had a chance to win it with those two big fourth quarter drives We just came up a little short Brown said the team has to work hard to improve He didnt single out the offensive line as a unit that needs to improve but while the receivers dropped some ball the quarterbacks missed some open receivers and the defense bent more than it should the one constant negative this year has been an inability to run the football After playing two teams who are not very good at stopping the run the Longhorns are last in the Big and No of Division I football tea ms in average rushing yardage per game at In two games they have net rushing yards The Longhorns actually ran the ball better against Stanford than they did against a weak LouisianaLafayette team in their opening win but the Cardinal defenders had five sacks to cut into the net figure I have been predicting a very good season and Brown has been saying the te am has some problems and must get better to accomplish its goals Hes right a nd Im wrong Lets just hope he and his assistant coaches can work out the problems in the offense in time to let the team accomplish its goals The victory gave Stanford a point underdog a record while the Longhorns fell to Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Stanford won the toss and took the ball After an exchange of punts Stanfo rd drove to midfield but backup DE Maurice Gordon sacked QB Randy Fasani and Fasani suffered an injured ankle and had to leave the game He was replaced by sophomore Chris Lewis A facemask penalty on a bad Stanford punt negate d that punt and gave Stanford a first down at the and the Cardinal took advantage of that Longhorn miscue scoring in four plays with Lewis hitting WR Luke Powell behind Quentin Jammer for the final yards to put Stanford ahead with left in the quarter DE Cory Redding blocked the extr a point Ivan Williams ran the kickoff back to the Texas drove to the Stanford before stalling Kris Stockton got off a great punt that kicked out of bounds at the Stanford A fumbled snap pushed Stanford inside the then Redding and DT Casey Hampton led a surge that trapped FB Casey Moore i n the end zone for a safety with left leaving Stanford on top Chr is Simms came in at QB for Texas and the Horns were at midfield as the period ended SECOND QUARTER Simms hit freshman WR Roy Williams down the middle for a yard touchdown strike on the third play of the quarter Williams broke an attempted tackle by CB Ryan Fernandez at the and strolled in for the score Stocktons ki ck put Texas on top with left Applewhite relieved Simms midway through the period Neither team threatened again until Stanford drove yards primarily on two big pass plays to take a left with left Neither team threatened again before intermission THIRD QUARTER Texas got the ball first but failed to make a first down and had to punt A horde of Stanford defenders poured through and blocked it and backup FB Emo ry Brock covered it in the end zone for a touchdown putting Stanford up just one minute deep into the second half The rest of the quarter was a defensive struggle with each team making only one first down FOURTH QUARTER Applewhite hit WR Montrell Flowers for yards on the second play of the fourth quarter to revive the long dormant UT offense and get the Horns started on a drive that enabled them to get into Stanford territory for the first time in the second half but a holding penalty and then a sack pushed the Horns back and killed the drive With left and Longhorn fans everywhere beginning to despair Texas starting from its own got back in the game on one huge play Applewhite found freshman WR B J Johnson behin d all the defenders and hit him for a yard scoring strike The Horns decid ed to go for a point conversion and after a pass interference penaty put th e ball on the Mitchell went over the top to get the twopointer and cut th e Stanford lead to with left The Texas defense again forced Stanford to punt quickly Mitchell returned the punt to the Texas Applewhite hit TE Mike Jones for yards to the Stanford but under a big blitz he was intercepted at the Stanford with left Stanford punted with left and Mitchell made a great punt return dashing yards to the Cardinal but a holding penalty on the return pushed the Horns back to the Backup TB Victor Ike was stopped for no gain and Applewhite threw an incomplete pass and to bring up thirdand Ike raced down the left sideline and caught Applewhites long throw just behind a Stanford defender and sprinted in for the TD putting Texas ahead with left Stanford got a good kickoff return to the Cardinal but couldnt move and had to punt giving Texas a chance to run the clock out with left A couple of first downs would have done it but two falsestart penalties left the Horns in a hole They made yards in three plays but faced a fourthand at their own and had to punt Stanford held in check throughout the second half by the Longhorn defense started i ts drive with left The Cardinal scored in five plays with Lewis hitting WR DeRonnie Phipps for yards to the Texas The Longhorns were called for roughing the passer and a penalty to the was tacked on After an incompletion Lewis found Pitts again and he barreled over for the winning TD with left Texas had enough time to come back but the Stanford defens e which already had three sacks got two more in that final minute to finish off the Longhorns Notes The Longhorns havent rushed for net yards in their last five games They are in those games with the lone victory being the season opener against LouisianaLafayette The Texas defense allowed Stanford only one first down in the third quarter and only two in the fourth quarter until the Cardinals winning drive in the final two minutes Texas had possessions Three of them resulted in touchdown two ended with pass interceptions ended with punts and the one at the end of the game ended on downs after Applewhite was sacked twice Texas three touchdown plays accounted for of the Longhorns total net yards It was a feastorfamine kind of game for the UT offense which only three other plays that gained more than yards Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting scoops The number is It costs a minute You must be to ca ll Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown was tired Sunday afternoon for his weekly postgame news conference The team plane left Palo Alto at am Texas time and got back to Austin around am But he was fairly upbeat You always hate to lose he said but if you have to lose you ought to lose early If youre going to lose it ought to be out of conference He said the only thing the lose really costs the Longhorns is a chance at going undefeated and were not a national championship caliber team in m y opinion He said the Horns can still accomplish a lot Look at Stanford last year he said You never want to lose a game but Stanford wins the Pac last year after they leave here with an embarrassing loss Brown said nothing went the Longhorns way in Palo Alto It was a night th at nothing worked for us but the positive thing is that we still had a chance to win No one asked him about his starting quarterback because he says he has two starters but it appears Major Applewhite is back in the saddle He started Saturday night and was the quarterback on of UTs possessions Sophomore Phil Simms got the other four possessions He cant comment on officiating without getting in trouble with the Big office but there were a lot of penalties against the Longhorns that came a t crucial times like the flagrant facemask call that negated Stanfords pun t on a fourthand and gave the Cardinal an automatic first down en route t o their first touchdown The Longhorns also had two false start penalties whe n they were trying to run out the clock with a lead They gained yar ds on their three plays that stood up but that left a yard short and they had to runThen there was a roughingthepasser penalty on Stanfords winning drive in the final two minutes While Brown couldnt comment after the game he had several animated discussions with the officials during the action Without commenting on the officiating he said They got a holding call on an incomplete pass on third down on one touchdown The face mask penalty le d to a score There was a late hit call on the quarterback on their last scoring drive Those things just abolutely kill because just about every one led to points for them Brown said the Longhorns didnt use their shotgun formation with four wideouts more because we werent throwing the ball and catching it very well Thats something we would have done more if we had done better at it We didnt have a good night throwing the ball overall he said We had some drops we had some passes that missed and we had some young receivers who were playing on the road for the first time Montrell Flowers was the g uy who played the best among the wide receivers and hes the most experienced It was a combination of errors on our passing game We were just not smooth Brown was asked about the teams performance in specific area that have caused problems in the past and have gotten special attention like the offensive line and the special teams He said After looking at the tape the offensive line played better than we thought The blitzes were our big problem It looked worse than it was I feel like weve made some progress with our offensive line Weve got to ke ep working on that I think the special teams have improved a lot We had some kickoff returns and Hodges Mitchell had the good punt return but we had a blocked punt for a touchdown We had to punt a lot but that blocked punt really bothers me We cant have one no matter how many times we have to punt Thats the part they have to focus on He said Texas has to bounce back quickly from the long tiring road trip coupled with the loss Our guys are totally exhausted We got back at am Sunday Thats why we didnt go to Hawaii because we knew it would be a hard game and a l ong trip Our team played really hard This was tough because we played so hard but had too many mistakes But our kids fought all the way Thats what we have to build on Weve got another game Saturday Houston is not going to care about our loss he said Itll probably excite them We can sit around and mope or we can get ready to play again This was a little eye opener for us to get better and move forward He said players and coaches cant get as up or down as fans because they kn ow they have to get ready to play another game and cant dwell on a win or a loss until the season is over Thats the least of my worries he said They really tried When you really try and you can come back on the road and have a chance to win that s something thats a positive to build on He said this game will help the team later on because it was a game the Hor ns could have won on the road against a good team We just made too many mistakes he said Thats something we can correct If we had a team that didnt care that it didnt both to lose thats the worst thing that can happen to you as a coach but thats not the problem After the game Saturday night Brown said most of the players were so upset they were crying We can build on this he said We have a really young football team We ll come back and get better We can correct the mistakes We took a big step in these big games by just hanging in there and hanging in there As long as theyll fight you can coach them and they fought all the way It was mistakes that cost them not their effort and that can be fixed We made three or four mistakes that probably cost us the game Brown said the bottom line is were a young team and we will get better INJURY UPDATE Brown said safety Lee Jackson has a strained hamstring and linebacker Marcus Wilkins has a sore groin He said those appeared to be th e only injuries sustained in the Stanford game and both players

defensive tackle Shaun Rogers We just have to keep fighting A loss like this really hurts but we have to bounce back and win the rest of them Longhorn linebacker DeAndre Lewis I wont know for sure what happened until we look at the tape We got some confidence and some momentum in the fourth quarter but we made too many mistakes early in the game Stanford has a good team and we just made too many mistakes to win Texas quarterback Major Applewhite When we give our quarterbacks time they can complete passes but we had some breakdowns tonight Well get better We have to work to eliminate our mistakes and we can still have a great season if we can improve and elimina te some of the mistakes UT tailback Hodges Mitchell This was the biggest win weve had Texas has a very good team and we were coming off a tough loss Stanford head coach Tyrone Willingham You just have to go out and do it We had to buckle down It was now or never There was no real pressure Its what we practice every day You jus t have to execute and thats what we did Stanford quarterback Chris Lewis who threw three touchdown passes in relief of injured starter Randy Fasani on the gamewinning drive Its a great feeling Its

nigh t when they host Houston at pm in a game that will be a regional Fox telecast The Cougars won their first game of the season Saturday defeating Army Army had a chence to win with a yard field goal on the final play of the game but UH defensive back Emile White blocked it Houston had lost its first two games to Rice in overtime and to LSU New Cougar coach Dana Dimel has installed an allout passing offense and hi s QB senior Jason McKinley is fifth in the nation in total offense with yards per game The Cougars are sixth in passing with yards per game and WR Brian Robinson is among the national leaders with catches for yards The Cougars gained yards against Army and ran plays Defensively Houston has struggled In losing to Stanford last week the Longhorns lost all three of the keys to victory I cited in my scouting report They lost the rushing battle they didnt put as much pressure on the Stanford QBs as the Cardinal defenders p ut on the Texas signal callers and they had two turnovers while Stanford had none The Cougars are far less formidable than Stanford so Texas should win fair ly easily Here are three keys to victory in my opinion Do a better job of running the football Thats not a huge order since t he Horns are averaging only yards per game on the ground Protect the Texas quarterbacks Stanford got five sacks and had tremendo us pressure on the Texas QBs most of the game Put a lot of pressure on McKinley The Texas secondary gives up a lot of big plays when opposing QBs have time to throw LongRange Outlook Coach Mack Brown likes to talk about four or five key games on the schedule He doesnt mean the other games are against patsies but lets ta ke a look at the teams Texas plays this year First there are six games the Longhorns should win The opening victory ov er LouisianaLafayette was one of those The others are Houston Oklahoma Stat e Missouri Baylor and Kansas If Texas takes care of business in those six games the other five will be the key to going or or somewhere in between this season Stanford as Brown noted was one of the key games so Texas is in the big games The others are Oklahoma Colorado Texas Tech and Texas AM Texas needs to win at least three of those to have a chance to finish a nd win the Big s Southern Division title Big Roundup Texas lost at Stanford and Colorado fell to visiting Washington in the Big

picked up two more commitments last week getting LB Lance McFarland of Jefferson early in the week followed by a pledge from his teammate RB Anthony Johnson on Friday Johnson rushed for more than yards in a loss to defending Class A chamion Texarkana LiberyEylau earlier this season He has great power outstanding moves and tremendous speed In other words he has all the attributes of an outstanding running back He also has confidence The Longhorns already have a commitment from super Midland Lee RB Cedric Benson but Johnson says that doesnt worry him I want to play on a great college team he said Youre going to have competition wherever you go if you want to play for a winning program His coach Jerry Bennett is the brother of Kansas States defensive coordinator and Johnson said the Wildcats finished No on his list The Wildcats also were after McFarland a hardnosed tackle with good speed for a linebacker He won a fatboy event after his sophomore year wit h an clocking Only players who weighed more than pounds competed The two additions give the Longhorns early commitments It looks more an d more like the Texas coaches will award close to scholarships because th ey still hope to add four of five defensive linemen a quarterback a tight en d a wide receiver a linebacker a safety and at least one cornerback Seven of the Longhorns commitments are offensive linemen Texas has signed only three offensive linemen in each of coach Mack Browns three previous recruiting classes and he said heading into this recruiting season that the offensive line was the No priority But he also said the defensive line was a high priority and that is where most of the remaining scholarships probably will be awarded Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter a national top player Abe Robinson Jersey Village a national top player Alfio Randall Blinn JC was a national top player two years ago Mike Garcia Galena Park was the Aggies top

Richardson both said they have some academic issues that need to be resolved before they can return Both said they hope to be back in Janua ry Satchell is from Denver Jefferson and Richardson is from Clarksville True Orange Observations Coach Mack Brown is in his third year of what should have been a major rebuilding job at Texas Thanks to the way he and his assistants took charge and changed one of the nations worst defenses into one of its best and thanks to the way they recruit the Longhorns are already back among the nations elite I know they lost at Stanford I didnt like it The coaches and players didnt like it either It bothers them even more than it bothers us But Texas hasnt finished among the nations top in football since so we probably all expected too much from this team The Horns will finish in the top again very soon and probably next year if not this one With three great recruiting classes already in school and a fourth in the making there are going to be a lot more Ws than Ls in the weeks and year s ahead Lets be grateful for what he and his assistants and players have accomplished and help them get back on the winning track Gustafsons Lawsuit Dismissed State District Judge J Scott McCown ruled last week that former Longhorn baseball coach Cliff Gustafsons lawsuit against UT athletic director DeLos s Dodds has no merit and he dismissed it McCown also said Dodds has official immunity from such a lawsuit The lawsuit alleged that Dodds falsified an outside income statement by Gustafson and provided false information to thenUT president Robert Berdah l that Gustfson has violated university rules by maintaining a nonuniversity bank account for a baseball camp The suit alleged Dodds actions forced hi m to resign The judge ordered Gustafson to pay Dodds court costs Basketball Recruiting T J Ford the outstanding point guard at Fort Bend Willowridge says he h ad a great visit to Texas the Sept weekend but isnt ready to commit to anyone until he looks at some other schools UCLA probably is the Horns main competition for Ford a super quick star who is the states No prospect He led Willowridge to the state Clas s A title and a record last season Coach Rick Barnes only has one more scholarship to award so UTs recruitin g will be over for this year if Ford commits to the Longhorns The Longhorn women are going to get a visit late this month from Kala Bower s a forward from Woodward Okla She is a national top star who plays on a team that has lost only two games in the last two years Coach Jody Conradt already has a pledge from the states top prospect forward Heather Schreiber of Windthorst Kelly to Miss Fall Semester Senior guard Darren Kelly will miss the fall semester Longhorn basketball coach Rick Barnes announced last week Kelly hopes to return to game action for the Longhorns following the fall semester It is going to be difficult not being able to play this fall but I have some academic issues that I need to take care of to return to the team Kelly said I am going to attempt to take care of that this fall and hope to rejoin the team in December Kelly was slated to return for his second season as the teams starting shooting guard He earned Big Conference AllNewcomer and AllBench team recognition as a junior averaging points and rebounds per game He was third on the squad in scoring and second in assists last season He also was the top threepoint shooter on the team and secondbest in the Big including a mark in league play of Im sad for Darren because he had made such great strides in his game duri ng the latter part of last year and over the summer and he had really taken a strong leadership role on this team Barnes said With the addition of so many new guys this year theres no question that his loss in the fall will hurt us Hopefully hell be able to return to the team and give us a big lift heading into Big Conference play A True Orange Subscription Is The Gift You Can Get Every Year for Your

Volume No September Defense Special Teams Dominant in Rout Longhorns Heading into Big Action The Longhorns stampeded past the Houston Cougars Saturday night in Austin posting their first home shutout in nine years and getting dominati ng play from the defense and special teams The victory got Texas back on the winning track and pulled the Longhorns up to No in both major polls The Longhorns are heading into their Big opener Saturday against Oklahoma State The Longhorn defense was so dominant that it scored two touchdowns and Houston which has one of the nations most potent offenses got inside the Texas yard line only two times The defense blocked a field goal to blunt the first threat and sacked Couga r QB Jason McKinley forcing a fumble to kill the second one Special teams a headache a week ago in the loss at Stanford were outstanding Kris Stockton punted for a yard average and had three pun ts killed inside the UH including one at the yard line UT also blocked a field goal and got a special teams touchdown when Quentin Jammer caused a fumble on a punt and Michael Ungar recovered it in the Houston end zone The offense started slowly making only two first downs and getting only on e net yard in the first quarter but the great defensive effort provided a safety net and the offense started moving more efficiently as the game progressed Head coach Mack Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis said the offense has been under so much pressure to play better that they thought the player s were a little too tight to start the game McKinley was one of the nations top passers heading into the game after three straight yard passing game but a fierce Texas pass rush limited him to yards through the air on of passing and sacked him nine times for minus yards The Horns also picked him off twice and returned both for touchdowns Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Texas won the toss and deferred Houston drove to midfield and punted Sophomore Chris Simms got the start at quarterback for Texas but his firs t pass bounced off WR Montrell Flowers hands and was intercepted by Cougar F S Hanik Milligan at the UT The Longhorn defense held with LB Everick Raw ls getting a sack and Mike Clark tried a yard field goal but UT LB Tyrone Jones blocked it But the Horns couldnt move and had to punt Then the defense took over putting Texas on top to stay Redshirt freshman SS Dakar ai Pearson getting his first start in place of the injured Lee Jackson intercepted McKinleys pass down the middle and galloped yards untouched to put Texas on top with left Moments later Stockton got a gre at punt that went yards and was killed at the UH The Longhorn defense forced Houston to punt from the and TB Hodges Mitchell ran the kick back yards to the Applewhite came in at QB and backup TB Victor Ike got yards then more to the behind good line blocking But the Cougars swarmed Ike for a yard loss on the last play of the quarter The Cougars had a big statistical advantage for the quarter leading in first downs and in total offense but thanks to the blocked field goal and the defensive TD UT led SECOND QUARTER Applewhite fumbled the snap but recovered it for a yard loss He hit Mitchell for yards to the and Stockton kicked a yard field goal fo r a lead with left Pearson recovered a Cougar fumble a minute lat er at the Cougar and the Longhorns third TB Kenny Hayter got five yards in two tough runs then Applewhite hit freshman WR B J Johnson for yards to the UH A sreen pass to freshman WR Sloan Thomas lost to the but then Applewhite found Johnson again with a quick pass in the flat and he turned on the speed to the yard line Ike scored on the next play and Stocktons kick gave UT a lead with left The Longhorn defenders again forced a quick Houston punt but Applewhite threw an interception to give Houston another shot from midfield Simms came back in at QB on the ne xt series and played the remainder of the quarter At the half despite having three passes intercepted and having gained only yards the Longhorns wer e in control at Houston had only yards offensively THIRD QUARTER With Applewhite back at the controls Texas opened the second half by drivi ng yards to set up a yard Stockton field goal that raised UTs lead to with left A yard run by Mitchell and passes of and yar ds from Applewhite to WR Montrell Flowers did most of the damage on the drive The Cougars came right back with their only sustained drive of the game zipping from their own to the UT but DE Cory Redding sacked McKinley and he fumbled with Redding covering the loose ball That was the Cougars last scoring threat The Longhorns punted quickly but Jammers jarring tackle forced a fumble on the return and Ungar fell on it in the end zone f or another Texas TD and a lead with left Neither team threatened again in the quarter FOURTH QUARTER Applewhite hit Mitchell for and Flowers for on the Horns first possession then Mitchell ran yards to the Houston Hayter came in and got the TD to give Texas a advange with left On Houstons next possession UT LB O J McClintock intercepted McKinleys pass and returned it yards for a score and a lead with left Simms came back in and engineered the Horns final TD drive hitting passes of yards to backup TB Ivan Williams to Flowers and then the yard scoring pass to fullback Matt Trissel with left The Horns almost scored again in the final minute when Simms hit true freshman WR Sloan Thomas for yards to t he Cougar but Williams fumbled on the final play SUMMARY The Texas defense was a picture of consistency Saturday never allowing Houston to get anything going offensively The Cougars ran plays for yards in the first quarter plays for yards in the second period plays for yards in the third quarter and plays for yards in the fourth quarter The Texas offense started slowly running plays for one net yard in the first quarter getting plays for yards in the second period running plays for yards in the third quarter and wrapping up with an play yard final period UTOU Likely am Start The official announcement wont come until noon today but its pretty certain that the TexasOklahoma game will begin at am on Oct in Dall as and will be televised by ABC Computer Guru Nixes Horns Jeff Sagarin the MIT mathermatics graduate who rates football teams for several major publications currently

fourth and Texas way back at th and fifth Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday afternoon the Longhorns are improving in a lot of areas but still need to play better On defense our secondary has improved a lot he said Our young defensi ve ends are playing a lot better Last night was one of the few times that we didnt give up big plays in the passing game We had a good pass rush and the secondary did a good job Offensively we are starting to run it a little bit better but we are sti ll not running it like we need to he said I also think we are gaining a lo t of depth Our special teams last night were outstanding Brown said They were as good as they have been since we got here He said TB Hodges Mitchell was chosen as the offensive player of the game and FS Quentin Jammer whose hard tackle on a punt forced a fumble that resulting in a Texas touchdown was the defensive player of the game He said three players shared the honors for the special teams They were LB Tyrone Jones who blocked a field goal Jammer and walkon Michael Ungar w ho covered the fumbled punt Jammer caused for his first collegiate touchdown Brown said he was pleased the offense did score four of the five time it g ot in the red zone with the only failure being the one at the end of the game He also said some of the Longhorns young defensive players really came of age against Houston Brown said sophomore DE Cory Redding played by far his best game and he said redshirt freshman DT Marcus Tubbs had two of our nine sacks Were really excited about his quickness off the ball and his explosiveness He a nd redshirt freshman safety Dakarai Pearson were really pleasant surprises Asked about throwing deep in the final minute of the game Brown said It s really a hard decision when you look at it My job is to do whats best for our football team He said the two big factors to consider were that sophomore QB Chris Simms needed some confidence and Houston had just gone for a fourth and six at their yard line We had five freshmen in there at the end of the game and Chris hadnt had a lot of success I wasnt trying to run up the score but I have to do what s best for our team INJURY UPDATE Brown said the rash of injuries at defensive tackle has real ly cut into the teams depth AllBig Shaun Rogers suffered a sprained ankle on an illegal chop block and Brown said he wont have any idea how long Rogers will be out until he talks to the team doctors Monday Freshman Stevie Lee sore foot and redshirt freshman Ryan Haywood sore shoulder didnt suit up for the Houston game Brown said Haywood might hav e a rotary cuff problem which might require surgery to repair Safety Lee Jackson who missed the Houston game with a strained hamstring is expected back for Oklahoma State Freshman wide receiver Roy Williams also suffered a bruised arm early in th e Houston game but it did not appear to be an injury that would sideline him against Oklahoma State Junior offensive tackle Mike Williams sustained a bruised collarbone that sidelined him for the rest of the game but its severity is not known Football Notes Five players scored their first touchdowns as Longhorns They are redshirt freshman safety Dakarai Pearson who had a yard interception return for a score sophomore linebacker O J McClintock who ran another interception back yards for a touchdown redshirt freshman running back Kenny Hayter who scored on a yard run sophomore fullback Matt Trissel who ran six yards for the final touchdown and walkon Michael Ungar who recovered a fumble in the end zone The official statistics for the game credited Texas with eight sacks but coach Mack Brown said Sunday the defensive staff said the team had nine sacks Either way its great pass rushing Defensive ends Jermain Anderson and Cory Redding had three of them Defensive coordinator Carl Reese has be en saying he needs to get more production from his ends and he got his wish Saturday night The victory gives the Longhorns a lead in their matchups with the Cougars Texas leads in games played in Austin The home crowd of was the th largest in Royal Memorial Stadium history and was the ninth sellout in the last home games Nine of the to p crowds in school history have come during Browns tenure as head coach The Longhorns are under Brown when they outrush their opponent Texas had net yards rushing Saturday Houston had The Longhorn defense has denied opponents a first down in of

play tight covera ge and get a pass rush from our front four We blitzed some but not as much a s usual The kids really played great This was probably our most consistent effort for a whole game Those goose eggs are hard to come by UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese It was Horns thats what were excited about The defense played great Offensively we withstood the early surge and moved the ball tetter in the second half Its hard to be consistent offensively in todays game because of all the blitzes I think our guys were so uptight to do well tha t they made some mistakes early in the game UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis reacting to a question about the offenses slow start Our young guys like DT Marcus Tubbs and SS Dakarai Pearson really stepped up big We needed that It was really tough about Shaun Rogers because it was a dirty play Longhorn AllAmerican DT Casey Hampton talking about the chop block t hat injured his fellow DT Rogers and the way redshirt freshmen Tubbs and Pearso n filled in for injured starters We just stepped it up another notch The quarterback was under a big rush and I got a good break on the ball Texas redshirt freshman safety Dakarai Pearson talking about his interception and runback for the first touchdown I was real proud of the way responded We had really worked hard on the punting team this week My punts dont usually bounce forward Sometimes th at can be a curse but this time it worked out right UT punter Kris Stockton who averaged yards per kick and had thre e killed inside the including one at the yard line Weve been able to hold the ball longer Against a very good defensive lin e like Texas has you have to get rid of it a lot quicker and sometimes you have to get rid of it before you really want to Houston head coach Dana Dimel commenting on the fierce Texas pass ru sh It was great to have a win like that The defense played great They gave us the ball in great field position It takes a lot of pressure off the offens e when the defense plays like that We have to execute better offensively We did better in the second half but we lacked consistency early in the game on offense Longhorn QB Major Applewhite

Oklahoma State in a game that will be televised by ABC The Cowboys opened their season with a win over Tulsa then blanked Southwest Texas before suffering their first loss at the hands of nationally

the pass this season However they ran the ball better last week and hope to be able to test the Cowboys defense which is No nationally against the run QB Tony Lindsay has always played well against Texas but he has had injury problems throughout his career and he was knocked out of the loss to Southe rn Mississippi with a shoulder injury in the third quarter RB Reggie White a pounder with good speed has been the goto guy on t he ground for the Cowboys White could pose a problem for the Longhorns because their normally stout middle defense has been weakened by injuries to DTs Shawn Rogers knee Stevie Lee foot and Ryan Haywood shoulder It is doubtful that Rogers an AllBig selection will be able to play Saturday Redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs played well against Houston after Rogers was hurt but depth will be a problem unless Lee can return He and Tubbs were the secondteam tackles Defensively the Cowboys are led by an outstanding front four headed by en ds Zac Warner and Juqua Thomas who had sacks each last year to lead the te am The Cowboys are inexperienced in the secondary but it wont matter if Warn er and Thomas can get to the UT quarterbacks before they throw The Horns should

like the Texas coaches He said Darryl Drake and Everett Withers were the two Texas coaches who recruited him and he said Withers the Texas secondary coach came to see him play in his second game this season He is a big fast corner with long arms but dont look for him to get many picks this year because he doesnt get many passes thrown his way because h e is so good at tight manforman coverage I went to Waco Friday night to see the Lions play Tyler Lee Waco LB Derric k Johnson scored one touchdown on an yard interception return and just generally wreaked havoc on Lees efforts to make a game of it Waco won and Johnson is as good a linebacker as I have seen in Texas recently He is or weighs around and he can really run He has the frame to carry pounds without losing any speed He says Texas is his No choice but he also says he probably will take a ll five official visits before making a decision Other schools in contention are AM FSU Oklahoma and UCLA but he says Id like to play pretty close to home so my friends and family could see m e play His teammate DT Sharod McGowan is listed in the program as being and He doesnt look that heavy but he is a dominating player too on occasion

womens softball team She said she will sign with Texas during the early signing period that begi ns in November In adding to pitching for her high school she was the ace pitcher last summer for the Katy Cruisers team that won the national title for the ASA andunder Gold Division which was the top national group At the ASA National Tournament in St Louis she struck out in innin gs and pitched one perfect game and one nohitter while going against the top high school seniors and college freshmen in the country Osterman pitched against the U S Olympic team last summer while playing f or the Katy Cruisers and struck out of the batters she faced while allowing just one hit in five innings The Cruisers were the only team to take the Olympic team to extra innings losing in eight innings The only other pitchers who struck out more Olympians were professional tea m pitchers who went seven full innings and none of them struck out more than Carol Adcock Ostermans coach at Cypress Springs said She could have go ne anywhere she wanted Every top softball program in the nation wanted her Adcock said Osterman compares favorably with former Longhorn AllAmerican a nd current Olympian Christa Williams at a comparable stage in their careers Cat doesnt throw quite as hard as Christa did in high school Adcock sai d but she has more movement on her pitches She is as dominating as any high school pitcher I have seen Osterman had a record last season at Cy Springs She gave up only one earned run during the season and had an ERA that looks like a misprint at Adcock said she struck out in innings last season averaging strikeouts per inning game Adcock said Her best pitch is a rise ball Its great but she also has a very good drop ball and a great curve UT softball coach Connie Clark cant comment on recruits until they sign b ut Osterman is clearly the kind of dominating pitcher she has been looking for since Williams skipped her senior season to play on the Olympic team Ostermans final five schools were Texas Stanford Washington Oklahoma an d UCLA She also is an outstanding student who ranks in the top in her class S he is dedicated too She was pitching to her dad in the family driveway when I called her Sunday at pm to confirm her commitment Top Pitcher Commits to UT Luis Cortez a hardthrowing righthanded pitcher with outstandi ng control has announced he will sign a baseball scholarship with the Longhor ns Cortez had a ERA at Sinton last year and he played with a top AAU team the Ohio Thunder this summer and went with one save and a ERA He was the youngest player on the Ohio Thunder and was one of only three players on the team with remaining high school eligibility His best pitches are a slider and a fast ball that has been clocked as high as miles per hour but is consistent in the mph area He also has a good curve and a changeup He averaged two strikeouts per inning at Sinton last season Cortez also is an outstanding student He makes straight As and is

Number October Part of Parts Longhorns Find Running Game Just in Time To Maul OSU in Big Opener OU Next Foe The Longhorns ran over around and through the Oklahoma State Cowboys and their No rated rushing defense Saturday en route to a victory befor e a sellout crowd in Austin The Cowboys while they hadnt played a good rushing team in their first three games had allowed only net yards rushing all season and they real ly do have a pretty salty front seven Led by sophomore Kenny Hayters yards the Longhorns had net yards rushing It was the first time Texas has has net rushing yards in a gam e since the thumping of Texas Tech last season In the six games they played between Texas Tech and Oklahoma State when the y couldnt reach the century mark in rushing its no coincidence that they w on just twice But they utilized a new gapblocking technique to combat the Cowboys stunting defense and it worked to near perfection because Hayter who was a little used thirdteam tailback turned a lot of little holes into big ones with his hard running While the rebirth of the running game was the big overall story it didnt happen until the second half and UT had a shaky lead at that point Texas still might have lost the game without three crucial earlier developments a huge passing play a great defensive stand after still another special teams goof and a penalty against the Cowboys that wiped out a potentially gameturning interception The huge passing play of course was Major Applewhites yard passandr un connection with sensational freshman WR Roy Williams six minutes deep into the second half The Horns were holding a fragile lead at the time they were facing a thirdand and they had already had so many problems with their punting team that UT fans everywhere were simply hoping for a miracle first down After all coaches everywhere say the first five minutes of the second half is the most crucial period in a tight game and the first five minutes had been all Oklahoma State The Longhorns hadnt even made a first down since the intermission But they got a lot more than that Williams got past the Cowboy cornerback who was covering him and Applewhite looked left and drew the safety back toward the middle When he finally looked to the right and heaved the ball the only question was whether Williams could catch up to it because there are few people in college football who can catch the fleet freshman He did catching it on his fingertips and racing untouched the rest of the way That yard play gave Texas a lead and it was all downhill after that for the Longhorns But that play was a gamebreaker only because the Longhorn defense stopped t he Cowboys cold early in the second quarter when a fake punt lost yardage and put OSU in possession at the UT and because an interception of a Chris Simms pass and a long runback inside the UT was negated by a personal foul penalty against the Cowboys The defensive stand came on the series after a blocked UT punt set up OSUs only touchdown The Cowboys were leading and the Longhorns at that point hadnt generated enough offense to indicate they could fall farther behind The disallowed interception was a possible point swing because OSU might have scored with a firstandgoal inside the UT Instead the Horns kept the ball and continued a drive that ended in the field goal that opened the scoring Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Neither team threatened early but the Horns dodged a bullet on their secon d possession They started in good field possession but Simms threw an interception that was run back inside the UT before a personal foul against OSU negated the play and gave Texas a first down at the OSU Tex as couldnt move and Stockton kicked a yard field goal to put the Horns ahead with left OSU TB Reggie White broke loose for yards to the UT on the Cowboys next possession but the UT defense held and the Cowboys missed a chipshot field goal try Applewhite came in at QB for Texas UT led at the end of the quarter but the Longhorns had only o ne first down on the penalty that negated the long interception return and just yards of total offense compared to for OSU SECOND QUARTER The UT defense stopped OSU and forced a punt With Applewhite still in at QB sophomore RB Kenny Hayter got a first down on two tough runs then seni or TB Hodges Mitchell took a quick pitch around left end for yards But Applewhite was sacked and his thirddown pass to freshman WR B J Johnson was dropped That was unfortunate because it forced Stockton to punt the snap was high a defender got loose up the middle and the kick was blocked Stockton covered it at the UT and OSUs White scored in two plays galloping yard to the then bursting up the middle untouched for the score to put OSU ahead with left The next UT drive also came u p short but facing fourth and at their own the Horns went with a fake punt It was a disaster and Stockton was tackled for a twoyard loss But t he strong UT defense yielded only two yards in three plays and got the ball ba ck for the offense On his third try Applewhite got the Longhorns into the en d zone driving yards in seven plays Mitchell got the TD on a yard run but the big plays were Applewhites passes of yards to WR Montrell Flowers yards on thirdand to Johnson and yards to the to Williams Stocktons kick gave Texas a lead with left OSU got close enough to try a field goal as time expired but Ervis Hill blocked it UT outgained OSU to in the period THIRD QUARTER A combination of mishaps including a sack and a halfthedistance penalty left the Longhorns facing a third and from their own Visions of anoth er punting adventure were etched into the brains of Longhorns everywhere but Applewhite dropped back and found Williams breaking open between double coverage just past midfield He heaved it and the swift freshman caught it on his fingertips and raced untouched into the end zone to complete a yard touchdown play Stocktons kick put UT ahead with left Lindsay and White misfired on a handoff two plays later and UT LB DeAndre Lewis recovered for Texas at the Hayter powered to the to set up a firstandgoal He tried to go over the top but the Cowboys stopped him then the Horns were penalized back to the for a false start Hayter got three yards to the off right tackle but Applewhites pass on third down was knocked down and Stocktons yard field goal gave Texas a lead with left Applewhite hit redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis for yard s and another TD with left A twopoint conversion try failed leaving U P on top heading into the final period FOURTH QUARTER With Hayter making good gains and Applewhite hitting key passes the Longhorns drove yards to set up a yard Stockton FG and moved yards for a touchdown with Applewhite connecting with Flowers for the final yards Ivan Williams ran yards for the final score with seconds left Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorn offense had its best day of the season against Oklahoma State the defense did its usual fine job and the special teams with one notable exception were outstanding After reviewing the film its clear that it was the best performance wev e had offensively he said We scored points and we had no turnovers Th e offensive line had its best performance We were pleased with not only the offensive line but Roy Williams made so me great blocks too and Kenny Hayter made some tough runs He also said junior QB Major Applewhite who underwent offseason knee surgery played like the Major of old He made very very few mistakes The Major of old was very good He was the Big Offensive Newcomer of the Year as a redshirt freshman in and the CoOffensive Player of the Year as a sophomore in Applewhite and sophomore Chris Simms have been dividing time at QB and Sim ms started the OSU game but gave way to Applewhite late in the first quarter Applewhite completed of passes for yards and three touchdowns Simms who returned late in the game completed of passes for yards Brown said the defense continues to swarm and play really well Casey Hampton is amazing and D D Lewis had an outstanding day Quentin Jammer a nd Rod Babers played really well We had another blocked kick thats our th in games here I thought it was Tyrone Jones but it was Ervis Hill who blocked the field goal Its interesting that our two best kick blockers ar e both from Texas City The special teams played well Brown said except for having another punt blocked and he said that is something that simply has to be fixed The two blocked punts this year have been in different areas he said b ut we have to get it fixed We cant keep getting punts blocked He said the UTOU game was such a big game or years ago that the feeling was that the team that won this game had a chance to win the nation al championship He said he and OU coach Bob Stoops are trying to get back t o that INJURY UPDATE Brown said SS Lee Jackson suited out against Oklahoma State and should be ready to play against Oklahoma He said DT Shaun Rogers sprained ankle is questionable for the OU game We should know more abou t Shaun Tuesday he said LB O J McClintock also missed the OSU game bruised knee but he should be back this week BLOCKING QUARTERBACK NOTES The big change in the UT running game was basically one new play a counter with an off side guard pulling and the linemen blocking down on the play side The QB also handed off at least par t of the time on one side and the back veered to the other side for a little bit of misdirection Major Applewhites knee has been one of he major no pun intended reasons the coaches have tried to use Chris Simms so much in the early games Applewhite still isnt but hes getting closer every week In fact he looked pretty close to Saturday Thats just in time because the Sooners look pretty potent and the Horns need to have two top quarterbacks ready to go Baseball Recruiting Going Great The UT baseball coaches got a commitment last week from righthanded pitch er Donald Lavinski of Class AA state champion Weimar giving them pledges from two of the states big three pitching recruits They also got a pledge from catcher Curtis Thigpen of Forney Round Rocks Joey Guajardo another righthander committed several months ago The third member of the big three pitching group is David Purcey a lefthander from Dallas Trinity Christian He is considering Texas AM and OU Purcey was at Trinity Christian the last two years and his team won backtoback state TAPPS championships He also helped his team win a stat e TAPPS title in basketball last year He had strikeouts in innin gs last year Lavinski was last year with an outstanding ERA His fast ball has been clocked as high as miles per hour and he is consistently in the mph range He also has great command of a sinking fast ball and a change up He struck out batters in innings last year while issuing about walks and giving up about hits He said he also had scholarship offers from Texas AM Baylor Rice Housto n and Oklahoma State Thigpen is an outstanding defensive catcher but he also wields a potent ba t bashing opposing pitchers for a batting average last season He also considered Alabama Baylor and AM Lavinski Thigpen and Pursey all visited Texas the September weekend along with shortstop Michael Holloman of Dallas Jesuit Holloman said he is considering Texas and Stanford He visited Texas earlie r and took his official trip to Stanford last weekend Horns Rise in Polls The Longhorns are No in this weeks Associated Press poll and No in the ESPNUSA Today coaches poll Oklahoma this weeks opponent is No in the AP poll and No in the coaches

us a spark He broke some tackles It brings an excitement to you when a back breaks tackles Longhorn offensive coordinator Greg Davis We really had to raise our level of play in the middle with Shaun Rogers and Stevie Lee out with injuiries It all starts up front and we got pretty good play up front today UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese We came out and played with a lot of emotion We were able to get some goo d hits on the quarterback When you get enough hits the quarterback eventual ly will start looking around and ducking Texas defensive tackle Casey Hampton At first I though I overthrew it I thought that was the big turning poin t in the game Roy Williams is just a great receiver the offensive line play ed great When I got sacked it was my fault for holding the ball too long UT QB Major Applewhite explaining his yard scoring pass to Roy Wil lims and the lines great protection To tell you the truth I was really nervous at first The holes were a lot bigger today The line really ripped some holes I had a lot of expectation s when I came here but I was a little too careless with the ball The last couple of weeks the coaches have told me I had a chance to play a lot more Sophomore RB Kenny Hayter after sparking the Longhorns running game w ith yards against the No ranked Cowboy defense I really felt like today we kind of jelled We opened up some holes for Kenny Hayter but sometimes he made us look good with the way he ran the ball and broke tackles UT senior OT Leonard Davis I couldnt go over there and tell him Mack Brown that but if you are asking if there is a difference between the two quarterbacks there is OSU head coach Bob Simmons when asked by an Oklahoma writer to compar e Texas quarterbacks Major Applewhite and Chris Simms Texas made adjustments and

play Saturday with a win over Kansas Texas leads the alltime series and has a threeyear winning streak In fact Texas dominated Oklahoma in the s going But coach Bob Stoops in his second year as the Sooners head man has OU humming along with an undefeated record and big ambitions Behind his allout passing attack the Sooners jumped out to a quick lead over the Longhorns last season before UT defense coordinator Carl Rees e changed his blitz packages and started getting enough pressure on QB Josh Heupel to put the brakes on the OU offense and allow Texas to rally for a win But it will be tougher this year because the Sooners of had no running threat at all They are rushing the ball much better this season which kee ps some of the pressure of Heupel The Longhorn defense should be able to pressure Heupel and corral the Soone r backs if the Texas offense shows up early The Longhorn offense hasnt done much in the first quarter of any of its games this year One field goal and very little yardage is all UT has garnered offensively this season But QB Major Applewhite who killed the Sooners last year with his clutch throws seems to be regaining his magic touch after offseason knee surgery and sophomore RB Kenny Hayter had his comingout party Saturday They keys to a Longhorn victory get a quick start on both sides of the ball pressure Heupel and make him throw before he wants to

Frenship Braden Johnson Euless Trinity Brian Carter The Woodlands Recruiting Roundup Brent Rawls of Shreveport Evangel the top QB prospect in Louisiana took his official visit to Texas last weekend I saw him going into the Texas dressing room after the game and he looks to be about as big as advertised He also appeared to be having a really good time His parents came to Austin with him which always is a good sign on an official visit Look for Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch or Rawls to commit to the Longhorns within the next week to days Nordgren is the most likely futu re Longhorn but it could be Rawls Actually its a great situation for the Longhorns because Nordgren is the top QB recruit in Texas and Rawls is the best one in Louisiana so either o ne would be a big catch The Longhorns are still at commitments They will sign between and players so there are six to nine spots left to fill I think most of those spots will be filled from a group of players consisting of Nordgren or Rawls FB James Buchanan of Sarasota Fla OLs Jami Hightower of Jacksonville and William Winston of Houston Madison DLs Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison and Kaelen Jakes of Placentia Cal DEs Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson and Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn LB Derrick Johnson of Waco S Dewayne Brandon of Temple Ath Joseph Addai o f Houston Sharpstown and the Galena Park North Shore duo of TE James Moses an d DELB Jonathon Jackson I think the Horns have at least shots at Nordgren Jakes Everett Hall Johnson Brandon and Addai Ill be surprised if they dont sign four or five players from that group Buchanan Hightower Winston Harris Jackson and Moses are all strongly considering Texas but they also are looking at a lot of other schools Texas really needs to sign Harris because he is a great defensive line prospect who really would be a great fit in defensive coordinator Carl Reeses attacking style This is a year when great offensive line prospects are plentiful but great defensive linemen are scarce and that is why Harris is such an important part of the Longhorn recruitizing puzzle There is a chance some other bigtime recruit will enter the picture but most of the remaining scholarships will go to players in one of the two groups above While big defensive line prospects are in short supply this year Ive already seen three juniors who will be bigtime recruits next year Ive written about them before but DTs Marco Martin of Mesquite and Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings are the rea l deal and so is DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands Leitko ca me to the Texas camp this summer I have seen Wright and Leitko play twice each and have seen Martin once an d also watched a lot of tape of him playing running back and in the defensive line Any college would take all three in a heartbeat if they were seniors The program at Hastings lists Wright as weighing close to pounds but h e looked more like a to pounder when I saw him play early this year against Galena Park North Shore He was a lot heavier last year but he has lost some weight and really is a great prospect While I havent seen them play I also have heard good things about some other big defensive line juniors including Damon Brown of Houston Washington Tully Jontzen of Keller and Jarre Rhodes of Dallas Lincoln who also is a tight end While were on the subject of juniors there is a great linebacker at Longview named Marvin Byrdsong He is weighs about and runs in the range Other super juniors include QBs Reggie McNeal of Lufkin and Vincent Young of Houston Madison RB Selvin Young of

October No WhatIffing in This One Sooners Turn Longhorns Every Which Way but Loose The Longhorns had their worst day during the Mack Brown era Saturday in Dallas and they picked a bad time to do it because unbeaten Oklahoma scored on its first six possessions and for good measure ran a pass back for a touchdown too en route to a victory The Sooners dominated the Longhorns offensively defensively and on special teams They even won the halftime when a Billy Simsled relay team beat an Eric Metcalfled relay team QB Josh Huepel passed the Longhorns to death and pound sophomore R B Quentin Griffin broke Oklahomas school scoring record and Longhorn fa ns hearts with six touchdowns In short it just wasnt a good day to be a Texas fan in the cold dam p Cotton Bowl or anywhere The loss dropped Texas to for the season and in the Big and gave the Sooners a big boost in their drive toward national and Big honors It also made this Saturdays game with Colorado in Boulder the biggest game of the year This is a season on the brink It could go up or down Remembe r that debacle with UCLA that started the slide in John Mackovics last year Brown is made of sterner stuff and I think he can get this team back on track But he has to do it in a hurry One thing Longhorn fans need to be very thankful about is that Heupel is a senior He was absolutely awesome Saturday and he probably will be the best allaround quarterback the Longhorns will face this year Here even more briefly than usual is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Oklahoma won the toss and deferred Texas took the ball and the Sooners go t the wind A falsestart penalty on the games second snap doomed that drive and forced a quick punt into the wind Kris Stockton got a good roll on the low kick to the OU Heupel hit four of five passes to cover the yards in six plays to give OU a lead with left TB Hodges Mitchell made a great run after catching Applewhites thirddown pass to pick up a UT first down but it was the only one in the first quarter On their second tr y the Sooners went yards in plays and ran the score to with left A holding penalty on the kickoff forced Texas to start frrom its Another threeandout series and punt out of the end zone gave the Sooners a short field at the UT They were on the move again at the UT when the period ended SECOND QUARTER The UT defense got a great leaping interception in the end zone from CB Quentin Jammer but it was disallowed and he was called for pass interferen ce instead giving OU a first down at the They scored on the next play for a lead with left Starting QB Major Applewhite almost connected wi th freshman WR Roy Williams for a yard completion but the officials ruled he lost the ball on the way down and it was ruled incomplete The Horns couldn t make a first down and J T Thatcher ran Stocktons punt back yards to t he UT A personal foul on the runback set them back to the but they scored in two plays for a lead with remaining Chris Simms came in at quarterback and hit Williams for a first down but a delayofgame penal ty negated it and Simms next pass was intercepted by OU LB Rocky Calmus who returned it for still another OU touchdown and a lead with remaining That brought Applewhite back in and he hit WR Montrell Flowers f or a nice gain on first down but an illegal motion penalty forced a punt The Sooners scored again giving them a lead with left At this point OUs offense had been so dominant that it had faced only seven first downs all day and had converted all of them Texas offense meanwhile had one first down The UT offense finally came to life driving yards in seven plays to leave OU on top with left Mitchell got the TD from seven yards out on a pass from Applewhite The Sooners were driving again when the half ended It was their only drive in the first half that did not result in a TD At the half OU led in first downs in rushing yardag e and in passing yardage THIRD QUARTER Texas finally forced OU to punt quickly to start the second half but Applewhite under a big rush threw an interception that was run back to th e UT OU scored in two plays for a lead just deep Simms came ba ck in at QB and played the rest of the way OU again drove deep into Texas territory but freshman DE Kalen Thorntons sack of Heupel forced the Soone rs to try a field goal and it went wide The Sooners next TD came after a fumble by WR Montrell Flowers at the UT That made the score with left Then Victor Ike probably the swiftest of all the Longhorns got loose on the kickoff and Sooner DB Michael Thompson caught him from behind at the OU It was an yard return But the Horns lost four yards on two plays and were facing thirdand at the OU when the quarter ended FOURTH QUARTER A pass interference penalty against OU gave Texas a first down at the Mitchell got five yards then backup TB Kenny Hayter took an outside toss f or the TD to make it with left OU came right back for its final T D driving yards primarily on runs by Griffin Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday he accepts the blame for the big loss to Oklahoma and he said the Longhorns have to bounce back because they still have a season to play and a lot of goals to accomplish if they play up to their capabilities After reviewing the film I still stand by what I said yesterday Brown said They outcoached us they outhustled us they outplayed us They totally dominated the game and when that happens it comes back to me It s my fault But he said the team still has a chance to repeat as the Big South champion Last year we were in the Big at this point Were at t he same spot as we were last season Asked if he thinks the team has a chance to rebound and win the title again he said no question about that Were far from out of anything We just h ad a poor poor performance yesterday in a game that was very important for us and our fans For me to just throw out the season because of that would be totally asinine He noted that Oklahoma after its loss to Texas last year beat Texas AM the following week and Stanford after giving up points to Texas last year won the Pac championship and Rose Bowl berth There is a lot of anger after a loss like this by our fans he said Wha t I will do this week is not look at the paper I wont watch TV or listen to the radio Ill be working hard all week trying to get us back on track He said he thought the Longhorns were ready to give a good performance against the Sooners but he said after three straight losses to Texas the Oklahoma players might have just been hungrier Our seniors had a chance to beat Oklahoma four straight times he said Some of them were crying Most of our younger players were in shock He said a loss like this one forces coaches to reevaluate everything We ll definitely go back and look very closely at everything were doing Well t ry to simplify things He said some of the Longhorn players played well but he said most of them played hard but didnt play well The defense had been playing so well for us he said It didnt even loo k like the same defense Part of it was OU QB Josh Heupel He played great We had a lot of mental mistakes Brown said We just played poorly and w ho knows why we played that poorly You guys will start looking at the things we should change The fans will start looking at the things we should change Ive got to look at things that I think will work Ive got to get them bac k on track Asked if he thinks there is a chance the team could fall apart because of t he loss to the Sooners Brown said This team wont fall apart Its a very young team with a lot of heart a lot of class Well go back to work to fi x things simplify things He said the key thing is for him to be truthful with his players this week about the things they did wrong the things they did right and the goals th e team still can accomplish This is a bad week to be going to Boulder he said noting that Colorado upset AM in College Station last week We wont ever forget this OU gam e but we still have goals to accomplish Were still in the race for the championship in our conference The players are embarrassed and I know Im embarrassed but weve got to pull back together and get back to work Weve got to go back and make sure we are fundamentally sound th Anniversary This is the final issue of my th year of publishing True Orange Next wee k will be the first issue of my th year While this is not a happy occasion because of the football game my first issue was after a Texas win over OU and UT is against the Sooners since True Orange began Thanks to all of you for your continued support True Orange Observations This was one of those games where a team has to figure out what went wrong try to correct it and then forget it because a game like this can be a cancer that ruins a season Remember UCLA and Mack Brown wont ask for my suggestions on this and Im sure he can figure it out for himself but if I were in his shoes here is what I would do rig ht now Give a royal chewing out to my players my assistants and myself becaus e this game was an embarrassment to all Longhorns Then I would say there are a lot of games left to play and this game needs to be put on the shelf and th e Colorado game should be the start of a new season for a team with a lot of goals left to accomplish Figure out the few things that have worked on offense and build future game plans around them By the same token Id figure out the plays that havent worked and quit using them The two upthegut plays the Horns used on their first two plays Saturday for zero yards have been unproductive all year Texas rarely has a running play outside the tackles but the sweeps usually work when they are tried Id also ditch that sideline pass that travels yards for a potential yard gain or an interception for a TD and start throwing downfield more often To open the game against Oklahoma State the Longhorns had a fouryard run and two pass completions on their first three plays and didnt pick up a first down Pick a QB and go with him Each QB has to be nervous knowing that if he throws an interception hell be jerked Quit being so predictable on offense Example when the Horns line up in a twoback offense and the tailback goes in motion Texas has passed or been sacked trying to pass of the time this season There has been one run by a UT fullback all year Brett Robins touchdown in mopup duty against OSU That formation invites an allout blitz If the run isnt going to be a big part of the offense go to the shotgu n with four wideouts as the basic formation It gives the quarterback a bette r chance to complete his passes as OU QB Josh Heupel demonstrated to near perfection Saturday Game Notes Oklahoma QB Josh Heupel one of the nations top passers had net yard s rushing Saturday which was more than the yards gained by the Longhorns leading ground gainer TB Hodges Mitchell This was the second most onesided game in the series trailing only the Oklahoma victory in in Texas leads the series The Sooners yards and first downs are both school records against the Longhorns This was the fifth most onesided defeat in Texas history The bottom are at Chicago UCLA Houston at Oklahoma Oklahoma at Kirksville at TCU at Vanderbilt Oklahoma Miami Baseball Team Starts Practice The Longhorn baseball begins fall practice Wednesday with lettermen back from last years team that qualified for the College World Series The team will practice through Oct and the annual Fall World Series wi ll be played from Oct through Oct All the practices will be open at DischFalk Field and all the practices will be in the afternoon but exact times have not been

right places at the right time Longhorn offensive coordinator Greg Davis They just whipped us They whipped us up front they whipped us at the linebacker level and they whipped us in the secondary You could put it a thousand different ways but we just got whipped UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese I feel honestly this is worse than UCLA in You dont come out against a big rival and get beat like that You feel bad getting dominated in every aspect of the game Texas defensive tackle Casey Hampton We didnt make plays Their quarterback did a great job but weve got to make plays It doesnt matter how good he throws the ball youve got to go up and knock it our or something You have to make plays and we didnt UT free safety Greg Brown We heard all week how good the Texas defense was but we knew we were a go od team too We werent going to take anything from them and our goal was to go right at them Thats what we did My getting the record was a byproduc t of our offensive performance as a whole Sooner running back Quentin Griffin after scoring a school record six touchdowns This was the worst buttkicking Ive ever been involved in OU was more emotional than us without question This is really bad To get manhandled by your rival it doesnt get any worse than this UT sophomore quarterback Chris Simms We took a lot away from this game last year We were up early and were playing good football at the start but things didnt go our way in the end We wanted to play four quarters today against a very good football team an d we did that for the most part OU quarterback Josh Heupel I was a little out of position but I knew what they were doing with their tendencies The guy looked at this receiver the entire way If he had looke d me off and gone the other way then I would have been in trouble But I too k a guess and I was right We had a great team effort today Everyone was on the same page When we work together you can see that we are a pretty good football team Sooner linebacker

storming into College Station and ending the Aggies game home winning streak last week And the Buffaloes get to play the host this week when Texas comes to milehigh Boulder for a pm game Saturday It will not be televised That sure got my attention said Texas coach Mack Brown College Station is a tough place for the visiting team Colorado coach Gary Barnett has had a tough year up to last week The Buffaloes opened the season with a loss to Colorado State then fell to Southern Cal Next up was Washington and the Huskies prevailed also by a score Powerful Kansas State pulled away in the second half for a victory After the KState loss Barnett threatened to strip the Buffalo decals off his players helmets if they didnt start playing better Barnett went with true freshman QB Craig Ochs all the way against AM and he came through big hitting of passes for yards and one touchdow n and running yards for another touchdown Sensational freshman RB Marcus Houston is out with an injury but Cortlen Johnson dented the tough Aggie defense for yards and a touchdown Saturda y WRs Javon Green and Roman Hollowell are swift and productive and TE Daniel Graham also is a threat Defensively the Buffs are led by a trio of returning linebacker starters headed by Jashon Sykes The Buffs return five offensive and six defensive starters from a team that went last year in Barnetts first season at the helm For the Longhorns to win the defense has to prove the Oklahoma game was a onetime disaster and go back to playing smashmouth defense It also has t o pressure Ochs into some freshman mistakes Offensively the Horns have to come out with their best shots early They havent scored an offensive TD all year and havent moved the ball at all i n some of their first quarters this season Unless the offense plays better than it has been playing it will be tough to win this game Heres how the teams compare statistically national rank in parenthesis Texas Colorado Offense Rushing Avg Passing Avg

Longhorns plan to sign to players with several of the remaining spots going to defensive linemen Tommie Harris the great DT from Killeen Ellison is the No guy on UTs wish list with Kaelen Jakes of Valencia HS in Placentia Cal the only other big defensive lineman who is seriously considering the Horns This is a bad year for the big guys in the middle so Harris and Jakes are as important as anyone remaining on the Longhorns wish list Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter Abe Robinson Jersey Village Alfio Randall Blinn JC Mike Garcia Galena Park Will Allen Cypress Falls Roman Reeves Livingston Terrance Young Longview Running Back Cedric Benson Midland Lee Anthony Johnson Jefferson Linebacker Yamil LeBron Killeen Ellison Lance McFarland Jefferson Defensive Back Cedric Griffin San Antonio Holmes Aaron Ross Tyler Kendal Briles Wolfforth Frenship Braden Johnson Euless Trinity Brian Carter The Woodlands As you can see the Longhorns are almost through recruiting offensive linemen running backs linebackers and defensive backs They want to sign one QB one TE one or two WRs Wacos great LB Derrick Johnson who had tackles in his teams loss to power Tyler John Tyler about days ago super safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple and any other gre at prospect who wants to come They should be able to get a QB and TE and they might get one WR but probably wont be able to get two They lead for both Johnson and Brandon If things fall like they appear to be developing there will be at least fo ur spots left for defensive linemen and possibly more depending on whether t he coaches will sign players But right now it doesnt look like Texas will be able to sign a lot of top defensive linemen because the only ones who are leaning the Longhorns way are Jakes DE Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn DE Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson who might be better suited to playing TE Harris appears to be wide open If the Horns dont fill all their defensive line needs this recruiting season they should be able to next year because there is a much better gro up of the big guys who are juniors this year RECRUITING NOTES QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch visited the Texas practice Thursday and spent a lot of time after practice talking to head coach Mack Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis but he said he isnt ready to commit and wants to look around some more The other QB Texas is recruiting Brent Rawls of Shreveport Evangel visits Florida State this weekend and says he might be ready to make a decision by next week He also has visited Texas and Purdue and Purdue appears to have a slight lead base d on his belief that he would have a chance to play quicker with the Boilermakers LBDE Jonathan Jackson of Galena Park North Shore is bein g recruited by most colleges including UT as a defensive end Colleges are wanting DEs with great speed as outside pass rusher and Jackson ran a at a summer camp That is very fast

players have all of those abilities But coach Jody Conradt who already had two outstanding recruits with all four of those traits landed two more last week for the Texas womens basketball team Kala Bowers of Woodward Okla and Jody Bell of Chestermere High School in Calgary Alberta Canada two stars who are so versatile that they have played point guard at times are the latest additions to Conradts recruiti ng class Bowers is a national top player who was one of just four high school underclassmen to be invited to try out for the junior national team She also considered Colorado North Carolina Stanford and Nebraska She averaged points and rebounds last season Her high school is for the last two seasons winning one Oklahoma stat e title and finishing as the runnerup to the state champion the other season Last year our point guard got hurt so Kala played point guard for us Woodward coach Kim Kramer said Shes so versatile she can play any position Bell averaged points and rebounds for Chestermere High School in Calgary She was a member of the Canadian junior national team She considered only warmweather schools and wound up picking Texas over Arizona State Chestermere coach Brian Utley said Bell is a player who can handle the ball like a guard run the floor and shoot the three Shes an insideoutsi de player with skills you normally dont see in a girl her size She has great allaround skills he said Texas got an outstanding playe r She really enjoyed her campus visit to Texas and really liked coach Conradt She said there were too many good things about Texas for her to go anywhere else Conradt also has commitments from forward Heather Schreiber of Windthorst the states hottest prospect and forward CoCo Reed of Houston Jersey Village Like Bowers and Bell they are fine ball handlers and shooters Schrieber and Bowers are both on at least one national top list Schrieb er has led her volleyball team to three straight state championships and alrea dy has been

Volume No October Longhorns Bounce Back Trample Buffaloes Behind Great Defense Solid Offense The Longhorns followed their worst game of the Mack Brown era with a great defensive effort and a solid offensive performance in a win over Colorado in Boulder Saturday afternoon The game really wasnt as close as the score indicates Texas outgained Colorado to and the Buffaloes ran only six plays in Texas end of the field all day The Buffs ran plays and they either gained nothing o r took a loss on of them The defense held Colorado to yards total offense in the first half and would have had a shutout except for a pair of fumbles that gave the Buffs a touchdown and set up their other score Texas is now for the year and in the Big Colorado fell to overall and in conference play This was a real gutcheck game for Texas after the whipping at the hands of Oklahoma the previous week and the Longhorns responded with their best defensive effort in terms of yardage yielded in years and their bes t rushing yardage total of the season The offense did struggle in the red zone and Hodges Mitchell who hadnt fumbled all year fumbled on a running play and a Colorado linebacker pick ed it up and returned it for a touchdown Mitchell also fumbled a punt to set up the other Colorado score But he ran for tough yards and scored the clinching touchdown on a pass from Major Applewhite who threw for three touchdowns and yards Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Colorado won the toss and took the ball Big mistake Texas got the wind an d the Buffs wound up playing deep in their own territory throughout the first half because the fierce Texas defense kept sacking freshman QB Craig Ochs a nd forcing turnovers That gave the Longhorn offense great field position wi th UTs first five possessions extending well into the second quarter starti ng at midfield or in Colorado territory Texas first drive started at the Buf f and got to the before Kris Stocktons attempt at a yard field goal sailed wide left Their next possession began at the CU and got to the before Applewhite fumbled and the Buffs recovered The third and final UT possession in the quarter started at the Texas and ended at the Colorado The Longhorns owned the statistics for the quarter leading in firs t downs and in total offense Colorado never crossed its yard line i n the entire period SECOND QUARTER The fourth Longhorn possession started at the Colorado and this time th e offense scored in two plays First Applewhite found true freshman WR B J Johnson streaking down the right sideline for yards to the Buffalo th en he hit his other true freshman receiver Roy Williams for the touchdown Williams outfought a Colorado defender for the ball and the score Stockton s kick gave Texas a lead only seconds deep in the quarter LB Everick Rawls intercepted Ochs pass on the first play after the kickoff and return ed it to the Colorado But the Horns couldnt move and Stocktons attempted yard field goal sailed wide right The Longhorns started their next possession at their own the worst field possession they had experie nced to this point and Applewhite hit Johnson for yards then found TE M ike Jones for more yards to the Colorado The Horns stalled at the Buff and Stockton booted a yard field goal to stretch UTs lead to with left Mitchell got loose on a yard punt return to the CU later i n the quarter Applewhite hit Johnson to the and Mitchell ran to the but a fumbled snap on a thirdand brought Stockton in to kick another yard FG to boost the lead to with left Colorado had nine possessions in the first half and had minus yardage on six of them The Buf fs had only yards at the half and just two first downs THIRD QUARTER The Longhorns were moving again to start the second half when disaster struck Mitchell was hit as he took a handoff and the ball came loose Colorado LB Jashon Sykes scooped it up and ran it back yards for a touchdown The kick was good and UTs lead was cut to with left Texas couldnt make a first down and the Buffs drove into Texas territory for the first time before punting to the UT The Horns had failed to scor e from pointblank range in the early going but they covered the yards in just five plays Mitchell got on a draw play then Applewhite threw an incompletion Mitchell bounced another draw play to the outside and ran yards to the Applewhite found Jones open again and hit him for yards to the CU Williams got a step on his defender and Applewhite hit him fo r the touchdown The Horns went for two and Williams who was well covered tipped the ball away from the defender and caught it as it came down to giv e the Horns a lead with left Redshirt freshman safety Dakarai Pearson intercepted Ochs long throw on the next play and ran it back to th e Colorado But the Horns couldnt make a first down and had to punt The UT defense forced a quick Colorado punt but Mitchell bobbled the ball at the UT and Colorado recovered A personal foul against Texas moved it to the and Colorado TB Cortlen Johnson who had been bottled up all day got outsi de the defenders and scored to cut the UT lead to with left At the end of the third quarter the Horns were clinging to a one touchdown lead despite having a edge in net yardage FOURTH QUARTER Neither team could mount a threat early in the quarter but Texas starting from its own with left finally put the game away and used up nearl y four minutes doing it Applewhite hit of passes for yards in the drive including a short pass to Mitchell on thirdand that he broke for a yard scoring jaunt That gave Texas a lead with left Neither team threatened again Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the victory at Colorado Saturday was on e of the best games weve had since weve been here Its a little disappointing that we didnt get the shutout because the defense played shutout football he said He said his young defensive ends played their best game as a group True freshman DE Kalen Thornton had two sacks and sophomore DE Cory Redding also had a sack Cory had his best game Brown said and Kalen is very mature He played really well yesterday and made some impact plays Brown also said QB Major Applewhite in his first game since being named th e starter played well He made some big plays for us He said DT Shaun Rogers who had missed two straight games with a sprained ankle played plays against Colorado and appears to be ready for fullti me duty again We need Shaun in there Brown said Hes just one of the premier footbal l players in America He said the team went back to the same basic offense it used during Ricky Williams Heisman Trophy year We were in twobacks a lot more than in oneback he said Its easier t o protect the passer with two backs When you are running the football th e safeties have to come in and get involved in the running game Then you can hit the tight end Then when they get concerned with the tight end that lets you get on with your receivers He said that was the reason TE Mike Jones was able to get open so easily Jones caught six passes for yards to lead the Longhorn receivers He al so became only the fourth tight end in school history to post a yard receiving day Brown said the UT offensive line had its best game of the year Our two tackles Mike Williams and Leonard Davis really played well he said Brown also said redshirt freshman OG Tillman Holloway who came in when Antwan KirkHughes was injured came in and was really physical He also said Major Applewhite remains the starting quarterback INJURY NOTES Brown said KirkHughes hurt his shoulder and is the only player who appears likely to miss any practice time this week He said DE Kalen Thornton who was hurt during the game is fine He got stepped on o r kicked but hes fine Colorado Game Notes Texas snapped its sixgame losing streak to Colorado The Longhorns last defeated the Buffaloes on Dec a triumph in the Bluebonnet Bowl The game Saturday also marked UTs first victory in Boulder since Sep t The victory also snapped a fivegame losing streak in games played away from Royal Memorial Stadium Texas improved to when recording more than yards of total offens e under Mack Brown The Longhorns improved to when outrushing their opponent during Browns tenure UT allowed only total yards which was its best defensive effort sinc e when New Mexico was held to yards offensively WRs B J Johnson and Roy Williams became the first true freshman receive r tandem to start for Texas since Mike Adams and Lovell Pinkney did so agains t Texas AM on Nov Williams set the Texas freshman singleseason touchdown record with his two scoring receptions in the contest yards Williams who has four scoring catches this season broke fellow teammate Artie Ellis and Lovell Pinkneys record of three The pair of touchdown receptions tied the UT freshman singlegame record held by Ellis Sept vs LouisianaLafayette Johnsons four receptions pushed his season total to and he moved into fourth place on UTs freshman singleseason receptions chart TE

receiving yards in a game and the first since Kerry Cash had seven receptions for yards on Nov at Texas Tech a span of games QB Major Applewhite threw for more than yards for a schoolrecord eighth

enough right now to beat the m Their defense gave us the worst field position in the first half that Ive ever seen Colorado head coach Gary Barnett When the ball is in the air you want to feel like

Clemson then played Michigan State down to the wire before losing The Tigers played Nebraska tough the next week before losing then whipped Oklahoma State and lost to Kansas Longhorn coach Mack Brown said he watched part of the NebraskaMissouri gam e and I thought they had a chance to beat Nebraska in Lincoln while I was watching it TB Zain Gilmore a pound junior is the Tigers top rusher He is averaging yards per game rushing and has scored six touchdowns Freshman QB Darius Outlaw is filling in for injured starter Kirk Farmer and has completed of passes for yards and three touchdowns But he also has been picked off seven times Defensively the Tigers are led by AllBig DE Justin Smith a pound terror Coach Larry Smith has five offensive and six defensive starters back from a team a year ago This is a game the Longhorns will be favored to win by at least points and it is one they should win handily if they come out ready to play Heres how the teams compare statistically national rank in

for the top spot in the Big las t week by going to Manhattan and handing No Kansas State a whipping The Sooners are firmly in the drivers seat in the Big Southern Division while topranked Nebraska and Kansas State will meet later this season to determine the Northern Division champion Conventional wisdom holds that two league losses eliminate a team from championship competition If that is the case then half the teams in each division have already been eliminated leaving Oklahoma Texas and Texas AM as the teams in the Southern Division with legitimate title hopes and topranked Nebraska Kans as State and Iowa State as the teams witha chance to win the Northern Division championship At least one of the contenders will fall by the wayside this week when Texa s AM travels to Ames to take on

disaster in Dallas will damage UT recruiting But the week between the disaster and the victory over Colorado was one of the best of this recruiting season for the Longhorns The Texas coaches got commitments last week from a great JC punter the states best QB and one of the top DELB prospects in the country The latest Longhorn pledge is DELB Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn He actually plays quarterback and safety at Clarksville but Texas Nebraska Tennessee and Texas AM were all recruiting him primarily as a defensive en d He said he picked Texas because he was born in Texas and has always had a fondness for the state and for its state university I really enjoyed my official visit to Texas he said I just decided it was the place for me Hall was the th commitment for the Longhorns who also had picked up pledges last week from QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch and punter Brian Bradford of Trinity Valley JC Nordgren is easily the top protype passer in Texas and Bradford has been rated as the nations top JC punter by at least one recruiting service Nordgren chose Texas over LSU Tennessee and Colorado He also was recruit ed by most of the top programs but had narrowed his choices to those four schools He told me had had scholarship offers It was really a close call between Texas and LSU he said but I decided I wanted to play for the Longhorns Nordgren is a student who also is a highjumper and intermedia te hurdler in track He also starts for the basketball team It came down to a great list of schools Nordgren said but I felt at home at the UT campus Its a football program that I know I can help lead to a national championship Trinity Valley JC coach Chuck Langston says Bradford will punt in the NFL someday Hes the best one Ive ever been around Langston who played and later coached at Oklahoma said Hes better than any of the ones we ever had at OU when I was there He averages better than yards and he gets tremendous hang time in the second range which is really outstanding He really gets great height and great distance Langston said Bradford is our teams MVP Hes one of the those guys who turns the field over He really changes field position Bradford told me he has always wanted to play for the Longhorns He was a full qualifier out of Lufkin High School and said he will transfer to Texas in January so he can go through spring training with the Longhorns Bradford can be counted against last years class because he will enroll at midyear What I really like about Bradford is his emphasis on hang time I concentrate on kicking it high he said Id rather have a yarder with no return than a yarder that might be returned It obviously works out because he is averaging yards per kick and stil l getting close to five seconds hang time Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter Abe Robinson Jersey Village Alfio Randall Blinn JC Mike Garcia Galena Park Will Allen Cypress Falls Roman Reeves Livingston

Punter Brian Bradford Trinity Valley JC The Longhorns with commitments already will give at least three more and if things fall right at the end as many as six additional ones There are five players LB Derrick Johnson of Waco S Dewayne Brandon o f Temple DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal and DE Jonathan Jackson and TE James Moses both of Galena Park North Shore who strongly favor Texas But all of them are highly recruited national prospects and I would be mild ly surprised if the Horns signed all five of them Then there are four great players the Horns are still recruiting very hard DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison FB James Buchanon of Cardinal Mooney H S in Sarasota Fla and OLs William Winston of Houston Madison and Jami Hightower of Jacksonville Texas has a pretty good shot at Harris but the other three are not leaning UTs way at this time Harris had a great junior year I saw him play and he was awesome But he h as a sprained ankle that has hampered his performance this year When the ankle was well last summer he ran a weighing close to pounds Hes still a super prospect and one the Horns need desperately UT Basketball Women Start Practice The Texas womens basketball team had

Fox Network The Bears have really struggled this season Their only victories are over North Texas State and South Florida They have been shut out in their last three games falling to Texas Tech AM and Nebraska Their other losses were to Minnesota and Iowa State The Bears had counted on former UT QB Greg Cicero to give them a good passi ng attack but he went down with a seasonending injury and they have had one of the least productive offenses in the country There are teams playing Division I football and Baylor ranks th in rushing th in passing th in total offense and th in scoring The Baylor defense is a little better but not much The Longhorns should be able to name their score in this one even if they do show up a little flat Heres how the teams compare statistically national rank in parenthesis Texas Baylor Offense Rushing Avg Passing Avg Total Off Avg Scoring Avg Defense Rushing Avg Passing Avg Total Def Avg Opp Scoring Avg UTs Bowl Outlook The Longhorns have to win their four remaining regular season games to have a chance to defend their Big Southern Division title and unless Oklahoma loses twice starting Saturday against Nebraska that wouldnt get them int o the league title game But a regular would guarantee them a good bowl game The Big champion is guaranteed a spot in one of the big four BCS bowls and the runnerup could wind up in one of the BCS bowls too The Cotton Bowl gets the second pick the Holiday Bowl in San Diego gets third choice and the Alamo Bowl gets the fourth pick By winning out Texas would be likely to wind up in either the Holiday Bowl or the Alamo Bowl If the Big lands two teams in the BCS bowls a Texas probably would wind up in San Diego If only one Big lands in the BCS bowls San Antonio is a more likely stopping spot for the bowl season If the Horns dont go they still will qualify for a bowl by beating Baylor Saturday and they will will go bowling somewhere Big Roundup The big game this week is in Norman where topranked and unbeaten Nebraska takes on undefeated and thirdranked Oklahoma Kansas State travels to Texas AM in another big game that will trim the li st of contenders for the two division titles to four The

a commitment so they are still at with a few slots left to fill One player who would fit one of those remaining spots very nicely safe ty Dewayne Brandon of Temple was one of the recruits who came to the TexasMissouri game Saturday The only other top recruits at the game were three who already are committe d to Texas CB Aaron Ross of Tyler John Tyler WRDB Brian Carter of the The Woodlands and DBLB Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity Ross and his Tyler Lions are having a fine season They are overall and in their district Ross is playing running back and wide receiver in addition to the defensive backfield He has scored one touchdown as a receiver and three as a running back He said only five passes have been thrown his way all year I intercepted one of them one was completed and I knocked the other three down he said The Longhorns will give five to seven more scholarships and most of them will be filled from a group of nine players They are Brandon LB Derrick Johnson of Waco DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal and DE Jonathan Jackson and TE James Moses both of Galena Park North Shore DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison Athlete Joseph Addai of Houston Sharpstown and OLs William Winston of Houston Madison and Jami Hightower of Jacksonville Super DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC is another possibility but he has some academic hurdles to clear The Longhorns are in good shape with Brandon Johnson Jakes Jackson and Moses They have as good a chance as anyone with Harris but the trouble there is that the Killeen Ellison star has a lengthy list of schools he is considering and he recently added Oklahoma to the mix and says he is wide open FB James Buchanon of Cardinal Mooney HS in Sarasota Fla is still considering Texas but he is a long shot RECRUITING NOTES Galena Park North Shore is and Jackson and Moses are having great years Moses doesnt get a lot of passes thrown his way but h e has very good hands good speed and he is a tremendous blocker Jackson wh o switched from linebacker to defensive end this year is an outstanding pass ru sher due to his speed and big frame Jacksons early college favorites give a strong indication hell be playing in Texas or Florida Hi s top five are Texas AM FSU Miami and Florida but Ill be surprised if both these bluechippers dont join former teammate Cory Redding at Texas Midland Lee star Cedric Benson isnt getting as many carries as he did la st season and hes running behind an all new and undersized line but hes sti ll lethal when he gets a chance He hit Abilene Cooper for yards and five touchdowns on carries Friday night in Midland in a key District A gam e Hes a Longhorn commitment and hes on everybodys national top list H e wont have the great statistics he had on last years state title team but he looks even bigger and faster this year Top Girls Basketball Stars Visit Coach Jody Conradt has already corraled a great recruiting class for her Longhorn womens basketball team but things could get even better because she got visits last weekend from the nations top junior and one of the states top three seniors The top junior is guardforward Ann Strother of Highlands Ranch Colorado and the top three Texas star is Niki Newton a forward from Crowley Strother is visiting several schools unofficially this year to decide which schools she wants to seriously consider next year Contadt already has commitments from two national top players Heather Schreiber of Windthorst and Kala Bowers of Woodward Okla They are the top prospects in their respective states Schreiber is rated as the nations No prospect and Bowers is ranked No by the All Star Girls Report a national rating service Horns Back in AP Rankings The Longhorns regained the top in the Associated Press rankings this wee k coming in at No They are No in the coaches poll That hasnt always been good news in recent years It seems like every time the Horns get a good ranking they get beat Is it complacency or overconfidence or just the fact they lose to a better team Im not sure but I do know thats why they havent finished in the t op since Theyve been in the top several times but they havent been able to stay there Kick Returns Picking Up Coach Mack Browns announced goal of improving the kick return teams this season is paying big dividends Victor Ike is No in the country in kickoff returns averaging yards on returns and Hodges Mitchell is No nationally in punt returns averaging yards on tries Unbeaten List Shrinking Only five Division teams still have perfect records and the list will shrink by at least one this weekend when No Nebraska and No Oklahoma meet The other teams with perfect records are No Virginia Tech No Clemson and No Texas Christian True Freshmen Will Start Tight end Brock Edwards will start against Baylor Saturday giving the Longhorns four true freshmen in the starting lineup Edwards joins defensive end Kalen Thornton who has started the last four games and wide receivers Roy Williams and B J Johnson who have started t he last two games Edwards was pressed into the starting lineup when Mike Jones the teams starting tight end suffered a lick on his knee early in the Missouri game Coach Mack Brown said Edwards did a good job against Missouri Two other redshirt freshmen have been starting Marcus Tubbs has been worki ng as the starter at defensive tackle while Shaun Rogers works his way back fr om an ankle sprain and Dakarai Pearson has won the starting free safety position Rogers is getting better each week and might reclaim his starting job this week Barring any late changes the Longhorns will start two seniors TB Hodges Mitchell and OT Leonard Davis four juniors QB Major Applewhite LT Mike Williams RG Antwan KirkHughes and C Matt Anderson two sophomores LG Derrick Dockery and FB Matt Trissel and the three true freshmen Williams Johnson and Edwards on offense Saturday Defensively they will start three seniors tackles Rogers and Casey Hampto n and SS Greg Brown four juniors LBs Everick Rawls D D Lewis and Everic k Rawls and CB Quentin Jammer two sophomores DE Cory Redding and CB Roderi ck Babers one redshirt freshman Pearson and one true freshman Thornton Baseball Stars Commit to UT The Longhorn baseball team got commitments from two more top recruits last week including a righthanded pitcher who has been clocked as high as m ph with his fast ball The pitcher is Kole Strayhorn of Shawnee Oklahoma who had offe rs from many schools but who picked Texas over Oklahoma Oklahoma State Cal StateFullerton and Baylor He was last year with a ERA He struck out in innings and said he gave up about walks and about hits He has been clocked as high as mph and he is consistent around He plays shortstop when he isnt pitching The only problem with Strayhorn is that pitchers who can hit mph and who have good control frequently wind up getting drafted so high that they get a lot of money to go pro immediately The other recruit is shortstop Seth Johnston of Boerne He also is the quarterback for Boernes football team Johnson hit last season and picked the Longhorns over Texas AM and Houston Simpler Is Better Coach Mack Brown says he thinks the Horns will fare better now that the coaches have simplified the offense Brown said he also thinks the twoback offense is better for Texas for several reasons He said having two backs behind the quarterback improves t he pass protection When teams rush eight defenders he said the five linemen the tight end a nd one running back are outnumbered When two backs are there he said there a re enough people to block everyone even in a maximum blitz It also is a better powerrunning formation because of the extra blocker h e said adding that success in the running game causes the other teams safeties to creep up to help stop the run which helps the passing game When you can run and pass it creates some problems for the defense he said We plan to keep working on being able to do both True freshman WR B J Johnson went along with the simplification idea whi le having some fun with the rerporters on hand Johnson said when he first got to Texas and heard the coaches talking about cover I didnt even know they had six coverages When someone asked him if he knew all the defensive coverages now he said I dont even know all the plays to tell you to truth You should see our playbook A True Orange Subscription Is The Gift You Can Get

Mexico then whipped Utah State and North Texas before wrapping up the nonconference slate with a shutout of LousianaLafayette The Raiders fell at Texas AM to open league play Then they whitewashed Baylor before getting hammered by Nebraska Then they scared Kansas State in Manhattan before falling They outscored Kansas Saturday in Lawrence with sophomore QB Kliff Kingsbury hitting WR Derek Dorris for four touchdowns Leach is the guy who found Josh Heupel and lured him to Oklahoma last seaso n when he was the Sooners offensive coordinator The Sooners offensive success last year propeled him to the head job at Texas Tech and his offense is a pass first pass second and pass third offense just like the one the Sooners use The difference however is that there is only one Heupel But Kingsbury is very good Hes a sophomore who has thrown a nations leading passes th is year and who has hit of them He is No in the nation in total offense averaging yards per game One scary statistic is Texas Techs lofty No ranking in pass defense Th e Raiders are giving up only yards per game passing and they have intercepted passes If the Longhorns dont run any better than they have been running they wil l have to have some success throwing to have a chance to win One other worrisome thing is that Texas Tech is the second best team the Longhorns have played to this point Oklahoma with a record is the on ly other team the Horns have played with a winning record right now To win in Lubbock the Longhorns have to pressure Kingsbury and the offense and defense both have to remember to

hell hurt you Don Shows the highly successful coach at West Monroe La had much the sa me thing to say after his team mauled Lee in an earlyseason game Lees lone TD came on a yard run by Benson and it came on the third pla y of the game Shows whose teams are since said We dont usuall y give up runs like that and we stopped him pretty good most of the time Bu t our game plan was to have a lot of people on him on every play and even then he made some tough tough yardage Hes a hard back to stop especial ly if he gets a little room Not much has changed in the last week The Longhorns are still

October Longhorns Overcome Slow Start Blast Bears Last Three Games Pose Major Challenge The Longhorns spotted Baylor an early lead before a sellout crowd in Austin Saturday then stormed back for a win to run their season reco rd to and their Big mark to But road trips to Texas Tech and Kansas are next on the agenda and then a home game against Texas AM wraps up the regular season All three opponents are dangerous and the Longhorn offense and defense will need to start their motors running a lot quicker or things could get rough down the stretch But this was Baylor a team that had been blanked for three straight games Even a slow start isnt fatal against the Bears LouisianaLafayette and Baylor are the two weakest teams the Horns have faced and UT trailed LaLa before coasting to an easy win Lets hope higher quality opponents motivate the Texas players to start competing better from the opening kickoff Texas offense gave Baylor a short field with an early fumble and it took the Bears less than two minutes to notch their first October TD this year But the offense warmed up and QB Major Applewhite threw for yards and t wo touchdowns and even scored on a quarterback sneak The Bears chose to double cover sensational freshman WR Roy Williams and h is classmate and buddy B J Johnson made them pay by hauling in nine passes for yards and a TD the best single game ever by a UT freshman But it was the Longhorn defense that set the tone for this game After that early lapse the Texas defense allowed Baylors offense only one more net yard for the remainder of this first half and forced two turnovers that led to Texas points Capitalizing on the short field created by the outstanding defensive effort the Longhorns kicked two early field goals then blew the game open with a point second quarter The Longhorn defenders forced five Baylor turnovers including four interceptions two by CB Quentin Jammer and one each by SS Greg Brown a nd backup FS Phillip Geiggar The defense also held Baylor to net yards passing and rushin g while the UT offense amassed yards total offense passing and rushing The defense forced Baylor into possessions of three downs or less The Bears only had possessions Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER Baylor won the toss and deferred The Longhorns like they have all year struggled out of the starting gate They made two first downs but then blitzing Baylor DB Gary Baxter blindsided UT QB Major Applewhite and knocke d the ball loose The Bears recovered at the UT and scored in five plays with QB Guy Tomcheck hitting WR Martin Dossett for the final yards That put Baylor ahead with left Applewhite hit freshman TE Brock Edwards for yards on the Horns next possession to set up a yard fiel d goal by Kris Stockton that cut the Baylor lead to with left Starting from their own the Longhorns drove to the Baylor later in th e quarter primarily on the strength of a yard pass from Applewhite to freshman WR B J Johnson but the drive stalled and Stockton kicked a yard field goal to get the Horns back within one point at with left A bungled Baylor screen pass gave the Horns great field position in t he final minute of the quarter when RB Darrell Bush was ambushed by DE Cory Redding and fumbled with LB Everick Rawls recovering for a yard loss at the Baylor TB Hodges Mitchell carried three straight times for nine yards bringing up a fourthand at the Bear as the quarter ended Although they trailed the Horns had net yards offensively while Baylor had SECOND QUARTER Stockton kicked a yard field goal on the first play of the quarter to give the Horns a lead they would never relinquish at Baylor went threeplaysandout two straight times and after the second one the Longhorns finally found the end zone Applewhite hit Johnson for Brandon Healy for Mitchell for more and then Montrell Flowers for the final yards and the TD Stocktons kick gave Texas a lead with left After an exchange of punt UT safety Greg Brown intercepted Tomchecks pass at the Bear and returned it to the Applewhite hit Johnson to the then sneaked in for the TD Stocktons kick made it with left After another quick Baylor punt the Longhorns struck again Applewhite hit freshman WR Roy Williams for found Mitchell for more and then hit Johnson for yards and the TD Texas went for two points and Applewhite connected with Mitchell to make it with left At the half Texas had yards offensively to the Bears THIRD QUARTER Baylor got the ball first and drove to the Texas but a yard penalty and then sacks on successive plays by CB Quentin Jammer and redshirt freshm an DT Marcus Tubbs pushed the Bears back to near midfield and forced a punt Neither team mounted another drive until late in the period when Jammer got his second interception and ran it back to the Baylor A pass interferen ce penalty and an Applewhite pass to Johnson set up a yard Stockton FG to make it with left The Longhorns had yards at this point to Baylors FOURTH QUARTER Chris Simms relieved Applewhite at QB and had the Longhorns on the march at the Baylor before his pass into the right flat was picked off by Bear CB Eric Giddens who ran it back yards for Baylors final touchdown to cut the UT lead to with left Backup TBs Victor Ike and Kenny Hayt er alternated short runs and Simms went for for yards before Hayter got another UT touchdown on a oneyard plunge Stocktons kick gave Texas a lead with left The Longhorn backups scored again on their next possession driving yards in eight plays with Simms hitting freshman WR Sloan Thomas for yards and Ike getting the final yards for the touchdown on a fourthdown play Stocktons kick brought the final score to with left Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorns played really well defensively against Baylor but we just werent in sync on offense After viewing the game tapes he said the Longhorns are facing a tough fina l three regular season games and will have to play much better to have a chan ce to win For us to win the next three weeks we need to be more balanced Brown said We need to be able to run the ball He also said the Longhorns are more physical than they were early in the year but he said they need to be more physical particularly in being able to run the ball Baylor put a lot of guys around the line of scrimmage and made it harder f or us to run the ball he said But we still should have been more physical and we should have been able to run the ball The best thing we did offensively was pass protect he said The offensi ve line did a tremendous job of picking up all the blitzes He also praised tackles Leonard Davis and Mike Williams saying they are playing extremely well Running the ball successfully he said is an attitude When you take linemen the size of ours and keep pounding they the opposing linemen get tired Our staff has taken the position that were going to make the run work regardless of how many are stacked in there he said Well just hang in there and keep working at it Brown said the coaches decided to play freshman DT Adam Doiron because Shau n Rogers is still hampered by a sprained ankle Ryan Haywood is out for the year with a shoulder injury and Stevie Lee might be out for the year with a n ankle injury Asked how Doiron played he said He played really well He was in there f or plays and he had four tackles and he got in the right place on just abo ut every play I think he has a chance to be a real good player Brown said Doiron has wanted to play all year Well get a minimum of five games from him Sometimes you have to play some freshmen when you have injuries It was at about this time last year that we started playing Bo Scaife Playing Scaife from midseason on last year worked out well because he suffered a torn ACL during twoaday workouts He was lost for this season which will be counted as his redshirt year making him a sophomore in eligibility again next season True freshman TE Brock Edwards got his first start because Mike Jones is ou t for the year with a torn ACL Brown said I thought Brock did a really goo d job for his first game to start He dropped his first ball but then made a great catch in the corner and ran well after he caught it Brown said redshirt freshman DT Marcus Tubbs played his best game Tubbs has been starting while Shaun Rogers has been limited with a sprained ankle He had a sack and three tackles for losses Saturday Doiron Ninth True Freshman to Play Defensive tackle Adam Doiron played Saturday against Baylor and he is the ninth true freshman to see action this year Four true freshmen are starting They are tight end Brock Edwards defensiv e end Kalen Thornton and wide receivers Roy Williams and B J Johnson CB Nathan Vasher has started when the Longhorns open with a nickel defense five defensive backs Other true freshman who have played are defensive tackle Stevie Lee safety Phillip Geiggar and wide receive Sloan Thomas Coach Mack Brown said he probably will redshirt the remainder of the freshm an class Fullback Will Matthews has been impressive on the scout team and probably would have played this season but he was bothered by severe headaches duri ng the early drills and that set him back Other freshmen who are redshirting but who are drawing praise from the starters for their work on the scout teams are QB Chance Mock RB Sneezy Beltran WR Tony Jeffery OT Lionel Garr and LB Austin Sendlein The current UT freshman class was rated as high as No in the country by the various recruiting services and it came on the heels of a class that was a runaway choice as the best class in the country The class was headed by Cory Redding and Chris Simms the USA Today defensive and offensive players of the year That was a great class and it is living up to its press clippings Redding is starting TE Bo Scaife was to start before his knee injury OGs Derrick Dockery and Tillman Holloway have started CB Roderick Babers is a starter and so is safety Dakarai Pearson DT Marcus Tubbs also has started But I think the current freshman class is even better with four players starting as true freshmen and several more playing key roles Williams already holds the yardage record for Longhorn freshmen receivers and Johnson is third and holds the freshman single game yardage record They are the two best freshmen wide receivers I have ever seen and Thomas and Jeffery make it a great foursome because they are outstanding receivers too The Longhorns will be a lot better next year than they are this year becaus e all of those top freshmen and sophomores will be a year older and will have one more year of experience But just think how good they will be when those two classes are juniors and seniors and are backed up by the outstanding class the coaches are recruiti ng right now and the one they will get next year Injury Update Offensive guard Antwan KirkHughes was held out of the Baylor game to give his sore shoulder a rest and he probably will be able to play at Texas Tec h Saturday The knee injury TE Mike Jones suffered turned out to be a torn ACL so he will undergo surgery and will be out for the rest of the season That leaves freshman Brock Edwards as the only healthy tight end Fullback Cha d Stevens a former tight end has been working at both positions Safety Lee Jackson suffered a leg injury in the Baylor game and is questionable for Saturday Freshman defensive tackle Stevie Lee who underwent foot surgery to repair a broken bone about a month ago is due to be examined again this week to see if he can return this season Lee is eligible for a medical redshirt year if he is unable to play again this season Redshirt freshman wide receiver Artie Ellis is having problems with the sam e shin injury that hampered him during spring practice He had a stress fracture then and the same shin is sore again He is not expected to play at Tech Others who are likely to miss the Tech game are outside linebacker O J McClintock sprained knee and defensive tackle Ryan Haywood shoulder injury The True Orange FaxEMail

advantage of some matchups An offense has to have the ability to win both ways running or throwing That took away som e of their blitzes We also wanted to change the tempo We werent pleased wi th the tempo to start the game UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis explaining why the Longhorns went primarily with the passing game out of the shotgun formation I thought we played good after that early touchdown Thank goodness we didnt play for a shutout Our kids came out and played hard They made som e plays that changed field position UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese I have to give Texas credit They have a very good defensive team We had a pretty broad selection of formations and plays but we never really got in sync and Texas had a lot to do with that Baylor head coach Kevin Steele You dont come out and try to set records It just happens Setting record s isnt important I just want to win UT WR B J Johnson who caught nine passes for yards the best da y ever for a Longhorn freshman receiver Gary Baxter is a great cornerback and they tried to do some things on the weak side with him pressing Roy Williams and a safety helping out over th e top That freed B J to get a oneonone matchup and he took advantage of it Texas receivers coach Darryl Drake discussing how the Bears tried to put the clamps on one of the Longhorns outstanding freshmen wide receivers on ly to see another one have a record day It was pretty tough out there Baxter is a tough corner and they had a safety helping out a lot Roy Williams UTs freshman receiver who still managed to catch three passes for yards and run his season receiving yardage total to yards the best ever for a Longhorn freshman Its an honor but its a team award The thing I was disappointed in toda y is that we werent sharp to start the game Sometimes it was a bad pass sometimes it was a drop and sometimes it was a missed block but for whatever reason we just werent sharp Were going to Lubbock next week an d well have to

November Mitchell Stockton Defense Lead Longhorns Past Raiders Applewhite Hurts Other Knee It was a game of surges weather wise and on the football field Saturday night in Lubbock and Texas triumphed because the Longhorns had two surges and Texas Tech had only one The Longhorns dominated the first quarter an d most of the second in cold rainy soldout Jones Stadium coming out smoking offensively for the first time all season Midway through the second quarter Texas was ahead and seemingly on the way to an easy win But Texas Tech scored points before intermission then scored again early in the second half to take a lead Despite losing QB Major Applewhite to a knee injury the right one not the surgically repaired left one the Longhorns roared back to score the game s final points to claim the victory and stay alive in the Big title cha se Coach Mack Brown said an MRI was done on Applewhites knee Sunday and he hopes to know the results sometime Monday He said he is hoping it is just a sprain The Longhorn heroes were plentiful Offensively the entire line played great TB Hodges Mitchell was tremendous and Kris Stockton booted five fiel d goals and narrowly missed on a yard attempt late in the first half Mitchell had carries for yards and scored both Longhorn touchdowns He also caught six passes for yards Defensively the Horns forced five turnovers which the offense converted into points and shut the Raider offense out for the final minutes The victory gave Texas a season record and Big mark while Tech fell to overall and in the Big If Texas AM upsets Oklahoma this weekend the Longhorns can tie the Sooner s for the Big South title by beating Kansas and AM to close the regular season By virtue of their win over the Horns the Sooners would represent the Sout h in the title game but the tie and a record would land the Longhorns in a top bowl game The Longhorns have won four games in a row after a slow start this season Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER The Longhorns moved the ball all over the field in the first quarter and to ok a lead They got the ball first and drove yards to the Tech with Mitchell getting all of the yardage on six tough runs behind good blocking and a yard pass reception But the drive stalled and Stockton kicked a yard field goal for a lead with left Tech went three plays an d out and Mitchell led another Longhorn drive that went yards for a touchdown and a lead with left He carried four times for yard s including a yard burst over right tackle for the TD Applewhite also hit freshman TE Brock Edwards for yards during the drive With the aid of tw o penalties against UT the Raiders drove to the Texas and QB Kliff Kingsbury hit WR Tim Baker at the but Baker fumbled and the Horns recovered and were on the move again when the quarter ended SECOND QUARTER The drive that started at the Texas stalled at the TT but Stocktons yard field goal gave UT a leadwith left UT safety Greg Brown s interception of a long Kingsbury pass killed Techs next effort but Texas couldnt move and punted for the first time Kingsbury operating out of th e shotgun bobbled a low snap and UT CB Ahmad Brooks fell on the loose ball a t the Raiders The Horns picked up a first down at the but Mitchell wa s stopped for no gain and two passes were incomplete so Stockton kicked a yard field goal for a lead with left But the Raiders came rig ht back and Kingsbury hit WR Carlos Francis for a yard touchdown strike tha t cut the UT lead to with remaining Texas had to punt and Tech aided by a pass interference penalty drove to the UT before settling fo r a yard field goal to cut the deficit to with left Applewhite was sacked and fumbled on UTs next possession giving the Raiders great field position at the Texas But the Longhorn defense held and a yard field goal try fell short UT drove to the Tech but Stocktons yard field goal try just missed to the left in the final seconds of the half THIRD QUARTER Tech got the ball to start the half but couldnt mount a drive But Applewhites pass was picked off by Tech DB John Norman who ran it back t o the UT Kingsbury got yards on a QB draw which was the longest Raide r run of the game and Ricky Williams went over the top for the final yard T he extra point put Tech on top with left But that lead was shor t lived Starting from their the Longhorns drove to the Tech before Applewhite was sacked on a thirddown play He came up limping and never returned to the game Stockton booted a yard field goal to put Texas bac k on top with left The Raiders went three plays and out and so did the Longhorns but Stocktons punt was fumbled at the Tech and Micha el Ungar recovered for the Horns Behind great blocking Mitchell ran for then for the final and the TD that gave Texas a little breathing room at with left The Raiders were driving as the quarter ended FOURTH QUARTER DE Cole Pittman sacked Kingsbury on the first play of the quarter and CB Roderick Babers intercepted Kingsburys pass two plays later and ran it bac k yards to the Tech Mitchell carried fiv e times fror yards and Simms under a big rush found Johnson for yards But a penalty set the Horns back and Stockton came in to boot his fifth field goal a yarder to put the Horns on top with left The Raiders killed most of the clock with a long drive that came up empty They drove from their own to the UT so slowly and laboriously that the clock ran from to by the time their fourthdown pass sailed incomplete The drive would have end ed much earlier but for two strange penalties against the Horns One was a la te offside call after UT recovered a fumble and the other was a personal foul on UT DE Cory Redding after he sacked Kingsbury The officials said the foul w as a blow to the head but Redding didnt appear to hit him in the head At an y rate after the fourthdown play failed Mitchell carried six straight time s for yards and two first downs to run out the rest of the clock Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday QB Major Applewhites knee injury Saturday nig ht does not appear to be as serious as the one he suffered in the Cotton Bowl game against Arkansas The injury to Applewhites left knee in the Cotton Bowl required surgery to repair a torn ACL anterier cruciate ligament Brown said the injury to his right knee Saturday in Lubbock might be just a sprain Im not a doctor so I dont know he said Were having an MRI done today and well know more tomorrow But Applewhite had to be taken off the field on a stretcher in the Cotton Bowl and he was standing on the sideline with Brown at the end of the Texas Tech game We were standing on the sideline at the end of the game Brown said He walked off the field with me He was upbeat and excited about the game It sure didnt look like what happened to him in the Arkansas game He said Chris Simms played well in relief and he said the fact that Simms played as much as he did early this season is a big plus if Applewhites injury turns out to be serious Chris progresses every time he walks out on the field Brown said He pu t a tremendous amount of pressure on himself early in the season I felt like last night was the most comfortable he has been There is no doubt in our minds that Chris is more ready to play now than h e was at the first of the season Brown said Simms threw only two passes and he completed both of them As he said my main job was pitching to Hodges left and pitching to Hodges right With Hodges Mitchell rushing for yards and carries both career high s and the line opening huge holes that was the Longhorn offense for most of the night Brown also said he probably wouldnt take the redshirt off freshman QB Chan ce Mock if Applewhites injury is serious Well talk about that Id think right now wed play Beau Trahan Brown said freshman TE Brock Edwards played really well and he said DT Casey Hampton DEs Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton LB DeAndre Lewis and D Bs Quentin Jammer Rod Babers and Greg Brown played well too He said LB Tyro ne Jones had by far his best game He also said the offensive line played great and Hodges did a great job of picking his holes Weve shown the ability in the last four games to throw it or run it We couldnt do that earlier in the year Brown said the five Tech turnovers were a great credit to the UT defense a nd he said Im really proud of the offense to with four minutes left take it and drive it on the ground and run out the clock Ive alway said you need to be able to run the ball in the fourth quarter to win Owens Thomas Lead Horns Junior forward Chris Owens had points and rebounds and freshm an forward James Thomas had points and nine rebounds to lead the Longhorn basketball team to a exhibition victory over Team Ezybonds of Austral ia before fans at the Frank Erwin Center Sunday night I think for

Then they defeated Missouri and Colorado before dropping a game to Texas Tech and then getting hammered by Nebraska The Jayhawks have a unique offense QB Dylen Smith is one of the rare quarterbacks who feels just as comfortable running the option or dropping back into a fourwide receiver set He is and fast and shifty Texas coach Mack Brown says Smith is a really athletic quarterback who has a great arm and who can make plays with his arm or his quick feet He also says RB David Winbush is the leading rusher in Kansas history and thats a school that has had Gale Sayers and John Riggins of Chicago Bears and Washington Redskins fame respectively WR Harrison Hill is one of the best in the league Defensively nose tackle Nate Dwyer is the anchor in the middle of the line and LBs Chaz Murphy and Andrew LeClair are big run stoppers The Jayhawks are giving up more yards than they are gaining which is never a good sign but they have been impressive at times particularly when they a re playing at home The Longhorns are a point favorite but this is a dangerous road game because Kansas has to beat Texas and then Iowa State next week to qualify f or a bowl game To win the Horns need to start quickly like they did in Lubbock and the defense needs to pressure Smith and keep Winbush under control If Major Applewhites knee injury turns out to be serious they also need t o have a

Dallas Carter created quite a stir last week when he was quoted in the Dallas News as saying he remains committed to Texas but might take a visit or two just to be sure of his commitment Texas coach Mack Brown generally sees a commitment as being binding on both parties He tells recruits when they are ready to commit that UT will guarantee them scholarships and they are supposed to guarantee they will honor their commitments and refrain from visiting other schools Scott has talked off an on about visiting other schools but he hasnt set up any visits yet Ill keep you posted if he does QBAthlete Kendal Briles of Wollforth Frenship another UT pledge says Nebraska continues to recruit him but he says he is solid for the Longhorn s Central Texas normally doesnt have very many top recruits but four of bes t in the state and in the nation his year are in Central Texas and three of them play in District A which stretches from Waco in the north to Georgetown in the south Those four recruits will go a long ways toward determining whether the Longhorns have a great recruiting class or just a very good one The A players are DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison LB Derrick Johns on of Waco and DB Dewayne Brandon of Temple The other top prospect is QBAthlete Quan Cosby of Mart who led his team t o a record and a Class A state title last year Texas is recruiting all four of them and has the lead with Johnson Brandon and Cosby Harris has favored Texas when he lists a preference but he has been more noncommital about his college choice recently Texas has a good chance to get all four of them and that would really put t he icing on an already outstanding recruiting class Student Sports magazine currently has UT ranked No behind Michigan in th e national recruiting rankings If the Horns get three or four of those Central Texans I mentioned earlier they will have a great shot at the top spot And for those of you who have expressed concern that the Longhorns twolos s season could pose a problem Michigan has three losses already A seaso n at this point is a very good year to sell to recruits I still expect the Longhorns to sign or kids With already committed that leaves room for only six or seven more players In addition to the obvious recruiting targets I have been writing about recently there are two super prospects in Louisiana who are talking about taking official visits to Texas the weekend of the TexasTexas AM game They are DT Marquise Hill of New Orleans De La Salle and TE Marcus Spears of Baton Rouge Southern Lab The two Louisiana prospects and DL Kaelen Jakes of Valenci a Cal are the only outofstate prospects on the Longhorn radar screen at this time UT has a very good shot at Jakes Hill and Spears are long shots A True Orange Subscription Is The

November Mitchell SimmstoWilliams Combination Way Too Much For Jayhawks Aggies Next Kansas came out smoking in damp freezing Lawrence Saturday taking a lead over Texas before the sparse crowd had time to settle down but the Longhorns came storming back for an easy victory Senior TB Hodges Mitchell broke the UT and Big records for allpurpose yardage in a single game He had yards rushing yards in receptions and yards in punt returns for total yards He also scored two touchdowns But sophomore QB Chris Simms subbing for the injured Major Applewhite and sensational freshman WR Roy Williams also were huge offensive guns for the Longhorns Simms passed for yards and two touchdowns and Williams caught four of h is passes for yards and both touchdowns all in the first half Willia ms also added a yard touchdown on a new play an end around Williams a true freshman already held the season record in reception yardage and in touchdowns for freshmen Kansas coach Terry Allen said his defense was able to hold Mitchells production down early but then we had to doublecover Williams and that opened some running lanes When this UT offense is clicking its hard for a defense to stop because Mitchell just needs a little crease to be productive and he gets those creases regularly when Williams draws double coverage It takes a brave or foolhardy coach to consistently single cover Williams a pounder with awesome speed and leaping ability The victory gave Texas an season record and Big mark heading into an open week and then the big regular season finale the day after Thanksgiving against Texas AM The Longhorns have won five games in a row after a start Here briefly is how the game went FIRST QUARTER The Longhorns started fearfully slow offensively and defensively Texas got the ball first couldnt make a first down and punted quickly Kansas score d in three plays with WR Derick Mills going the final yards on a reverse to give the Jayhawks a lead with left On the fourth play after the kickoff Simms pass in the left flat was picked off and returned yards for a touchdown by KU CB Andrew Davison That put the Jayhawks on top with left The Longhorns finally got something going on their third possession driving from their own to a first down at the Kansas but they stalled and Kris Stockton kicked a yard field goal to cut the defic it to with left Longhorn LB DeAndre Lewis pounced on a Kansas fumb le four plays later to set the Longhorn s up at the Jayhawk Simms hit Williams behind Davison for a touchdown on the first play to cut the Kansas lead to with left The Longhorns decided to go for a point conversion but it backfired when Simms under pressure threw into the end zone and Kansas safety Carl Nesmith picked it off and returned it plus yards for two point for the Jayhawks and a lead Huge Longhorn OT Leonard Davis showed a lot of heart on that play chasing Nesmith all the w ay down the sideline But that was the last highlight for the Jayhawks They h ad to punt from their own and the punter shanked it to the KU With the Jayhawks now aware of Williams and his longdistance threat Mitchell ran f or then more and then for the TD Stocktons kick tied it at wi th seconds left SECOND QUARTER The Texas defense forced the Jayhawks to punt quickly and Williams got behi nd Davison again on the first play and Simms hit him for a yard touchdown play Stocktons kick put UT on top for the first time only seconds deep in the quarter Mitchell set up the Horns next touchdown with a yard punt return to the Kansas Simms scrambled for four yards then hit Williams again to the Jayhawk Mitchell scored on the next play for a left with second left in the half Texas had a edge in yardage and a advantage in first downs THIRD QUARTER Kansas had a good drive to open the second half but redshirt freshman safe ty Dakarai Pearson stopped it with an interception at the UT Later in the period Williams scored on a yard end around to give Texas a lead with left Mitchells yard punt return to the Texas got the Longhorns started on their next drive Simms picked up nine yards on a scramble then Mitchell ran for more than then for another TD to run the score to with left FOURTH QUARTER Backup TB Victor Ike scored the final touchdown on a yard run with left Backup QB Beau Trahan one of the teams top special teams players relieved Simms and played most of the quarter Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorns are a much better football team than they were early this season He said the teams fivegame winning streak is something they worked very hard to achieve I am very proud of our team over the past five weeks he said To win three conference games on the road including backtoback away contests against teams that all had something to prove shows me that our team is no t only tough but is gaining more confidence As a result they are also earning back some of their national respect h e said Brown said playing straight weeks worked a real hardship on the team an d he said the open date this week is very welcome He said the regular season finale against Texas AM on Nov the Friday after Thanksgiving will be a tough one We will use this week to prepare for Texas AM which I think has been underrated all year he said JaMar Toombs is one of the best tailbacks in the country and Robert Ferguson is one of the top receivers It also looks to me as if they have improved their offense with quarterbac k Mark Farris taking the helm and defensively they are the same great team that they have always been We will have our hands full in two weeks But he said the Longhorns have improved so much that they have a chance to close strong if they keep working hard He also said sophomore QB Chris Simms subbing for the injured Major Applewhite gets better every time he gets to play I was pleased with the way he came back after his rough start Brown said He showed the ability to scramble and make plays He also displayed good leadership in the huddle Brown said We should ha ve thrown the ball more in the second half but we still wanted to be physica l and use the running game as much as possible Brown said the victory at Kansas was a big one because it was the second straight tough road trip and the players really kept their focus Overall we felt that it was a very good win for us We were able to play everybody that we took on the trip and came out of the game very well Offensively we won the field position battle with our kicking game Roy Williams played great and we were obviously pleased to have plays in th e running game produce about yards In fact he said we have felt good about our running game over the last five weeks as Hodges Mitchell has established himself as one of the best running backs in the country In terms of the quarterback position we only threw the ball three times i n the second half but I thought Chris Simms got better as the game went on He hit big plays in the passing game and kept moving the chains for us Defensively Brown said we didnt let Kansas score again after their first drive so we also played very well on that side of the ball Brown said he knew the Longhorns had hit the jackpot when they signed WRs Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas last February but he said the freshmen receivers are even better than he thought I have been very impressed with the maturity of Roy Sloan and BJ he said Yesterday was a day that young players could have been flat because of the cold weather and lack of a big crowd I have been amazed all year with how these freshmen play as if they are older The young players have compet ed and showed a lot of maturity which is hard to do at that age Brown said he has been telling the team it needs to keep winning to have a shot at a good bowl game We try to have a theme each week he said and our theme last week was t o put ourselves in position to go to the best bowl possible Regardless of what bowl it is we know we do not get to choose he said I went through the bowls available to our team last week which was the only time this year that we have mentioned bowls I also showed our players the records of each team in the league and told them that it is critical for them to beat Kansas he said adding that eac h win improves the bowl picture for the team Horns Climb to th in AP Texas is ranked th in this weeks Associated Press poll Five Big teams are in the top headed by topranked Oklahoma the onl y team remaining with a perfect record Other Big teams ranked are Kansas State at No Nebraska at No and Texas AM at No One cautionary note should be injected here There is a very good reason wh y Texas has not finished in the APs top since It is the fact that every time the Longhorns got close to the top or actually got in the top the unthinkable happened and they lost and went tumbling down the rankings You have to go back no farther than the start of this season The Horns opened at No and in the second week of the season they ventured out to Palo Alto and got upset by Stanford They havent been close to the top since until now If they beat the Aggies and win their bowl game they will break that ye ar drought but thats a big if A Clutch Freshman True freshman WR Roy Williams has been Mr Clutch for the Longhorns He is averaging yards per catch on his seven touchdown receptions In addition five of his TD grabs came when the Horns were behind or tied a nd the other two came when UT held either a point or point lead Basketball Team Opens The Longhorn mens basketball team opens its season tonight Monday when i t hosts Navy at pm in the Erwin Center in the opening round of the Preseason NIT Texas won its two preseason exhibition games leading up to the start of th e regular season showing a surprisingly strong inside game without departed big men Chris Mihm and Gabe Muoneke Freshman forward James Thomas was a big factor in both exhibition games He had points and nine rebounds in the victory over EA Sports California AllStars Wednesday after getting points and nine boards in t he triumph overTeam Ezybonds of Australia last Sunday Junior forward Chris Owens had points and seven rebounds against the California team and points and rebounds against Ezybonds Junior swingman Maurice Evans a transfer from Wichita State had points seven rebounds and three blocks against EA Sports and freshman Brian Boddicker had points and eight boards in just minutes Junior transfer point guard Fredie Williams scored five points three steal s and nine assists against only three turnovers Lee Will Get Medical Redshirt Coach Mack Brown said Sunday freshman DT Stevie Lee wont play against Texa s AM because the broken bone in his foot has not allowed him to begin practicing That means Lee will get a medical redshirt and will be a redshirt freshman next year He was injured in the third game and anyone who suffers a seasonending injury prior to the fourth game is eligible for a medical redshirt year INJURY NOTES Brown said starting QB Major Applewhite is questionable for t he Aggie game He suffered a knee sprain against Texas Tech and missed the Kansas game Brown said safety Lee Jacksons leg injury is much better and he probably will play against AM WR Artie Ellis shin and TE Brock Edwards leg are both questionable for the Aggie game Edwards injury left the Horns with converted FB Chad Stevens as the only healthy scholarship TE at Kansas DT Shaun Rogers played without reinjuring his ankle and should be closer to for the Aggie game than he has been since early this season OG Antwan KirkHughes has been having problems with a shoulder and it bothered him during the Kansas game but the week off should give him a chance to be ready for the Aggie game The True Orange FaxEMail Deal Is a Great Christmas Gift Ill Have Frequent Reports on Recruiting And Practice

We had to regain our composure after our slow start We had to get the strong safety removed a little bit and the long passes from Chris Simms to Roy Williams caused him to start playing back a little That opened it up more for the run UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis Im not sure Ive seen one like that We tried to double cover him but th at didnt always work either Kansas head coach Tim Allen talking about the problems created for hi s team by sensational Longhorn freshman receiver Roy Williams I knew what was going through their minds Holy cow another one All quarterbacks throw interceptions It just seems like mine go for touchdowns In not used to throwing it away I always try to find a place to fit it in but this is a different level I guess Im going to have to learn the hard way but at least Im learning UT QB Chris Simms talking about the two interceptions Kansas ran bac k all the way one for a touchdown and the other for two points on an errant conversion pass Ive been saying prayers for Joe Beene I dedicated this game to him He used to cover me on the scout team Hes a good friend and its really sad TexasWR Roy Williams talking about the terrible injury to his former Odessa Permian teammate who is paralyzed from the chin down after sufferin g a cracked vertebrae in practice earlier in the week The big man is really good Simms talking about Williams Hodges Mitchell really gets the job done If we give him just a little hole he really gets through it in a hurry Longhorn OT Leonard Davis the biggest man on the team talking about one of the smallest I didnt think I was going to get to yards again but these last two games really helped The offensive line is just doing a great job Texas TB Hodges Mitchell who has yards rushing to give him backtoback yard seasons I thought he was a pretty easy quarterback to read I just stepped in fron t of the receiver caught the ball and I was gone I dont know what happened after that I guess after the first one I got I thought I knew what he was going to do so I cheated a little Kansas CB Andrew Davison who returned one of Chris Simms passes for a touchdown but then gave up four completions from Simms to Roy

heading into the game and Tex as is also a game ahead in the race for second place in the Big South with a record to AMs The Aggies like the Longhorns had a slow start this season They opened with a loss at Notre Dame before winning three straight over Wyomin g UTEP and Texas Tech But then they were upset at home by previously winless Colorado Much like the debacle in Dallas caused Texas to bear down and start playing better the loss to Colorado seemed to bring out the best in AM Since that disappointing loss they have defeated Baylor Iowa State and Northern Division leader Kansas State before losing to topranked Oklahoma Saturday by a razorthin margin Mark Farris a yearold sophomore who gave pro baseball a whirl before winning the AM QB job has put some life into the Aggies offense He is a very cool and very accurate passer and he has some outstanding receivers Huge TBFB JaMar Toombs also is an effective weapon But it is on defense where the Aggies win or lose most games The Longhorns outstanding defense actually has better statistics overall but the Aggies are No in the country in scoring defense giving up an average of only points per game There are four keys to a UT victory two on offense one on defense and one on special teams Offensively they must be balanced and they cant lose the turnover battle and they surely cant stand any touchdowns by the Aggie defense Defensively they have to shut down the Aggie running game and pressure Farris On special teams the Aggies are good at blocking punts and the Longhorns have had some blocked Thats a nono if the Horns

annual football banquet Nearly all of the recruits who have already committed to Texas have chos en that weekend to visit and so have most of the players the Longhorns are still recruiting The list of players the Longhorns are still seriously recruiting is continuing to shrink At this point there are recruits left on the board who a have offers or will get offers if they check out okay academically and b are strongly considering the Longhorns They are DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison LB Derrick Johnson of Waco D L Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal TE James Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson bot h of Galena Park North Shore OL Jamie Hightower of Jacksonville OL William Winston of Houston Madison safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple athlete Quan Cosby of Mart and DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC Most of the remaining six or seven scholarships will go to the players in that group Johnson Jakes Moses Jackson and Brandon all list Texas No at this point and it is possible the Longhorns will get all five of them Winston also says Texas is tops with him right now but he also wants to lo ok at several outofstate schools Harris is the remaining recruit who is No on my wish list for two excellent reasons First he is the top DT prospect in the country Second he is the only top DT who is considering the Longhorns But Oklahoma is making a big run at him and he is listening He also is being heavily recruited by Florida State and he plans to visit the Seminole s this weekend Harris earlier listed Texas No but now says the Sooners and Seminoles a re his top two teams He plans to visit Texas the Dec weekend and has another trip set up to Texas AM the Dec weekend There actually is another top DT who is interested in Texas Broussard but he has many academic hurdles to clear Jakes has already visited Texas and the other nine players in that man grouping all say they plan to visit Texas the Dec weekend unless their teams are still in the high school playoffs Their teams will have to be really good to be still in the playoffs at that point because that will be the weekend of the state semifinals in some classes and the finals in other classes There are some other great prospects who are long shots but are still in the picture They are headed by DT Marquise Hill of New Orleans De La Salle and DE Justin Tomerlin of San Clemente Cal Tomerlin has been committed to Florida State for several weeks but now say s he wants to visit several other schools including Texas He says he still is committed to FSU Im not sure he will visit but if he does there is a chance Hill says he will take an official visit to Texas the Thanksgiving weekend and will attend the TexasAM game Hill has already visited LSU and plans to visit Michigan the Dec weekend Georgia the Dec weekend and Georgia Tech the Dec weekend He said his big three are Michigan LSU and Texas Heres a list of the Horns early commitments Offensive Line Jonathan Scott Dallas Carter Abe Robinson Jersey Village Alfio Randall

Briles Wolfforth Frenship Braden Johnson Euless Trinity Brian Carter The Woodlands Punter Brian Bradford Trinity Valley JC The Bowl Picture If the Longhorns defeat Texas AM on the Friday after Thanksgiving they wi ll wind up in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas the Holiday Bowl in San Diego or the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio Those three bowls get the top three picks from the Big in that order after the BCS takes the league champion Conventional wisdom holds that Texas and the Cotton Bowl wont hook up agai n because the Longhorns have already played there on two consecutive New Year s Days But dont be too sure The Cotton Bowl brass likes the Longhorns and Texas coach Mack Brown loves New Years Day bowls If that doesnt come to pass then it will be either the Holiday or Alamo bowl for the Longhorns What if Texas loses to Texas AM I hate to consider the unthinkable and I wont until and unless that happens But if it does well all need to do some research on the Insightcom Bowl the Independence Bowl and maybe the Galleryfurniturecom Bowl UT Women Impressive Sophomore guard Tai Dillard scored a careerhigh points and led three Longhorns in doublefigure scoring as Texas captured a victory over Tulane Sunday at the Erwin center in the second round of the Preseason Womens National Invitation Tournament WNIT With the win Texas advances to the Preseason WNIT semifinal and championship rounds next Sunday and Monday at a site to be determined Texas joins No Louisiana Tech and No Virginia in the fourteam semifinals No Purdue hosts Georgetown today Monday in the final game to determine the fourth semifinalist The Preseason WNIT semifinal pairings will be Texas versus the PurdueGeorgetown winner and Louisiana Tech versus Virginia The Preason WNIT committee has announced that if Purdue defeats Georgetown then the Boilermakers will serve as the host school for the Preseason WNIT semifinals Sunday and thirdplace and championship games Monday in West Lafayette Indiana If Georgetown upsets Purdue then the Preseason WNIT semifinals and championship round will be hosted by Texas at the Erwin Center The site an d times will be announced late Monday Joining Dillard in doublefigure scoring were junior forward Tracy Cook wh o tallied points and senior guard JoRuth Woods who chipped in with points Woods added a teamhigh seven rebounds and had five assists which tied her best career night total Texas shot percent from the floor of while the Green Wave hit percent of their shots for Texas shot from the field in the first half en route to a lead in the win over Tulane Tulane turned the ball over times while UT committed turnovers The Horns also held an advantage in steals to nine while Tulane outrebounded Texas UT also scored points off turnovers to Tulanes Texas had advanced to the WNIT second round with Fridays win over Wichita State while Tulane bested Grambling State in the first round Woods had points and Cook added points in the victory over Wichita State in the season opener for both squads The Longhorns who never trailed in the game were aided by an outstanding for effort from the free throw line as they hit percent of thei r foul shots The Longhorns also shot percent from the floor and outscored the Shockers in the paint Wichita State was held to a percent shooting performance as the Shockers hit just of shots WSU also turned the ball over times while UT committed turnovers Also scoring in double figures against Wichita State were Dillard who had points and freshman forward Stacy Stephens who had points a gamehigh eight rebounds and had a gamehigh seven steals in her first game as a Longhorn In both their games the Longhorns have shown much better quickness and athleticism as a team than they showed last season This was a good first outing for us Conradt said We wanted to have a strong effort on the defensive end of the floor and we succeeded We are starting and playing a lot of young people she said and at this point in time I think we have the athletic ability the quickness and the depth to play solid defense and press Success starts with defense and we were really good again today on D Conradt added We came out with excellent intensity on defense and it helped that we started off shooting strongly As we look ahead to the WNIT semifinals and if Purdue wins against Georgetown then well be playing on the road in West Lafayette Conradt said If we do go on the road I think we all welcome the opportunity to see how we stack up against a top team and how we handle the pressure of being away from

State Zip Your Name Any Message You Want on Card True Orange Observations I think it is time for the Texas Athletic Department to do some major soul searching about the way it treats Longhorn football fans This season has set a modern day record for callous treatment of some of th e most loyal fans in all of college football First there was that unconscionable am kickoff of the LousianaLafayette game in early September and then another am kickoff for the Oklahoma game I know some older Longhorn fans who had to miss the LouisianaLafayette gam e because their doctors told them it would be hazardous to their health to attend because they would be exposed to a potentially deadly combination of extreme heat and three to four solid hours of blazing sunlight beaming down on them Both those games were on TV and that is always the excuse UT athletic officials come up with when kickoff times are inconvenient Most of us go along with things like that because nearly all of our games a re televised Last season of the were on TV But three games this season arent being televised and two of them Colorado and Kansas are the longest road trips the Longhorns have in B ig Conference play The game in Colorado was nixed to allow Texas AM at Baylor to be televised and the Kansas game this Saturday wont be televised so the Iowa State at Colorado game can be aired I know the TV folks dont worry about fan inconvenience but UT athletic officials certainly should and one thing they should include in the deal if they decide to inconvenience their fans with am kickoffs in early September heat is assurance that the two longest road trips on the conferen ce schedule wont be nixed for TV One subscriber who couldnt attend the LaLa game because of his doctors orders told me Athletic Director Deloss Dodds should sit outside in the hea t with the regular fans and he wouldnt ever have another am kickoff for a Sept game I think most fans are willing to accept some inconvenience but I think the y expect some sort of a trade off In other words if we need to have some early games for TV then we should get preference on the TV for the faraway games especially when they go up against the likes of AM at Baylor and Iowa State at Colorado It wouldnt have been a hard sell But apparently no one in the UT Athletic Department thought enough of the fans to ask for a quid pro quo Lets hope they do next year After all it takes pretty loyal fans to sell out big stadiums Saturday after Saturday when their team hasnt finished in the top in long years Horns Sign Fine Baseball Class Texas baseball coach Augie Garrido has signed of the top high school players in Texas and throughout the country Through the hard work of recruiting coordinator Tommy Harmon Frank Anders on and the entire

country and Curtis Thigpen of Forney who batted last season for Forney High School and is also regarded as an outstanding defensive backstop and outfielder Other signees were Seth Johnston of Boerne

Bill Snyder is outstanding at winning games but is not popul ar with the bowl committee members because they feel he is a very reluctant participant in the prebowl festivities So the Wildcats probably wont affect the Longhorns bowl hopes because th ey will either beat Oklahoma and get an automatic BCS bid or the will lose to the Sooners and be picked for a bowl bid after the Longhorns are already

on the AllTournament Team by freshman forward Annissa Hastings who came off the bench to score a careerhigh points to lead Texas to a win over Louisville in the first round of the tourney Saturday night Texas hit of free throws including a six for eight performance in t he final seconds to ice the championship game The Longhorns are and off to their best start since the season Coach Jody Conradt said she is very pleased with the way her young team i s improving Recruiting Roundup Lets get the bad news out of the way first because there is a lot of good news to brighten the overall picture The bad news is that the Horns really have an uphill fight in their bid to sign the states top recruit DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison Oklahoma has the inside track now and the Sooners will have to stumble on the field or in their recruiting of Harris to give the Horns a chance to g et back in the race Nearly all of the recruits who have already committed to Texas have chos en plan to take their official visits the Dec weekend and so have most of the players the Longhorns are still recruiting That is the weekend of the annual football banquet and the only Longhorn pledges who wont be taking official visits that weekend are DE Eric Hall o f Clarksville Tenn who took his official visit earlier and possibly playe rs like RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee and QBAthlete Kendal Briles of Wollforth Frenship because they play on teams that might be still alive in the state playoffs in midDecember Benson last years Class A Offensive Player of the Year had carries f or yards and three touchdowns on runs of and yards in a thumping of El Paso Franklin in the state playoffs last weekend He also scored on a yard screen pass Briles last years Class A Offensive Player of the year completed of passes for yards and five touchdowns in a romp past El Paso Ysleta Briles who led Stephenville to the state A title last year has thrown fo r more than yards and touchdown and has run for more than yards and more TDs so far this season Despite rumors galore to the contrary both Benson and Briles said they remain solidly committed to Texas With scholarships already committed Texas will give only five to seven more this season They could go as high as seven because they can count punter Brian Bradford of Trinity Valley JC who will enroll in January against last year The best players still available who list the Longhorns No are LB Derric k Johnson of Waco DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal TE James Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson both of Galena Park North Shore OL William Winston of Houston Madison safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple athlete Quan Cosby of Ma rt and DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC Most of the remaining six or seven scholarships will go to the players in that group DT Marquise Hill of New Orleans De La Salle and DE Justin Tomerlin of San Clemente Cal are a couple of outstanding prospects who might visit Texas but they are the longest of long shots rig ht now Top recruits who came to the AM game were DTs Harris and Broussard and Longhorn commitments OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Mike Garcia of Galena Park and Terrance Young of Longview LBs Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison and Lance McFarland of Jefferson and RB Anthony Johnson of Jefferso n Two top junior prospects also were on hand OL Kyle Thornton of Dallas St Marks and WR Anthony Wright of Klein Forest Thornton is the younger brother of Longhorn freshman DE starter Kalen Thornton Aggie Injury Excuses Hollow The Aggies players and coaches did a lost of postgame moaning about their injury problems For the second straight year Texas was missing starting QB Major Applewhit e against AM and the Horns also were down to a backup FB Chad Stevens playing TE because all three scholarship TEs were injured Two top DT reserves Stevie Lee and Ryan Haywood were lost for the season starting safety Lee Jackson and super DT Shaun Rogers have missed a lot of time with injuries and redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis the guy who was counted on to give those super freshmen some time to mature had been out nearly all year with a sore shin Then you have OL like Derrick Dockery and Antwan KirkHughes who have been battle sickness andor injuries all year The point is that every team has injuries and Texas has had more of them this season than Texas AM Basketball Team Texas took a big early lead over Indiana Friday night and then held off a Hoosier comeback for a victory in the consolation game of the Tivo Preseason NIT in New York City The Longhorns started three freshmen James Thomas Brandon Mouton a nd Royal Ivey and used a stifling defense to take a lead at halftime Indiana climbed back into the game and cut the lead to seven points a t limiting Texas to just two baskets in the first of the second half Then Thomas scored five straight points as Texas restored a comfortable lea d with a run Mouton and Maurice Evans opened the game with consecutive pointers and t he Texas defensive pressure forced a lot of turnovers Chis Owens had points in the first half and led Texas with points and rebounds Texas had fallen to topranked Duke Wednesday in the tourney semifinals Mouton led Texas with points and Evans had Baseball Team Adds Four Baseball coach Augie Garrido has signed third baseman Nic Crosta of Seattle Wash righthanded pitchers Chris Scofield of Fort Worth Nolan and Danny Muegge of Blinn JC and centerfielder Dustin Majewski of Blinn JCto round o ut the Longhorns early signing class for the campaign With their potential both offensively and defensively thse players are solid additions to our early signing class that will provide us with depth said Texas assistant coach and recruiting coordinator Tommy Harmon Overall we are very pleased with the studentathletes we have signed for the season An honor student at Nolan Catholic High School Scofield earned AllState honors to go along with AllArea distinctions in as he helped the Vikings capture their district championship and finish second in the state finals He was also named his teams MVP last season and was a teammate o f current Longhorn freshman pitcher Tim McGough at Nolan Crosta is a

Classic MVP and to an AllTournament team in Reno Nev this past summer Majewski hit and blasted homers at Blinn last season Muegge played last season at McLennan JC in Waco and is playing for Blinn this season H e has a very good changeup and a fast ball in the mph range Reese Signs Top Prospects Texas swimming coach Eddie Reese and diving coach Matt Scoggin have signed three top recruits They are swimmers Andrew Davidson of Father Ryan HS in Nashvill and Rainer Kendrick of Homewood HS in Birminghamm and diver Jonathan Linette of Fort Lauderdale Fla Davidson a fourtime high school

December Longhorns Will Face Pac TriChampion Oregon in Culligan Holiday Bowl December The thranked Longhorns who havent finished in the AP top since can wipe out years of frustration on Dec in San Diego by beating No Oregon in the Culligan Holiday Bowl While thats easy to say it will be much harder to accomplish The Ducks went overall and tied BCSbowl teams Washington and Oregon State for th e Pac championship with a record Texas has the same overall and leagu e record at and The Holiday Bowl game starts at pm Texas time and will be nationally televised by ESPN Now before I get back to the matchup let me urge all Longhorn fans to buy tickets and attend this game Why Because one major criteria for getting one of the eight elite BCS bowl bids is fan loyalty The Longhorn team forgot to show up for the Cotton Bow l last year and so did Longhorn fans who didnt fill their ticket quota Bowl folks notice things like that Coach Mack Brown has Texas poised for a long run at top status and our fans need to be in the top too to he lp the team land good bowl games So please buy some tickets the information is on page and take a few days to enjoy San Diego It will help the Longhorns in this bowl game and i t will help them get in future ones Thats it with the sermon Lets get back to the bowl matchup Brown called the game an exciting matchup and a great challenge for both programs Both teams are very well respected state institutions with a great deal of pride and tradition Brown said He also called Oregons coach Mike Bellotti a personal friend and said he has done a great job of buildin g that program Bellotti boats a record in six season at Oregon and has taken the Duc ks to bowl games in five of his six years at the helm Oregon has lost only eight games in the last three years going in in and in Oregon was picked to finish in the middle of the pack in the Pac after racking up nine wins in with a seniorladen team But Bellotti rebuilt his offense around strongarmed junior QB Joey Harrington and junior college transfer RB Maurice Morris and found competent replacements for eight lost defensive starters to produce a surprisingly good team that lost only two games all season Harrington completed of passes and the Ducks ranked th nationally in passing with yards per game Harrington threw touchdown passes while being intercepted times Morris filled the void at running back by averaging yards a game He ran for yards and eight touchdowns Senior WR Marshaun Tucker was the teams leading receiver with receptions for yards and six touchdowns Sophomore WR Keenon Howry a pound speedster is another outstanding receiver Defensively tackles Jason Nikolao and Jed Boice end Saul Patu and LB Matt Smith are the team leaders The Ducks defensive philosophy is to stop the run and dont get beat deep on pass plays Lets hope they dont make that work in the Holiday Bowl because the Horns live on beating people deep on pass plays and they also like to run the football The Ducks beat Rose Bowl representative Washington during the regul ar season and were undefeated in the Pac until the final week of the regula r season when they lost to archrival Oregon State Their only other loss was in their second game to then No ranked Wisconsin Their other victories were over Nevada Idaho UCLA US C Arizona Arizona State Washington State and California The wins over Arizona State and Washington State were in overtime The Longhorns have won six games in a row after a start and they can be at the Ducks and make it seven in a row if they can win four key battles To win the Longhorns have to be able to run the ball better than the Ducks they have to get a fast start offensively they must win the turnover battl e and they have to get another great effort from their outstanding defense Against Texas AM the Longhorns got a terrible start offensively and faile d to even make a first down in the first quarter But they were able to keep the early lead because safety Greg Brown scored on a yard pass interception on the Aggies first offensive plays They probably wont be able to count on scoring a quick defensive touchdown against Oregon which is why getting a fast start offensively is one of the main keys to the games outcome Heres how the teams compared statistically at the end of the regular seaso n national rank in parenthesis Texas Oregon Offense Rushing

Insightcom Bowl in Phoenix on Dec against Pittsburgh Number Updated Daily I update my number daily with football and football recruiting news Th e number is It costs a minute You must be to call Coaches Waiting for a Few Top Recruits to Come Aboard Coach Mack Brown and his assistant coaches already have enough top recruits to assure them of their third straight top class and it could challenge for the top spot again if things fall right Texas has commitments already the list is on page and the Horns probably will sign six or seven more players The Longhorns will challenge for the No spot again if most of them come from a group of nine top national recruits that includes DT Tommie Harris o f Killeen Ellison LB Derrick Johnson of Waco OL Jami Hightower of Jacksonville S Derrick Johnson of Temple Ath Quan Cosby of Mart DE Jonathan Jackson and TE James Moses both of Galena Park North Shore OL William Winston of Houston Madison and DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal The good news in this recruiting season is that Texas has cleaned up in eve ry critical area except the defensive line That makes the bad news pretty obvious if Texas doesnt sign both Harris and Jakes the class will come u p short in the big guys up front in the defensive line But even that cloud has a silver lining This was the year of the offensive lineman in Texas Next year will be the year of the defensive lineman Ther e a re more good ones than I have seen in several years The Longhorns cleaned up on offensive linemen this year and they should be able to clean up on defensive linemen next year I have already seen four junior defensive tackles who are better than anybo dy except Harris in this years senior class I spotted one of them Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings the first week of the season when I went to Houston to watch the Galena Park North ShoreHastings game I was there primarily to look at Jackson and Moses but Wright was the most dominant player on the field At and pounds he was able to stuff the run and he showed the quickness and upper body strength to get off bloc ks quickly and rush the passer Mesquites Marco Martin is generally regarded as the state s top defensive line prospect next recruiting season He is so quick he doubl es as a running back But Wright is the most physical defensive tackle I have seen in the junior ranks Suffice it to say that both Wright and Martin will be top national recruits next year Wrights time is in the to range but he has as much quickness over to yards the key distance for defensive tackles as any of the guys who might outrun him in a The other two top junior DTs I have seen this year are Earl Anderson of San Marcos and Patrick Lee Dallas Carter The Longhorns will have great shots at Wright Anderson and Lee who all li st Texas among their favorites They also will be in the hunt for Martin While I have only seen them on tape there are several other junior DTs who will be highly recruited next year They include Damon Brown of Houston Washington Tully Jontzen of Keller Jarre Rhodes of Dallas Lincoln and David Johnson of Aldine Nimitz Since the Longhorns are down to recruiting a handful of players to complete this years recruiting class lets look for a moment at some of the other top juniors who will be the difference makers next year There are two junior QBs college coaches everywhere know about They are Reggie McNeal of Lufkin and Vincent Young of Houston Madison McNeal is Arkansas No recruiting target in Texas next year Both are outstanding runners who also have strong arms TE Eric Winston is the second best player at Midland Lee behind super senior RB Cedric Benson who is committed to Texas Winston is a devastating blocker who probably will move to the offensive line in college He is a strong AM lean and has been to the Aggies summer camp Travis Leitko of The Woodlands is an outstanding defensive end If he was a senior this year he would have colleges from everywhere clamoring for his signature At LB Marvin Byrdsong of Longview Andy Matakis of Corpus Christi Flower Bluff and Archie McDaniel of Bay City are already established stars LTydrick Riley of Crockett who also plays QB very well Kendrick Muckelroy of Hallsville and Michael Cuba of Taylor are great safety prospects as juniors Now lets get back to this years recruits I thought Benson and Midland Lee might be in trouble Saturday against defensive powerhouse Duncanville which hadnt allowed any team to score mo re than points all year Benson the Energizer Bunny of the high school running backs carried times for yards and four touchdowns and scored another TD on a yard screen pass to pace the Rebels to a victory Benson now ranks No among all the high school running backs in Texas history in yardage gained with He is the only Class A rusher in Cla ss A in the top Kenneth Hall the Class B terror at Sugar Land from through hold s the record at yards He was an amazing runner but he never ran against the kind of defenses Benson faces every week Benson has led Midland Lee to backtoback state champsionships but he los t most of his supporting cast after last season and the Rebels looked vulnerable this season losing two earlyseason games But his rebuilt line is getting better every week and Duncanville coach Bob Alpert who has been coaching at the A level in Texas for many years firs t in the Houston area and now in the DallasFort Worth Metroplex has seen an d played against a lot of great running backs but he says Benson is in a cla ss by himself Hes the best high school running back Ive seen and hes by far the best one that one of my teams has had to try to stop Alpert said What makes Benson so special It doesnt take a rocket scientist Alpert said Hes got great vision hes really quick through the hole he can get something if there isnt muc h there hes hard to bring down and he has great really great balance Hes also got really good speed and he runs as hard on his th carry as he doe s on his first one And of course the high school coach to end all high school coaches the legendary Gordon Wood long retired after winning state titles galore at Stamford and Brownwood put his stamp of approval on Benson after his junio r year saying Benson is the best allaround high school running back Ive ever seen Ive moved Benson to the top spot on my difference maker list on the previous page With endorsements from guys like Wood and Alpert hes obviously an awesome prospect By the way an interesting and fairly obscure note on Woods career is that hes the guy who ended the Breckinridge dynasty in Texas If you remember Chuck Moser and his mighty Abilene Eagle dynasty and its multiyear winning streak in the s there is a connection to Breckinrid ge there too The reason Abilene won all those games in a row was that the Eagles quit playing Breckinridge That long winning streak started the week after Breckinridge thumped Abilene by three touchdowns I think the score was and it was a whipping But the team Breckinridge really had the hex on was Brownwood The Lions ha d never beaten Breckinridge and it was a really sore topic of conversation around Brownwood Back in those days Class A was the big school class Abilene was Class A and Breckinridge was Class A Both teams won state regularly But Breckinridge fell down to Class A one year and fell into Stamfords district Woods Stamford team beat the Buckaroos that year en route to another state title Folks in Brownwood noticed that the little A school was against the te am it had never beaten and they hired Wood hoping he could do the same thing for them Did he ever Brownwood started beating Breckinridge every year and winning state titles almost every year The Buckaroos still have some good teams b ut they are in Class A now and happy they dont play the Class A Lions now even with Wood long retired Pardon me for drifting back so far but I grew up in West Texas when it had the best football played and teams like Abilene and Breckinridge got everyones attention before giving way to Gordon Wood and his powerhouse Br ownwood teams So far eight members of Dave Campbells Texas Football magazines man Super Team have committed to colleges and the Longhorns have six of them Benson is the only high school player ever to grace the cover of the state s top football magazine and he is joined on the Super Team by fellow UT commitments Frenship QB Kendal Briles San Antonio Holmes CB Cedric Griffin and OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter Terrance Young of Longview and Abe Robinson of Jersey Village The other Super Team players who have committed are Madisonville RB David Underwood who says he will sign with Michigan and Lancaster WR Armon Dorrough who has given his pledge to Texas Tech Briles threw three touchdown passes and ran for a fourth score to lead Frenship to a victory over Fort Worth Wyatt in the Class A regional finals Saturday Briles who led Stephenville to the Class A state title last year is threatening to do the same thing at Frenship He needs just two more victories to accomplish that rare and possibly unprecedented feat If UT has a shaky commitment it would be Briles He was recruited by Texas as an athlete probably a safety and he says he still thinks about going somewhere like Nebraska to get a shot at playing QB There is always a chance that lightning will strike and the Longhorns will get a commitment from some blue chipper from out of the blue If it happens it probably will be DT Marquise Hill of New Orleans De La Salle Michigan has a big lead over LSU but he says he probably will take a trip to Texas just to be sure Hes a long long shot but if he does take the trip to Texas it could happen Brown and his staff dont miss on many guys who take official visit s The visit limit rule isnt one that UT coaches even consider They normally bring in about kids offer about of them and sign about o f them Look for all of the UT commitments except DE Eric Hall of Tennessee who ha s already visited and possibly Benson and Briles who might be playing for repeat state championships that weekend to take their official visits to Texas the Dec weekend to attend the Texas football banquet Most of the other players Texas is recruiting also will take their visits that weekend The True Orange FaxEMail Deal Is a Great Christmas Gift Ill Have Frequent Reports on

the top junior recruits in the state He favors Texas over Oklahoma WR Marquis Johnson of Centennial HS in Champaign Ill is one of the top receivers in the country and he is a Texas fan I watched him on tape last week and he has size speed great hands and best of all he is fearless when he comes across the middle He caught passes for yards and TDs last year He told me Ive been a Texas fan since I was a little kid I like the way they run their offense He has an offer from Illinois and is considering Michigan and Notre Dame but he plans to visit Texas unofficially this summer with his parents Dont be surprised if Texas signs several outofstate players Three excellent players listed on the previous page DE Chase Pittman and DTs Lyle Sendlein and Kasey Studdard have strong Longhorn bloodlines and are seriously considering UT RB Zan Johnson of Winnfield La one of the top players in that state als o has several relatives who are Longhorn grads including former UT LB Lionel Johnson Johnson Pittman and Sendlein all came to the UT spring game Two LBFB combos Brandon Hancock of Clovis Cal Wes t and Chris Herring Batesville Miss South Panola also are considering the Longhorns but are longer shots than the ones mentioned previously Three players who have really zoomed up the recruiting charts since college coaches started watching their tapes are LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar S Vickiel Vaughn of Plano East and OL Bret Valdez of Brownwood Ive seen tape now and its easy to understand why the college coaches like them Smith is extremely quick and hardhitting Vaughn is a fast hardtackling ball hawk and Valdez is a devastating blocker with really quick feet in Brownwoods option attack Valdez came to the Texas spring game Smith also is interested in the Horns but Vaughn is interested only in outofstate schools right now I have listed other sports instead of schools by three players on my list o n page At WR Wardell Starling of Fort Bend Elkins will be a firstround baseball draft choice and will get a bonus offer that will almost certainly keep him from playhing college football In the Athlete category LeKeldrick Bridges of Dallas Hillcrest and in the Safeties Bam Harmon of The Colony both say they want to play college basketball not football All three are fine players I left them on the list just like I leave the academic problems on the list because I think we need to know who the best prospects are at every position UT Drops of to Huskers The Longhorns played the heck out of fifthranked and defending Big baseball champion Nebraska last weekend but

Buckman Picks Horns Brad Buckman a pound power forward from Austin Westlake who was recruited by most of the nations top programs picked Texas Tuesday saying he thinks the Horns are on the verge of joining the national elite in basketball He chose Texas over North Carolina at the end but also had considered Kentucky UCLA Missouri and others He had said earlier that the lure of the ACC where basketball reigns supreme was very strong and almost pulled him to North Carolina But he told me Tuesday Ive always wanted to go to Texas This is where my heart is He also said his head turned Texas way at the end because coach Rick Barnes has established a consistent winning program and has been wooing and winning bigtime recruits After looking at it closely he said I think Texas basketball is really on the upswing Theyve signed two McDonalds All Americans freshman point guard T J Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge and sophomore forward Brian Boddicker of Duncanville in the last two years They could make it three in three years because Buckmans stock soared this summer when he starred in several top AAU tournaments Brick Oettinger publisher of Prep Stars Recruiters Handbook was asked who was the biggest surprise of the summer Oettinger said In terms of from out of nowhere not in anybodys top to everybodys top it would be Brad Buckman Big forward very aggressive and a whole lot of skills just about as many skills as anybody in the class Ive got him No now and he wasnt in my top Dave Telep another national recruiting analyst agreed Buckman is a national top recruit The reality is that while there are guys with larger names there probably arent better players in the class Telep said He is athletic can handle it some he blocks shots he shoots to mediumrange and he scores in the post Clifton McNeely the Westlake coach also says his stars work ethic is off the chart Hes a very gifted player with a lot of talent McNeely said but the best thing about him is his strong heart and work ethic I dont think you could find anyone who works harder than he does McNeely also said he thinks Buckman is the best player in Texas There are some guards in the Dallas area who ranked higher nationally including Bracy Wright of The Colony who chose Indiana Daniel Horton of Cedar Hill who picked Michigan and Bryan Hopkins of Dallas Lincoln who committed to SMU The Longhorns recruited all three of those star guards but lost out on them at the end Buckman averaged points rebounds and blocks for Westlake as a junior And hes the kind of bluecollar inside player Barnes loves McNeely said Buckman can play a power game inside and shoot from point range Asked to compare him to Luke Axtell and Chris Mihm two other Westlake players he coached who played at UT he said He has the physical presence of Mihm and is a lot stronger coming out of high school and he has the range of Luke He is the first recruit to commit to Texas for the early signing period next month Barnes and his assistants are recruiting several other players most of them in other states and hope to sign a sharp shooting guard and a wing Buckmans father Brent played on two national championship golf teams at UT Basketball Team Has New Look The Longhorn basketball team will have a new look this season with the addition of heralded point guard T J Ford who led Fort Bend Willowridge to backtoback Class A state titles When the season starts next month Ford will be called upon to speed up the Horns offense and also create more opportunities for the teams inside players with his lightningquick passes Coach Rick Barnes is hoping Fords creativity in the halfcourt offense will improve the scoring punch of center James Thomas who averaged points and rebounds a game last year Ford also should be able to provide better shooting opportunities for senior forward Chris Owens sophomore wings Brandon Mouton and Royal Ivey and forward Brian Boddicker Barnes had to operate without a true point guard last year Fredie Williams Ivey and shooting guard Darren Kelly took turns at the point Barnes and the Horns coped with it admirably going overall and in the tough Big but they shot only percent from the field and had more turnovers than assists Ford should help raise the former and lower the latter They also lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Temple and Barnes hopes Ford will be a key to helping the team get farther into the playoffs this season Replacing departed wing Maurice Evans and Kelley who combined for of UTs pergame scoring average creates scoring opportunities for other shooters Now Barnes just needs some of them to seize that opportunity He expects Mouton and Ivey to step up there Sydmill Harris a freshman from The Netherlands has been a consistent shooter in preseason workouts Owens was a star in the World University Games during the summer and is expected to be one of the top players in the Big and a more dependable scoring threat Ever since last year the Temple game it started coming together Owens said It clicked I didnt do what I wanted to do and I knew I had the ability Now I have the mental concentration UT Women Looking Sharp Coach Jody Conradts Longhorn womens basketball team is picked to finish in the middle of the Big pack but early practices and stiff competition at several positons indicate it might be a lot better than that The Longhorns were looking good early last season before losing centerforward Annissa Hastings and guardTai Dillard to knee injuries Hastings and Dillard are hale and hearty once again but equally important is the fact that the Horns heralded recruiting class is living up to its hype Stacy Stephens a sophomore returns as the starting center and senior Tracy Cook and the Hastings can back her up and also play power forward Jody Bell a freshman from Canada and freshman Mercedes Williams also are looking good at power forward Two freshmen Heather Schreiber the high school player of the year in Texas last year and Kala Bowers last years high school player of the year in Oklahoma are battling for the small forward job it shows you are on the right track when you can call and women small forwards Hastings is so versatile that she probably will see action at all three inside positions Kenya Larkin returns as the point guard and other guards who will see a lot of action include sophomore Kaira White who has been looking great in practice plus Dillard and freshman CoCo Reed Alisha Sare and Asha Hill are other guards who could figure into the rotation RECRUITING NOTES LaToya Davis of Houston South Houston picked Texas Tech over Texas last week Nichelle Roberts a centerforward who teamED with Mercedes Williams to lead Spring Westfield deep into the state playoffs last year is the only remaining uncommitted blue chipper and the Longhorns have a great chance to sign her No Horns Win Soccer Title The No Texas womens soccer team clinched its first Big Conference title Sunday with a victory over Oklahoma The Longhorns are overall and in the Big and have one regular season match remaining against Texas AM Coach Chris Petrucelli in his third year at the helm said This is a huge step for us Its going to help us in recruiting Its going to help us in marketing And its going to help our confidence Freshman forward Kelly Wilson scored Texas third goal Sunday giving her

rather murky at this time LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar is committed to Texas but is setting up visits to Oklahoma he was once committed to the Sooners and several other schools WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus committed to Florida and LB Michael Williams of Lindale committed to Oklahoma last week but then they both decommitted Williams attended Texas AMs game Saturday and plans to come to take an official visit to Texas the December weekend The Longhorns commitments include nine players who are listed on one or more national top teams They are WR Marquis Johnson of Centennial High School in Champaign Illinois DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar DTs Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier Earl Anderson of San Marcos Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral the twotime defending Class A champion in Arizona OLs Brett Valdez of Brownwood and Neale Tweedie of Allen and TE David Thomas of Wolfforth Frenship Davis made all of the top national lists last year However he injured a knee and has undergone surgery and his coach at Gulf Coast JC says he has a lot of academic ground to cover to graduate The other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen of Keller LBs Brian Robison of Splendora and Marcus Myers of Pflugerville Connally WR Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar DB Matt Melton of Tyler and RBAth Clint Haney of Smithson Valley The Longhorns will give about to more scholarships and I think most of them will be awarded to members of a player group that includes QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison RBs Albert Hardy of Galena Park and Selvin Young of Houston Jersey Village WRs Timmons Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and Anthony Wright of Klein Forest TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee OLs Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield DEs Bryan Pickryl of Jenks Okla Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands DTs Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings Marco Martin of Mesquite and Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo LBs Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and Lindales Williams and DBs Edorian McCullough of North Garland Brodney Pool of Houston Westbury and Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln If the Longhorns finish strong they have a very good chance to get the four top players on my man differencemaker list They already have No in Earl Anderson and they have very good shots at No Wright No Young and No Dibbles If Pikryl lived in Texas he would be in my top and he says Texas is the leader right now He took his official visit the weekend of the Colorado game The Longhorns might take a kicker if they find one who is consistent at kicking off into the end zone Trey DeCarlo at Carrollton Creekview is the best Ive seen this year at booting them deep College kickers start five yards farther back but DeCarlos kicks usually carry out of the end zone INTERESTING RECRUITING TIDBIT The Longhorns lost

because tight end Bo Scaife made some great catches and that opened things up I think Bo gives us the ability to stretch the field even when the ball doesnt come to him because the defense has to be aware of where he is at all times Quarterback Chris Simms did a great job looking off on his big catch just before the half Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis This was a great team win for us The offense did a great job of hanging on the ball and running the clock and the defense did a good job of getting some threeandouts Thats the way its supposed to work when you draw it up I give a lot of credit to CB Quentin Jammer and nickel back Dakarai Pearson for shutting down their bigplay receivers Jammer held WR Justin Gage to two catches and Dak really did a good job on their tight end after we decided to give him the primary coverage on him UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese I dont think I was running any harder in the fourth quarter I think our offensive line just wore them down a little Coach Brown and coach Davis told me I needed to take charge in the fourth quarter and I just tried to keep running and pounding as hard as I could It feels good to be part of the record book UT freshman RB Cedric Benson talking about his game and the fact that he is the first true freshman to rush for yards in three straight games at Texas I was getting real clean releases I used my speed to my advantage I was getting single coverage because they were worrying about our running game and our wide receivers They were just sitting back waiting for me to come to them Longhorn TE Bo Scaife who caught five passes for yards including ones for and yards that set up firsthalf touchdowns We won and Oklahoma lost Virginia Tech lost and Stanford is ahead of UCLA Stanford won Thats what I call a good day UT quarterback Chris Simms When I heard the Oklahoma score I was a little happy Then I heard the Virginia Tech score and I was a little happier then the UCLAStanford game came as quite a

No October Simms Throws TD Passes Benson Rushes For Yards as Longhorns Gore Tigers Junior QB Chris Simms and true freshman RB Cedric Benson had careerbest days and the UT defense held Missouri to just one first down in the first and third quarters Saturday in Columbia to lead Texas to a victory On a day when upsets reigned across the country particularly in the top and five of the eight previously unbeaten teams lost the Longhorns took care of business and ran their record to overall and in the Big With Oklahomas loss at Nebraska the Sooners Longhorns and Aggies are all tied atop the standings in the Big South But the Longhorns have to win out and Oklahoma has to lose another conference game for the Longhorns to make it to the Big Championship Game Saturdays victory at Missouri was a fairly easy conquest thanks to the stout UT defense and a great performance by the offensive line that allowed Simms to complete of passes for yards and four touchdowns and Benson to run for yards on carries an average of yards a pop But some strange things happened to thwart the Longhorns in the early going On their first drive for example they held the ball almost minutes rolling yards in plays but they got zero points because they stalled at the Tiger and Dusty Mangum missed the chipshot field goal They also drove into Missouri territory on their second possession but again stalled Missouri finally got rolling to start the second quarter and scored first That seemed to wake up the Longhorn offense and it took control and wore out the Missouri defenders Here briefly is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred Missouri took the ball and Marcus James ran the UT kick back to the The Longhorn defense forced a quick threeandout and the UT offense had its most timeconsuming drive of the year going yards in a laborious minute play drive to the Tiger but Dusty Mangum missed the chipshot field goal Missouri went threeandout again The Horns drove to midfield again but stalled as the quarter ended Texas had a huge lead in statistics with first downs to for Missouri a edge in total offense and a to bulge in time of possession but the game was all even at in the only statistic that counts Second Quarter The Tigers finally got their offense untracked to start the second quarter and drove yards primarily on the passing of QB Kirk Farmer to take a lead with left Victor Ike ran the kickoff back to the and the Longhorns went yards in plays to tie it up Simms connected with WR B J Johnson on the yard TD toss but the big play was a yarder from Simms to TE Bo Scaife on thirdand at the Missouri Mangums kick tied it with left After the UT defense forced another quick andout and got a short punt Simms found Scaife again on the first play for a yard gain to the MU A WR reverse by Johnson got yards and Benson got more and a first down at the before Simms faked to Benson and hit TE Brock Edwards for the final yards and the TD Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left The Tigers stormed down the field in the final two minutes primarily on the running of pound Zack Abron who gained yards in three carries His yard tacklebreaking run to the gave the Tigers a firstandgoal but his next try gained only a yard and Farmer threw two incompletions before Brad Hammerich booted a yard field goal to cut the UT lead to with seconds left The Tigers outgained the Longhorns in the quarter to yards and had a edge in first downs Third Quarter Texas got the ball and again made a long timeconsuming drive but this time it counted because Simms scored from the to cap a yard drive and Mangum converted for a lead with left the Longhorns overcame a thirdand early in the drive when Simms scrambled and found Brett Robin for yards Vasher intercepted Farmer four plays later to give the Horns great field position at the MU The Longhorns couldnt move but the pick kept Missouri bottled up deep in its own territory throughout the quarter and allowed Texas to start its possessions around midfield in a quarter that was dominated by defense after Texas impressive opening drive The Tigers made only one first down in the quarter and Texas after getting five first downs on that opening TD drive managed only one more in the entire quarter Fourth Quarter The Tigers finally figured out their best offense was to hand the ball to Abron and he bulled for and then more for a TD Missouris pass for a point conversion failed and left UT on top with left Not to be outdone Benson shredded the Missouri defense for and then before Simms scrambled left and found Robin who scampered the final yards to complete a yard scoring play Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left Texas and the BCS The next Bowl Championship Series BCS standings will be a lot different from the first ones that were announced last week and Texas will be a lot higher than it was in the last one In the first standings which were announced last Monday Texas was ranked No behind five teams with perfect records The BCS standings are like golf in that the lowest score is the best score Oklahoma came in at No in the first standings at followed by Nebraska at UCLA at Miami at Virginia Tech at Texas at and Michigan at to round out the top seven But a rash of upsets claimed OU UCLA and Virginia Tech Since OU lost to Nebraska the Sooners wont tumble far but Texas should pass UCLA and VT Of course Michigan is so close to Texas that the Wolverines might pass the Horns if they keep winning Under the BCS formula the top four teams in the final standings are guaranteed berths in one of the four BCS Bowls which are the Rose Orange Fiesta and Sugar The Rose Bowl will get the national title game this year Right now that looks like a NebraskaMiami battle but both teams have some big games left before making that date Texas could make it to the Rose Bowl but it would require some big upsets like Texas AM or Texas Tech upsetting Oklahoma and then Texas beating Nebraska in the Big title game But the Longhorns will make it to one of the big BCS bowls if they keep winning Key Games for BCS Watchers If you want to keep tabs on the Longhorns chances to wind up in good shape in one of the big four BCS bowls the key is that they have to win their final three regular season games Assuming that happens here are some key games to watch for the rest of the season This Saturdays key games are Michigan at Michigan State Tennessee at Notre Dame and UCLA at Washington State The big ones the following Saturday Nov are Texas AM at Oklahoma and UCLA at Oregon On Nov Texas Tech hosts Oklahoma Syracuse is at Miami Michigan is at Wisconsin and Virginia Tech is at Virginia On Thanksgiving weekend Michigan hosts Ohio State Nebraska goes to Colorado and Oklahoma State plays at Oklahoma The big games on Dec are Miami at Virginia Tech Tennessee at Florida and Oregon State at at Oregon If Oklahoma loses to AM Tech or OSU and the Longhorns win out Texas would qualify for the Big Championship Game on Dec The final BCS rankings will be released on December the day after the Big and Southeastern Conference have their championship games Texas probably will be fourth or fifth in the BCS rankings to be released today and the games mentioned above will be big determining factors in where the Horns wind up Jackson McClintock to Redshirt It looks like senior LB Lee Jackson and junior DE O J McClintock will redshirt Both have been out with injuries all season and head coach Mack Brown said last week there are no plans to play them He said Jackson is still having troubles with his toe and his leg He said McClintock wont play unless the team suffers some injuries at DE Number Updated Daily I update my number every day with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call Coachs Corner The Longhorns now ranked No in both polls after a rash of upsets Saturday are playing well but they need to keep working to get better head coach Mack Brown said Sunday After studying films of the victory over Missouri Brown said he and his assistants were generally pleased with the teams play But he said the defense will work on hard on tackling this week We werent pleased with out tackling Brown said We werent pleased one back gained over yards on us Weve got to get back to work on that He also said the defense did a good job in permitting Missouri to get into the red zone only three times all day but they scored all three times Thats not what we want The offense played a pretty good game he said adding that tackle Mike Wiliams played great Hes our offensive player of the week Defensively he said the player of the week is CB Quentin Jammer who held the Tigers nationally ranked WR Justin Gage to two receptions for yards He was averaging receptions per game and ranked second in the Big in that department Brown also said he is concerned about some aspects of the kicking game We kicked two balls out of bounds on kickoffs he said Weve got some issues there weve got to correct He said backup LB Reed Boyd who plays on several of the kicking teams was our special teams player of the week Asked how he prepares his team for games like the next two against Baylor and Kansas when the opponents are losing and struggling he said Baylor played AM and Oklahoma tough Our guys need to play football because they like playing it If they cant get excited about playing football they dont need to be playing football at the University of Texas He also said Our guys need to understand that everyone wants to knock them

good as advertised Wednesday night in the Longhorn basketball teams annual intrasquad scrimmage Senior guard Fredie Williams sophomore guard Royal Ivey and sophomore swingman Brandon Mouton had points each to lead the scoring but Ford had points and nailed a threepointer with five seconds left to knot the score at Coach Rick Barnes called it a draw at that point The Longhorns who tied for last in the Big Conference in field goal percentage during the season shot well Both teams connected on better than percent of their field goal attempts and threepoint field goal attempts during the scrimmage Coming into the season we knew we had to get better with our field goal percentage Barnes said I look at the stat sheet and I know we can shoot even better than we did tonight I think we are a better driving team this year and that penetration will help our shooting I was pleased with tonight and I really like the chemistry on this team The Orange team was led by Mouton and Ford plus senior forward Chris Owens who scored points Fords points included four of six treys plus eight assists and just three turnovers Williams and Ivey led the White squad Sophomore center James Thomas had points and a gamehigh rebounds while sophomore forward Brian Boddicker scored points of threes and had seven boards A trio of Longhorns did not suit up for the scrimmage due to injuries including junior guard Terrell Ross foot ankle freshman swingman Sydmill Harris achilles and freshman forwardcenter Chris Wright knee Wright is expected to redshirt this season to rehabilitate his knee The other two should return this season Texas is slated to play two home exhibition games at the Erwin Center Wednesday Nov vs Alaska Anchorage pm and Tuesday Nov vs EA Sports AllStars pm Newcomers Star for Women

department and she also scored seven points for the White Senior forward Tracy Cook led the Orange team with points and freshman forward Jody Bell added seven points and six rebounds The White squad held a edge in rebounding and shot from the floor hitting of shots while the Orange squad hit at a percent clip for It was a little shaky out there at first but thats to be expected coach Jody Conradt said You could easily tell who the returnees were by their solid presence on the court whereas the freshmen looked a little tentative and uptight We are looking for our identity right now We do want to run with the ball but weve got to work on pushing the ball up the court quicker getting the outlet passes released quicker and taking the ball out of bounds as fast as possible Important Notice

the BCS mix It hurts when you throw an interception have a punt return a kick return and a bad snap that all lead to eventual touchdowns and realize your spotting Texas points Baylor head coach Kevin Steele Early in the ball game the defense did what it was supposed to do It stopped Baylor when it had to Then the offense did what it was supposed to do It started scoring touchdowns It got a little sloppy after that but overall I thought we did a good job Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese In most cases today the run was outnumbered We knew it would be hard but Cedric Benson did a good job for us and we were able to get good matchups in the passing game because they had to play Roy Williams and B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas one on one We ran two backs more than we have in other games to try to get more blocking UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis I might have gained yards today but it didnt come easy The offensive line did a great job today Baylor played tough all day long I feel like the offense is starting to get into a rhythm Hopefully we can keep stepping it up more each week Im happy with the win Every team in the Big has talent and winning on the road isnt easy Longhorn freshman RB Cedric Benson Its really competitive out there and we did a lot of things right but we made too many mistakes to beat a team as good as Texas Baylor wide receiver Reggie Newhouse I thought we were going to make more big plays and I got a little impatient at times Overall I thought the offense played well and moved the ball and scored some points UT quarterback Chris Simms My eyes lit up when I saw that manforman coverage Weve got the mentality that nobody can cover us man for man I respect them for trying it We havent seen a lot of manh coverage this year Longhorn wide receiver Roy Williams who had six catches for yards and a touchdown It was just like being at home I wanted everyone to know I can compete with the older guys and thats hard to do when youre a freshman Texas

takes two and three because I have a doctors appointment Nothing series but I have to go right now Jerry Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No November Horns Rip Bears Passing Game Clicks Benson Has Yards TDs on Stacked Defense QB Chris Simms and his receivers had a great day against Baylors manforman coverage Saturday and freshman RB Cedric Benson ran for yards and two touchdowns in a rout The Bears were determined to deny the Longhorns a running game and they stacked the line and dared Simms to pass He did hitting of passes for yards and two touchdowns but the Bears strategy backfired against the run too because of Bensons fierce running and the lines strong blocking With starting guard AntwanKirk Hughes out with a sprained ankle the Horns were already running low on guards when Tillman Holloway went down with a neck and shoulder injury But Beau Baker who has worked at both guard and center came in and played so well the Longhorns didnt miss a beat The victory ran UTs record to overall and in the Big while Baylor fell to and Longhorn coach Mack Brown saluted the Bears for their effort They really played hard and they played well he said We just had better players Baylors defenses is one of the better defenses in the league he said The Longhorns kick returnees had a field day Nathan Vasher had yards on seven punt returns including a yarder that set up the second touchdown another for yards deep into Bear territory and another for yards that set up another touchdown He also had a pass interception deep in Baylor territory that set up a short TD drive Victor Ike only got to return one kickoff but he did it in fine style bolting yards to the Baylor to give the Horns a short field for their fifth touchdown drive Sophomore WR Roy Williams had his best day of the season with six receptions for yards including a yarder for the first score Here briefly is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred Baylors Bobby Hart gave the Bears an early chance bobbling a UT punt then picking it up and returning it yards to the Texas The Longhorn defense held Then Simms hit WR Sloan Thomas but Thomas bobbled it right into the hands of Bear DB Derrick Cash That set Baylor up at the Texas The UT defense held again with LB Tyrone Jones leaping high and blocking Baylors attempted yard field goal After the blocked FG UT drove yards in six plays to take the lead Simms connected with Williams for yards and the TD Benson carried twice for yards and also caught a yard shovel pass Dusty Mangums kick gave the Horns a lead with left Baylor couldnt move and punter Vasher ran the yard punt back yards to the BU Simms connected with Thomas for yards then Benson carried twice for yards before Simms got the touchdown on a yard sneak Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left Second Quarter The Bears sacked Simms at the UT early in the period giving them possession at the Longhorn after Brian Bradfords strong yard punt QB Josh Zachry hit passes for and yards then scored from the on a QB draw to cut the UT lead to with left Midway through the quarter the Longhorns drove yards in four plays for their third TD Simms connected with Thomas for the final yards after a yarder to Williams set it up Mangums give put UT on top with left On Texas next possession Simms hit Williams for yards but Mangums yard field goal try failed Vashers interception three plays later set the Horns up at the Bear Simms connected with WR B J Johnson for yards then RB Brett Robin scored the TD Mangums kick made it with seconds left Zachry hit four passes for yards to get the Bears to the UT and Adam Stiles kicked a yard field goal on the final play to cut the UT lead to Third Quarter Ike returned the kickoff yards to the Baylor Benson churned for over right tackle then Simms found Williams who made a great catch at the Benson got the TD on a yard run Mangums kick put Texas head with left Vashers yard punt return to the Baylor had the Horns on the move again as the quarter ended Fourth Quarter Benson finished the drive with a yard run Mangums kick made it with left On the Bears next possession QB Davon Vinson was in the shotgun when the ball was snapped over his head UT safety Dakarai Pearson recovered in the end zone Mangums kick made it with left Texas The BCS The Bowls Coach Mack Brown talked last week to John Swafford a top BCS official and Swafford said the BCS rule prohibiting three teams being selected for the four BCS bowls from one league takes precedence over the BCS rule that the top four teams in the final BCS poll have to be chosen That really simplifies things when figuring out how UT can qualify for a BCS bowl First the Longhorns have to win the rest of their games Second Texas has to finish in the top four in the final BCS poll on Dec Third the Longhorns have to be ahead Nebraska or Oklahoma in the final BCS poll Brown said the Longhorns just have to keep winning and see where they wind up I think there is a fair chance Oklahoma will lose to Texas Tech in Lubbock The Sooners were never great shakes on offense this year and their offensive unit is pretty banged up If Tech does upset the Sooners that would drop them out of the top four and clear the way for the Longhorns as long as they keep winning The Sooners also might fall out of the top four if they win the rest of their regular season games and lose to Nebraska in the Big Championship Game One thing that would be fatal to the Longhorns chances of landing a BCS bowl berth would be for OU to win out then beat Nebraska in the title game With one loss each and those losses to each other both teams would stay ahead of the Longhorns in the BCS ranking Texas was fifth in last weeks poll while Nebraska was No Oklahoma was No Miami was No Michigan was No Stanford was No Tennessee was No Florida was No UCLA was No Oregon was No Washington was No and Washington State was No No Michigan No Stanford and No UCLA all lost Saturday giving them two losses each and effectively knocking them out of the BCS bowls Some of the teams below the Horns will move up because their schedules are stronger and they might pass Texas until and unless they lose again Which brings us back to my original premise if the Longhorns win out they are in good shape if Oklahoma loses another regular season game and maybe even if OU loses to Nebraska again If the Horns win out and still finish below Nebraska and Oklahoma in the BCS poll or if they fail to finish in the top four look for them to wind up in the Cotton Bowl But Im optimistic If they win out I think they will be in the Sugar Bowl one of the four BCS bowls Some of the other top teams will lose again and one of them might be the Sooners in Lubbock Number Updated Daily I update my number every day with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Bowl Championship Series BCS standings are so confusing that he has told his team to keep working to be the best team it can be because good things usually happen for the best team What we do every Sunday is we meet with the team he said We go over the film and talk about the good and the bad and then I take time to go over the BCS Noting that five undefeated teams lost the previous weekend and three top teams Michigan Stanford and UCLA lost for the second time Saturday Brown said teams just have to concentrate on the only thing they control winning We want to play as good as we can play every week he said Thats the only thing we can control Ive asked them to try to play to a standard to try to get better on every play He also said he has told them not to worry about the BCS because it will all work out for them if they keep winning their games He also said that is one reason for the am kickoff Saturday for the final home game against Kansas Theyre kids and they are going to watch some scores he said Thats one reason I wanted the early kickoff There arent many scores to watch at am Brown said the team played a complete game in the win over Baylor He said sophomore safety Dakarai Pearson was chosen as the defensive player of the game after scoring a touchdown with a fumble recovery and leading the team in tackles with nine Sophomore WR Roy Williams was picked as the top offensive performer after catching six passes for yards and a touchdown and another sophomore Nathan Vasher was picked as the top special teams performer after returning seven punts for yards Brown also said QB Chris Simms has shown a lot of improvement in recent weeks and true freshman RB Cedric Benson continues to play well and seems to improve every week INJURY NOTE Brown said he hopes injured offensive guards Antwan KirkHughes who has missed the last two games with a sprained ankle and Tillman Holloway who suffered a shoulder and neck injury during the Baylor game will be able to play this week He also said Beau Baker played really well at guard after Holloways injury Horns Fifth in Both Polls Texas is fifth in both major football polls this week Miami is No and

Longhorn games but Saturdays rout over Kansas was an exceptional day for top recruits to turn out For starters three top linebackers took their official visits to Texas They are Michael Williams of Lindale A J Nicholson of Mount Tabor HS in Winston Salem N C and Rufus Alexander of Baton Rouge Christian Life Texas needs to sign several linebackers this year All three starters are seniors and their backups are mostly unproven Williams and Alexander are speedy outside linebacker types who are top national recruits and Nicholson is one of the top inside backers in the nation I talked to all three of them after they returned home from their visits and Williams who has visited Texas Oklahoma Texas Tech and Texas AM said he has pretty well narrowed his choices to the Longhorns and Sooners He said he had a great time in Austin and I really like the players and coaches Nicholson said Texas is his top choice right now but he said he plans to visit Miami and Florida State before making a decision I thought the facilities at Texas were incredible he said and I really liked the coaches and players and everybody I met Alexander said Texas is one of his top choices The players and coaches really get along together he said Its like a big family He said Texas and Alabama are his top two teams right now and he said he will visit Alabama Florida and Tennessee before making a decision Eleven recruits off my man differencemaker list were at the game They are QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park LB Marvin Byrdsong of Longview TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus RB Paul Mosley of Austin Anderson Athlete DaBryan Blanton of Forney and UT commitments DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos LBs Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar and Brian Robison of Splendora and OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood Other top recruits at the game included DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel a UT commitment and a national top player WR Anthony Wright of Klein Forest and WR Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood a UT pledge Two top juniors who were there were QB Kris Heavner of Johnson City and WRDB Limas Sweed of Brenham The Longhorns still have commitments Garnet Smith has firmed up his commitment and has stopped talking to the press on orders from his father Of the kids who came to the game other than the three who were on official visits and who have already been discussed I think Texas has at least a shot with Young Hardy Winston and Timmons The Longhorns will sign between and players in February and most of the remaining to scholarships will go to recruits in an member group that includes Young Hardy Winston OLs Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield DTOG Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo DEs Bryan Pickryl of Jenks Okla Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands DTs Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings and Marco Martin of Mesquite LBs Williams Nicholson Alexander and Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and one of three WRS Timmons Wright or Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls The Longhorns also are looking for a kicker who can boot the ball into the end zone consistently and will sign one if they can one who meets their needs Of course they probably will try to talk him into walking on first but theyll probably come up with a scholarship if they find a great one Horns Fifth in Both Polls Texas remained No in both major football polls this week The Associated Press poll has Miami No Nebraska No Oklahoma No and Florida No while the USA TodayESPN poll has Nebraska No Miami No

without a doubt the best secondary we have played this season Kansas interim head coach Tom Hayes who became acting head coach last Monday when Terry Allen was fired The Jayhawks schedule has been voted the toughest in the country I thought it was a great team game The offense got yards and the defense held the other team to I wish they were all like that Our kids played really hard and Im proud of them Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese Im just really pleased overall and Im glad Cedric Benson finally had a long run so you will quit asking him about it UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis who was picking up on a comment by Benson that he was glad to pop a long one so people would quit asking him what was wrong As a kid this is what you dream about My dreams are falling into place If I continue to work hard yards will come I have a great offensive line a great fullback a great quarterback and great coaches With all that what cant be done Longhorn RB Cedric Benson talking about his chances of becoming the first UT freshman to rush for yards Hes probably running full speed at three steps He hits the line of scrimmage at full speed He attacks the line of scrimmage and he usually falls forward Hes one of the quickest guys Ive ever seen I dont think it takes him long to go from zero to Texas running back coach Bruce Chambers talking about Benson We never gave up I felt the offensive line played hard the whole game Unfortunately that doesnt always translate into wins Texas has an extremely talented defense and they came out and showed us exactly that today Kansas offensive tackle Justin Hartwig Hes the best Ive ever gone against Size speed he has it all Ive never seen a guy that big who can run that fast Kansas cornerback Andrew Davidson talking about trying to cover Roy Williams I thought that if we kept them from scoring for the rest of the first half holding the score to then maybe we could come back but Texas kept making big plays and the next thing

and will be televised by ABC In case you have forgotten they had an early kickoff in College Station two years ago and the Longhorns with a sick quarterback and two injured wide receivers got beat There were some other factors but suffice it to say the Longhorns wont stay in College Station the night before the game this year Texas is overall and in the Big while AM is overall and in the Big The Aggies have had offensive problems all year and the situation has mushroomed in the last two games when they were shut out by Texas Tech and then held to five first downs by Oklahoma in a loss Saturday Both teams have solid defenses but UT has an edge in all four major defensive categories as you can see in the statistical rankings below But the Longhorns also have one of the nations most potent offenses and that should negate the Aggies home field advantage To win this one the Longhorns need to stay with their balanced offensive attack connect on some big plays and above all dont turn the ball over and give the Aggies a short field This Aggie team has had difficulty making drives and hasnt scored an offensive touchdown in its last two games It wont have much luck against the strong Longhorn defense The keys here are simple Win the turnover battle Dont accept any food or drink from strangers Im usually a little more serious about trips to Collie Station but this Aggie teams best offense is its defense and that wont be enough on Nov If you followed the news about the melee in Lubbock after Techs victory over AM these two thoughts come to mind Only Aggies would go all the way

<30016779.1075848300805.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2001-04-09 04:12:00,True Orange April Part of parts of Parts Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No April Spring Shows UT Has Fine Passing Offense Defense but Questions Persist Elsewhere The Longhorns wrapped up spring football practice last week and the best news I can give you after watching all practices is that the passing offense and defense should both be very good this season The run defense probably wont be as good as last years rocksolid group but it will be a faster group that should be good against the run and much improved at rushing passers The running offense still looks spotty but coach Mack Brown says it is improved and will look much better in the fall when injured offensive guards Antwan KirkHughes and Tillman Holloway return When they return by the way look for the teams other fine guard Derrick Dockery to move to left tackle The one huge problem that surfaced in the spring was in the kicking game JC transfer Brian Bradford and redshirt freshman Justin Smith both did a good job of punting but the placekickers had a tough spring Redshirt freshman Matt McFadden showed fair consistency on field goals up to yards but struggled mightily on the longer ones Brown expressed concern about the kicking and said three walkons will be reporting in August and will get chances to win the job So looking at the big picture I see the last year of the softer schedule no Nebraska or Kansas State as one in which the Longhorns will have a passing game that will strike terror into opposing teams hearts and a pass defense that should be one of the best around too But UT teams dont usually win big games unless they can run fairly well yards at Stanford minus against Oklahoma and in the Oregon game in the Holiday Bowl Those were the three games the team lost Brown says one of the tailbacks needs to jump out of the pack and give the team a goto guy If one of them doesnt do it look for super recruit Cedric Benson to be a factor very quickly Brown doesnt like to talk about Benson because he doesnt want him to put any extra pressure on him But Benson is a guy who thrives on pressure Fifteen touchdowns in three Class A championship games shows how pressure affects him Hopefully he will do for the running game what true freshmen WRs Roy Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas did for the passing game last season With junior QB Chris Simms and five or six outstanding WRs to go with two extremely gifted TEs the Longhorns should have at great passing attack If Simms continues to make progress in looking away from his target Texas will have a great passing attack He hit of his passes and averaged yards per completion last year but he had only eight touchdowns and four of his seven interceptions were run back all the way He was much better this spring about concealing his intended target I think he will continue to improve and if he does the passing game will be so potent that it will make it easier to run The other key to getting the running game jumpstarted is getting better run blocking from the line The line worked more on run blocking this spring than it has in previous springs under Brown and he thinks that will pay off with a better running attack when the season starts Ill make a prediction right now that if the Horns can run for yards in every regularseason game they wont lose any of them Brown says he isnt concerned about the yardage but is concerned about the ability to pick up short yardage on third downs and about being able to run the ball in the fourth quarter to protect a lead Ill second that The Longhorns dont have to run for yards if they can run it successfully when they really need to run it Many teams and particularly teams in the Big are stacking the line of scrimmage to force teams to throw After Simms and Company show how they can stretch a defense I dont think many teams will want to force Texas to throw The defense meanwhile is much faster than last season Strong safety Lee Jackson is primarily a strongside linebacker now and converted cornerbacks Ahmad Brooks and Nathan Vasher are two of the top three safeties Former outside linebacker O J McClintock is a passrushing defensive end and defensive end Maurice Gordon is at defensive tackle Sophomore Marcus Tubbs had a strong spring at DT and Lee if he returns healthy in the fall should team with sophomore Adam Doiron the other spring starter to give the Horns three good tackles Gordon is already an outstanding passrushing tackle and Brown said he will try to bulk up a little in the off season to be better at handling the run too Starting DEs Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding return as do all three LBs and three of the four DBs Against Oklahoma the best team the Horns will face in the regular season this type of lighter faster defensive unit should have a better chance to succeed It should be better against the passing teams and it might be almost as good against the running teams The Achilles heel could be the placekicking unless McFadden walkon Dylan Becker or one of the three incoming walkons takes charge

costs a minute You must be or older to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown had to juggle spring football practice this year because of the tragic death of Cole Pittman and a series of thunderstorms but he says it was the most physical and successful spring in our four years here One of our main goals was to be tougher more physical he said after spring practice concluded last Wednesday We worked harder we had our ones go against our ones more and we worked on being tougher and on getting better every day We didnt have a bad practice he said They worked hard every day and thats when you get better We did get better Brown said he was very pleased with the progress the team made during the spring workouts but said there are still some problems heading into the offseason program and fall workouts We still have some unanswered questions such as developing depth along the defensive line and we need a tailback to step forward he said He said Victor Ike would start at tailback if we played tomorrow and Brett Robin would be second team Our running game has improved weve continued to improve our protections and our throwing and catching with our receivers is getting better he added While he isnt pleased with the production at tailback he said the running game will be better this season because of improvement in the offensive line Mike Williams at tackle and Derrick Dockery at guard played as well as any offensive linemen have played in the spring since we got here he said Even though we lost two great defensive players in Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers and an outstanding safety in Greg Brown our defense has continued to improve and has better team speed than last year Brown said He said strong senior leadership gives the team a chance to be really successful on defense next season Sophomore OG Tillman Holloway and redshirt freshman DT Stevie Lee were the only Longhorns who suffered serious injuries in the spring Holloway sprained a knee during the first week of workoutsand Lee had surgery on the same foot that sidelined him for the last games of the season which qualified him for a medical redshirt season Seniors Antwan KirkHughes shoulder and Mike Jones knee missed the entire spring season while recovering from offseason surgery and sophomore tight end Artie Ellis sat out with a stress fracture in his leg We were able to get through the spring without any significant injuries that would keep someone from missing time in the fall Brown said All the guys who missed this spring because of injuries last fall should be back to full strength when we start up again in August He said he was tremendously pleased with progress of sophomore TE Bo Scaife who returned after missing the entire season with a knee injury Scaife tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during the first preseason practice last August I was really pleased with Bos improvement toward the end of the spring Brown said We held him out of the majority of contact drills but the more he played the more you could tell he was getting physically ready to play He should come back with great confidence in the fall after having a solid month of practice this spring He also said one big spring goal was to develop more depth and he said the team made good progress in that area With Lee out with his foot injury it left the team really thin at DT but moving Gordon over helped a lot If Stevie hadnt been injured we probably wouldnt have moved Maurice from end to tackle Brown said Maurice looks really good at tackle and when Stevie comes back well have a lot better depth there The program is growing at the pace wed hoped it would when we came here three years ago Brown said Each year we have developed more depth and experience and from top to bottom have become an improved team with a better grasp of our overall program Last year we played more players across the board than we had in our first two years and that is what saved our season in the end We had so many players injured that it took a lot of guys stepping up for us to be successful

attends church services at Shreveport Evangel It is a tradition at Evangel that recruits announce their college plans to the congregation Pittman might commit to LSU instead of Texas but I think he is going to be a Longhorn He and his parents were in Austin over the weekend and participated in pregame ceremonies honoring the memory of his brother Cole who was killed in a traffic accident in February while returning to UT for spring football practice He visited LSU the previous week and has narrowed his choices to the Longhorns and Bayou Bengals While Pittman was not on an official visit he and his parents paid their own way his teammate speedy DB Jonathan Wade was on an official visit Wade a sprinter committed to Tennessee several weeks ago but he must be having second thoughts He says he remains firmly committede to the Volunteers but you know what I have always said about kids who keep on visiting after they commit In case you are a new subscriber I say that is akin to keeping on dating after you become engaged which makes marriage rather doubtful WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign Ill has not made it to a Texas game as he had planned to do but he says the Longhorns still are his No choice He does say he has changed his mind about committing early and wants to look around a little LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar is the closest thing Ive seen this year to super Longhorn freshman Derrick Johnson He told me Sunday he probably will announce his college choice right after he attends the TexasOklahoma game He leans the Longhorns way pretty strongly but I think he might swing the other way if the Sooners win that game I really like Texas but I want to see how those teams look when they play each other he said If the Longhorns can sign Smith and Aaron Harris the

could I was not going to be denied I wanted that touchdown UT DE Cory Redding talking about his yard interception return for the games first score I was really excited about getting to play against him heralded North Carolina DE Julius Peppers Hes got a great first step and hes really fast Hes got real long arms too which helps him on his pass rush I felt like I did pretty good I know I gave it

sack I questioned myself a little on that one just before the half It was yards and going into the wind but I marked off my steps took a deep breath and told myself to kick right through the ball and drive it I was really excited when it went in It gave the team a lift Texas true freshman walkon kicker Dusty Mangum who booted a yard field goal into the wind on the last play of the first half to

<8940428.1075852130655.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2001-09-10 08:10:18,True Orange September Part Part of Parts Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No September Defense VasherLed Special Teams Bail Out Anemic Offense in Win Over Tar Heels The Longhorns have twothirds of an outstanding team as they showed Saturday before another sellout home crowd in a rout of North Carolina Coach Mack Browns defense and special teams led by Nathan Vashers schoolrecord punt returns were simply too much for Browns old team But be thankful it wasnt a powerhouse across the line of scrimmage Saturday The Tar Heels might have the secondbest defense the Longhorns will see this year but their offense is as bad as their defense is good The Texas offense after two games simply isnt hitting on all cylinders There are way too many threeandouts and way too many drives that end almost as soon as they start To stay in the top or even in the top the Longhorns must develop an offense that moves the ball on most possessions even when it fails to score An offense like that pays huge dividends in two ways First it helps win the allimportant field position battle Second it gives a teams defense time to rest But this game while it was a nailbiter for a half turned into a runaway primarily because of the tough UT defense Vasher DE Cory Redding and the find of the year freshman walkon kicker Dusty Mangum The Longhorn defense held North Carolina to yards total offense and Redding scored the games first touchdown on a yard pass interception return that included an awesome dive into the end zone to avoid two tacklers Vasher broke a game Longhorn drought in touchdown punt returns set up another easy TD with a yard punt return to the Tar Heel and kept the crowd on its feet regularly with exciting punt returns He also giftwrapped a touchdown for North Carolina when he bobbled a bouncing punt at the UT Mangum the gritty young kicker from Mesquite booted a yard field goal into the wind on the last play of the first half to send the Longhorns into the dressing room with a lead and some momentum He later kicked a yarder and a yarder and is perfect this season on eight extra points and five field goals Not bad for a walkon Coach Brown said after the game a point victory is to be enjoyed not critiqued but the Longhorns need to use this open date to figure out a way to run the ball better and be more consistent on offense A bunch of threeandouts in a row will get them beat pretty soon if they dont Here briefly is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred Just like last week that decision paid off because most of the first quarter was played in North Carolina territory After an exchange of punts Tar Heel QB Ronald Currys pass in the right flat was intercepted at the by Redding who ran it back to about the and then leaped over two wouldbe tacklers into the end zone Mangum kicked the extra point to give UT a lead with left The Longhorn defense forced another quick punt and Vasher got loose on a yard punt return to the He almost scored but lost his balance tiptooeing down the sideline after leaping over one Tar Heel An offside penalty moved it inside the TB Victor Ike ran to the then QB Chris Simms scored Mangum kicked the extra point for a lead with left The Longhorns had no first downs at this point After the kickoff Curry led the Tar Heels on an impressive yard scoring drive to cut the deficit to with left The Lo nghorns ran only nine plays and had just yards offensively in the quarter while North Carolina ran plays and had yards offensively Second Quarter Vasher tried to scoop up a low bouncing punt at the UT early in the period and North Carolina scored in two plays to tie at with left He came right back with a yard return to the Tar Heel Three plays later the Longhorns were on the facing fourthand so Mangum kicked a yard field goal for a lead with left Simms led the Horns on a yard drive in the final seconds connecting on four passes for yards to set up Mangums clutch yard FG into the wind on the final play for a lead at the half The Longhorns had offensive yards in the period to the Tar Heels Third Quarter UT went andout to start the second half and the Tar Heels went deep on their first play after the punt but CB Quentin Jammer after being burned on a couple of long passes in the first half made a lunging interection at the UT After an exchange of punts UT put together its only long TD drive going yards in plays to take a lead with left Simms tried to pass for the twopoint conversion but it failed RB Ivan Williams had a yard run and Simms completed four passes for yards Freshman RB Cedric Benson got the score on a yard run Texas had offensive yards in the quarter and the Longhorn defense gave the Tar Heels fits allowing them to run only seven plays for minus yards Fourth Quarter Mangums yard field goal to start the fourth quarter gave Texas a lead Then the UT kickoff team forced the Tar Heels to start their next possession at the NC Curry tried to pass on first down and DT Maurice Gordon sacked him in the end zone for a safety and a lead just seconds deep in the quarter Vashers yard punt return for a touchdown with left put UT on top Longhorn LB Reed Boyds interception at the North Carolina set up TB Brett Robins yard TD run with seconds left then backup QB Major Applewhite took a knee on the extrapoint play leaving the score at to honor Cole Pittman the UT player who was killed in a vehicle accident in February Pittman Ceremony The Longhorns gave Cole Pittmans family an honorary TRing before the game Saturday In a tradition started nearly years ago by Darrell Royal TRings are presented to every Longhorn football player who graduates Pittman was killed in an automobile accident last February while returning to UT for spring football practice He was a junior defensive tackle When the Longhorns scored late in the game to reach the point plateau redshirt freshman quarterback Chance Mock who was Pittmans best friend on the team told coach Mack Brown the score matched Pittmans jersey number Texas did not try to kick the extra point after the score electing to take a knee to preserve the final score in Pittmans honor Number Updated Daily I update my number every day with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday he wants the Longhorn offense to develop more consistency but he also said he isnt worried about much of anything when his team posts a win Were stressing the team not individuals and stats this year he said Im not into statistics how much we run it or how much we throw it Im not as concerned about all that as I am about is time of possession the number of plays we have as compared to them the kicking game and turnovers But he said We havent had as many explosive runs or passes as I would like to see The UT staff defines explosive plays as runs of yards or more and passes of yards or more In two games this season both lopsided victories the Longhorns have run the ball times and they have had only six runs of yards or more They have thrown passes and have completed six of yards or more Brown said the Longhorns have been very conservative offensively and have forced the run in situations where the defensive formation normally would cause a pass to be called Were still not clicking on offense all the time he said but said one reason is were forcing the run some now in situations that we probably wont later in the year He said he wants the team to be able to run the ball when it wants to run it at times because a solid running game is necessary to pick up shortyardage first downs keep some pressure off the quarterback and run the clock to protect a lead late in the game But as a whole Brown said he was very happy with the victory over his former school After studying the film Im really pleased about almost everything There are still a lot of things we can improve but nearly everything was positive The special teams were very exciting and really helped us win the game but the fumbled punt gave them a touchdown he said Weve got some things to work on Brown said the offense had yards against them and they were giving up only yards a game against Oklahoma and Maryland The Carolina defensive line is very good I think they have six or seven pro prospects on their defense True freshmen LB Derrick Johnson led the team in tackles and had two sacks and Brown said he has the ability to play as good as anybody in the country Hes tall hes fast and he likes to hit I think hes got a chance to be really special Sooners Still Outlaws I normally dont write a lot about the other teams in the Big unless I am previewing their games with Texas But the University of Oklahoma issued an interesting press release about days ago Heres how it went in part Lynn McGruder who began his college football career at Tennessee is enrolled at Oklahoma University of Oklahoma athletic officials said today According to head football coach Bob Stoops McGruder has yet to join the football program Stoops said that McGruder is not practicing or participating in any football team activities and will not be until a past offthefield incident is resolved OU expects its studentathletes to represent the best values of the university both on and off the field Stoops said We have set very high standards of excellence and we are not going to compromise them in any way Our process of evaluating Lynn McGruder has included intensive conversations with him and members of his family and those who worked with him in previous athletic programs While we have not yet made a final decision about whether or not he will ultimately be allowed to participate in our football program Stoops continued we believe in looking at the whole character and background of a person in deciding whether or not he deserves a second chance We recognize that it is only human to make an isolated mistake and the important thing is whether or not we learn from that mistake If we end up deciding that he will join our football program we will hold him very strictly to the highest standards of behavior Not a single deviation from that standard will be tolerated Thats what the press release said and coming from OU I guess I shouldnt be that surprised McGruder was kicked off the Tennessee team after he was charged with felony possession of marijuana with the intent to sell and deliver The charge said there were marijuana plants a scale and other things the police report described as drugrelated material in his room Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer sometimes gives scholarships to kids other schools wont touch Do you remember the offensive lineman a couple of years ago who was charged with raping a student at Florida while he was on a recruiting visit to the school Florida dropped him but Fulmer signed him In other words when Fulmer boots a kid for character reasons you know something is really wrong The odd thing about Stoops taking him is that if convicted he might do some serious prison time Stoops didnt say whether McGruder is on scholarship but I think he would have stressed that he was walking on if that was the case I wonder what parents of top recruits will think of Stoops decision Perhaps he can tell them that if their sons come to Oklahoma and want to buy some dope at least they wont have to leave the athletic dorm to get it We shouldnt be surprised After all the original Sooners were the crooks who cheated on the land rush back in They didnt participate in the rush but hid out along the way and grabbed choice pieces of property Thats kind of like the marathon runners who get caught hitching a car ride part of the way Of course those runners get disqualified and dont get the race named after them they way the Sooners did Oklahoma is after all the Sooner State Corrections I wrote in a recent newsletter that the University Interscholastic League UIL the governing body for high school sports in Texas had a rule against recruits taking paid visits to colleges while they had eligibility remaining That rule was repealed five years ago and there is no such rule now I wrote in my last issue that Victor Ike and Ivan Williams ran behind the firstteam line and Cedric Benson ran behind the defensive line That should have been the secondteam line Subscribe To The EMailFax To Get YearRound Football Recruiting

touchdown to highlight UTs annual OrangeWhite game before a crowd school officials estimated at Coach Mack Brown had the first team offenses and defenses square off agains t each other for the first time in the OrangeWhite game The only touchdown the firstteam defense gave up was a yard Simms pass to WR Roy Williams who had a step on CB Quentin Jammer Simms also led the offense to a field goal QB Major Applewhite operating behind an offensive line patched with walkons led the second team to one touchdown against the secondteam defense on a fade route to WR Sloan Thomas in the end zone My vote for most improved offensive player this spring is split three ways because Simms sophomore TE Brock Edwards and senior tackle Mike Williams a re all much improved over last year On defense I think its a twoway tie between DT Marcus Tubbs and CBsafety Nathan Vasher I think the Longhorns will have the best group of WRs TEs and DBs in the B ig They will have the best passing QB in the Big too if Simms continu es to improve They also will have one of the two or three best passblocking lines in the league if they stay healthy Subscribe Now To The FaxEMail Service to Get Scoops on Early Recruiting Get

I should have commented on this earlier but better late than never Kevin Sherrington of the Dallas News wrote a lovein column about Texas AM coach R C Slocum right after national signing day and both Slocum and Sherrington used the opportunity to throw a few rocks at Texas coach Mack Brown and the Longhorns Im going to quote a couple of excerpts from the column with my comments about them Heres the first one Such is RC Slocums life these days Never had a losing season at Texas AM Won more games than any coach in school history Run a clean program h is dozen years as head coach Clean program No question its cleaner than it used to be but Sherrington must have a really short memory Remember those noshow jobs Then Sherrington and Slocum got into recruiting and both took some shots a t Brown and UT Heres what they said in the column Of course rankings come with caveats too Slocum reminded After four years of enrolling the countrys top recruiting classes he asked shouldn t a school have the most talented team in the country Shouldnt expectations go way up Wouldnt that be accurate Slocum asked In other words youre up Mr Brown First of all Brown hasnt had four years of enrolling the countrys top recruiting classes Hes had three of them and the third class hasnt eve n enrolled yet The other two were freshmen and sophomores last year and they are the heart and soul of the team Browns first signees at Texas werent in the class of the others which certainly were highly ranked classes His first great class will be starting its third year this season and it is ready to boost the Longhorns back into national prominence The Aggies on the other hand went in in and in Sounds like a downward spiral to me I wonder if Aggies expectations are way up Second the last time I looked Texas and Texas AM had played three times since Brown arrived to find Slocum firmly entrenched at AM with his progra m already well established Enheriting a team Brown has produced three consecutive ninewin season s and while I know it sounds farfetched after reading the remarks of Sherrington and Slocum he has a edge over Slocum and his Aggies The lone Aggie victory over Brown was in at AM by a razorthin margin when UT QB Major Applewhite the Big CoOffensive Player of the Year was too sick to play I know you play with what you have and I am not saying that Aggie victory shouldnt count but what I am saying is that any outsider reading the colu mn would think the Aggies must be hammering us every year While Im on the subject of biased reporting I thought it was interesting that the Houston Chronicle published a threecolumn bylined story on the Texas AM spring game which drew fans The paper did not staff the U T spring game and did not run one line on an event that was attended by fans The UT Sports Information Department distributed a lengthy story on the spring game and many papers used all or part of it but the Chronicle simpl y ignored the entire event The Chronicle has one sports columnist devout Aggie John Lopez who doesn t even try to get his facts straight when writing about Texas Remember his column on how UT basketball guard Darren Kelly wanted to go to AM but didnt have the grades Kelly was a full qualifier out of high school and in fact started his college career at a Division I school before switching to a JC When he missed a semester at Texas for academic problems it was because ma ny of his hours at the small JC he attended did not transfer and he was short on hours toward his degree It want because he was failing any courses But Lopez was more interested in making excuses for the dismal Aggie basketball team than he was in getting the facts straight If you get as irritated as I do with columnists who continue to glorify the Aggies and ignore or put down the Longhorns let the sports editors andor their bosses know about it An Early Look at the Schedule Trying to predict football games in April that are several months away is a dangerous business so Im going to just look at the schedule and talk abou t the likely odds on all the games The Longhorns probably will be at least point favorites over five of the ir foes They are the home games against New Mexico State and Kansas and the road games against Houston Oklahoma State and Baylor Texas also will be favored probably by at least points in the home g ames against North Carolina and Texas Tech and the game at Missouri That leaves the Oct date in Dallas against defending national champion Oklahoma the Oct home game against Colorado and the Nov visit to A M as the ones that would appear to be the most dangerous I think Colorado will be a dangerous team if RB Marcus Houston stays health y and AM is always dangerous in College Station But there is no question that the Sooners are the most dangerous looking fo e on the schedule I wont predict Texas will win every game but I will predict if the Longhorns average yards rushing against OU Colorado and AM well all be smiling heading into the post season Conradt Gives Up AD Title Jody Conradt UT womens basketball coach since and womens athletic director since is going back to coaching full time and giving up the AD post I have appreciated the opportunity to serve the university but my heart a nd my passion are about coaching womens athletics she said Conradt said she thinks her basketball program is making significant progress toward returning to the national spotlight and said she wants to devote full time to that job Chris Plonsky a senior associate athletic director in the mens department will serve as womens athletic director on an interim basis and will get a new title senior associate athletic director for mens and womens athletics Patricia Ohlendorf UT vice president for institutional relations and legal affairs oversees both athletic departments She said she will chair a smal l committee that will study the mens and womens athletic departments to determine their future course The study probably will take about two months to complete and all signs point to a recommendation to combine the two departments Only five Division I universities have separate athletic departments for me n and women The others are Tennessee Arkansas Minnesota and Wisconsin In recent years the two departments have combined to operate together in several areas at Texas such as sports medicine strength and conditioning fundraising and development marketing ticket operations and media relations Sources close to the situation at UT say combining the two departments and having one director to oversee both would save more than million a year The sources also say UT President Larry Faulkner who will make the ultimat e call favors combining the two departments In this day of increasing expenses and tight budgets it would make a lot o f sense to join the other schools in the Big and the vast majority of t he other Division I schools in combining the two departments under one athleti c director It would eliminate a lot of duplication and save a lot of money Jamboree on TV in Austin The Longhorns Spring Football Jamboree highlighted by the OrangeWhite gam e will be telecast by time Warner Cable Monday and Tuesday on Austin Cable Channel Fox Sports and Time Warner Cable are teaming up to bring Austin cable viewers the tapedelay broadcast of the March jamboree and scrimmage It will be telecast Monday April at pm and Tuesday April at pm Umpire Boycott Silly The three Austinarea umpires who are boycotting nonconference baseball games at Texas DischFalk Field because of what they term insulting person al attacks by Longhorns assistant coaches are being silly David Wiley Tim Henderson and Wade Ford say they wont call Texas nonconference games the rest of the season because they are unhappy with t he way they have been treated by UT assistants Frank Anderson and Tommy Harmon Tim Wade and I have just decided it might be better for all parties involved if we worked elsewhere this year because the professional climate has deteriorated all year such that we felt it would be better for us to extract ourselves from that situation Wiley said Henderson and Wade were assigned before the season to work some Big game s at DischFalk and said they will honor that commitment The reason the boycott is silly is that umpires have the ultimate weapon in disputes with coaches They can eject them and that would be a far more reasonable approach than what Wiley Henderson and Ford have chosen to do A few ejections will make any coach see the light even if he is in the right because umpires have dictatorial power over coaches Its also strange that Wiley is talking about it to reporters The Big h as a strict gag rule on all Big coaches and Wiley knows he can say anythin g he wants to without fear of contradiction from the other parties involved A True Orange Subscription Is The Gift You Can Give Every Year to Your Longhorn Friends A subscription to True Orange is the perfect

top national recruits since my last newsletter As expected DE Chase Pittman of national powerhouse Shreveport Evangel committed to Texas during ceremonies at his church on Sunday September The other national top pledge the Horns got recently was from LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar who first committed to Oklahoma Monday Sept then switched to Texas two days later and said he is solid for the Longhorns The Longhorns are close to getting a commitment from Tyler DB Matthew Melton who is being highly recruited because he is big enoough to play safety fast enough to play corner and unlike many of the states other top DBs is a full qualifier Tyler is this season and is one of the states top teams Melton missed one game with a sprained ankle but he had tackles and one interception in the other two games prior to their game Saturday Im very close to committing to Texas he said Ill probably do it in the next month Pittman chose Texas over LSU at the end but he was recruited by top schools from all over the country He is the brother of Cole Pittman the sophomore Longhorn DT who was killed in a vehicle accident in February while returning to Texas for spring football practice I went to Lufkin Friday night to watch Evangel play Lufkin one of the top teams in Texas In last weeks USA Today rankings Lufkin led by QB Reggie McNeal an AM pledge was rated No in the country and Evangel led by sophomore QB John David Booty and Pittman was rated No Evangel defeated Lufkin primarily because of Bootys throwing and a stout defense led by Pittman But Booty isnt the only stud sophomore on the Evangel team DE Chris Bowers is a budding star on the side opposite Pittman Lufkin ran away from Pittmans right DE spot all night but he still had by my count a sack three QB pressures and eight tackles McNeal is a sprinter but Pittman twice came from the far side to run him out of bounds He has outstanding speed and quickness and is on many national top teams Lufkin has an underclassman who will be a big man in recruiting circles next year He is TEWRQB Terrance Parks With McNeal struggling early in the game he moved to QB and brought Lufkin back from a deficit He not McNeal was named the Panthers offensive player of the game Texas also is trying to sign Jonathan Wade a pound cornerback at Evangel He has committed to Tennessee but took an official visit to Texas the weekend of the North Carolina game He is the top sprinter in Louisiana With a plus SAT Smith said UTs academic superiority over OU was a big factor Despite his early commitment to OU Smith said Im sure now I am solid on this I definitely know where I want to go and it is Texas Smith said I want to go where I will be happy and I feel like I will be happy in Austin The Texas people have said nothing but nice things to me even when I was committed to Oklahoma but the OU people havent been that nice He also said he had never realized how much difference there is in the two schools academically until he looked at an academic rating of colleges Oklahoma just cant compare to Texas academically he said Smith said his head coach and several of his assistant coaches are Oklahoma graduates and have been pushing me to go to Oklahoma Smith is the closest thing out there this year to sensational UT freshman LB Derrick Johnson If Smiths commitment holds up look for Johnson and Smith to be outstanding outside backers one on the weakside and one on the strongside for years to come at UT Subscribe To The EMailFax To Get YearRound Football Recruiting Scoops Save Big As An

then we had the good drive to start the second half and fumbled inside the Texas when we had a chance to retake the lead We had our chances but we werent able to execute Houston head coach Dana Dimel Gosh we really missed a lot of tackles We just didnt play well at all on defense I may have them out there practicing tomorrow Sunday Thats how concerned I am We have to tackle better than that to do the things we want to do this year Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese Houston played some good football early in the game but we just had to keep fighting On the long one I just faked in and cut outside and I was wide open and Chris Simms dropped it right in there UT WR B J Johnson who had a yard TD reception and yards on four catches I got some great blocking and I just tried to run hard on every carry It felt great to go over yards I felt like we were able to pound on them and wear them down in the second half We also were able to get a lot of balance on offense Longhorn RB Ivan Williams who became the first UT back to gain yards rushing this year with carries for yards and a touchdown Those points in the last eight seconds of the first half really gave us a lift I love to play smashmouth football with a big back and thats whaqt we had tonight with Ivan Williams Texas senior OT Mike Williams We had to fight through a lot of adversity in the first half but we took the lead and the momentum back when we scored twice at the end of the first half I think this was the best offensive game weve had this year UT QB Chris Simms who passed for yards and three touchdowns Their receivers made some phenomenal catches and they all have some great moves to go with their speed We busted some coverages and you cant do that and survive against receivers like Texas has Houston CB Jason Parker That was a crucial mistake on my part I was trying to get through the pile and get the first down and somebodys helmet hit the ball and it popped out We hit some big plays on

attemps for yards an average of per game He has thrown TD passes with two interceptions UT QB Chris Simms has completed of passes for yards an average of a game He has had five touchdown passes and allowed one interception The Raiders also have a better running game than they did last year with TB Ricky Williams averaging yards a carry and yards per game Williams also is Kingsburys favorite target leading the Big with an average of receptions and yards per game receiving Texas coach Mack Brown said the Longhorn defense has to put pressure on Kingsbury and has to tackle better than it did against Houston At and pounds and with blazing speed and outstanding moves Williams has proven he is a difficult man to corral How the UT defense copes with his dual threat will be a major key in determing who wins the game Kingsburys other favorite target is speedy redshirt freshman Nehemia Glover who is averaging catches for yards per game Tech head coach Mike Leach loves the short passing

Volume No September Longhorns Bury Cougars Get Ready For Tough Big Opener Against Texas Tech Texas was a point favorite at Houston Saturday night but the Cougars were primed for an upset until a Longhorn stampede in the final eight seconds of the first half and the first few minutes of the second half buried their chances The Longhorns took a victory to run their record to heading into a tough Big opener against Texas Tech this week but they were fighting for their lives in the first half and early in the second half before blowing the game open QB Chris Simms passed for yards and three touchdowns WR B J Johnson had four catches for yards and a TD and RB Ivan Williams rushed for yards and two more scores to spark the prolific Longhorn offense But the Longhorns needed their best offensive showing of the year because the usually reliable UT defense had its worst game of the season The statistics in this game were like some of those in the old runandshoot days Texas averaged yards per snap and Houston was right behind at yards per play The defensive play was so spotty that defensive coordinator Carl Reese threatened to make his players practice Sunday The defense did have some sparking moments stopping Houston on two crucial fourthdown plays and setting up a Longhorn touchdown with Nathan Vashers pass interception deep in Houston territory But it also gave up lots of big plays and allowed the Cougars to run and pass far too effectively for most of the game The main culprit was missed tackles but the Longhorn defenders also were victimized repeatedly by misdirection plays which is not a good sign with two unbeaten teams Texas Tech and Oklahoma coming up in the next two weeks Both teams love misdirection plays and after watching the way the Horns played Saturday night they will be finding even more misdirection plays to use Here briefly is how the game went First Quarter The Longhorns scored on their first two possessions driving yards after the kickoff to set up a yard field goal by freshman walkon Dusty Mangum for a lead with left then hitting a big one with Simms and Johnson combining on a yard passandrun play Mangums kick made it with left Houston came back with a yard scoring drive to cut the Longhorns lead to at the end of the quarter Simms barely overthrew wideopen WR Roy Williams on a nearmiss for what would have been another UT touchdown Second Quarter Texas couldnt move on its first drive and Simms threw an interception on the second The Cougars drove yards after the interception taking a lead on a deflected threeyard pass with just left The Horns came back with a quick yard scoring drive Simms completed passes of yards to WR Tony Jeffery and to Williams before hitting Jeffery for the final yards and with Mangums kick a lead with just eight seconds left The Cougars couldnt handle a bouncing kickoff and the Horns recovered at the with four seconds left Mangum kicked a yard field goal on the last play At the half Texas had yards offensively and the Cougars had The Longhorns had the lone turnover however and that led to one UH score Third Quarter Houston started the half with a drive deep into Texas territory but QB Kelly Robertson fumbled on a fourthdown plunge and Texas recovered at the then drove yards for a TD to take a twotouchdown lead on Ivan Williams yard run at with left A twopoint conversion try faile d The Cougars gambled again on fourth down on their next possession Compounding the problem they were on their own DE Cory Redding slammed Robertson to the turf for no gain and the Horns covered that distance in seven plays with Williams again scoring from the Mangums kick made it with left Vashers interception on UHs next possession again gave the offense a short field at the Houston Ivan Williams carried twice for yards and Simms hit Roy Williams for yards to reach the UH as the quarter ended Fourth Quarter Simms hit TE Brock Edwards with a yard scoring pass on the first play of the quarter and Mangums kick gave Texas a lead Mangum missed a yard field goal on UTs next possession It was his first miss as a Longhorn after seven straight successful field goals Moments later UH WR Brandon Middleton got away from the Longhorn defenders and was in the clear by yards when Robertson floated a pass to him He loped the rest of the way to complate an yard scoring play and drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for taunting his pursuers Houstons try for a point conversion failed leaving UT on top with left DE Kalen Thornton sacked Robertson at the UH on the Cougars next possession forcing a fumble LB DeAndre Lewis covered the fumble and backup QB Major Applewhite hit TE Bo Scaife for three yards and a touchdown three plays later Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left Houston came right back with a play yard drive to score again leaving Texas ahead On the Horns last possession freshman TB Cedric Benson carried four times for yards including a yard TD plunge to run the final score to Number Updated Daily I update my number every day with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown wanted some explosive offensive plays and he got them in spades Saturday night in Houston But so did the Houston Cougars which made the point favorite Longhorns sweat for quite a while before pulling away Last week he was worried about the dearth of big offensive plays This week hes tickled with his offensive production and worried sick about his defense We got complacent on defense he said We just stood there at times Offensively we played really really well We had good balance between the run and pass we had big plays five in the passing game and six in the running game But the negative part is they Houston had nine big plays Its a good thing we had great offensive production because we would not have without it because our defense did not play well enough to play anybody left on our schedule Weve got to get better than that defensively to have a chance to beat Tech this weekend Weve got to get right to work on improving defensively On the positive said Brown said We are excited to be It equals our best start since Houston played about as good as they can play and they played as hard as they could possibly play I thought the momentum changer was scoring points in the final seconds of the first half to go up he said then we totally dominated the third quarter scoring on every possession The Longhorns only had two possessions in the third quarter and they scored touchdowns on each of them There was another momentum changer early in the third quarter when Houston took the secondhalf kickoff and drove to the UT Facing a fourthandinches and trailing the Cougars went for it QB Kelly Robertson tried a sneak and he might have made it but a Longhorn got a helmet on the ball and it shot back to the where the Horns recovered Texas promptly drove for another TD and a point lead and the rout was on That was a big play too Brown said The defense did have some stops and that was a key one But he said he said the Longhorns overall performance defensively was just unacceptable We tackled very very poorly he said I think our defense has just been bragged on so much and we shut them out last year that I dont know if our guys showed them much respect Getting back to the good news Brown said the team didnt suffer any serious injuries and he was glad to get TEs Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards more involved in the offense He noted that both have played very little because of injuries and he said both are very talented players who need to be involved in the Longhorns offense to make it more effective Game Notes The Longhorns did not have a threeandout possession Saturday night They only punted twice in possessions and they made at least one first down before each punt In their possessions they had seven touchdowns two field goals a missed field goal a fumble an interception and the two punts The yard touchdown on QB Chris Simms throw to WR B J Johnson was the sixth play of yards or more in UT history It was the fourth longest pass play in Longhorn history The Texas offense scored on five consecutive possessions stretching from the end of the first half TD FG through the entire third quarter TD In the second half Texas scored on five of its seven possessions TDs and advanced into Houston territory on all seven possessions Flowers Has to Give Up Football McFadden Quits Team WR Montrell Flowers has had to give up football and backup kicker Matt McFadden has quit the team Head coach Mack Brown said Flowers suffered kidney injuries when he took a hard hit in the North Carolina game He said doctors discovered Flowers only has one kidney and advised him to give up football Brown said he will get a medical scholarship which wont count against the man limit and will concentrate on track where he has two years of eligiblity left Montrells injury is really unfortunate Brown said He is a nice kid who was playing his best football and providing much needed veteran leadership for us Brown also announced that backup kicker Matt McFadden of Coppell has quit the team to concentrate on personal matters The personal matters are a grand jury indictment against him in Dallas County on a felony charge of taking and distributing nude photographs of a yearold Coppell girl McFadden a redshirt freshman at Texas was expected to be the starting place kicker at Texas this season but he had a disappointing spring and the coaches brought in four freshmen walkon kickers in August One of them Dusty Mangum of Mesquite beat him out

Champaign Illinois the big fast tough wide receiver the Longhorns have been recruiting for months committed to UT Sunday Johnson a national top prospect and one of the top wide receivers in the country took his official visit to Texas this weekend and said he committed to UT head coach Mack Brown before returning home Texas assistant coach Tim Brewster did an outstanding recruiting job with Johnson who listed Texas No throughout the recruiting process Johnson said he picked the Longhorns because I love their offense They really run a protype offense Its a dream offense for a wide receiver Johnson is the th early commitment for Texas and is the ninth one who is listed on one or more national top teams The other eight recruits who have been listed on top national teams are DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel LB Garnett Smith of Arlington Lamar DTs Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier Earl Anderson of San Marcos Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral the twotime defending Class A champion in Arizona OLs Brett Valdez of Brownwood and Neale Tweedie of Allen and TE David Thomas of Wolfforth Frenship Davis made all of the top national lists last year The other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen of Keller LBs Brian Robison of Splendora and Marcus Myers of Pflugerville Connally WR Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar and RBAth Clint Haney of Smithson Valley DB Matthew Melton of Tyler John Tyler had planned to come to Texas on an unofficial visit last weekend but was not able to make it He told me he is planning to commit to Texas soon RECRUITING NOTES Super QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison says his top two teams right now are Texas and Miami Young is one of the nations top quarterback prospects He also is an outstanding basketball player but wants to concentrate on football in college The TexasOklahoma game Saturday will be a big factor in deciding where several top recruits go including OL Justin Blalock of Plano East DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and DE Bryan Pickryl of Jenks Oklahoma All of them are national top recruits I have moved Lufkin QB Reggie McNeal to the Athlete category on my Blue Chip list on page He is a great athlete with tremendous speed I saw him play when Lufkin hosted Shreveport Evangel and think he is one of the states top prospects but might wind up at wide receiver or defensive back in college I usually dont explain moves like this but he is an Aggie commitment and many of the AM gurus always move Longhorn signees down in their rankings when they commit to Texas I still have McNeal ranked very high but have changed his projected position WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus has played very little high school football because of transfers and disciplinary problems but he is a great athlete who would be on all the national lists if he had played as much as the other top guys He is very interested in Texas and other top schools but many of them are waiting to see how he fares for the rest of the season on the field and in the citizenship area before pulling the trigger on an offer RB Selvin Young of Jersey Village is opening some eyes again this season He was sensational in rushing for more than yards as a sophomore but was hampered by an ankle injury throughout his

No October Longhorns Blast Raiders Run Record to Huge Showdown with OU Looms Saturday Junior QB Chris Simms completed his first passes and pound sophomore RB Ivan Williams bulled for yards and two touchdowns to spark Texas to a victory over Texas Tech Saturday night in Austin Simms had his sharpest performance as a Longhorn completing of passes for yards and a touchdown and scoring two TDs on yard sneaks It also was easily Williams best game His strong runs gave the Longhorns such balance that they scored on their first three possessions and kept the Raiders defenders guessing all night The Longhorn defense coming out in a and inserting sensational freshman LB Derrick Johnson in place of DT Maurice Gordon also rebounded strongly after last weeks poor showing in the victory over Houston The victory ran Texas record to for the first time since But getting to will prove a monumental task for the No Longhorns because they will face defending national champion and No rated Oklahoma Saturday at pm in the teams traditional showdown in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas see OU scouting report in second part Defensive coordinator Carl Reese a staunch advocate of manforman pass defense fed Texas Techs highoctane offense a steady dose of zone coverages Saturday night He also got to use his favored manforman defense on occasion but it was primarily a tight zone with a lot of different looks that was responsible for holding the Raiders to seven points The Longhorn defenders kept the dangerous Tech receivers in front of them making them catch the ball in the short flat most of the time then try to use their speed to make something big happen The Raiders problem is that this Texas defense is speedy too and those twoyard catches often became fouryard gains Consider these telling statistics the Raiders couldnt run carries for net yards and they threw passes completing of them for yards Thats a net gain of just under yards per pass and its exactly yards per completion Raider coach Mike Leach who had poked fun at Texas CBs Quentin Jammer and Rod Babers and QB Chris Simms in pregame comments gave them little credit in his postgame interview then bristled when a Lubbock reporter asked him about all the short passes Raider QB Kliff Kingsbury threw I dont know who all those experts are that know so much about going vertical Leach said I would guess I know a lot more about going vertical than they do With that being the case I thought we went vertical the right number of times Their longest pass completion was yards and they only scored points so maybe they did and maybe they didnt What he didnt say was that the swarming UT defense didnt give the Raiders much chance to go deep or vertical in his terminology Here briefly is how the game went First Quarter The Longhorns won the toss and deferred so Tech took the ball The UT defense forced a quick punt Simms led the Longhorns yards in plays hitting five straight passes all of them to WR Roy Williams for yards Ivan Williams got the other yards on six bullish runs including the final two yards for the TD Dusty Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left After another Tech punt the Longhorns struck again going yards in nine plays Simms was for on the drive hitting WR B J Johnson twice for yards and TE Bo Scaife once for yards But Ivan Williams had the big play a yard run to the Raiders Simms got the TD on a yard run Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left The Longhorns totally dominated the quarter leading in first downs in rushing yardage in passing yardage and in total offense But the Raiders were driving for the first time as the quarter ended Second Quarter Techs Ricky Williams squirted through a huge hole on a fourthand and dashed yards for a touchdown on the second play of the quarter cutting the UT lead to just seconds deep But the Longhorn offense retaliated immediately Victor Ike returned the kickoff to the UT and Simms found Roy Williams with a yard TD pass two plays later Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left Tech drove to the UT late in the half but LBs DeAndre Lewis and Tyrone Jones stopped Kingsbury a yard short of a first down on a keeper that got to the UT Simms was for for yards and a touchdown at the half TE Bo Scaife who had receptions for yards had a rare drop and Simms other incompletion was one he threw away under a big rush Third Quarter The Longhorns put the game on ice with two touchdowns in a second span early in the second half They drove yards in plays to start the half Ivan Williams got the touchdown on a yard run He had six carries for y ards on the drive and Simms hit Scaife twice for yards Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left Derrick Johnson ripped the ball out of Ivory McCanns grasp on the kickoff and walkon Richard Hightower recovered at the Tech Williams carried twice to the then Simms scored on a sneak Mangums kick put UT on top with left Neither team threatened again in the quarter Fourth Quarter Tech drove to the Texas early in the fourth quarter but a fourthdown pass fell incomplete Texas came back with a play yard scoring drive Simms gave way to Major Applewhite during the drive Ike got the touchdown on a yard run Redshirt freshman RB Sneezy Beltran got his first three carries of the year on the final Texas possession netting six yards Game Quotes We didnt play as well as we should have tonight We got stopped at key times on all sides of the ball and didnt play together as well as Texas did The Longhorns deserve a lot of credit for their effort Texas Tech head coach Mike Leach These spread offenses are like the wishbone If they know what youre doing and where youre going to line up theyll get you With that kind of offense youve got to play around a little give them a twoman rush a threeman rush just keep them guessing Weve got another offense like that coming up this week Oklahoma We cant just do the same things we did tonight Well have to come up with some new wrinkles Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese We ran for more than yards and we passed for more than yards Chris Simms played extremely well I think his best game is yet to come He gets better each week I think hes playing within himself UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis talking about the offense in general and answering a question about whether this was Simms best game The line did a great job of blocking We go out every Saturday and play the game like its the national championship game OU will be a great game and were looking forward to the challenge Longhorn RB Ivan Williams who had a career best yards rushing We showed them some things they hadnt seen before from us It was a lot of fun Texas senior LB DeAndre Lewis Roy Williams split the two safeties They gave us the look we wanted It was a great call by coach Greg Davis They gave us the middle of the field all night UT QB Chris Simms talking about his yard touchdown pass to Roy Williams and the Raider defense Its not like getting an extra cornerback in there but our linebackers are all pretty fast It was a lot of fun getting to play most of the game UT freshman LB Derrick Johnson who got his first start talking about the defense They did what they needed to do running and passing the football We got a tail kicking Tech defensive coordinator Greg McMackin We had opportunities but we struggled in the red zone early In the second half the wheels just came off I have to take my hat off to the Longhorns They played a great game tonight Raider QB Kliff Kingsbury Number Updated Daily I update my number every day with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday a thorough study of Saturday nights game film by all of the Texas coaches showed nearly everybody played well for the Longhorns He also said the team has improved since the beginning of the season and said it is important that it continue to improve We feel good about where we are he said Well know a lot more after Saturday because this will be by far the best team we have played He was referring of course to the upcoming meeting in Dallas with Oklahoma Brown said it was really important for the players to focus on the Texas Tech game last week Were really excited about the way the guys played he said It was a tough game to play because so many people were already talking about the Oklahoma game We told our team last week the OU game wouldnt be nearly as important to us if we didnt beat Texas Tech and Texas Tech is a good football team that we knew would come in here and play us hard He said the Longhorns new defense with freshman LB Derrick Johnson replacing DT Maurice Gordon worked great against Tech because it gave us more speed Against more runoriented teams he said the Longhorns base defense will still be the We felt going into the kind of offenses were going into Tech and Oklahoma we needed to change it up play some zone try to give the quarterback some indecision and keep the ball in front of us Weve been using it since the spring but we didnt feel like we needed it against Houston Brown said He also said the three starting linebackers all seniors have been playing the best since weve been here He said Johnson is just so talented that we needed to get him in there and we can do that in a with an extra linebacker Weve been losing three games a year since we got here Brown said In the games we lose weve been giving up too many big plays playing too much man for man He said the use of some zone coverages in the secondary helps the defensive backs keep the receivers in front of them helps eliminate some of those big plays Offensively he said the Horns are much better this year than they were last year at this time Chris Simms has a lot more experience The receivers have more experience he said Were blocking better were running better Last year we werent able to run the ball consistently and we had one quarterback who was hurt some Major Applewhite and one who hadnt played much Simms and that really hurt us He said Simms is playing much better than he did early last year and he said the emergence of TE Bo Scaife has helped the offense Scaife was supposed to be a weapon last year but suffered a seasonending knee injury during the preseason drills My goal and the assistant coaches goal is to make this team the best team it can be he said We also want to continue to improve to be a better team at the end of the year than we were at the beginning
<10244010.1075852130918.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2001-10-08 09:34:48,True Orange October Part of Recruiting Roundup The loss to Oklahoma didnt have as much impact on some of the top players as I thought it would I talked to MLB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite OL Justin Blalock of Plano East and DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster after the game They are the three of the brightest superstars in the Dallas area who are strongly considering both Texas and Oklahoma Harris who is the bruising middle backer the Longhorns so desperately need said It was a great game Both defenses played great Asked if the outcome would have any bearing on his decision he said No I just want to go some place where they play great defense and both teams play great defense He said he also plans to visit Texas AM Florida and Florida State Blalock said the game was exciting and said he sees a chance to play pretty early at either school and thats one of the main things Im looking for He said he isnt close to making a decision but still is very interested in Texas Dibbles the kind of physical and fast defensive end the Longhorns covet said It was a great game and could have gone either way The outcome wont influence my decision one way or the other He said he still is looking at Texas and OU as well as several other schools Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar who committed to Texas several months ago continues to have an outstanding season Playing on a team that is not blessed with outstanding talent or speedy wide receivers he continues to be one of the top passers in the Dallas area He completed of passes for yards and a touchdown Friday in a victory over Winnsboro with no interceptions He also scored on a yard run and had net yards rushing on carries Malone is a quarterback who sees the field and looks for the most open receivers That ability was what made Major Applewhite so effective for Texas before severe injuries to both knees gave Chris Simms the starting job I think it is the most important talent a college quarterback needs to be successful Its really pretty simple to understand that a pass to an open receiver is a lot easier to complete with a lot less risk of interception than a pass thrown to a covered receiver Malone also has a strong arm and very good mobility to go along with his outstanding field vision He is a lot better than most gurus think The Longhorns with commitments probably will take another or recruits They can take more than the normal limit in this recruiting year because DE Chase Pittman will graduate in December and enroll in January which will allow him to count against last year and some other players the Horns are recruiting also could enroll in January The key recruits still on the UT radar screen in addition to the ones mentioned earlier are QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee WRs Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus who might get an offer if he stays out of trouble for the rest of the year Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and Anthony Wright of Klein Forest OL Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield DEs Brian Pickryl of Jenks Oklaand Travis Leitko of The Woodlands DTs Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo Marco Martin of Mesquite and Loren Howard of Scottsdale Saquaro Ariz CBs Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln and Jonathan Wade of Shreveport Evangel Safeties Brodney Pool of Houston Westbury and Matthew Melton of Tyler and Athletes Eddorian McCullough of North Garland and

Pflugerville Connally Athletes Clint Haney Smithson Valley Nine of the players Johnson Pittman Smith Davis Anderson Sendlein Valdez Tweedie and Thomas have been on one or more national top lists Davis was on all the lists last year Looking to the Future Much has been made of the youth of the powerful Oklahoma team The Sooners should be better next year but so should the Longhorns Oklahoma returns starters eight on offense and eight on defense Texas returns starters eight offensively and six defensively Three of the Longhorn senior starters on defense are linebackers but the best UT linebacker is true freshman Derrick Johnson Some of the brightest stars on both teams are very young Freshman DT Tommy Harris and sophomore DE Jimmy Wilkerson are OUs two best defensive linemen Texas top two tight ends and top four wide receivers also are sophomores Another thing to remember is that these games often turn on strange things In this one for example UT had the upper hand early but OU QB Nate Hybl was hurt and Jason White replaced him and led the Sooners to victory One thing that wont change is the Sooners great secondary If you want to go deep you had better throw a great pass and if you want to avoid costly turnovers in the passing game you must use your head and not take foolish chances Texas could have won this game The Longhorns can win next years game if they improve their offense and it should improve because all of the skill players will be back The UT defense joined the offense in being awful last year The offense was awful again this year but the defense played great The offense needs to steal a page from that book If Chris Simms Roy Williams B J Johnson Sloan Thomas Bo Scaife Brock Edwards and either Cedric Benson or Ivan Williams step it up a few notches next year the Longhorns might get back on top in this topsyturvy series Both teams defenses should be better next year so the winner will be the team that can get the best and most errorfree offensive performance Its up to head coach Mack Brown and his assistants to figure out how to do that He wants to win a national championship so hes going to have to figure it out because there is no question that there is no tougher league than the Big On the bright side despite the fact that Bob Stoops won a national title in his second year and is competing for another one this year most of the great coaches in the country took a little longer Darrell Royal the Longhorns great one won his first national title in his seventh year Bobby Bowden won his in his th season at Florida State Tom Osborne took years to win his first one at Nebraska then won it all in three of the next four years The Longhorns just need to get a little better and they have the time and resources to do it Just dont give up on the guys and the coaches Remember how bad we were when they got there Were on the right track if we stay the course Injury Report DE Kalen Thornton sprained knee and TB Victor Ike bruised ribs are the only Longhorns who were injured in Saturdays game Team trainer Tom McVan said Sunday both players will be examined again Monday to determine whether they can play against Oklahoma State It looks like injured LB Lee Jackson turf toe will be redshirted He is a fourthyear senior who has another year left he he doesnt play this season Longhorn Notes The Texas defense gave up a season low total of yards to the Oklahoma offense The Sooners were averaging yards of total offense per game before playing Texas This game marked the first time Texas failed to score a touchdown since a loss to No Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl The last time Texas failed to score a touchdown against Oklahoma was in when the Sooners took a victory Luxurious Austin Townhouse For Sale Super nice townhouse in great

and despite prior announcements will not be televised not even on a pay per view basis The Longhorns ranked No in both polls are while the Tigers are unranked at Missouri opened the season with a loss to Bowling Green then thumped Southwest Texas before getting mauled by Nebraska Then the Tigers beat Oklahoma State in a triple overtime before losing to Iowa State and then outscoring Kansas Tiger QB Kirk Farmer has had a hot hand in recent weeks and he kept both teams in the game last week blistering Kansas with yards and three touchdowns passing plus another rushing yards But he also had two interceptions run back for touchdowns Farmer a pound junior has completed of passes for yards and touchdowns but he was very productive in the Tigers three most recent games He also is a slippery runner who is a great scrambler WR Justin Gage a pound junior is one of the nations most productive pass receivers He has caught passes for yards and TDs and ranks second in the Big in receptions per game with a average RB Zack Abron a pound sophomore is the main threat on the ground He has rushed times for yards and TDs Thats an average of yards per carry New coach Gary Pinkel inherited eight offensive and six defensive starters from a team and he has shifted players around particularly on defense to try to get more speed on the field I had to use Big statistics in my team comparisons this week because the NCAA defensive statistics and rankings were not available at press time As you can see from the statistics below the Longhorns appear to be far superior to the Tigers This is a game the Longhorns should win and will win if they Avoid costly turnovers Keep on running the ball to provide more offensive balance Get their usual great defensive game Heres how the teams compare

Buckman Close to Decision Brad Buckman the Austin Westlake forward who is the object of the big recruiting battle between Texas and North Carolina is very close to making his choice In fact two North Carolina internet sites claim he has already made it and the Tar Heels are the winners Buckman isnt saying He says he has always been a Texas fan but really likes North Carolina and the ACC because basketball is so important in that area Top Women Visit Center LaToya Davis of Houston South Houston took her official visit to Texas last weekend after visiting Texas Tech the previous week Davis the states top uncommitted player has narrowed her choices to those two schools and is expected to make her decision this week Three top juniors also took unofficial visits to Texas the same weekend They are Kalee Carey of Canyon Destiny Drew of Crosby and Emily Niemann of Houston Westbury Christian UT Men Women Picked th The Longhorns arent getting alot of respect in basketball The Texas men and women were both picked to finish fifth in a poll of Big coaches last week The mens coaches picked Chris Owens to the AllBig first team and tabbed freshman point guard T J Ford as conewcomer of the year The womens coaches didnt name any Longhorns to their honor teams which probably was a mistake because the Longhorn women were headed toward a very good season last year when a rash of injuries destroyed their chances With an outstanding group of incoming recruits the Longhorn women will have much more depth this year Turnover Troubles Texas is and Colorado is You knew that didnt you But did you know that in the two games Colorado lost the Buffaloes suffered nine turnovers five against Fresno State and four against Texas and did not cause a single one And did you know that in the game the Longhorns lost they gave up four turnovers against Oklahoma without gaining a single one What that statistic proves is that going in turnovers is a really surefire formula for going in games The

Faithful Volume No October Longhorn Defense Stifles Buffs Simms Benson Spark Offensive Fireworks in Romp The Texas defense forced four turnovers and totoally shut down Colorados offense in the second half to lead the No Longhorns to a victory over No Colorado in Austin The offense also had a great day with QB Chris Simms throwing for yards and three touchdowns and true freshman RB Cedric Benson getting yards for the second straight Saturday He also scored two touchdowns and caught three passes for yards Benson had the days biggest offensive play It came with the Longhorns leading and facing secondand at their own just before the the half The Horns were going into a stout wind and Colorado was threatening to get the ball back in great field position But Simms dropped back and just before he was hit flipped a shovel pass to Benson who caught it put an awesome move on two Buff defenders and sped yards to launch the Longhorns on an yard scoring drive that broke the game open The UT defense forced four Buffalo turnovers three fumbles and a pass interception and held the potent Colorado offense to just two first downs and net offensive yards in the second half The three fumbles Colorado lost all came in the first half and cost the Buffs a firstandgoal at the UT with Texas ahead only and set up short Longhorn scoring drives for the field goal that made it and the touchdown that gave Texas a lead Colorados starting QB Craig Ochs did not play because of a concussion he suffered in the victory over Texas AM last week His replacement Bobby Pesavento is a better passer but Ochs is a much better runner and his absence caused the Buffaloes to change their offensive strategy to include more passing and less double tight end power running The Longhorn defense also had something to do with that Here briefly is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred Colorado took the ball and the Longhorn defense stuffed the Buffs power running game and forced a quick punt Starting at their own after a short punt into the stiff wind the Horns scored quickly Benson ran for then Simms hit TE Bo Scaife for A wide receiver reverse was beautifully blocked allowing B J Johnson to gallop yards to the Buffalo Benson carried three times for a first down at the then Simms after a fake to Benson going right rolled left and hit WR Roy Williams for the TD Dusty Mangums kick gave UT a lead with left On the first play after the kickoff Pesavento hit two big passes to the UT Then he threw into a crowd at the Longhorn but WR Derek McCoy wrestled it away from three Horns and bulled to the four before fumbling Freshman LB Derrick Johnson recovered for Texas The Horns couldnt move and a short punt gave the Buffs the ball at their own Colorado went to its power running game and rolled to a first down at the UT before the Longhorn defense stiffened and forced a yard field goal try that was wide CU led in first downs and in total offense but the Longhorns led because they scored on their only foray deep into Buff territory while the Buffaloes fumble at the and missed chipshot FG killed both their scoring chances Second Quarter DE Kalen Thornton forced a fumble that was recovered by UT CB Roderick Babers at the CU The Horns drove to the before Mangum kicked a yard field goal for a lead with left UTs kickoff into the wind went out of bounds giving Colorado good field position at the and the Buffs got their running game going and swept in for the TD in just seven plays to cut the lead to with left UT drove into Buff territory but Simms was sacked to kill the threat The third Colorado fumble of the half set the Horns up at the Buff and they capitalized but they they had to score two TDs to get credit for one First Simms hit Williams in the end zone and Williams got a foot down in bounds but the official waved it off Benson got the TD on a yard run and Mangums kick gave UT a lead with left A quick defensive stop gave the Horns another possession at their with left Simms was sacked at the on the first play but Benson took a shovel pass juked two defenders off their feet at about the and scampered yards down the sideline Simms passed to WR B J Johnson for and to Williams for before Benson scored from the with left for a lead Texas led in first downs and in total offense in the quarter Third Quarter Texas couldnt move into the wind and had to punt Colorado drove to the Texas and went for it on a fourthand but the Longhorn defense held Brown to a yard gain to end that drive The Longhorn offense then drove yards in plays for another TD with the payoff coming on a yard pass from Simms to WR Sloan Thomas Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left The UT defense stifled Colorados next effort and Nathan Vasher ran the Buffalo punt back yards to the CU setting up a yard Mangum FG for a lead with left Texas led in first downs and in total offense in the quarter Fourth Quarter Simms found Thomas all alone in the end zone for yards and the games f inal score on the Horns first possession in the quarter Major Applewhite and Chance Mock took over at QB after that The Longhorn defense did not allow Colorado a single first down in the period and the Buffs had only plays for net yards Drive Chart Heres the drive chart for the game showing how each team fared on each possession First Half CU plays

game ends Number Updated Daily I update my number every day with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday studying the films of the Longhorns victory over Colorado Saturday proved what we felt all along our guys played really well and really hard all day He also said Colorado is a much better team than yesterdays score would indicate That was just a game that got out of hand because of turnovers He said he was very pleased with the shovel passes wide receiver reverses and other misdirection plays the Horns used very successfully Saturday If you are moving the ball they usually work he said Weve talked about needing a little more misdirection All of them are things we need to run because it makes our regular plays work better He had said last week wanted to use more traps run more gaps and counter gaps saying it slowed defensive pursuit and created more doubt in the minds of defenders After using a lot of them against the Buffaloes he said they will remain a part of the UT offense Colorado came into the game on a fivegame winning streak and with a powerful running game that ranked No nationally at yards a game and a strong rushing defense that was No nationally allowing only yards That had allowed the Buffs to dominate time of possession against their foes They were averaging about minutes a game compared to about minutes for their opponents But Texas dominated the time of possession to held the Buffaloes to net rushing yards yards below their average and rushed on the Buff defenders for yards about more than they had been allowing Brown said the Longhorn defense did an outstanding job against the CU power runners and he said the Texas offense was successful because it was able to stay two dimensional But he said the early UT lead helped along by the Colorado turnovers forced them to try to play catchup and playing catchup is not their game I think Colorado is really good he said Weve played so well at home and our crowd gives us a big advantage at home I think Colorado will win a bunch more football games this year Longhorn true freshman RB Cedric Benson picked up yards rushing on carries and scored two touchdowns in his second start It marked the first time all season a running back has hit the Colorado defense for yards Thats a credit to our balance our offensive line and to Cedric Brown said Hes a fine running back who has great vision and who almost always falls forward Hes getting better every week Brown said he and his assistant coaches talk constantly to their players about the need to show up ready to play every week and he also said its way too early to worry about the BCS bowl situation because there are a lot of football games still to be played before that comes into play We talked to our team after Florida lost to Auburn about how you cant control anything except what you do Anybody can beat anybody Our guys understand the only thing they can do is be the best football team they can be and be ready to play Missouri this Saturday What weve got to do is try to win four more football games and see where that takes us Longhorn Notes Quotes They say football is a game of inches and UT QB Chris Simms will buy into that particularly after executiing the shovel pass to freshman RB Cedric Benson just before the half that went for yards and helped break the game open I was nervous dropping back Simms said I was in the end zone and saw the defensive end coming and I didnt know if our tackle got a good piece of him and Im thinking Gosh I have to get it out Cedrics still turning around and I kind of threw it just as I was about to get hit and hoped he could catch it Cedric just got turned around and he caught it and then made an unbelievable move down the sideline As for Benson he says college football is a little more complicated than he thought it would be In high school it was basically run left run right he said Here Im learning how to block how to fake better and how to run better routes Simms said Benson is going to be great He runs so hard on every play and the thing I like about him is every time I drop back to pass and he protects for me he turns around after his block and goes Did I do okay I say I didnt get hit did I You did okay
<29492380.1075852131129.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2001-10-22 08:16:21,True Orange October Part of Recruiting Roundup Tyler DB Matt Melton committed to Texas last week because I knew I wanted to stay in state and after visiting AM and Texas unofficially I just like Texas better He said he visited UT unofficially because he wants to take his official visit the December weekend to attend the Longhorn football banquet Melton who has tackles and two interceptions so far this year said he had offers from about or schools including Texas AM Purdue TCU Baylor and West Virginia He is the th recruit to commit to Texas He is a member of my Fabulous The other recruits who have committed to Texas include nine recruits who are listed on one or more national top teams They are WR Marquis Johnson of Centennial High School in Champaign Illinois DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar DTs Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier Earl Anderson of San Marcos Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral the twotime defending Class A champion in Arizona OLs Brett Valdez of Brownwood and Neale Tweedie of Allen and TE David Thomas of Wolfforth Frenship Davis made all of the top national lists last year The other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen of Keller LBs Brian Robison of Splendora and Marcus Myers of Pflugerville Connally WR Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar and RBAth Clint Haney of Smithson Valley Michael Williams the big and fast linebacker from Lindale I wrote about it my last issue went to the OklahomaBaylor game Saturday and committed to the Sooners When I talked to him Sunday night he called it a soft commitment and said Im still going to visit Texas on December and I might visit Minnesota and Texas Tech too I think hes in about the same boat as Garnet Smith the Arlington Lamar linebacker who is committed to Texas Both say they are committed but both want to look around a little bit to see if they find anything better I always compare it to being engaged and dating other people which makes getting married somewhat iffy Williams probably will wind up at OU and Smith probably will wind up at Texas but both cases will bear watching right up to and through signing day in February Several top national recruits were in Austin for the TexasColorado game including DE Bryan Pickryl of Jenks Oklahoma who was there on his official visit He wasnt expected back at home until Monday so I wasnt able to talk to him after his visit but before his visit he told me he has narrowed his choices to Oklahoma Texas and Missouri Top Texas players who were at the game included RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park MLB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands and WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus Players already committed to UT who were there included Smith Anderson Thomas Janszen Myers and Miksch This Longhorn recruiting class is already ranked No in the country by a couple of national recruiting services The ranking will improve dramatically if the Horns hold what they have and add a few top national recruits like DT Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and some of the players who attended the game Saturday like Pickryl Hardy Harris Leitko and Timmons The Horns wont get all of those guys but they continued on page Recruiting continued from page will get several of them and their chances are very good with Wright Dibbles Harris Hardy and Timmons if he walks the straight and narrow path for the rest of the season They also are close to with Pickryl Young and Leitko If Williams does follow through on his plans to visit Texas the Dec weekend his pledge to OU might turn out to be really soft Of course the same could be said of Smiths commitment to Texas if he follows through on his announced plans to take other visits Texas has pledges from five players on my man difference maker list including No DT Anderson No LB Smith No LB Brian Robison of Splendora No OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood and No QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar The Horns have a pretty good shot at everyone in the top seven on that list No DT Wright No QB Young No DE Dibbles No DE Leitko No RB Hardy and No LB Harris They wont get all of that group but they might get most of them I think the Longhorns will sign at least four players from the eightmember group of superstars that includes Wright Dibbles Harris Hardy Pickryl Young Lietko and Timmons If they do this class will rank very high nationally probably in the top That would give the Longhorns four straight super classes heading into next season and for the first time the oldest group of that foursome would be seniors or juniors who have redshirted The Longhorns with commitments already have a couple of shaky ones in Smith who plans to take other visits and one player who has an uphill battle to qualify They can take more than the normal limit in a single year because Pittman plans to graduate from Shreveport Evangel in December and enroll at Texas in January which will let him count against last years total Pickryl also plans to graduate early so he also could be counted back to last year if he signs with Texas I expect the Longhorns to take commitments from another to recruits The number will be on the low side if Smith stays solid and Pickryl goes alsewhere but it will rise if Smith strays and Pickryl comes aboard Sonny Davis suffered a torn ACL in a recent game at Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and is due to undergo knee surgery this week His mother told me he still hopes to graduate early and enroll at Texas in January The surgery probably would knock him out of most or all of the contact work but should allow him to be fully recovered by the start of next season Game Quotes We played poorly We turned the ball over and could not overcome the adversity we created for ourselves I give Texas a lot of credit They have good players who are well coached I feel bad that we didnt give them a better game Colorado head coach Gary Barnett We did not want to be one dimensional We knew it wouldnt be easy to run on Colorado but we knew we had to keep at it I thought the offensive line did a good job and Cedric Benson did a great job Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis We worked all week against two tight ends and I think in this game they ran two tight ends maybe four times They did a great job of coming and doing exactly what we werent planning on But our guys did a pretty good job of improvising UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese We forced some turnovers today and when you got most of the turnovers you usually win the game UT linebacker DeAndre Lewis Sloan Thomas is probably the most underrated wide receiver in the country Longhorn QB Chris Simms talking about the backup wide receiver who has scored two touchdowns in each of the last two games We did self destruct a little bit but I dont want to take anything away from Texas They came out ready to play on both sides of the ball as well as on special teams We made a lot of mistakes today and they had us on our heels throughout the second half Colorado linebacker Joey Johnson Hes an unbelievable running back He runs hard and that move he put on to break that long gain on the shovel pass at the end of the first half was unbelievable Simms talking about Longhorn freshman running back Cedric Benson They beat us in every phase of the game I dont think it was one particular thing We had some turnovers and they put together some long drives They also did a nice job in the punt return game Buff linebacker Robbie Robinson We cant keep our defense on the field that long We let the defense down We selfdestructed and Texas took advantage of everything Colorado running back Cortlen Johnson We not only won but we dominated and Colorado is a good football team

coincidentally is where they are in both major polls this week What that mean is that Texas has a very good chance to land one of the four major BCS bowl spots if they take care of business and win their final four games to finish the regular season at Upsets have thinned the ranks of unbeaten teams in the last two weeks leaving only eight teams in major college football with perfect records They are No Miami No Oklahoma No Nebraska No UCLA No Virginia Tech No Maryland No Washington State and No Brigham Young At least two of those teams will lose in the near future because Oklahoma and Nebraska clash this week and Washington State and UCLA meet in early November The top two teams in the final BCS standings will play for the national title in the Rose Bowl on January Texas coach Mack Brown and his Longhorns hope to be in that game but their chances are somewhere between very slim and none because Oklahoma would have to lose twice in the regular season for that to happen and then the Horns would have to beat the Big North winner probably Nebraska But by winning out and finishing the Longhorns would have a great chance to play in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans in the postseason

Zach Latimer Aurora Colo Colo Mia OU Neb Mo UT UCLA That Elusive Top Is this the year the Longhorns finally will finish in that elusive top nationally for the first time since The Longhorns are in the top right now at No in the AP poll and they will stay in that elite group and even rise a little if they keep winning The biggest remaining obstacle to keeping winning is the game Saturday against Colorado The Longhorns are point favorites over the Buffaloes but Colorado at and with a fivegame winning streak is the most dangerous foe left on the schedule Next up will be road trips to Missouri ande Baylor teams which have one Big victory between them this season followed by a game in Austin against Kansas also The Longhorns will be huge favorites in all three of those game Then comes the regular season finale at Texas AM The Aggies lost to Colorado Saturday in Boulder to fall from the unbeaten ranks but the toughest part of their schedule remains to be played If the Horns keep winning until the AM game they will be favored by at least points The Aggies have a good defense but it isnt as good as the one at Texas and the Horns have a clear edge on offense So barring an upset the Longhorns should head for a bowl game at and with a national ranking in the top A win in the bowl game would cement a top ranking but a loss might knock the Horns just out of the top in the final poll Longhorn Game Notes After opening the game with a play yard scoring drive Oklahoma State had six more possessions in the first half and gained yards on plays In the second half OSU started drives at the Texas and after turnovers but came away with zero points After its opening TD drive Oklahoma State gained only yards and had for the game its lowest total of the season QB Chris Simms was involved in all six Texas touchdowns with a yard rushing TD and scoring passes of yards to Brock Edwards and yards to Roy Williams and and yards to Sloan Thomas He fell one short of the UT record of seven set by Clyde Littlefield against Daniel Baker pass rush in The last Longhorn to account for six touchdowns in a game was Ricky Williams against Rice in Freshman LB Derrick Johnson had two tackles for losses in the first half to move into a tie for third place on UTs alltime freshman list He has TFLs for the season just six short of the Longhorns record held by Tony Brackens who had in Sophomore WR Sloan Thomas had six catches for yards Saturday Both were career bests His previous highs were three catches against Missouri in and yards against Texas AM in He tied his career high with two TD passes last accomplishing the feat against Missouri UT No in Basketball Poll The Longhorn mens basketball team has been ranked No in the ESPNcom preseason top Texas is one of five Big Conference teams

<2026337.1075852131191.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2001-10-15 08:53:54,True Orange October Part Part of Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange Newsletter The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No October Simms Ties School Record with TD Passes Benson Shines in First Start as UT Rips OSU True freshman RB Cedric Benson got his first start Saturday in Stillwater and his hard running opened the airways for QB Chris Simms to toss a schoolrecordtying five touchdown passes en route to a victory over Oklahoma State The Cowboys started strong and scored on their first possession against the Longhorns manforman defense by hitting four thirdandlong passes in a row the final one for a touchdown But defensive coordinator Carl Reese switched to zone coverage as his base defense at that point and the Cowboys didnt hit another thirddown pass all day After the slow start that spotted OSU an early lead the UT offense exploded for points in the second quarter to put the game on ice Bensons early fumble set up Oklahoma States field goal that put the Horns in the point hole but his strong runs fueled the first three Texas scoring drives forcing the Cowboys to bring more defenders in close and setting up the potent UT passing game He carried times for yards and a yard average in the first half en route to a carry yard performance for the day This was a day when the run complemented the pass and the pass complemented the run and it simply gave the outmanned Cowboys too many problems to solve Simms tried only four passes in the first quarter completing two of them for a mere two yards as the Horns concentrated on establishing Benson and the ground game The strategy paid off handsomely with the Cowboys putting seven and eight defenders in the box to slow Benson and Simms responded by completing of passes for yards and five TDs in the final three quarters The TD passes tied a school record set by James Brown against Baylor in Here briefly is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred until the second half OSU took the ball and Texas got the strong mileanhour wind QB Aso Pogi led the Cowboys on a play yard touchdown drive after the kickoff He overcame four thirdandlong situations by hitting four straight passes the final one to WR Rashaun Woods for nine yards and the TD for a lead with left After the kickoff Benson fumbled on the second play and OSU recovered at the UT The Pokes tried the UT middle twice but DT Marcus Tubbs and others held strong bringing up a thirdand at the Now in a tight zone defense the Horns forced Pogi into an incompletion and Luke Phillips hit a careerbest yard FG for a lead with left The Horns went backward on a penalty and a sack after the kickoff forcing a punt from the UT But safety Nathan Vasher intercepted Pogis long pass at the UT and Benson started shredding the Cowboy defense He ran for and yards to get the Longhorns to the OSU Ivan Williams relieved him briefly and got and then to bring up a third down at the Benson got the first down on a tough yard run to the as the quarter ended Second Quarter Two more Benson runs reached the then Simms hit WR Roy Williams just short of the goal then scored on a sneak on the next play Dusty Mangums kick cut the deficit to with left The Longhorn defense forced another turnover when OSU RB Tatum Bell fumbled and UT safety Ahmad Brooks recovered at the Cowboys Benson ran for to the but a penalty and a stiffening OSU defense forced Mangum to come in and hit a yard field goal for a tie with leftLB Everick Rawls sacked Pogi and forced a quick punt and Vasher returned it yards to the Cowboys Benson got a first down with a yard run then Simms hit three straight passes the final one for yards and the touchdown to wide open TE Brock Edwards Mangums kick put the Horns ahead to stay with left After OSU failed on a fourthdown gamble at the UT Simms took the Horns on an play yard scoring drive His passes for yards to Kyle Shanahan and and yards to Sloan Thomas were the big plays He connected with Williams for the final five yards and a lead with just seconds left The Horns tried a squib kickoff and recovered it at the OSU with seconds left Simms hit Williams down the middle for the touchdown and a lead at the half Third Quarter After an exchange of punts Benson and Simms went to work again running and passing UT down to the OSU Then Simms hit Thomas again for yards and the TD Mangums fifth conversion made it with left OSU safety Chris Massey intercepted a Simms pass at the UT late in the quarter but TB Richard Schwarz fumbled on the first play and Vasher recovered Fourth Quarter With Ivan Williams relieving Benson and ripping off some good runs the Horns scored again early in the quarter on Simms fifth TD pass a yarder to Thomas Mangums kick gave Texas a lead with left Massey returned David Pinos kickoff yards for an OSU touchdown to wrap up the scoring at with left With Major Applewhite relieving Simms at QB the Longhorns drove deep into OSU territory on their next possession but declined to kick a short field goal on a fourthand and fell a yard short Number Updated Daily I update my number every day with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorns have changed their offensive philosphy to include more traps and counters and he said true freshman Cedric Benson has won the starting tailback job for the big game with Colorado Saturday We need to use more traps run more gaps and counter gaps he said adding that helps slow down blitzing linebackers and gives running backs a better chance to break for long gains The Longhorns had great balance Saturday in their victory at Oklahoma State rushing for yards and passing for yards This was an important game for us Brown said It was important for our offense in general It was important to get back on track and it was important to have good balance The Longhorns are under Brown when they outrush their opponents and when they get outrushed so it doesnt take a degree in rocket scientistry to figure out why he wants to keep running the ball well Brown also said Benson did really well in his first start He was pretty much mistake free and he got better as the game progressed We expect him to be much better this week He will understand that Colorado is much tougher on defense than Oklahoma State so it will be a much tougher test Brown said Benson who broke all the Class A rushing and scoring records in leading Midland Lee to three straight state titless has come a long way on blocking because he wasnt asked to block much in high school Stepping up and taking on a hardcharging linebacker is a hard thing to do Brown also has stressed that he wants his backs to make yardage after being hit and he said Benson did a very good job of that getting of his net rushing yards after contact He said Benson and the offensive line will have to do a really good job this week to give QB Chris Simms and his receivers a chance to succeed Weve got to stay balanced on offense he said Colorado has won five games in a row and I watched them in their opener a loss to still unbeaten Fresno State and I thought Colorado outplayed them and had some awful things happen to them He said Colorados offensive line probably will be better than anyone else we play I know Garys Colorado coach Gary Barnett teams are going to line up and be really physical I think they are back to running the football and being very physical and very sound INJURY REPORT There were no new injuries in the OSU game and DE Kalen Thornton knee and RB Victor Ike bruised ribs who missed that game remain questionable for Colorado First Issue of th Year Last weeks issue concluded my th year of publishing True Orange and this is the first issue of my th year I want to thank all of you for helping make this a successful undertaking through all those years and Im excited about the future because the Longhorn football team is on the right track again True Orange Speaking Note Many of you have been asking me why I no longer speak at your Longhorn Club meetings The answer is very simple Somebody in the UT Athletics Department has blackballed me In years past many of the Longhorn Clubs and particularly the ones in Houston and San Antonio invited me to speak to their members fairly frequently I always enjoyed doing it and I hope you enjoyed having me If enough of you feel strongly enough about it you can reverse that decision to blackball me If you dont thats okay too because the main purpose of this note is to let all of you know that I was not the one who made the decision to stop speaking at Longhorn Club meetings Recruiting Roundup The Longhorns havent added any new recruits since my last newsletter They still have commitments The college coaches have found a big fast linebacker that all the recruiting gurus including me missed He is Michael Williams of Lindale and attesting to his bluechip status are scholarship offers from Texas Oklahoma Texas AM Baylor Minnesota and West Virginia Williams has such speed and quickness that he plays wide receiver on offense And in a year when many of the top players are struggling to qualify academically he already has passed that hurdle When I talked to him last week he told me he already is getting weary of the recruiting process and probably will commit to someone in the next couple of weeks He also said he plans to attend the TexasColorado game Saturday The Longhorns have a very good chance to get him With three starting senior linebackers the Longhorns need to sign several top prospects in this recruiting class There are so many national top recruiting lists available that its hard to keep up with which players are on which list but one of the better ones is the Rivals list on the internet The Longhorns already have commitments from three players on that list No WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign Ill No DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel and No OL Neale Tweedie of Allen Texas also has really good shots at seven other players on the Rivals They are No DT Roderique Wright of Alief Hastings No QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison No OL Justin Blalock of Plano East No WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus No DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster No LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and No DT Marco Martin of Mesquite The Horns also are being mentioned favorably by seven other players on the list including No RB Lorenzo Booker of Ventura Cal St Bonaventure No DE Bryan Pickryl of Jenks Okla No DE Zack Latimer of Aurora Colo No DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands No TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee No Ath Edorian McCullough of North Garland and No RB Selvin Young of Jersey Village and could wind up with one of two of them Young lists Texas and Miami as his top two schools right now but he is pretty wide open If he isnt the top QB prospect in the country hes very close to the top He has led Madison to a season so far and in a big district showdown with powerful Houston Lamar Friday night he had carries for yards including touchdown runs of and yards and he completed of passes including an yard touchdown toss to lead Madison to a victory For the season he has completed of passes for yards and touchdowns with just interceptions and he has rushed times for yards and more TDs Thats a average per carry by the way He is a quarterback who could run Rices option or Texas passing attack If you could build the perfect QB put another pounds on his pound frame without hurting his sub speed and you would have a perfect Put him at a good training table and the pounds of added muscle wont be a problem Hes one of the real jewels in this recruiting class and the Horns have as good a shot as anybody and a better shot than most

Mack Brown put the Longhorns through a different kind of twoaday workouts this year and he and the players both think it is the way to go in the future With the wave of footballrelated deaths hitting the pros the colleges and the high schools he decided to only have one workout on days when the team worked during the hottest time of the day A typical week of practice included am and pm workouts on Monday Wednesday and Friday and pm workouts on Tuesday Thursday and Saturday Brown said it kept the players fresher and safer and he also said they will be better prepared to start the season They handled the heat really well and worked hard in every practice he said Weve had some problems early in the season since Ive been here and I think this kind of schedule gives us a better chance to be stronger at the start of the season Brown had three gametype scrimmages during the preseason work The final one went about minutes last Wednesday night before about fans and the firstteam offense and firstteam defense were dominant The ones were dominant Brown said and thats the way you want it We ran the ball well and threw it and caught it well and we played good defense for the most part The firstteam defense had five QB sacks with LBs Tyrone Jones and Everick Rawls DEs Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding and DT Maurice Gordon getting one each Gordon got most of the firstteam snaps at DT opposite Marcus Tubbs Brown said Tubbs has won a starting job but the other DT spot is still up for grabs Freshman Stevie Lee also looked good working with the second team at DT and going against the firstteam line He appears to be recovered from offseason foot surgery He is a run stopped deluxe who is getting better at rushing the passer Freshman RB Cedric Benson running primarily with the second team had his best scrimmage He gained yards on carries His was very impressive on a fourplay yard drive with the second team against a mixture of firstandsecondteam defenders He carried the ball four straight times getting and then to set up a first down at the then bolting yards on a draw play breaking several tackles along the way He scored easily on the next play from the Benson seems to have better vision and be quicker through holes than the other Longhorn backs It also takes great penetration by the defense to keep the heralded freshman from making positive yardage The Longhorns worked primarily on the running game in the final scrimmage Brown has said several times that UT must run the ball better in big games and he said after the scrimmage he is encouraged by the way the backs are running and the linement are blocking He was asked after the scrimmage why TE Bo Scaife has not been involved more in the passing game We know Bo can catch and make things happen after he catches it Brown said Weve been working Bo more on runs because he needs to work on his blocking Thats the area where he needs to improve Brown also said at least three freshmen will play in the opener Sept against New Mexico State Benson outside linebacker Derrick Johnson and walkon kicker Dusty Mangum Asked why they are assured of playing Brown laughed and said Cedric is really really productive Derrick is and he runs really fast Dusty has been doing a good job in an area that was a problem for us in the spring He also said Mangum will be the placekicker and also might kick off Baseball Prospects Promising The Longhorn baseball team begins fall workouts in September with most of its top performers returning plus a great group of new players Iowa State dropped baseball after last season and the Longhorns got the Cyclones ace pitcher Alan Bomar a hardthrowing righthander who was one of the top hurlers in the Big last year They also signed two other pitchers who will compete for starting jobs They are Brad Halsey a lefthander from Hill County JC who throws in the lows s and Jesin Merrle a righthander from Navarro JC with a fine assortment of pitches Five pitchers who saw a lot of action last year also return They are Ray Clark Ryan France Justin Simmons Eugene Espineli and Bradley Jordan Ryan Hubele returns at catcher and Jeff Ontiveros will be at first base Both hit with power Speedy Timmy Moss is back at second base and prize freshman Michael Holliman of Dallas Jesuit who turned down a pro offer of more than million to come to Texas probably will be at shortstop Omar Quintinilla who suffered severe facial injuries in a collision with a teammate last season was having a great year at bat when the seasonending injury occurred He played shortstop last year as a freshman but will move to third base and will add some pop to the batting lineup Another top middle infielder is Brandon Fahey of Duncanville and Grayson County JC He is an outstanding hitter who could be the designated hitter if he doesnt win a starting job Starting outfielders Ben King Kaloni Napolean and Matt Rosenberg all return along with Eric Sultemeir who played a lot as a freshman last season The Horns also added a top centerfielder in Joe Ferin of Westark JC He was AllBig as a freshman at Iowa State in before transferring to Westark for the season He has outstanding speed and is a fine hitter The Longhorns made it to the regional finals last year With Quintinilla returning healthy and the other returning starters plus the influx of new talent this team has the potential to be much better Soccer Team Starts Strong The Texas womens soccer team completed a wing of Europe last week with a victory over Saestrum the Dutch League Champion in Zeist Utrecht NL The UT team ranked No nationally had three shutouts in the seven matches and outscored their opponents by a margin Leading the Longhornsoffensively in Europe were freshmen Kelly Wilson of Odessa Permian and Kristen Teter of Kingwood who finished the trip ranked first and second on the club respectively in points scored with and Wilson led the Horns with five goals and she and Teter tied for the team lead in assists with four Teter and sophomore Kylee Wosnuk of Folsom California tied for second on the squad with four goals each during UTs European trip Up next head coach Chris Petrucelli and theLonghorns

Faithful Volume No August Longhorns Favored by in Season Opener But New Mexico State Will Test Run Defense Coach Mack Brown and the Longhorn players hope they are back among the nations elite teams but they wont find out Saturday night when they entertain the point underdog New Mexico State Aggies The pm game will be televised nationally by Fox and the sellout crowd and all those television viewers should see a Longhorn romp and they also will find out those new defensive tackles are shaping up Texas led the Big Conference in rushing defense last year allowing only yards a game and yards a carry New Mexico State won only three games last year and the Aggies started this season on a losing note falling to Louisville But they outgained the Cardinals and lost primarily because they fumbled twice deep in Louisville territory and both fumbles were returned for Cardinal touchdeowns RB Kenton Keith who rushed for yards last season had carries for yards and led the Aggies to a halftime lead before the two long fumble returns turned the game around in the second half The Aggies were No in the country in rushing last year and the year before with their poweroption attack and they will give those new Longhorn defense tackles an early test QB K C Enzminger also can run He picked up yards rushing last season while passing for more yards and touchdowns The New Mexico State defense gives up lots of yards and lots of points when it is on the field but the Aggie offense when it gets rolling like it did in the first half at Louisville can control the ball for long periods in the game Sophomore Marcus Tubbs and the other young defensive tackles will bear a major responsibility in handling the Aggie inside option They have looked good in practice but facing an option attack is such a rarity these days that its difficult to practice for it Most of the top teams the Longhorns will play this year are passfirst runsecond teams In fact some of them are passfirst passsecond and passthird team who hardly ever run Thats what makes this game so interesting even if it should be a blowout because the one thing New Mexico State does well is run the football But thats enough on the opponents Lets look at the Longhorns their No national ranking and their chances of keeping it No one in college football will have a receiving corps to match the Longhorns particularly when the wide receivers and tight ends are lumped together The top three wide receivers and top two tight ends all sophomores by the way are outstanding Few teams in college football have a defensive secondary to equal UTs and there probably isnt a better passblocking offensive line in the Big The defensive line lost outstanding tackles Casey Hampton an AllAmerican and Shaun Rogers but it should again be very good with DEs Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton leading the way Redding a junior and Thornton a sophomore both started and played very well as true freshmen Both are bigger and stronger this season and look ready to have outstanding seasons Tubbs played a lot last year as a redshirt freshman because Rogers had a badly sprained ankle that limited his play for much of the year He played well then and has looked like a budding star in twoadays The coaches say they are worried about the other defensive tackle position but good coaches always say they are worried unless their names are Steve Spurrier or Bob Stoops But redshirt freshman Stevie Lee has been looking very good against the run in recent practices and senior Maurice Gordon is an outstanding pass rusher who also plays the run pretty well Sophomore Adam Doiron who is a good run stopper also figures to see a lot of playing time The offensive line has been working harder this spring on run blocking because head coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns have to be able to run the ball when we want to run it He says a dependable running game makes it harder to stop the Horns lethal passing weapons helps in running the clock when protecting a lead and last but not least helps the defense by giving it more time to rest One constant in the Longhorns three losses last season was the incredible number of threeandout possessions by the offense Against Oklahoma for example Texas had one first down when the Sooners scored their sixth touchdown Even in the big victory over AM the Longhorns had just one first down in the entire first half and the stout UT defense obviously tired in the third quarter but it didnt matter because Texas scored four touchdowns in the period to blow the game open That shouldnt happen this season The line has worked harder on run blocking and the four returning line starters finally have enough experience to function better as a unit It also shouldnt happen because the running back corps looks so much stronger than it was last year when it started and ended with Hodges Mitchell Junior Victor Ike one of the fastest backs around is bigger and stronger and determined to hold the starting job But pound sophomore Ivan Williams always a terror in the spring and a bust in the fall must be smelling spring flowers because he has been a terror throughout twoaday workouts And then there is true freshman Cedric Benson I know now how Florida fans must have felt when they first set eyes on Emmitt Smith This young man is something special Hes lightningquick to the line and he has such great vision that he always seems to find the soft spot He also is hard to bring down In other words he has a lot of the same assets that made guys like Ricky Williams Earl Campbell and Roosevelt Leaks such great Longhorn backs Williams and Campbell both won the Heisman Trophy and Leaks would have if he hadnt suffered a devastating knee injury after finishing third in the Heisman voting as a junior Ike will start Saturday night but look for Williams and Benson to get a lot of carries too The coaches say QB Chris Simms FB Matt Trissel and the linebackers are all much improved over last season Lets hope they are right That doesnt leave much except kicking and special teams and those could be problems this season Junior college transfer Brian Bradford has won the punting job and he always gets great height and usually gets great length Id rather have the height because linedrive punts often lead to long returns As long as he doesnt get any blocked the Horns should be fine in the punting game Freshman walkon Dusty Mangum of Mesquite has won the placekicking job and he has been very accurate in practice up to yards But if you watched Oklahoma Saturday the Sooners didnt look as potent on offense as last year but they had a killer kicking game to go along with a killer defense The Horns should have a good punting game and they probably will have pretty good success in kicking field goals and kicking off But they had better dominate in other areas when they play teams that have kicking games like Oklahoma or they will be in trouble Bobby Bowden has won two national titles at Florida State and he would have won twice that many if he had a kicker like Phil Dawson or Kris Stockton Remember wide right and those chipshot misses that cost him two perfect seasons Mangum could be a good kicker Hes a remarkable find for a walkon but making kicks like Dawson and Stockton made is a lot to ask from any walkon Brown plans to announce his starting lineups later today but there is little suspense with starters returning and replacements already in place at most of the other spots When you carry a No national ranking into the season you obviously have a lot going for you That is the case with the Longhorns but they have some areas where improvement is mandatory if they want to keep that lofty spot and possibly improve upon it Junior QB Chris Simms led the Big in passing efficiency last year but he also had a problem with interceptions The Longhorns couldnt run the ball when they had to in the big games they lost last year What are the chances for improvements in those two areas Simms has looked better during the preseason at throwing the ball away instead of forcing it into a crowd If he can improve his touchdownstointerceptions ratio to to or even to this should be a great season The increased emphasis on the running game and the bigger backs and the quick way Benson has adapted to the college game will improve the team in that area The key here will be for the line to open more holes Defensively the loss of the two tackles is the big problem and Tubbs and the other three players mentioned earlier should be able to fill those holes Against passing teams they probably will be better than last years tackles because Rogers was never completely healthy after the ankle sprain in the Houston game and and Hampton was more of a run stopper than a pass rusher So if Simms can be more consistent in big games if the offensive line can block better for the run and if the kicking game holds up this Longhorn team has a chance to be in the Rose Bowl playing for the national title in January But breakdowns in any of those areas could again break Longhorn hearts and dreams If you want to know how I think it will all come out Im going to chicken out I think the Longhorns are going to be a top team for sure and I think they have a chance to make it to the Rose Bowl But so do several other teams including three or four others in the Big Texas will have to go and beat Oklahoma to win the Big South then topple Nebraska or Kansas State or whoever emerges in the North to make it to Pasadena There are lots of other teams out there who also have legitimate shots at the Rose Bowl including Oklahoma Nebraska Kansas State Florida Miami and Oregon the Longhorns conqueror in the Holiday Bowl Oklahoma was rated No at this time last year and the Sooners won the national title going in the process and beating Kansas State twice A similar scenario could play out this year The Longhorns have to take care of business better than they have in a long time to make it to Pasadena But two teams will get there and one of them could be the Longhorns Thats what makes this season so interesting for all orangeblooded football fans The game this week wont answer many questions but it will show us with of the problem areas has improved and which of them are still problems All teams have some problems The ones with the fewest usually wind up playing for all the marbles Lets hope the Longhorns are problem solvers deluxe this season Important Notice Next weeks newsletter will be emailed on Tuesday because Monday is Labor Day and is a postal holiday

recruits again Saturday after a layoff of more than three months and that usually means good things will start to happen again for the Longhorns Coach Mack Brown and his staff have revolutionized recruiting in Texas with the their early commitment blitz and it worked again this year with an even dozen early pleges by August including six who have been mentioned on one or more national top lists There havent been any new ones since DT Tully Janszen of Keller picked Texas over Oklahoma and Texas AM back on August Under NCAA rules college coaches get to call each recruit one time in May then they get to start calling them once a week on September which is this Saturday Those weekly calls probably will produce at least one or two more commitments in September WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign Ill had planned to come to New Mexico State season opener and he had said there was a good chance he would commit on his visit He still strongly favors the Longhorns but wants to take his official visit before committing One important thing to note here is that outofstate kids can take official visits during the football season Texas kids cannot take official visits because the University Interscholastic League the governing body for high school sports in Texas has ruled that any player who takes an expensepaid trip prior to the conclusion of football season loses his eligibility for that season That means the only kids making official visits to Texas and other instate schools in September October or early November will be from other states The Longhorns will have a lot of fine high school prospects as their guests at the New Mexico State game but they will be in Austin unofficially which means UT can give them a ticket and they have to pay for everything else including their transportation food and lodging Here are the Longhorns early commitments Quarterbacks Billy Don Malone Paris North Lamar Tight Ends David Thomas Wolfforth Frenship Wide Receivers Dustin Miksch Round Rock Westwood Offensive Linemen Brett Valdez Brownwood Neale Tweedie Allen Defensive Linemen Sonny Davis Austin Lanier and Gulf Coast Miss JC Earl Anderson San Marcos Lyle Sendlein Scottsdale Chaparral Tully Jantzen Keller Linebackers Brian Robison Splendora Marcus Myers Pflugerville Connally Athletes Clint Haney Smithson Valley The Longhorns probably wont get another quarterback Vincent Young the great prospect at Houston Madison says he is going to go out of state The only running back still on the UT radar screen is Albert Hardy of Galena Park the states top back At tight end Texas is still trying to get Eric Winston of Midland Lee but he comes from Aggie stock and is a long shot The Longhorns hope to get two more wide receivers headed by Marquis Johnson and then probably Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus is the states most talented wideout but he is serving a threeweek suspension to start the season and he played only two games last year because of eligibility problems arising from switching schools A wild card here is DaBryan Blanton the small but lightning fast running back from Forney He could be a wide receiver in college Texas is recruiting him Texas is still recruiting two offensive line prospects and probably will try to sign both Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield The defensive line crop is loaded this year and Texas is trying to sign DEs Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel Bryan Pickryl of Jenks Okla Travis Leitko of The Woodlands Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Dontriel Coates of Anahuac The Horns wont get all of them of course but they hope to get several of them The North Carolina game on Sept has been dedicated to the memory of Cole Pittman Chase Pittmans brother who was killed in a tragic automobile accident while returning to UT in February He was a promising sophomore DT The situation at DT is much like the one at DE Roderique Wright of Alief Hastings Marco Martin of Mesquite Joseph Edwards of Dayton Tuaren Brown of Katy Cinco Ranch Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo and Loren Howard of Scottsdale Ariz are all being recruited and hopefully at least two or three of them will sign with Texas At linebacker outstanding middle backer Aaron Harris of Mesquite and speedy outside backers Garnett Smith of Arlington Lamar and Glenn Jackson of Carrollton Turner are the main hopes Texas probably will try to sign one or two defensive backs and the top one who is considering the Horns is Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln Speedy Edorian McCullough of North Garland would be a fine cornerback but he wants to be a running back He likes Oklahoma and Texas RECRUITING NOTES LeKeldrick Bridges of Dallas Hillcrest one of the states top athletes has given up football to concentrate on basketball so he will be disappearing from all the football prospect lists including mine The strength of the this years recruiting class statewide is in the defensive line There are more outstanding defensive linemen in the state than in any other year since Ive been doing this Injury Update Senior starting LB Lee Jackson has a turf toe and probably will miss the opener with Tyrone Jones replacing him Jackson is expected back for the second game but toe injuries sometimes are tough to shake off Junior DE O J McClintock is out indefinitely after suffering severe hand and arm cuts in a household accident The coaches hope hell be back by midseason Junior WR Kyle Shanahan a walkon who is one of the Longhorns top four receivers is still recovering from a puncture wound in his leg He tried to jump a fence and didnt make it He will miss the opener but might be back for the second game Subscribe To The EMailFax To Get YearRound

<10363917.1075852131404.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2001-09-04 09:16:19,True Orange September Part Part of Parts Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The newsletter and emailfax service for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No September Longhorns Zap Aggies New Mexico Brand Freshmen Show Up Raring and Ready to Play The Longhorns opened the season Saturday night before a sellout crowd in Austin with an easy victory over New Mexico State that gave positive answers to most team question marks Two super freshmen and a freshman walkon kicker even gave some hope for those tough games down the line The kicker Dusty Mangum of Mesquite kicked two field goals and and five extra points flawlessly That might not sound like a big deal particularly since the field goals were short ones But if you had watched the place kickers in the spring you would be ecstatic that young Mangum seemed to be close to dead center on all seven of his first collegiate kicks The other two freshmen are much more heralded and rightly so judging by what they did Saturday night LB Derrick Johnson came in a a backup but he had six tackles and caught caught slippery RB Walter Taylor for a threeyard loss on a screeen pass that appeared to be well executed until he sped past the blockers and nailed Taylor Taylor hit the Longhorns for yards rushing on just carries with his stopandgo style and he had only two plays that lost yardage all night That was one of them While Johnson is a heralded recruit fellow freshman RB Cedric Benson is even more highly touted after leading Midland Lee to three straight state titles and he gave a glimpse of his tremendous talent in a mopup role Saturday He didnt get into the game until the fourth quarter and then he did most of his running behind the secondteam defensive line But with all due respect to Victor Ike and Ivan Williams the top two tailbacks Benson showed talents that most running backs can only dream about For starters he has acceleration that is off the chart when he takes a handoff He also has great vision and knows instinctively where to run He also has an ability to make most tacklers miss without appearing to do anything to make them miss That means he doesnt have to slow down to do it He and Williams tied for top rushing honors with indentical stats carries for yards and a touchdown Coach Mack Brown pointed out that it was easier sledding for Benson than for Ike and Williams because he entered the game in the fourth quarter after the Aggie defenders were tired But Ike and Williams did all their running behind the firstteam line The offensive line is not a great runblocking unit so it figures that the backups are even less adept at run blocking My nominees for the biggest positive surprises on offense and defense are easy ones WR Montrell Flowers and LB Tyrone Jones are seniors who have had solid but not spectacular careers Flowers caught two touchdown passes Saturday night and Jones had six tackles including two for losses Here briefly is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred so New Mexico State took the ball That turned out to be a great decision for the Horns because New Mexico State fumbled the opening kickoff and the Longhorns had a lead before either team ran a play on the Texas end of the field Tony Jeffery and Rod Babers blocked a punt and Phillip Geiggar covered it in the end zone for the first Texas touchdown and Mangum kicked his first extra point in college to give Texas a lead with left The Horns drove yards on their second possession to take a lead when Williams scored on a yard run and Mangum kicked the extra point with left in the period Neither team had much offense in the quarter Texas had yards on plays and NM State had on plays but two Aggie fumbles the only turnovers in the game gave the Longhorns the two touchdown lead Second Quarter Nathan Vashers yard punt return to the Aggies set up a field goal drive Ike got yards on two strong runs but then the drive stalled and Mangum kicked his first college field goal a yarder to give Texas a lead with left The Horns scored another TD on their next possession going yards in plays Flowers had a yard catch and then a yarder for the TD Mangum kicked the point for a lead with seconds left in the half Texas had offensive yards in the quarter while the Longhorn defense was holding NM State to net yards Third Quarter Both teams got their offenses cranked up to start the third quarter Texas had a yard drive to set up a yard Mangum field goal to start the half but then Aggie TB Taylors yard run took the visitors deep into Longhorn territory for the first time in the game The drive reached the UT before stalling and the field goal try was wide After a Texas punt NM State drove yards in plays to score and cut the UT lead to with left Fourth Quarter Benson came in to start the fourth quarter and carried seven straight times for yards Simms hit Flowers for yards and the touchdown to cap the drive Mangums kick gave UT a lead with left The defense got a quick stop and Major Applewhite relieved Simms at QB With Applewhite hitting four of five passes for yards including a yard completion to Benson the Horns moved to the three and Benson ran over right tackle for his first collegiate touchdown Mangums kick gave UT a lead with seconds left Recruiting

blitz Ive seen them play on television he said but being there and seeing it in person was a great experience I love the way the bring linebackers on nearly every play and the way the disquise who they are going to bring Thats the kind of defense Im looking for Number Updated Daily I update my number every day with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call Coachs Corner Coach Mack Brown worries about openers so he was particularly happy about the Longhorns romp past New Mexico State Saturday night We had two areas we really wanted to concentrate on he said Defensively we wanted to hit people and force turnovers Offensively we wanted to be physical He said the team graded high in both areas We forced three turnovers on defense he said and we hit people and flew around and made plays most of the time We had some lapses and we need to work on correcting that He said he was pleased that the offense did not turn the ball over and was able to overpower New Mexico States defenders and run the ball despite a stacked defense Except for six plays I though the offense played really really well he said Those six plays included three to start the game when a fumbled kickoff set Texas up at the Aggies and the Horns lost yards in three plays and had to punt The other three were on the Longhorns drive to open the second half They got a firstandgoal at the and wound up kicking a field goal Brown said the Longhorns gave up on the run in the first two games last year because of stacked defenses and then we couldnt run it when we needed to at Stanford and we got beat I told the staff before this game that I didnt care if they had on the line of scrimmage we were going to run the ball he said We only ran three plays Brown said but we ran them a whole bunch We just wanted to line up and be physical The Longhorns ran times for net yards and passed times for yards and Brown said that is the kind of production he wanted He said there were some plays where the quarterback normally would have audibled and called a pass but we wanted to force the run and thats Coachs Corner continued from page what we did We have to be able to run the ball when we want to regardless of the defensive alignment Brown said DT Maurice Gordon played an outstanding game in his first start after moving from a backup DE spot Maurice is an outstanding pass rusher he said We already knew that but he also stood up well against the run He runs a and hes a defensive end playing defensive tackle His speed really helps us in there After the game Saturday night Brown said he felt it was the Longhorns best opening game in his four years at Texas Monday he said After reviewing the film this definitely was our best opener at Texas I was concerned about the kicking game and turnovers You always worry about that in openers and our kicking game was really good and we didnt turn the ball over Brown said WR Kyle Shanahan has been cleared to practice this week but he said LB Lee Jacksons turf toe is still bothering him Ross Leaves Plans to Return Freshman CB Aaron Ross has left the team to clear up some NCAA Clearinghouse issues I have some Clearinghouse issues I need to get resolved in order to rejoin the team Ross said Im going to get those issues worked out so I can return to Texas in January LB Aurmon Satchell had similar issues last year and he is back on the team now and is a secondteam linebacker Look for Ross to be able to clear up the problems and come back in time to go through spring practice next season

They have the great lateral movement and we tried to run at them and they did a good job there as well We had bad field position all night but their defense had something to do with that They do a great job with the special teams They did a good job getting down the field and making the play New Mexico State head coach Tony Samuel We started off slow but they had played a game and we hadnt It took a while for us to get going and we have a lot of things to work on I was pleased with the way we ran the ball in the second half They threw some blitzes at us that they hadnt used before so we made a conscious decision to go with more threestep drops instead of the normal step drops If they are coming after us we know they have to play man for man We also decided to force the run even if they had nine in the box We want to be able to run it when we want to regardless of the defensive lineup UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis We came out and played hard and really got with it in the first half We made some mistakes in the third quarter but those are things we can go back and coach next week We thought we would see more option but we ran them down early and they got away from it Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese They played hard and threw a lot of different things against us I talked to Montrell Flowers after that second touchdown and he goes Man I got two touchdown passes tonight and I only got two all of last year He did a great job for us tonight UT QB Chris Simms Im happy on my overall performance tonight but I am even more happy that the team has gotten the season off to a good start with a win The passes were perfect all night They just came right to me I have to give all of the credit to Chris Simms He was on target the whole time which made my job easier All I had to do is catch it and run Longhorn senior WR Montrell Flowers Oh it felt good It was fun I enjoyed it With the guys we have up front its fun to run the ball It was great scoring my first college touchdown It probably wont hit me until I get out of this room I had so much excitement and energy running through me tonight I really enjoyed this game I loved carrying the ball the

front four headed by Julius Peppers a pound end who Brown said might be the nations top defensive player Ironically he recruited Peppers for the Tar Heels before leaving for Texas Joey Evans is the other defensive end and he also is being eyed by NFL scouts But so far this season the Tar Heel defense hasnt had a chance because the offense has committed eight turnovers in the two losses TB Willie

touchdowns and two interceptions He has a QB efficiency rating of I expect Durant a pounder with good speed and a strong arm to be the quarterback at Texas unless Curry gets off to a really quick

Volume No May Brown Says Longhorns Should Be Very Good Offensively with Chance for Stout Defense Too Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns will head into the football season with just one problem on offense and fewer than expected on defense if his young tackles come through In an interview with coach Brown last week I asked him how the Longhorns compare with his best teams at North Carolina In a nutshell he said Texas is better offensively than those North Carolina teams but is not quite as imposing defensively His last two teams at North Carolina lost only to Florida State posting the best twoyear record ever for the Tar Heels and finishing in the top twice something Texas hasnt accomplished once in nearly two decades Our offensive line is better here he said We have two quarterbacks who can play We had that at North Carolina too but our upside is better here Our receivers at North Carolina were very good but the ones we have now can be the best weve had He said North Carolinas fullback and tight end from his last team there are still playing in the NFL but he also noted that UT TEs Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards who are only sophomores in eligibility have NFL potential too He said one big plus offensively at UT is the depth the incoming freshmen will provide in the line We had good offensive linemen at North Carolina but we had trouble finding good ones in numbers he said We didnt have good numbers here and had to force some guys to play too early he said but that got them ready to play and now we have good experience and good numbers and we hope we can start redshirting our freshmen offensive linemen We need to get to that point Hesaid the only problem he sees offensively this season is at tailback and that isnt as big a problem as it seems because all five of the returnees competing for the job are competent players and several of them have the ability to step it up And if they dont step it up there is a young fellow coming to twoadays in August who has everyone excited Ive written enough about Cedric Benson that I wont go through it all again but he is something special If you doubt it just remember this Three state championship games in Class A at Midland Lee with five touchdowns in each game No one else has ever come close to doing that once in Class A much less three times Defensively Brown has high expectations and thats only natural because of the starters and of the backups on his North Carolina team were NFL draft picks Three of his defensive linemen went in the first round But he says the Longhorns have some talent on defense and could be very good if his young tackles come through The departures of twotime AllAmerican Casey Hampton and his equally formidable sidekick Shaun Rogers left a giant hole in the middle of the Longhorn defense They were the runstoppers deluxe who led a unit that ranked th nationally in rushing defense yielding yards a game last year Eight starters return from a Longhorn defense that also ranked seventh in the nation in total defense yielding only yards per game Brown also said Rogers who missed several games with a badly sprained ankle was never close to last year after being injured early in the season Shaun was one of the best players of his size I have seen at rushing the passer he said When we lost him it really hurt our pass rush I have speculated in previous issues that the Longhorns probably will have a better pass rush from their front four this season because sophomoretobe Marcus Tubbs got sacks second on the team last year while standing in for Rogers and because the defensive ends are a year older and there is more speed at tackle than before Brown said the coaches are counting on a better pass rush from their linemen Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton have the potential to be as good as anybody at defense end he said We have high expectations for them At tackle he said Tubbs weighs and he can run Hes got a great upside Hes a young guy who has played well already and should just get better and better Were excited about him Brown also said the move of Maurice Gordon from end to tackle looks like a good one He runs a and he looked really good this spring We just need him to keep on working hard and hell be a good one Hes already a good pass rusher and hes working on getting stronger to stop the run While Gordon is a passrushing whiz the likely starter at tackle opposite Tubbs is redshirt freshman Stevie Lee if he is able to recover fully from foot surgery Lee played well last year in spots as a true freshman but was injured early and was able to get a medical redshirt year which means he is a freshman again this year If Lee is healthy Brown said the key for him is offseason conditioning work Stevie can play at about pounds but he doesnt need to play at he said In this league everybody spreads people out forcing the front four to make offschedule plays You cant just be a run stopper anymore Youve got to be quick enough to make adjustments Were emphasizing speed and quickness he added Thats why we made some moves in the spring like moving Maurice Gordon to tackle O J McClintock to end from linebacker and Lee Jackson to linebacker from safety Brown also said sophomore Adam Doiron who also played well in relief last season as a true freshman has a bright future at tackle He needs to get get stronger Brown said Hes real smart and real tough He just needs to get more experience and use the offseason program to get stronger He likes his secondary saying I feel like we are in real good shape with our secondary We have guys who have the ability to cover and the speed to make up ground We also are two deep in the secondary for the first time since weve been here The area where he wants to see the most improvement on defense is a linebacker where all three starters return We have asked our linebackers to step it up he said They have played really well for us but we want them to just take an extra step to get even better The Longhorns had troubles with their place kicking in the spring and Brown said the returnees and three walkons will compete for the starting job when twoadays begin in early August Summing up he said the Longhorns strengths are at quarterback wide receiver tight end the offensive line the defensive ends and the secondary He said defensive tackle will be a strong position too if Lee returns healthy and all the young players continue to improve When asked to comment on the most pleasant surprises from spring training Brown said Bo Scaife returning and looking like he is ready to play is one Kyle Shanahan a walkon wide receiver did some really good things Derrick Dockery finally being healthy again was a big positive development He said all of the spindown moves the coaches made on defense this spring are looking good at this point We wanted to improve our speed on defense and these moves have helped us accomplish that Asked about the biggest disappointment in the spring drills he said It was nobody emerging at tailback They all played good but after Ricky Williams and Hodges Mitchell our expectations are very high True Orange Observations Look for the Longhorns to use more oneback formations this season Why The backup wide receivers and tight ends are more dangerous than the fullbacks WR Sloan Thomas and TE Brock Edwards would start and star for many teams but they are backups at Texas Also look for a lot more misdirection plays and other plays designed to make the offense less predictable than it was last season With coach Mack Browns first great class of recruits heading into their third seasons and two other great classes following it this is the season the Longhorns should be able to finish in the top for the first time since For those of you who seem to get a little impatient at times it is worth noting that the Longhorns have finished in the top just seven times since and three of those seven times were in Browns first three years here th in st in and th in This Longhorn team probably will start out about fifth or sixth in the country and it should be able to stay in the top unless some wheels fall off The great thing about the way Brown has built this program is that he and his assistants recruit great prospects every year and develop them I think this year will start a long string of years for UT to be contending for high national honors The only way you can win the highest national honor a national championship is to get to the championship game Since only two teams get to the championship game some very deserving teams are left out Miami and Washington for example were certainly deserving last year but unbeaten Oklahoma and oncebeaten Florida State got the nod So having an outstanding team doesnt guarantee a berth in the national title game I wont predict the Longhorns will wind up in the Rose Bowl playing for the national title this year but I will predict that Brown will have us playing in a national championship game very soon Teams in the Big and SEC have the extra burden of having to play a postseason game for their conference titles which means they have to play two godzillas back to back to be No But great teams can do it and Texas will be a great team in the very near future It might not be this year but it could be if things break the Longhorns way Number Updated Frequently I

April True Orange Crystal Ball Shows Season Will Be Longhorns BreakThrough Year My crystal ball was a little faulty last year because it didnt show TE Bo Scaife going down for the season in the first preseason practice Without that important piece of data I predicted the Longhorns would win a t least regular season games They won nine without Scaife and I think they would have won with him because the Stanford loss came before the great freshmen wide receivers became the goto guys on the team Im more confident this year because the Longhorns are deeper and even more talented than they were last season so Im going to go way out on a limb a nd predict the season will be remembered as the one we all will recall as the Horns breakthrough year By that I mean I think they will break into the top and stay there for years and years Since the Longhorns havent finished in the top since that sounds like a tall order for this team This will be coach Mack Browns fourth team at Texas and it should be his best one by far His fourth recruiting class will enroll in September and it will be his third straight great one that means the first group of great recruits will be starting their third years They will be juniors or redshirt sophomores The third year normally is one when players who have been able to play at a high level at times learn how to play at a high level consistently This team will have some flaws but every team has flaws The great teams simply have enough great players to win in spite of their flaws The Longhorns have offensive weapons that are almost off the chart With a healthy Scaife who is that rarity at TE a swift surehanded guy who can turn a sixyard pass into an yard score to go along with sophomorestobe Roy Williams and B J Johnson who broke every Longhorn freshman receiving record last year When a team has an awesome tight end and Scaife is one of those with sophomore Brock Edwards not too far behind it creates matchup problems fo r any defense Linebackers normally cover tight ends and good tight ends even one who arent really fast usually win those matchups Fast tight ends who can cat ch in a crowd usually draw coverage from a safety But then Williams and Johnson create problems because Williams almost alway s draws double coverage and Johnson is a huge threat to go all the way if one safety is worrying about Scaife and the other one is helping out on William s QB Chris Simms seems to be developing into the great player he was expected to be after all the recruiting services tabbed him as the No prospect in the country when he was a senior in high school The obvious solution for a defensive coordinator would be to play five or s ix defensive backs most of the time or to go to a zone defense But Brown says the Horns will be a better running team than they have been since Ricky Williams departed and a more experienced line and a bigger tailback should make that happen Hodges Mitchell was a great little tailback but this offense is designed primarily to pass or run between the tackles When you want to run between the tackles it helps to have a big powerful tailback The tailback this season whether it is one of the returnees or heralded recruit Cedric Benson will be bigger and more powerful than Mitchell The line was a good passblocking unit last year and with four of the five guys back it should be much better this year The only big question about the offense will be one of consistency When Simms who shared time with Major Applewhite last season was at the helm the team often had long long dry spells In the victory over Texas AM for example what most people remember is the Longhorns fourtouchdown explosion in the third quarter But I remember being scared silly at the half because the offense had made only one first down in the entire half and the defense was showing signs of tiring because of all those andouts And that was not an unusual happening In the bowl loss to Oregon Simms to ok the Longhorns on long backtoback scoring drives in the second quarter bu t the Horns generated little offense in the first and third quarters I could cite other examples because there are plenty to cite but Simms is a year older and wiser and so are the receivers who performed better last season than any of us have a right to expect true freshmen to perform A bigger stronger tailback also will be able to pick up more of those thirdandshort downs than the team did last year Defensively eight starters return from an outstanding unit The Longhorns lost two great defensive tackles but the power teams in the Southern Division of the Big rely a lot more on the pass than they do on the run and the tackles UT will play this year are quicker and might suppl y a better pass rush Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also made several position changes in the spring that are certain to generate a better pass rush If you remember the Oregon game the Ducks used quick undersized linemen t o harass Simms and it worked remarkably well most of the time With former DE Maurice Gordon now a super quick DT and former OLB O J McClintock now a super quick DE look for the Longhorns to be a much better pass rushing team in I do worry a lot about the Horns placekicking but the coaches are bringi ng in several walkons and hopefully one of them can kick off into the end zone and make most of the yard field goals Even if the kicking problems arent solved this is a team with enough weapons offensively and defensively to be a top team No one in the college ranks will be better or deeper at the receiving positions particularly when the tight ends are added to the mix and few teams will have better defensive secondaries The offensive line will be one of the best passblocking lines in the Big and the defensive line despite having two new tackles also will be one of the leagues best Heres the way I see the Big South race winding up and briefly why I place each team at its particular spot Texas Too many big play guys for the other teams to stop Oklahoma Defending national champs could do it again if they can find another great QB Texas Tech Big passing game too tough for everyone in South but Texas and Oklahoma Texas AM Even R C Slocum says the Ags will not dazzle anyone with talent Oklahoma State Team has too many holes and too tough a schedule to do any better Baylor Bears still find Big a tough row to hoe with little offense and overworked defense Nebraska should win the North mainly because the Huskers host the big game with Kansas State The Southern Division teams have beaten the North three times in the five championship games and I think Texas or Oklahoma will make it four this yea r The South is a lot stronger than the folks and particularly the pundi ts in the North think and its getting stronger every year Number Updated Frequently I update my number at least twice a week with football and football recruiting news The number is It costs a minute You must be or older to call UT Starts Another Great Recruiting Year with First Pledge The Longhorns have three great recruiting classes in succession and they made a good start on a fourth earlier this month when outstanding Brownwood junior OL Bret Valdez confirmed he has committed to the UT coaches Valdez one of the states great run blockers said he went to the UT sprin g game March and really liked what he saw He said the Texas coaches offered him a scholarship at the spring game They told me I was the first offensive lineman they have offered this year he said adding that he went home and talked to his parents about it and decided he wanted to be a Longhorn He said he came to Austin the weekend after the spring game and competed i n the Texas Relays throwing the shot and discus After I was through competing he said I went over to the coaches offices and talked to coach Mack Brown and coaches Tim Nunez and Mike Tolleson and told them I was ready to commit Im really excited about bein g a Longhorn He said he also was being recruited by about other schools including Florida State Texas AM Oklahoma Alabama and Notre Dame The first time they can come see us is in May and Florida State AM OU Notre Dame and Alabama coaches had all told my coach they were going to com e down and see me then But he said they need to change their travel plans because he is firmly committed to the Longhorns and will tell any other coaches who contact him that he is a future Longhorn Texas has really been recruiting well every year and I think they have a great shot at winning a national championship in the next year or two he said I like the way they emphasize academics too I think Ill have a good chance to start after a redshirt year he said The Longhorns probably will sign only three offensive line prospects next February and the coaches have not offered scholarships to any other offensive line prospects I have been talking to so they must consider Vald ez to be the states top OL prospect Brownwood went last year and Valdez was the teams top blocker He ha s thrown the shot feet and discus On tape Valdez is a very aggressive blocker who has an explosive start tha t allows him to make quick contact and then he simply drives his guy backward He has the quickest start of any of the big offensive line prospects I have seen this year One of the best things about him is that he is only and wont turn until June but he already benches and squats The Longhorns need a bumper crop of defensive linemen this year and they stand a very good chance to get an early commitment from one of the top one s around at their early June camp He is Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral a top DT who i s the No recruit in Arizona Sendlein is the son of former UT and NFL LB

already had a lot of tall recruits in her nationally ranked recruiting class but she didnt have a true center until last week when she won a long battle to sign Spring Westfield center Mercedes Williams Williams averaged points rebounds and steals per game in leading Westfield to a record and a berth in the state Class A finals She was on the AllState team and was the Houston Chronicles Player of the Year She is a strong physical presence in the paint and relishes the tough play around the basket She will provide much needed depth behind Stacy Stephens and Annissa Hastings at center for the Longhorns With the addition of Mercedes we now have five newcomers who immediately raise the overall talent level of our program Conradt said adding that all five players are considered among the very best players coming out of their respective states The other four signees are forward Kala Bowers of Woodward Okla the Oklahoma Player of the Year Heather Schreiber of Windthorst the top player in Texas and a Parade AllAmerican guardforward Coco Reed of Houston Jersey Village Canadian Junior National team player Jody Bell a forward from Chestermere High School in Alberta The Longhorns had a top recruiting class nationally before signing Williams Womens Tennis in Sweet The No ranked Texas womens tennis team beat No TCU Sunday in Austin in the second round of the NCAA regional playoffs Texas advances to the NCAA round of and will play No Duke Thursday in Stone Mountain Ga The Longhorns played Duke earlier this season losing in Austin TCU finished Mens Tennis Team Falls to LSU The No ranked Longhorn mens tennis team fell to LSU Sunday in Baton Rouge in the second round of the NCAA playoffs The Longhorns end the season while LSU advances to the Round of Longhorn Golfers in Regional The No ranked Longhorn golf team will compete in the NCAA Central Regional Championships in Stillwater Oklahoma Thursday through Saturday Texas finished third in the Maxwell Invitational in Ardmore Okla last weekend shooting a over par to finish five strokes behind tourney champ Tulsa UT Basketball Recruits Honored Texas basketball coach Rick Barnes two recruits both ranked among the nations elite players at their positions Good national basketball ratings are hard to find but Student Sports Magazine recently came out with a ranking of the top players at each position for a national top overall Point guard T J Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge ranked No at his position and center Chris Wright of Redwater ranked No among the big guys in the middle Most rating services had Ford much higher but it is a great tribute to Wrights potential that he made the list of the top centers because he missed almost all of his senior year with a torn ACL that required surgery Fords Willowridge team also was ranked No in the nation by Student Sports and the Eagles were the topranked public school team Mouth of Wilson Va which gives scholarships and recruits all over the nation was ranked No but the Warriors are an allstar team with players from several states and countries Ford also made the magazines man first team senior AllAmerican list which was surprising since he was rated only No in the pointguard category I suppose they have two gurus with different views of the point guards I go along with the one who rated Ford as one of the top two point guards because every other rating service I saw had him as one of the top two or three point guards in the nation Evans Testing Pro Waters Junior Longhorns swingman Maurice Evans has declared himself eligible for June NBA draft Evans who led the Horns in scoring last year with a average has not hired an agent and can return to Texas for his senior season if he doesnt elect to turn pro While Evans is a fine college player he lacks great dribbling skills at this point and probably wont be drafted He could benefit from another year under coach Rick Barnes tutelage Horns Recruiting Top JC Guard The Longhorns are in the running for a top junior college combo guard Terrell Ross a point guard with fine shooting skills at Allegany JC in Meadville Md visited UT three weeks ago and has narrowed his picks to Texas Mississippi State and Michigan State Tuesday is the deadline for signing letters of intent in basketball so he will sign with someone right away or his recruiting will drag on until he shows up on a college campus to start classes He led Allegany to a record and the National JC championship game He averaged only points a game for a loaded team that features four other Division I signees but he hit of his shots from the field and of his free throws He also is an outstanding defensive player and rebounder A True Orange Subscription Is The Gift You Can Give Every Year to Your Longhorn Friends

NFL draft Friday and Longhorn AllAmerican teammate DT Casey Hampton also went in the first round Arizona picked Davis after the Atlanta Falcons traded up to get the first choice and took Virginia Tech QB Michael Vick Hampton was chosen by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the th pick in the fir st round The Horns other outstanding DT Shaun Rogers was picked in the second rou nd by the Detroit Lions He was the st pick overall The last time Texas had three players chosen in the first round was in Texas coach Mack Brown noted that all three players were recruited by forme r coach John Mackovic and his staff and said he is hoping it starts a trend that sees several Longhorns being drafted every year There might be a little fall off next year but Longhorns should be very popular with NFL teams on a regular basis beginning in Football Notes Observations UT QB Chris Simms says he is sure he will stay at Texas for his senior year There had been some speculation that Simms might turn pro after this season but he said he will stick around for his senior year Things to watch for this season that should make a big positive difference include More weapons to pick up those shortyardage plays to keep drives alive like a bigger stronger running back a more experienced offensive line and dont forget great targets in TEs Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards from a twoTE set More misdirection plays particularly reverses and quick pitches to the outside More short passes to frustrate the pass rushers and to give the Horns swift and elusive receivers chances to turn short passes into long gains Bears Maul Longhorns The UT baseball players looked great Friday night in whipping Baylor in Austin but they looked lost when they went to Waco for the final two games of their series Saturday and Sunday Gerritt Simpson scattered six singles and struck out Friday night to giv e the Horns a triumph in the first game of the crucial series Ryan Brooks had three hits to pace the offense But the Bears got to apply the mercy rule twice in Waco throttling the Horns in seven innings and in eight innings Texas made seven errors in the two games in Waco and that coupled with spotty pitching and very little hitting turned the two games into routs Nebraska is running away with the regular season championship and Baylor and Texas are tied for second place Texas Tech is fourth and OSU is fifth

Coordinator Interview Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says there are two areas he always focuses on in spring practice The first is replacing the seniors and the second is schematics what we did last season and what changes we need to make what we should try to do better AllAmerican LT Leonard Davis and AllBig RB Hodges Mitchell were the on ly senior starters on last years offense and he said he feels a lot better a bo ut replacing Davis than he does about replacing Mitchell Robbie Doane had a real good spring at left tackle Davis said We also worked Derrick Dockery some at left tackle because weve got three really good guards Alfeo Randall incoming JC transfer also is a left tackle Considering all the possibilities I think well be okay at left tackle But I dont think we solved anything this spring at tailback he said A ll five guys did some good things and we could play all five of them but we wanted somebody to step up and nobody did The five tailbacks are juniors Victor Ike and Kenny Hayter sophomores Bret t Robin and Ivan Williams and redshirt freshman Sneezy Beltran Head coach Mack Brown said Robin had the best spring but he said none of t he five played at the level the Longhorns need their tailback to reach Davis concurred saying Were going into the preseason practices with an unsettled situation at tailback Obviously were going to find out what the youngster can do when he gets here he added The youngster of course needs no identification He is Cedric Benson the super recruit who is finishing his senior year at Midland Lee after leading the Rebels to three straight state A championships As for a changing some things in the overall scheme Davis said We wanted to add more misdirection this spring and we worked on that Its an area where we think we can add some things that will help us He said more work needs to be done on the reverses shovel passes and quick dashes to the outside Those things are not greased yet he said but Im glad we got to throw a lot of those things at them It gives us some more avenues to attack Davis also said the coaches worked hard this spring on developing a running game to pick up shortyardage situations Were not going to be a team that says we have to run for a certain amount of yardage he said We want to do whatever it takes to win the game but there are times when you have to be able to run the ball in short yardage particularly for first downs on the goal line and in the fourth quarter wh en were trying to protect a lead Other than the uncertainty at tailback Davis liked what he saw this spring Our linemen had a good spring he said Mike Williams at right tackle ha d a great spring I think Mike will be an outstanding right tackle this seaso n Derrick Dockery had a really good spring at right guard Davis said Mat t Anderson had a good spring at center and Jason Glynn got a lot of snaps behind Matt Im really pleased with Jason Glynns development Davis said the line will be much better when guards Antwan KirkHughes and Tillman Holloway who both missed the spring rehabilitating injuries retur n for preseason practice Tight end will be a really solid position he said Bo Scaife was able t o get back into things after knee surgery and he had a really solid spring Brock Edwards is a good young tight end and well get Mike Jones knee surgery back for the season Our young wide receivers are just going to get better and better Davis said Roy Williams B J Johnson and Sloan Thomas all played really well as true freshmen and now theyre a year older and more experienced He also said walkon Kyle Shanahan redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and seni or Montrell Flowers also will see a lot of action Shanahan is the son of the Denver Broncos head coach and was a starter on a scholarship at Duke before deciding to transfer and walk on at Texas becaus e he wants to be a coach and felt this was the best place to learn the trade After sitting out last season Shanahan is a junior and he catches the ball as well as anybody on the team This is a really solid group with very good players and quality depth Davis said Were really pleased with our wide receivers At quarterback he said you would be hard pressed to find anybody who h as two like we do They are junior starter Chris Simms and senior Major Applewhite who shattered most of Texas passing records before severe injuries to both kne es sidelined him gave Simms a chance to win the job Davis also said he is very pleased with the development of redshirt freshma n QB Chance Mock Chance Mock is really talented Davis said He has really good skills Mock has outstanding speed for a quarterback and a strong arm He also has a very quick release He needs to get some experience but he has all the tools Davis said So looking at everything how good can this Longhorn offense be I think this group has a chance to be really good he said We have a lo t of talented players We just need to solidify the running game and were working on that UT Hires Volleyball Coach Jerritt Elliott former interim head womens volleyball coach at the University of Southern California is the new head womens volleyball

as explosive at the line of scrimmage of any tackle I have seen this year committed on May and Sendlein who is so quick he plays middle linebacker on a team that is the last two seasons committed on June The junior college star is DT Sonny Davis formerly of Austin Lanier and currently of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi He signed with Texas last year but failed to qualify academically and enrolled in a JC He says he is ahead of schedule academically and hopes to be able to graduate in December and enroll at Texas in January so he can go through spring training Coach Mack Brown said signing defensive linemen was his No priority in this years recruiting class and this trio gives him a great start toward accomplishing that goal The Longhorns first commitment was from outstanding run blocker Brett Valdez of Brownwood on April The commitments since my last newsletter are athlete Clint Haney Nike camp time at AM of Smithson Valley and QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar both on June and WR Dustin Miksch Nike camp time at AM of Round Rock Westwood on June While the more recent commitments are not as heralded as the earlier ones they obviously were impressive at UTs summer camps Donald Burgs the outstanding cornerback from Houston Madison told me last Wednesday night that Miksch was the best wide receiver at the camp that ended earlier that day The following day Miksch committed to the Longhorns It also didnt hurt that Miksch ran a at the AM Nike camp and a at the UT camp and Haney ran a at the same Nike camp and a at the Texas camp Malone is not as much of a sleeper as the other two Hes a twotime Class A AllDistrict quarterback and safety and he was the sophomore of the year in the district both offensively and defensively He has receivers who can catch the ball but they dont dazzle anyone with their speed When defensive backs arent worried about receivers speed they cover them as tightly as they can knowing that if they lose a step it will be easy to get it back That makes the quarterbacks job a lot harder and can lead to more interceptions But Malone completed of passes for yards and touchdowns for a team He had seven interceptions He also ran for yards and four touchdowns Malone said he chose Texas over Tennessee Arkansas Colorado Iowa State TCU and SMU He said ISU TCU and SMU had offered and North Lamar head coach Tom Felty said Tennessee Arkansas and Colorado coaches had told him they were preparing to offer He has a great arm Felty said but what really makes him special is the way he sees the entire field He can find his second and third receivers and he never just locks onto one guy Hes also a very physical player Felty said Thats what makes him such a fine free safety and it also helps him at quarterback because he will hang in there until the last split second to get a completion even when he knows hes going to get decked Haney said he picked the Longhorns over Texas Tech and Colorado offers and several other schools who were recruiting him He rushed times for yards yards per carry and touchdowns and also was a big threat as a receiver catching passes for yards and four touchdowns for the Rangers He said when he committed Coach Brown said they were recruiting me as a football player He told me they want fast athletic kids and they would find a spot for me after I get there That spot probably will be wide receiver or defensive back Smithson Valley defeated San Marcos in the Class A playoffs last year and Haney said San Marcos defensive tackle Earl Anderson another UT pledge is really fast to be so big I broke about a yard touchdown run in that game and he was right behind me most of the way Im glad were going to be on the same side at Texas In addition to those fast times Miksch ran at the summer camps he also blazed to a meters last track season Miksch the son of former Longhorn WR Ronnie Miksch a letterman from Needville said Purdue Nebraska AM Notre Dame and Oklahoma were all recruiting him He said Purdue and Nebraska coaches had invited him to their summer camps Ill have to call both of them and tell them I wont be coming to their camps he said He caught passes for yards and five touchdowns for the Warriors last season When Anderson and Sendlein committed earlier along with Davis recommitment it gave the Longhorns a fine start toward a great defensive line class All three are physical players who have great quickness to go with their size and athleticism They also all play very hard all the time Anderson is the highest ranked Texas bluechipper to pick a college He is No on my man differencemaker list Sendlein is the top recruit in Arizona and if he lived in Texas he would be high in my top Davis was No on my difference maker list last year Anderson who says he has grown an inch to and now weighs told me can still break in the on most days I ran a the last time I was clocked he said I want to stay below so Im watching my weight now I was the first guy to give him a high ranking after seeing his incredible quickness last season He said he picked Texas over Texas AM Florida State and others because UT has the great combination of athletics and academics that I want and its so close that my parents wont have to spend a lot of money traveling around to see me play Besides that he said Ive always been a Longhorn fan Sendlein comes from such a Longhorn family that his UT linebacker brother is named Austin Their father Robin was a great linebacker at Texas and also played in the NFL for many years Sendlein said he is and can run the in His Scottsdale team has gone two straight years and his prowess as a defender is one of the main reasons for the teams success Sendlein was being recruited by all the top schools in the Pac plus Notre Dame Nebraska Michigan and Penn State Another great defensive line prospect Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel came in at and and ran a at a Nike camp at LSU recently and he also bench pressed pounds times No one else at the camp was able to bench press pounds more than times Pittman bench pressed pounds a tremendous achievement for a high school junior at a recent charity fund raising event at Evangel He is the younger brother of Cole Pittman the former UT defensive linemen who was killed in a tragic auto accident earlier this year while returning to Texas for spring training He is considering Texas and LSU Chase and his father Marc Pittman came to one of the Longhorn camp sessions on June and several other Evangel stars accompanied them including John David Booty a pound quarterback who might be the nations top sophomore prospect and another outstanding sophomore DE Chris Bowers He also brought two top Evangel defensive backs who are being highly recruited from Evangel They are Jonathan Wade he ran a meters in April and Chad Johnson RECRUITING NOTES Trivia Question The speedrushing DE Longhorn coaches and their cohors everywhere want to sign lives miles or so northeast of Austin but his grandmother and two uncles live in Austin and he took an u nofficial visit to Austin recently Who is he If you guessed Bryan Pickryl of Jenks suburban Tulsa Oklahoma you are a certified recruiting junkie Pickryl has lived in Oklahoma all his life but his father is a UCLA grad and he says his top two schools right now are Texas and UCLA Look for the Sooners to be a big player here but they will have to hurry because he is planning to graduate in December and enroll in the college of his choice in January Hes the top player in Oklahoma and one of the truly great outside pass rushers in the country My list on page has quite a few new names because the May evaluations by college coaches produced some new top prospects The Longhorns might sign as many as six or seven defensive linemen and as many as four offensive linemen in this recruiting class because the talent base is so strong in both areas The top offensive line prospects the Horns are hustling are Justin Blaylock of Plano East Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield and Neale Tweedie of Allen The top defensive line hopes include tackles Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch Colo Marco Martin of Mesquite and Joseph Edwards of Dayton and the top ends in addition to Pittman and Pickryl are Travis Leitko of The Woodlands Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Dontriel Coates of Anahuac Coates has only played football the last two seasons but he has great quickness and intensity Baseball Roundup Shorstop Omar Quintanilla and pitcher Justin Simmons have been named to Collegiate Baseballs Louisville Slugger Freshmen AllAmerican Team This marks the first time Texas has had two freshman AllAmercians in the same year The Longhorns were seeded third in the NCAA sub regional at Stanford in late May They upset No seed Long Beach State then stunned topseeded Stanford in the winners bracket finale but Stanford came back out of the losers bracket to beat Texas twice on May The Cardinal won the first game in innings then took the nightcap Sophomore Longhorn pitcher Ray Clark took a lead into the eighth inning in the second game but sloppy fielding and mental miscues gave Stanford three extra outs and the Cardinal scored three times Stanford went on to win a regional and made the finals of the College World Series last week before losing to Miami The Longhorns will lose Gerrit Simpson and Albert Montes their top two pitchers Both were drafted and plan to sign They also lost one of their top recruits Houston Bellaire catcher James Sweeney to the pros Vincent Sinisi the slugger from The Woodlands who was the Horns top signee last year has transferred to Rice He has had persistent problems with a rib injury Subscribe Now To The FaxEMail Service to Get Scoops on Early Recruiting Get Reports on Early

<15863337.1075852131982.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,truorange@aol.com,2001-06-18 09:55:23,True Orange June Part Part of Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The newsletter and emailfax service for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No June Most Football Forecasters Rank Longhorns High Nationally See OU Game as Key to Season Most of the good national football magazines are out and so is the one that serves as an everyyear staple for fans in Texas Dave Campbells Texas Football and all of them agree on two things The Longhorns are going to be very good this season with coach Mack Browns most talented team at Texas poised to claim its place among the nations elite once again Defending national champion Oklahoma is going to be very good too so mark October on your calendar and plan to be in Dallas on that date for the clash of Big South titans With apologies to the other Big South teams I think the Longhorns and the Sooners will be so far above their division rivals that the winner of that October Dallas showdown will win the Southern Division and have a chance for national honors The Longhorns have other dangerous games and so do the Sooners but its hard to see either of them stumbling more than once when they arent playing each other so look for the Cotton Bowl winner to emerge as a big player on the national scene Of course as Longhorn fans know exceeedingly well to their chagrin bad things happen quite often through the course of a season Remember Stanford last year and North Carolina State the year before Of course you do We all do They are sad memories for all Longhorns But Browns teams have also won great victories over Nebraska twice in three tries Oklahoma twice in three years and AM twice in three seasons plus a decisive Cotton Bowl victory over Mississippi State and Jackie Sherrill Browns first team at Texas went after a start and Ricky Williams won the Heisman Trophy Coming on the heels of a team that ended the John Mackovic era it was an impressive start for the Brown era His second team at Texas was rolling along at when its wide receivers started getting nicked and then the best one Kwame Cavil got suspended It lost its final three games to wind up but it was a very good team until those last three games When you only have three good wide receivers and two of them get hurt and the third one misses the bowl game its tough to operate successfully when you are primarily a passing team Some fans were disappointed in that team and it is understandably disheartening to lose three games to close the season but those Longhorns did some very good things like handing Nebraska its only loss rallying from a deficit to beat Bob Stoops first Oklahoma team and hammering Stanford That Stanford team went on to win the Pac and earn a Rose Bowl berth Browns third team at Texas was last years unit which finished Frankly when I saw superb young TE Bo Scaife go down with a seasonending knee injury during twoadays I would have settled for The Longhorns had only three scholarship tight ends and the other two also suffered injuries that ended their seasons And that wasnt all DT Shaun Rogers missed some games and was never at full speed after an early season injury Ditto for both starting guards Antwan KirkHughes and Derrick Dockery Then there was the socalled quarterback controversy It really wasnt that much of a controversy because Major Applewhite simply didnt look like the same great quarterback after his knee injury and Chris Simms simply didnt have enough experience to play well early in the year I think the coaches were just trying to find one quarterback who could play at a winning level not playing some game with their quarterbacks Neither quarterback played as well last season as the preinjury Applewhite but Simms did improve as the season progressed and he is the unquestioned No guy heading into this season There were two reasons for this brief review of Mack Browns three seasons at Texas The first was to say three ninewin seasons in a row with the kind of problems that hit the team in and are pretty remarkable and all Longhorn fans should be thanking their lucky stars every day that the leaders of a school that would hire John Mackovic would get smart enough to hire Mack Brown the next time around The second was to say that injuries while always a point of concern shouldnt be quite as worrisome this season because the superb recruiting classes Brown and his staff have signed will be three deep this season He actually will have four classes on campus but he got a late start his first year and his first class was good but not great The last three have been great There are some questions to be answered particularly at running back but there are talented players at virtually every position and that is something now many college teams can say The receiving corps including the wide receivers and tight ends will be the best in the Big and maybe in the country and the secondary might be the best in the Big too although Oklahoma fans and coaches would dispute that If Simms is the best passer in the league as all the football magazines attest and if Cedric Benson is as good as we all think look out everyone because the Longhorns will be for real Dont worry about all that talk about our defensive tackles The Big is a passing league and these tackles are quick to the passer But you should worry some about the place kicking Unless one of the returnees gets better or one of the walkons steps up the same thing that knocked Bobby Bowden out of a couple of national titles at Florida State could jump up and bite the Longhorns Benson Will Mix Football Baseball Cosby Drops Football Two super Longhorn recruits have signed pro baseball contracts but only one of them and it is not Cedric Benson is giving up college football to concentrate on professional football Benson who led Midland Lee to three straight Class A state titles signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers but he signed a contract like the one Ricky Williams signed out of high school It lets him play college football and use pro baseball as a highly paid summer job I want to play college football at Texas Benson said Someday I want to play both sports professionally but I want to play college football first But Marts Quan Cosby a nationally recruited athlete who was ticketed to play wide receiver at Texas signed a fiveyear baseball contract with the California Angels and said his football playing days are over It came as a shock to the Longhorn coaches and to me and most other Longhorns You just dont expect a sixthround draft choice to get enough money to give up football But Cosby told me he got close to firstround money I told them what it would take for me to give up football and thats what they came up with he said but he declined to give a hint about his signing bonus Cosby said baseball is easier on the body so I probably will be able to play baseball longer than I could have played football Asked if he might return to Texas to play football if his baseball career doesnt work out as planned he said Thats a possibility but Im figuring on playing baseball for a long time The Blue Chips Heres my

football with twin goals of developing better run blockers and finding a left tackle to replac e AllAmerican Leonard Davis who was the second player chosen in the first round of the NFL draft Saturday In an interview last week he told me he is pleased about the progress his players made in both areas He said right tackle Mike Williams and right guard Derrick Dockery were outstanding this spring in every area including run blocking Mike Williams had a great spring Nunez said He had as good a spring as any offensive linemen has had since weve been here Hes really light on h is feet for such a big man and that helps him whether hes pass blocking or run blocking Derrick Dockery finally was healthy this spring he said That infection he had last season really sapped his strength all season He fought through it and played as hard as he could but this spring he was flying around and doing things he couldnt do last year He was just a different guy this spring and he really did a good job He and Mike really gave us a strong right side this spring He said center Matt Anderson played well this spring Hes a steady hand i n there He also said backup Jason Glynn had a very good spring He is real ly athletic We just need to get him some snaps Junior Robbie Doane started at left tackle all spring and Nunez said I think Robbie Doane is going to be a good football player for us He needs t o have a great summer and get stronger in his upper body He really wants to be a good player and hell work hard this summer to get there He said Doane has great technique He really knows what to do Hes just g ot to get strong enough to do it on a consistent basis Nunez said one reason Doane might not have been an obvious standout during the spring was that he was going against a great player Defensive end Kalen Thornton is as hard to block as anybody hell see during the season Hes special But the Longhorns also have some other options at left tackle Blinn Junior College star Alfio Randall has passed the JC exit exam and is on schedule t o graduate in time to join the team in August and Dockery also worked some a t left tackle in the spring and did very well Nunez said Two top guards missed the spring Senior Antwan KirkHughes a two year starter was recovering from shoulder surgery and sophomore Tillman Hollowa y sprained a knee early in the spring and missed the remainder of the drills When they return Nunez said it will make it easier to move Dockery to tack le if the need arises He said both of them should be totally recovered in plenty of time for the season How about depth at guard if Dockery moves to tackle Bo Baker had a good spring at guard he said Well continue to work him some at center but he gives us another good guard Hes really fast If we had a race he would be the fastest of the offensive linemen Nunez said players like Williams Dockery and KirkHughes have had to play earlier than they should have since none of them redshirted but he said those painful early learning experiences should pay off this year Mike Williams really improved during last season Nunez said He was playing really well by the end of the season and he carried that over into this spring He said KirkHughes shoulder and Dockerys infection hampered their play last season but he said they played as hard as they could and should be mu ch better this season because of their experiences last season Dockery made great strides this spring he said adding that he expects KirkHughes to again be one of the teams top linemen when he returns with his surgicallyrepaired shoulder Holloway started several games as a redshirt freshman last year due to Dockerys health problems and Nunez said he had to grow up during the season Its tough to start as a redshirt freshman offensive lineman in thi s league but he worked through it and he was just playing so much better by the end of the season Im excited about this group Nunez said Theyve worked hard to get better and I think they have a chance to be a really strong group this seas on if they can stay healthy Head coach Mack Brown said at the end of spring practice the Longhorns were running the ball better than they have the last two seasons Since he also says he isnt that happy with any of the tailbacks he obviously feels the line is doing a better job of run blocking We worked on it more this spring Nunez said and I think that will pay off this season One thing that needs to be noted is that the perennial powerhouse teams usually dont start offensive linemen until they are redshirt juniors whic h means they are in their fourth year Exceptional linemen can start earlier but even they usually spend two year s backing up before starting in their third year This coaching staff inherited some talent when it took over but other than a talented bunch of seniors the offensive line talent was pretty bare Even firstround draft choice Davis spent his first year on defense before the new staff switched him to the offensive line Texas should be able to begin redshirting most of its offensive linemen thi s season but the coaches havent had that luxury until now Why Because despite their great overall recruiting success they have bee n able to sign only three offensive linemen each year until they hit the jackpot with six in their last recruiting class Kelly Named Basketball MVP Senior shooting
