XMailer Microsoft Outlook Express XMimeOLE Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V Subject Re Worth passing on Darrell Scott the father of Rachel Scott a victim of the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton Colorado was invited to address the House Judiciary Committees subcommittee What he said to our national leaders during this special session of Congress was painfully truthful They were not prepared for what he was to say nor was it received well It needs to be heard by every parent every teacher every politician every sociologist every psychologist and every socalled expert These courageous words spoken by Darrell Scott are powerful penetrating and deeply personal The following is a portion of the transcript Since the dawn of creation there has been both good evil in the hearts of men and women We all contain the seeds of kindness or the seeds of violence The death of my wonderful daughter Rachel Joy Scott and the deaths of that heroic teacher and the other eleven children who died must not be in vain Their blood cries out for answers The first recorded act of violence was when Cain slew his brother Abel out in the field The villain was not the club he used Neither was it the NCA the National Club Association The true killer was Cain and the reason for the murder could only be found in Cains heart In the days that followed the Columbine tragedy I was amazed at how quickly fingers began to be pointed at groups such as the NRA I am not a member of the NRA I am not a hunter I do not even own a gun I am not here to represent or defend the NRA because I dont believe that they are responsible for my daughters death Therefore I do not believe that they need to be defended If I believed they had anything to do with Rachels murder I would be their strongest opponent I am here today to declare that Columbine was not just a tragedyit was a spiritual event that should be forcing us to look at where the real blame lies Much of the blame lies here in this room Much of the blame lies behind the pointing fingers of the accusers themselves I wrote a poem that expresses my feelings best This was written way before I knew I would be speaking here today Your laws ignore our deepest needs Your words are empty air Youve stripped away our heritage Youve outlawed simple prayer Now gunshots fill our classrooms and precious children die You seek for answers everywhere And ask the question Why You regulate restrictive laws Through legislative creed And yet you fail to understand That God is what we need Men and women are threepart beings We all consist of body soul and spirit When we refuse to acknowledge a third part of our makeup we create a void that allows evil prejudice and hatred to rush in and wreak havoc Spiritual influences were present within our educational systems for most of our nations history Many of our major colleges began as theological seminaries This is a historical fact What has happened to us as a nation We have refused to honor God and in so doing we open the doors to hatred and violence And when something as terrible as Columbines tragedy occurs politicians immediately look for a scapegoat such as the NRA They immediately seek to pass more restrictive laws that contribute to erode away our personal and private liberties We do not need more restrictive laws Eric and Dylan would not have been stopped by metal detectors No amount of gun laws can stop someone who spends months planning this type of massacre The real villain lies within our own hearts Political posturing and restrictive legislation are not the answers The young people of our nation hold the key There is a spiritual awakening taking place that will not be squelched We do not need more religion We do not need more gaudy television evangelists spewing out verbal religious garbage We do not need more million dollar church buildings built while people with basic needs are being ignored We do need a change of heart and a humble acknowledgment that this nation was founded on the principle of simple trust in God As my son Craig lay under that table in the school library and saw his two friends murdered before his very eyes he did not hesitate to pray in school I defy any law or politician to deny him that right I challenge every young person in America and around the world to realize that on April at Columbine High School prayer was brought back to our schools Do not let the many prayers offered by those students be in vain Dare to move into the new millennium with a sacred disregard for legislation that violates your Godgiven right to communicate with Him To those of you who would point your finger at the NRA I give to you a sincere challenge Dare to examine your own heart before casting the first stone My daughters death will not be in vain The young people of this country will not allow that to happen PLEASE Do what the media did notlet the nation hear this mans speech Please send this out to everyone you can
