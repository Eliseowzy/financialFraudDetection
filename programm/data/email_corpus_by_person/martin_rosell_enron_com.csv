<3122814.1075859885470.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,martin.rosell@enron.com,1999-05-28 12:12:00,FYI New Nordic Financial Power Documentation Cc of the newly started revision of the NPTA terms a group of some people meet in Stockholm yesterday for a halfday session at the offices of the Swedish SE Bank Since only half of the attendees were lawyers and just the SE Bank attorney attending the meeting and myself have any greater experience from derivatives documentation and trading the discussion was initially somewhat unstructured but gradually got on track and I think I actually managed quite well in stiring the process towards a decent result Minutes was taken and will be circulated in about a week In brief the following was agreed An new Nordic financial power trading master is to be created This document shall be in English and be AngloAmerican styled and contain all customary provisions and a schedule plus proposed collateral arrangements and if possible a short Users Guide The intention is not to reinvent the wheel but rather to collect and seek inspiration from existing derivatives documentation in different markets I suggested that a law firm should be assigned to prepare the new doc but the meeting rather thought that the initial work should be done by a working group including Enron the SE Bank Eastern Energy National Power Sydkraft and Statkraft and that legal opinions should be obtained in due course as to the enforceability of the new documentation in different jurisdictions The governing law issue was the issue mostly discussed and it was agreed that this matter supposedly had to be left to the option of the contracting parties The idea is to have the Nordic Power Traders Association promote the new documentationthereby obtaining wide acceptance for it in the market place Since Enron is the only party in the formed working group experienced in both derivatives and commodities this may be a chance for the company if it desires to take the initiative and promote for instance something in line with the ECT Houston Industrial Master The new doc is thought to serve as a standard doc for players that is unwilling or unable to use the ISDA documentation Ill keep you posted on the progress and please let me have your viewpoints Martin
