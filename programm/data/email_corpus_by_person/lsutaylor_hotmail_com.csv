mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR CAR Manchester United Updated Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sundays game against the ers His status for the Week game against Atlanta is unclear Mike Anderson mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB DEN Dirty Bastards Updated Anderson rushed for only yards on carries against the Redskins Olandis Gary carried the ball times for yards It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense Michael Westbrook mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR WAS Baton Rouge Idiot Updated Westbrook caught nine passes for yards and a TD at Denver Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly Jake Plummer mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB ARI Free Agent Updated Plummer threw for yards four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer who may not have a better game this season Michael Pittman mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB ARI Free Agent Updated The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to rushing yards on carries Dont start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB David Sloan mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey TE DET Free Agent Updated Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona If you ar e desperate for help at TE consider Sloan who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch Lamont Warren mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB DET Free Agent Updated Warren rushed for yards and a TD at Arizona and caught passes for yards and a score The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year Warrick Dunn mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB TB Bees Updated Dunn caught passes for yards against the Bears but he rushed for only yards and fumbled twice Dont count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks He can be explosive but he is also erratic Keyshawn Johnson mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR TB Baton Rouge Idiot Updated Johnson caught passes for yards against the Bears but he failed to get in the end zone again Dont depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout David Terrell mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR CHI Free Agent Updated Terrell ca ug ht one pass for yards at Tampa Bay The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams Marty Booker mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR CHI Anorexic Drunks Updated Booker caught seven passes for yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay In his third season Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout He is a player you must start every week no matter what matchup he faces Plaxico Burress mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR PIT Bees Updated The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for yards The secondyear receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player LaDainian Tomlinson mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB SD Bees Updated Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland posting yards and a touchdown His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks however which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason Hines Ward mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR PIT Free Agent Updated Ward caught nine passes for yards and a TD against Jacks on ville While he doesnt score often Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year and he will always post respectable totals Doug Flutie mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB SD Free Agent Updated Fluties recent struggles continued against Oakland throwing for only yards on Sunday Unless he faces a good matchup starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble Stacey Mack mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB JAC Manchester United Updated Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season Rich Gannon mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB OAK Mandeville Marriage Updated Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego throwing for yards and four touchdowns Hes one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a muststart every week Jerry Rice mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR OAK Free Agent Updated Rice had a huge game on Sunday catching eight passes for yards and three touchdowns against San Diego R ic e may not be an everyweek starter in smaller leagues but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right Tony Banks mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB WAS Free Agent Updated Banks was carted off the field in the second quarter of Sundays game at Denver with a concussion He was replaced by Kent Graham Brett Favre mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB GB Team Sensitive Updated Favre threw for yards and two TDs against the Falcons but he was intercepted three times and lost a fumble Despite some inconsistent play in recent weeks Favres potential for big games makes him a muststart every week Corey Bradford mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR GB Free Agent Updated Bradford caught three passes for yards against Atlanta The Green Bay wideout is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player Chris Chandler mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB ATL Free Agent Updated Chandler started at Green Bay and threw for yards two TD s and two interceptions He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy Bob Christian mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB ATL Free Agent Updated Christian rushed for yards and caught five passes for yards at Green Bay The Falcons are using him more often and Christian makes a good backup RB right now Elvis Grbac mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB BAL Free Agent Updated Grbac threw for yards two TDs and was intercepted four times by the Browns The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should not start for most Fantasy teams Jason Brookins mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB BAL Free Agent Updated Brookins rushed for yards on carries against the Browns The rookie is a servicable yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give you some occasional TDs down the stretch Tim Couch mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB CLE Bees Updated Couch threw for only yards and was intercepted three times at Baltimore The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even as a Fantasy backup right now Benjamin Gay mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandom k ey RB CLE Free Agent Updated Gay saw his first extensive action of the year carrying the ball times for yards and a TD at Baltimore He displayed good vision and lateral quickness and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at RB James Jackson mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB CLE Clubbers Updated Jackson ankle did not play at Baltimore Benjamin Gay and Jamel White shared carries in his place Lamar Smith mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB MIA Manchester United Updated Smith rushed for only yards on carries against the Jets Smith appears to be mired in mediocrity right now and he is a risky start unless you lack depth at RB Chris Chambers mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR MIA Free Agent Updated The rookie wideout caught only two passes for yards against the Jets Chambers is still too inconsistent to start for most

development VHLD should attract major shareholder value with tremendous upside potential VHLD with tremendous growth in assets in one of the most secure industries in a volatile market REAL ESTATE In a marketplace where cos continue to disappoint on earnings VHLD is positioned to grow at a massive rate with tremendous earnings and assets The Company Vector Holdings Inc OTC BB VHLD Vector Holdings Inc through its subsidiary Bestfoodonlinecom distributes specialty food products to the hospitality industry The flagship website can be found at wwwbestfoodonlinecom where products may be purchased on a wholesale basis to the hospitality industry worldwide Clients of Vector Holdings Best Food include Walt Disney United Airlines Ocean Reef Club and Turnberry Isle Resort and Country Club The Company has carved out its niche within the management and hospitality industry through management contracts with name hotel properties within the South Florida region Vector Holdings present strategy to maximize shareholder value is to acquire boutique hotels located in South Beach Florida through its relationships and existing contracts INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY When you talk about real estate you talk about LOCATION LOCATION When you talk about Commercial Hotel real estate you talk about LOCATION LOCATION and MANAGEMENT VHLD appears to be on to something VHLDs present strategy to maximize shareholder value is to acquire boutique hotels located in South Beach Florida For those Wizard subscribers who are not familiar with South Beach Florida market let The Wizard try to describe First this area is home to nearly Art Deco buildings which were primarily constructed during the s s and s The South Beach area is comprised of small boutique hotels nightclubs restaurants and lots of chic shopping stores South Beach is a unique area to Miami Beach from st street to th street including Ocean Drive Collins Avenue and Washington Avenue Miami Dades hotel occupancy rates have lead the nation for the first five months of South Beach is strategically located near Miamis financial district and a very attractive destination to tourists from all over the world VHLDs plan is to acquire existing boutique hotels in South Beach FL that are currently operating and profitable VHLD is simply taking existing hotels and attempting to make them better by partnering with an experienced hotel management company that has a proven track record of doing exactly what VHLD is looking to accomplish To this extent VHLD has retained Hospitality Advisory Group Inc HAG which is led by Mr Richard Wilhelm Richard Wilhelm is a hotel management professional with over thirty years of experience in management of a number of premier hotel and resort properties in the United States These properties include such landmark hotels as the Plaza Hotel the St Regis and the WaldorfAstoria in New York City Trump Castle in Atlantic City and recently the Island Outpost group of hotels in Miami Beachs popular South Beach area The core business of HAG is that of providing comprehensive hotel management services to their clients which is VHLD Services typically provided include the full spectrum of operational financial and marketing management of hotel properties HAG works in every appropriate way to drive revenues A key element in HAGs management program is the focus on a comprehensive targeted sales and marketing effort to put heads in the bed VALUATION Some of the greatest corporations in America were created with a simple concept VHLD is currently under contract to acquire prime South Florida hotel properties that on average are occupied year round By partnering with a topnotch hotel management company leveraging off their expertise hope to increase the annual occupancy rate to over within years For example HAG became the management company for the Tides Hotel in South Beach Fl when it reopened after a major renovation By the end of the st year the Tides had an occupancy rate VHLD intends to acquire hotels by the end of calendar year that will be running at an annualized revenue rate in excess of MILLION DOLLARS These hotels assets will be in excess of MILLION DOLLARS VHLD intends to close on of the nine hotels by the end of this calendar year These three hotels are estimated to generate Million Dollars in revenues and Net Operating Income NOI of Million Dollars on assets of Million Dollars in VHLD intends to close on their st hotel within days When achieved this should become a significant milestone for VHLD as well as the stock The first hotel is called The Astor VHLD currently manages The Astor The Astor was originally built in and remodeled in VHLD is Buying The Astor for Million Dollars in a combination of cash and debt mortgage In year The Astor generated about Million in revenues and had approx Million NOI According to HAG based upon their projections using their management techniques HAG projects The Astors revenues to rise to Million and NOI to Million in In addition HAG projects that in all hotel acquisitions by VHLD a portion of the profits in the st year under their management will be reinvested back into the hotels for improvements Thereafter HAG projects NOI to approximate of revenues REMEMBER VHLD is currently acquiring only profitable hotels and looking to make them more profitable VHLD is currently trading near a week low VHLD has been working quietly on achieving its goal of increasing shareholder value There is hardly any news on VHLD and virtually no chat over on the Internet The Wizard believes this too might change shortly The Wizard believes that once VHLD closes on the Astor Hotel the story becomes a little bit more believable BUY ON THE RUMOR CONCLUSION One way to value a company is to look at its peers in the industry Within this group companies currently trade at about a discount to the SP index which equates to about x earnings Based on VHLD closing hotels by yearend and using HAGs forecast for profits of Million or cents per share If VHLD were to trade in the market at x earnings then this would equate to a stock price of per share DISCLAIMER Marketwizardalerts MWA publishes

Senators Pass The Presidents Growth Plan Date Tue Nov Congress and the President must act again to help our economy and to prevent the situation from worsening We must get our workers back to work and strengthen our businesses so that they can continue to be productive and hire more employees House Speaker Dennis Hastert to Congressional Republicans November In the aftermath of September our economy needs a boost President Bush and Members of Congress agree on the necessity of an economic stimulus package yet there has been no package passed by the Senate President Bush has proposed an economic stimulus package that provides needed assistance NOW without significant increases in unemployment state mandates and business taxes The President wants the Senate to pass a bill that focuses on job creation instead of creating new taxes on employers or new costs on states CALL YOUR SENATORS TODAY and tell them to support the Presidents economic growth plan Senator John Breaux DLA Phone Senator Mary Landrieu DLA Phone Please also take the time to FORWARD THIS MESSAGE to everyone you know who will help the President get the economy moving again To contact your Senators go here findsenatorsasp The debate over economic stimulus packages is plainly explained in a November th oped appearing in the Washington Post The President wants to create more jobs while the Senate democrats propose entitlements If you were unemployed which would you prefer Tax Cuts Are the Best Stimulus by R Glenn Hubbard The full article appears below and is reprinted at hubbardasp Tell your Senators TODAY that youd prefer job creation Sincerely Jack Oliver Deputy Chairman Republican National Committee Tax Cuts Are the Best Stimulus By R Glenn Hubbard Washington Post Friday November Page A With most indicators of economic production such as employment and purchasing showing further decline in October some have argued that President Bushs growth plan would have little stimulative effect They prefer the Senate Democrats plan on the grounds that spending is a better way to revive the economy Permit me to differ The presidents plan included in the stimulus plan passed by the House addresses the nations underlying economic problems If enacted the tax cuts will quickly deliver a boost to move the economy back toward its longrun growth path The plan it is estimated would result in more jobs and add half a percentage point to the growth rate Heres how tax cuts help stimulate the economy Tax cuts for individuals give them more money to spend and invest Tax cuts for business for three years long enough to have a serious effect would make investment less expensive so businesses would be encouraged to buy equipment increase production and expand employment It is a major fallacy to praise new spending plans as stimulus This ignores the fact that a dollar spent by the government is one fewer that can be spent by private businesses Furthermore new spending programs almost never go away and they lead to more inflexible regulation of the economy New spending programs are not only unlikely to make the economy grow they also are an undesirable response to terrorism risks Instead it is important to take advantage of the flexibility and innovation of the private sector This will reduce the negative effects on job growth as part of our necessary response to terrorism The real underlying economic problem is that the terrorist attacks took a direct toll on the economy and more important on the confidence of American households and firms The combined effect tipped a fragile rate of economic growth into negative territory But the attacks did not undermine longterm productivity growth so economic fundamentals remain strong The challenge is simply to restore the health of the economy quickly And Congress needs to do so in the way that will be most beneficial Assistance for dislocated workers is important and the president has already proposed an aggressive package to provide it But spending should not be confused with economic stimulus The basic source of uncertainty and loss of consumer confidence is fear over job loss and the fact is that additional spending even on unemployment insurance wont give people jobs Indeed the excessive expansion of unemployment insurance proposed by the Senate would actually increase unemployment because it would discourage job applicants from accepting new positions Moreover the Senate bill would err by raising taxes on employers exactly the wrong thing to do at this moment Until one addresses the underlying source of the uncertainty there will be no guarantee that hemorrhaging federal dollars will do any good Lower tax rates are the best way to create jobs and make large and small businesses grow Acceleration of future tax cuts which Congress has already chosen will help the economy Despite the repeated claim that only poor households will spend additional income evidence indicates almost all households spend about the same percentage of their tax cuts Business tax relief is essential because it encourages firms to expand investment and employment With tax cuts firms would be able to replace existing machines with more productive ones precisely the kind of change that frees up funds to hire more workers The economy needs help now The president wants to create more jobs while the Senate proposes new entitlements If you were unemployed which would you prefer The writer is chairman of the Presidents Council of Economic Advisers Reprinted by permission of the author Paid for by

mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR JAC Clubbers Updated McCardell caught six passes for yards against Baltimore He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith Sta ce y Mack mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB JAC Manchester United Updated Mack rushed for yards and two TDs and caught five passes for yards against the Ravens Despite his good outing Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency Qadry Ismail mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR BAL Team Sensitive Updated The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for yards Despite his quiet statistical performance Ismail remains a muststart player for any Fantasy team He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC Jason Brookins mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB BAL Free Ag ent Updated Brookins rushed for yards and two TDs at Jacksonville but also lost a fumble The rookie RB is talented but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now Ron Dayne mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB NYG Clubbers Updated Dayne carried the ball six times for yards against Oakland Dont depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season Tiki Barber mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB NYG Baton Rouge Idiot Updated Barber rushed for yards and a TD against Oakland and caug ht five passes for yards He has played well recently although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis LaDainian Tomlinson mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB SD Bees Updated Tomlinson was held out of the end zone but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless The rookie tailback had scrimmage yards including receptions in San Diegos loss Doug Flutie mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB SD Free Agent Updated Flutie had a solid game throwing for yards and two touchdowns against Arizona However hes only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage Jake Plummer mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB ARI Free Agent Updated Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday posting yards and a touchdown against San Diego Plummer who also threw two picks is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best David Boston mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR ARI Dirty Bastards Updated Boston had another outstanding game catching six passes for yards and a touchdown against San Diego H e s one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis Willie Jackson mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR NO Anorexic Drunks Updated Jackson had a good outing against New England catching five catches for yards and a touchdown He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver but he is worth starting in deeper leagues Joe Horn mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR NO Clubbers Updated Horn had another solid outing catching four passes for yards against New England Hes been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis Tyrone Wheatley mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB OAK Bees Updated In his return from a knee injury Wheatley carried the ball five times for yards Zack Crockett was used more often in shortyardage packages and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future Even when he is fully healthy he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner Antowain Smith mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB NE Baton Rouge Idiot Updated Smith had yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans After a slow start Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers Tom Brady mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB NE Free Agent Updated Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans posting yards passing and four touchdowns Hes become a pretty reliable Fantasy player and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots bench for another week Rich Gannon mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB OAK Mandeville Marriage Updated Gannon threw for yards three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants He ignored rainsoaked conditions and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football Frank Sanders mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR ARI Free Agent Updated Sanders left Sundays game against San Diego after reaggravating a hamstring injury He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins and did not return to the game Eric Moulds mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR BUF Clubbers Updated Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump catching six passes for yards and two TDs again st Miami He also lost a fumble and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year Dont be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance Alex Van Pelt mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB BUF Free Agent Updated Van Pelt had another fine game throwing for yards three TDs and one interception He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalos starting lineup Oronde Gadsden mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR MIA Free Agent Updated Gadsden caught eight passes for yards at Buffalo He did not catch a TD pass though and lost a fumble Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks Jay Fiedler mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB MIA Free Agent Updated Fiedler threw for yards three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB Donovan McNabb mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB PHI Bees Updated The Redskins held McNabb to passing yards and rushing yards with no TDs or interceptions Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance James Thrash mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR PHI Clubbers Updated Thrash caught four passes for yards against Washington He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach Rod Gardner mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR WAS Free Agent Updated Gardner caught four passes for only yards on Sunday The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestret ch KiJana Carter mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB WAS Free Agent Updated Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems He carried times for yards and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries Isaac Byrd mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR CAR Free Agent Updated Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammads absence catching five passes for yards in Carolinas loss to Atlanta Muhsin Muhammad mph tt WR CAR Manchester United Updated Muhammad missed Sundays game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury His status for next weekends game against New Orleans is unknown at this time Derrick Alexander mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR KC Mandeville Marriage Updated Alexander caught two passes for yards in his return from a rib injury He was not open often and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy Chris Chandler mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrand om key QB ATL Anorexic Drunks Updated Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday throwing for only yards against Carolina The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game which was the reason for Chandlers poor Fantasy numbers Derrick Alexander mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR KC Mandeville Marriage Updated Alexander caught two passes for yards in his return from a rib injury He was not open often and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy More Updates mpelinkscriptproplayerupdatesleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomstart Transactions View imagesnflnfltinygifMake Selection

some limited action during upcoming games He is not expected to play fulltime but this development means that C harlie Batch might lose some playing time hurting his overall Fantasy value Byron Chamberlain mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey TE MIN Clubbers Updated An MRI revealed a small cartilage tear in Chamberlains right knee but he is not expected to require surgery All signs point to him playing Monday against the Giants so feel free to use him this week Freddie Jones mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey TE SD Manchester United Updated The San Diego UnionTribune says Jones ankle has been advised against playing this week Results of an MRI exam are not available yet but Steve Heiden is expected to start in his place Tim Dwight mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR SD Free Agent Updated Dwight lung is doubtful for Sundays game He has not been very healthy when productive so dont count on him for much

expected to practice later in the week Hell like ly start his third consecutive game this weekend if Emmitt Smiths knee isnt percent by Friday Emmitt Smith mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB DAL Mandeville Marriage Updated Smith knee is listed as questionable for Sundays game against Philadelphia If he is unable to go Troy Hambrick

was only able to throw on the sidelines Tuesday but was expected to practice on Wednesday If he is unable to play Matt Lytle would likely make his second consecutive start Peyton Manning

start on Sunday Drew Bledsoe mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB NE Free Agent Updated Bledsoe has been cleared to play but Tom Brady will start against the Rams Bledsoe said he

guarantee Brady will hold onto the job past the Rams game OJ McDuffie mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR MIA Free Agent Updated McDuffie is ready to return to practice from the PUP list He will be eligible for activation on Dec but he may still miss the rest of the season Aaron Brooks mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB NO Clubbers Updated According to published reports many veterans on the New Orleans roster have expressed their displeasure with Brooks inconsistency this season The reports also stated that those same veterans would rather see Jeff Blake under center but that doesnt seem likely to happen The coaching staff feels as though Brooks has the talent to be a topnotch NFL quarterback so dont expect a change under center any time soon Cowboys mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey DT DAL Free Agent Updated Linebacker Dexter Coakley is expected to miss two weeks of action due to a sprained knee He suffered the injury during last weekends loss to Atlanta Dallas defense has played well but theyre an inconsistent unit from a Fantasy perspective Jon Hilbert sy nflcommpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey K NO Free Agent Updated Hilbert has been signed by the Dallas Cowboys and will serve as their starting kicker in Tim Seders absence Hilberts value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point however so dont bother picking him up outside of deeper leagues Tim Seder mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey K DAL Free Agent Updated Seder is expected to miss several weeks of action after injuring his ankle last Sunday against Atlanta The team has signed former New Orleans booter Jon Hilbert to take over the kicking duties in Dallas Rob Moore mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR ARI Free Agent Updated Moore who had hamstring surgery two weeks ago will begin some light running on Wednesday His status for the rest of the season is still unclear however so dont bother picking him up off the waiver wire Terry Hardy mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey TE ARI Free Agent Updated Hardy shoulder is expected to miss a few more weeks of action Unless you play in a very deep league holding onto him isnt advisable at this point Terry Allen mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodr ow sownerrandomkey RB BAL

mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey QB TEN Free Agent Updated McNair will wear a cast on his throwing hand for at least a day after aggravating an injury during Monday nights loss to Baltimore He had Xrays and other tests on his right hand Tuesday and coach Jeff Fisher said the results were negative But doctors found an apparent hairline break in McNairs thumb which he originally hurt last season in practice He is questionable for Sundays game We put him in a cast until tomorrow Wednesday Well see how he is with some soft tosses going with the hand Fisher said Ricky Watters mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey RB SEA Bees Updated According to the Seattle Times Watters is expected to return from his shoulder injury in two weeks However he is not guaranteed to reclaim the starting running back job with Shaun A lexander performing so well We recommend you hold onto both players until it becomes clear which one will get the starts over the second half of the season although were betting it will be Alexander Rod Smith mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR DEN Dirty Bastards Updated Smith predicted Monday that he will be able to return from a sprained right ankle in time for Sundays game against Washington If he cant go Keith Poole would become Denvers top receiving option with Chris Cole Scottie Montgomery and Kevin Kasper also filling in However Poole is already expected to replace Eddie Kennison as the teams second wideout Edd ie Kennison mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR DEN Free Agent Updated Kennison returned to the Broncos Monday and informed them that he is unretiring according to the Denver Post While this is a radical turnaround from his message of retirement over the weekend he might not be welcomed back by the team as a result of his change of decision It is unclear whether Kennison will be placed on the reservesuspended list or reinstated to the roster but either way its highly unlikely he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the remainder of the season Drop him Cameron Cleeland mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey TE NO Team Sensitive Updated According to published reports Cleeland wont be available for Sundays game against Indianapol is His high ankle sprain still hasnt healed sufficently so look for Boo Williams and Lamont Hall to get the majority of the playing time in his absence Santana Moss mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR NYJ Free Agent Updated Moss is expected to make his season debut Sunday against Miami He has been sidelined all season with a knee injury but is listed as probable for Sundays game Wayne Chrebet mpelinkscriptplayersleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey WR NYJ Free Agent Updated Chrebet is expected to

Garcia mpelinkscriptmpplayernewsleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey Active QB Updated Garcia made it through another game using a brace to protect his sprained knee and had no problems afterwards Head Coach Steve Mariucci is optimistic that Garcia will be able to play without the brace soon Edgerrin James mpelinkscriptmpplayernewsleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey Reserve RB Updated James will miss at least two more games with a knee injury James practiced late in the week after his injury but felt some swelling and stiffness in his left knee Further tests showed ligament damage Our doctors felt it was appropriate to shut him down for another two or three weeks Colts president Bill Polian said Monday Theyre not certain what the severity is Some published reports say James might miss the rest of the season Lamar Smith mpelinkscriptmpplayernewsleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey Active RB Updated The Colts defense held Smith to yards on carries Rookie Travis Minor rushed for yards and a TD yards and now there will be rampant speculation that Smith might be fading as a Fantasy player Garrison Hearst mpelinkscriptmpplayernewsleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey Reserve RB Updated Hearst had solid game against New Orleans compiling scrimmage yards on Sunday He seems to have established himself as San Franciscos featured back in recent weeks which is keeping Kevan Barlows Fantasy value at a minimum Muhsin Muhammad mpelinkscriptmpplayernewsleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey Reserve WR Updated Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game catching six passes for yards against St Louis If the quarterback situation in Carolina doesnt improve however Muhammad could have a tough time being productive the rest of the season Marvin Harrison mpelinkscriptmpplayernewsleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey Active WR Updated Harrison scorched the Dolphins for nine receptions yards and three TDs No defense is the league can contain Harrison when he plays in front of the home crowd Dominic Rhodes mpelinkscriptmpplayernewsleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey Active RB Updated Rhodes left Sundays game in the first quarter with a dislocated left shoulder He was replaced by Kevin McDougal and returned in the second quarter Vinny Testaverde mpelinkscriptmpplayernewsleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey Reserve QB Updated The Kansas City defense is definitely vulnerable to the pass but the Jets havent been throwing the ball enough to please Fantasy leaguers Dont start Testaverde unless your team is very thin at QB Tim Brown mpelinkscriptmpplayernewsleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey Active WR Updated Brown caught three passes for yards against the Seahawks in the teams first meeting this year He should perfom better if Seattle pays more attention to Jerry Rice two TDs in first meeting in this weeks matchup Jay Riemersma mpelinkscriptmpplayernewsleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey Active TE Updated Riemersma had five catches for yards and a touchdown in Sundays game against Indianapolis He has put up decent yardage numbers for a tight end but the TD against the Colts was his first of the season Matt Stover mpelinkscriptmpplayernewsleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey Active K Updated Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he will be able to kick field goals according to published reports The injury isnt considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs Germane Crowell mpelinkscriptmpplayernewsleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey Injured WR Updated The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee which ends his season Deuce McAllister mpelinkscriptmpplayernewsleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey Reserve RB Updated McAllister rushed for yards on carries all in the first half had a yard punt return in the second half and caught four passes for yards during Saturdays preseason finale That was probably the best hes run the whole year Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett said I dont think hes where he should be yet but were just starting to see what he can do While McAllister wont be the Saints starting running back likely at all this season he might be a good insurance policy for Ricky Williams owners in Fantasy leagues Packers mpelinkscriptmpplayernewsleaguelilwoodrowsownerrandomkey Active DT Updated The Packers signed free agent defensive tackle James Grier on Wednesday and released defensive tackle Carl Bradley Bradley had arthroscopic knee surgery Tuesday and would have been unavailable to the team for an unspecified amount of time Morten Andersen
