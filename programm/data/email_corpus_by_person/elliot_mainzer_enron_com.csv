wanted to fire off an email to you to summarize current commercial activities on the Renewable Power Desk I appreciate all the work you guys are doing and feel as though were really gaining some traction Green Power Market Development Group We will be submitting a proposal to the Wind Energy Working Group of the Green Power Market Development Group headed by Mark Crowdis of Think Energy on Tuesday with a variety of prici ng proposals for products ranging from physical commodity with green tags t o green tags with embedded call options Richard and I are working together to develop pricing for tags in the Pac Northwest California Texas and th e East I feel good about our chances of getting something done with these guys as they are feeling the heat to do something concrete after making so many public declarations of intent As we move forward I think we should a ll do a lot of thinking about other companies we should approach for this t ype of product Once the Enron Building is juiced with wind power we will be able to approach other fortune companies with a straight face and en courage them to become Green Power Alliance Customers During the week of S eptember I plan to be in Houston to work extensively on drawing up the guidelines for the Alliance Program and working more closely with Richard a nd Stacey and their EES contacts to develop green power products for upstr eam marketing and new origination efforts Los Angeles Department of Water and Power LADWP is the largest green pow er buyer among public power agencies in California Their green power buyer is heavily understaffed and somewhat outgunned in terms of industry knowl edge He has hired us to help him bring his contract negotiations to fruit ion manage logistics for new projects and essentially sleeve new renewable power products through Enrons existing Master Services Agreement with LAD WP This is an exciting although not very profitable at this point opport unity to establish the nodes of the California Renewable Power Pool and we see this as a way to bring our Services Desk functions to bear on the renew able sector in California I am meeting with FPL Energy next week to discus s becoming the logistics coordinator for their new wind projects in Califor nia Wind Development As you may know I purchased an option on a large parce l of windy land in Central Washington with enXco a wind development concer n We are marketing the project to two of the munis in the Pacific Northwes t Seattle City Light and Eugene Water and Electric Board Both have expre ssed interest This morning I am meeting with the City of Portland to try t o convince Portland to follow Seattles lead as a zerocarbon growth city a nd signatory to the type of Kyotoesque committments recently announced by N ew England legislators Renewable Portfolio Standard The proposed CA RPS has major implications for our business from both a risk management and commercial opportunity pe rspective We need to really drill down on this today and get as much insig ht as to the political climate as possible Having witnessed the first meet ing of the California Power Authority last Friday in Sacramento I am perso nally convinced that the RPS will definitely be passed in some shape or for m If they pass a requirement for new renewables next year this transla tes into MWm off a MW peak load in CA We have very good working r elationships with several of the biomass generators in California includin g generators with new resources and we are actively negotiating a marketin g agreement with one of them and considering taking a long position for the next couple of years The critical question of course is who will actual ly have the short position in California If it is just the DWR then they will probably satisfy their requirement with their new renewables purchases If the utilities end up serving load they will be in the market looking for the leastcost resources and new biomass will clearly be a part of the mix Pac Northwest RFPs Both PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric have RF Ps out right now for green tags and retail marketing services I am staying in touch with Bonneville Environmental Foundation Green Mountain Energy a nd Community Energy to act as a wholesaler for their tag submissions I wan t to get master services contracts in place with each of these entities to make it really easy for them to transact with us We can use our market leg s to get wellpriced tags and then sell to them as they shoot for RFP succe sses Bonneville Environmental at a minimum will need new biomass to blen d in with their expensive wind energy tags Chicago Most of you probably met Mike Lindert at our Houston Renewables meeting earlier this month He was the EES originator for the ComEd deal a nd as you know there is a significant renewable committment in Chicago We need to get in front of the City of Chicago as soon as possible to talk ab out their next generation of renewable purchases Stacey I belive you have info on this Sustainable Products Training The Renewable Power Desk has donated RECs and CO offsets for the Sustainable Products Training in Austin September They are giving us lots of press and would like one or two of us t o attend If you are interested in heading up there for a day with me plea se let me know There should be a pretty good turnout among potential comme rcial and industrial customers Kinkos All indications are that our negotiations with Kinkos are going very well The hope is to sell them a threeyear fixedprice retail product and wind tags Richard and I are woking to source the tags Success w ill be huge as Kinkos is part of the Green Power Market Development Group I know that Richard and Stacey have other deals on the table and Jesse has been busy working on finalizing our services deal with Edwards Air Force B ase I look forward to seeing you guys in Houston the week of September and taking the next steps in formalizing our green product offerings Talk to you soon EM Elliot Mainzer Renewable Power Desk Enron North America SW Salmon St WTC Portland OR FX CL

Winston Goodbody PM To cc Subject Update from First Leg Hi All Heres a preview of a story that should be going up on our site soon Win DDDDDD Greater Yellowstone Ski Traverse Update for Leg South Pass to Cora By Win Goodbody The weather gods must have been in a good mood Maybe they had a good New Years party On previous trips to the Wind River Range I had grown accustomed to spending large blocks of time in the tent waiting for storm after storm to subside If one of every two days was suitable for venturin g outside I considered it a bit of luck But this time was different In the middle of January we enjoyed an amazing consecutive days of good weather for our mile ski traverse of the Wind River Range The drive south toward Lander WY revealed an alarming lack of snow both i n the mountains and lower down where we hoped to start This has not been a good winter so far in the Yellowstone region and we wondered what conditions would be like in the Wind Rivers Luckily with the final gain in elevation as we neared the Continental Divide and South Pass enough coverage materialized for us to ski away from the car We had day packs an d pound sleds Starting out with an approach of several days across lowlands was an interesting way to ease into the trip Instead of driving right up to the base of the mountains we had to work a little bit to get there Even though we were on open range with scattered trees this was some of the trickiest route finding we would encounter anywhere on the route Steepsided drainages and minigorges suddenly appeared in the otherwise mildly rolling terrain requiring detours and delays For a few days we thrashed across the prairie landscape moving toward distant peaks that didnt seem to be getting much closer The or inches of snow on the ground were completely rotten and our movement was half skiing half snowshoeing Each step sank to the ground and ski tips snagged in exposed sage brush When we came upon a perfectly groomed but empty Continental Divide Snowmobile trail we took advantage of it to quickly reach the Little Sandy drainage our entrance to the mountains We were by now settling into our routines relearning winter camping skills dividing repetitive tasks and adjusting to the cold With only about hours of daylight our schedule was remarkably busy It was a struggle to get moving by each morning even though we got up at Lunchtime arrive d immediately Just as quickly the sun dipped behind a peak and it was time to make camp After eating dinner we scurried into our down bags for a hour sleep The days flew by and we focused on putting miles beneath the sleds while the good weather lasted not knowing it would last indefinitely We were comfortable but every waking moment was occupied and there was n o time for relaxing We seemed to be always on the move The price to be paid for clear sunny days is clear cold nights and about a week into the range when we were up above feet nearly all the time we had our first taste of real cold It was the night we camped in the Cirque of the Towers and we were in our floorless cook tent We had excavated a basement a few feet down to the ice of Lonesome Lake Except for the entranceway all the sides of the tent were flush with the snow surface and with both stoves going it was pleasantly warm inside After dinner as we sat reading I sensed some sort of change Then I knew what it was Searing cold air was draining into the tent and spilling across the floor like a poisonous gas You could feel it cool your face try to get inside your clothes turn your water bottle into a frozen brick I imagined my candle snuffing out refusing to burn at such an obscene temperature I went outside to check my key chain thermometer under a sky of blazing stars The cheap gadget was maxed out It was at least F The cold was like a deafening air raid siren There was no escaping it That same cold was to stay with us most nights and mornings for the next or days In the evening before going to bed I would check the thermometer All the red fluid was huddled in the ball at the bottom too scared to try for a run up toward the numbers It was the same each morning The daily temperature swings were tremendous We would go from F or lower to F in a matter of hours in the morning The warm midday sun was always a relief but it didnt last Our joy at being ab le to ski along in just a shirt was tempered by the knowledge we would soon be wearing every layer of clothing we possessed In the evenings as soon as the sun went down the temperature headed south with merciless speed Deep cold is to the sense of touch what the Grand Teton or Old Faithful or a radiant sunrise are to the sense of sight It is truly an amazing natural phenomenon to be reckoned with We marveled at it again and again this thing you cannot see or hear or smell It is both beautiful and horrifying an undeniably authentic experience that leaves an imprint on your memory but with luck not on your toes or fingers It might be hard to explain why it is a fascinating spectacle to behold but there is no denying that it is As the days went by we became students of this strange invisible force But of course we still got cold every day Our good weather continued and we knocked off high pass after high pass on our voyage north Some days we even crossed two passes and multiple drainages For mid winter we were really moving fast With so little sno w on the ground at least we were not delayed by having to worry about avalanches Without consciously deciding to do so we were in fact traveling harder during the day stopping later each night and spending less time readying a good camp More and more we were going flat out all day and then just collapsing at night to wake the next morning and do it again Our traverse was imperceptibly developing all the classic symptoms of what I have come to know as a death march Though a death march typically occurs at the end of a tour when the desire to exit is so strong it can make you g o all day or all night without thinking of the consequences a death march ca n also occur at any time during a trip For example if you discover you havent brought enough food you might need to go full bore for days on e nd Or maybe you hear a storm is coming and decide to turn on the after burner to reach a safe haven Probably the defining characteristic of a death march is that you never intend to get into one to begin with But there comes a point when like an investigator you step back for a minute examine the evidence of your daily life and it suddenly dawns on you that a death march is in full swing and you are powerless to stop it The horror The horror At the outset of the leg we were putting in good days because we wanted to get up into the high peaks where the real trip would begin Once we were there we wanted to put in some good days while the weather lasted to make some progress before the inevitable endless blizzard that would surely descend After we had been going about days and did some math based on the miles we had covered and what still lay ahead we realized that we woul d not have time to exit as we had originally planned In fact even after cutting off some substantial passes and distance it was still going to be all we could do to make it out in the time allotted So we decided to put in more good days We always had a reason for not resting for going hard day after day One night while thawing my foot out over the stove I realized we were not going to have a single rest day We were going for it We had gotten sucked in We were on a death march The long days alone would have been manageable but we had a growing proble m that was interfering with our ability to recover and rest each night Our sleeping bags were filling with ice which impaired their ability to loft and hence insulate us This is a common problem in extreme cold As you sleep you radiate moisture and heat The moisture passes through your sleeping bag and escapes into the air When it is very cold however the temperature difference between the air inside your bag and the air outside is too great for moisture to pass through the bags outer skin As moisture goes to move that last millim eter from the comfortable F temperature inside the bag to the outside air it gets walloped with a degree temperature difference lets say it s F out Instead of escaping the moisture freezes on the inside of the bag s outer shell This problem seems to be worse with high tech laminate materials designed to impede the flow of moisture usually rain into the bag from the outside This is a cumulative condition and gets worse each day as another night s moisture is added to what is already frozen in the bag Unless the bag is thawed out and dried there is no solution and you will reach a point wher e all insulating qualities have been lost and you are better of just sleeping on your insulated pad in your clothes We had already taken to wearing mos t of our clothes inside our sleeping bags and this just barely worked Still more and more of each night was spent tossing and desperately huddling into some new contorted position in an attempt to avoid feeling th e hideous cold of yet another clear night As light at the end of the tunnel appeared our daytime efforts reached a fever pitch Day miles Day miles Day miles Day miles And these were by no means easy flat miles They were trailbreaking miles up and down passes all above feet Reaching th e entrance to Titcomb Basin we veered northwest toward the origin of the Green River at Peak Lake Originally we had planned to go north from Titcomb past Gannett Peak as far as Downs Mountain the last peak above feet in the Winds before falling off to the west down Roaring Fork eventually reaching the Green River drainage But because of time low snow and a desire to live we had altered our course to head directly down the Green Going over the top at Cube Rock Pass we caught a glimpse thousands of feet down the Green River drainage The end was near but we were still looking at another two days to get to Green River Lakes campground where we hoped to solicit a snowmobile ride for the remaining miles to our car in Cora The view down the upper Green as it plummets from near Peak Lake is shocking We silently gazed miles down a classic deeply carved thickl y forested valley wedged between impassable rocks walls Toward their northern end the Winds turn into a series of high broad plateaus above feet and the chief difficulty exiting is finding some way down Many of the drainages that cut this plateau are gorges sheer cliffs or other features unfriendly to ski tourers with sleds As we had changed our exit route we had not gone all the way north to the real plateaus But even here getting down was going to take some doing Day was the first time we allowed that most cruel of thoughts to enter our minds perhaps this was the day we would get out Eating pizza in Jackson tonight Sleeping indoors not encased in an ice tomb No more holding frozen body parts over an open flame Perhaps We slowly suffered up Vista Pass where the summer trail leaves the Green River for about miles and descends a neighboring creek I had got into the habit over the last few days of proclaiming that some feature or other was really goin g to be the last uphill Usually as soon as this sentence hit the air we wo uld round a corner to glimpse another uphill ahead But I was undeterred by past failed prophecies and once again suggested to Joe that this is it He said nothing Whereas early in the trip I felt strong and had been happy to break trail for hours at a time the death march and lack of sleep had taken their toll and the wheels were coming off I had no enthusiasm for leading I felt like the walking dead and just wanted to follow my eyes locked on a track in front of me legs trudging on automatic pilot But as I grew weaker Jo e became unstoppable He was increasingly pulling the boat over the final days and I was happy to let him Especially going downhill though tricky steep sections he raced far ahead Perhaps it was a desire to escape my singing that drove him forward I sang many pop songs past and present but refused to sing Neil Diamond Joes favorite artiste As this dispu ted issue festered Joe seemed eager to put more and more distance between the two of us As it turns out Vista Pass really was the last uphill and now it was time to go down After a few hours of easy traversing we lost the trail and decided to descend a steeply falling stream choked with enormous boulders Seemed like a good idea at the time I guess Joe was in front skiing straight downstream and stopping only for the most absurd drops He was soon out of sight Following his track was a bit of an eye opener It fel t like the cartoon where you come upon a set of ski tracks that split around a tree In leather boots and telemark bindings with a large sled Joe was sticking and foot drops I stared in disbelief at the smooth sled trac k that went over the top of a boulder then straight down for a few feet the n continued on I had more solid AT gear but there was no way I was doing that I was sure Id break a ski Later Joe confided that the way hed been able to descend these boulder s was to surf down sloughs of snow As he went over the tops of rocks snow would slide off and cushion his descent and landing But as the second guy down the course I enjoyed none of this extra padding It was all gone Instead of using the Hartney straightline method I tried side stepping dow n from the top of the boulder turning my skis perpendicular to the fall line that my sled wanted so desperately to follow at great speed It didnt work too well Shorn of most of their snow the boulders it turned out were covered with glare ice Again and again I would be just about to take the final step down when my skis would slip I fell over my skis downhill faceplanting in the stream bed The sled then crashed on top of me I struggled to release skis and waist belts Once I had to get out my shovel and dig to find a pole that went astray in a particularly juicy fall To make matters worse I was getting wet from these repeated snow baths Some time during this carefree afternoon I looked down and noticed that where the solid metal tow bars of my sled connected to the plastic hull there was a grave problem The connection points were tearing away from th e body and threatened to come off altogether When and if that happened I would be reduced to fashioning a rope and stick contraption to bind the sle d to my body I shuddered to think what such a caveman era contraption might do to our progress and tried to face plant less often on the rest of my stream run At last the track I was following left the creek and I thrashed down into dense woods where I found Joe looking at the map and having a snack It looked like hed been there for quite a while I waited for some sign f rom him that maybe the creek had been kind of tough Nothing I acted nonchalant That was fun Yeah Joe said I broke my sled it looks like I countered Oh really Finally I had to ask Did you fall at all back there What He was looking at the map Oh no I did have to slow down at one point though Here Id spent the last hour egg beatering down the creek like someone just introduced to skis And Joe had to slow down once The poor kid Needless to say we didnt make it out that day But we did make it to the valley floor Flat ground at last Now I could claim that there would be no more uphill or downhill But all was not yet goodness and light and we soon found ourselves wallowing in some of the worst snow imaginable Deepe r than the snow we had battled through at South Pass it exhibited the same general characteristics Deeply rotten and unsupportable yet dense and heavy it was nearly impossible to move through We were snowshoeing again pulling our ski tips out of the snow at each step and stepping on the surface only to sink down a foot Pure hell Too spice up what promised to be hours and possibly days of fun battling our way out I decided to make a quick sight seeing trip to the other side of the Green River After plunging through the ice and almost losing a ski in the swift flowing current I reluctantly came back across and started sloshing down the trail like a good boy My skins were now coated with ice which removed any possibility of sliding on them Oh well That night we made a fire and fe d it with prehistoric glee which somewhat warmed our outlook and dried my boots But we still werent out Day Joe and I dont need to verbalize this but its just sort o f understood that there is absolutely no way we are not making it out today No chance of not getting out today Nope I mean zero chance We even ge t up in the dark for an early start to ensure that no matter what the day may throw at us earthquakes volcanic eruptions meteors etc we are still making it out As I flee the ice bag I notice its only F down here in the sultry valley Even though he broke trail most of yesterday Joe is out in front again The snow is worse than ever Somehow even with a trail to follow I can t really keep up I occupy myself with bitter frivolous Well at least were not getting attacked by a moose kind of thoughts I look arou nd for some small forest creature to curse at Anything to divert attention from the pain in my feet and legs Damn pikas Bloody chipmunks But there s nothing about Staggering along I feel almost like a third party to our plight like Im watching it on tv Tra la la This is pretty fun I l ie to myself But our suffering pays off We come upon a lake Could this be Green Rive r Lakes We consult the map Surely there must be some mistake I wait for Joe to inform me that weve made a wrong turn and are actually in northe rn British Columbia hundreds of miles from the nearest road But no As if a ramp of light had descended from parted clouds to our feet the lake lies there like a highway Trumpets are sounding Angels are fluttering above motioning us forward Not only will trail breaking be easier we now have certifiable proof that we are only miles from Green River Lakes campground a snowmobiling mecca Its only about pm and clear and su nny Surely there will be hundreds of people out on a day like this even if i t is a Tuesday We have visions of having to fight back hordes of attractive female snowmachiners all clamoring to be the ones who will give us a ride back to Cora miles distant Well probably need flak jackets We pick up the pace Or rather Joe picks up the pace Apparently he think s he may still have a good chance of competing in some nordic events in the Olympics in Salt Lake because hes going down the lake like a rock et Hes not even going in a straight line Hes swerving all over the p lace going like a madman for the finish line He doesnt care because WE ARE GETTING OUT TODAY One thing I do have going for me is that I can plot a straight course for the point where we will exit the first lake so I regai n some time We cross the first lake There are ski tracks in the snow Humans At the second lake where the wilderness boundary ends I am about as happy as I have ever been to see snowmobile tracks all over the place But strangely ominously no machines At pm we are at the campground Snowmobile tracks everywhere Its j ust a matter of time I tell myself Theyll be here We reach the far end of the campground where the road heads off for Cora and do some gear rearranging readying ourselves for that magic ride We scatter things all over the road effectively blockading it Nobody is getting by here withou t picking us up The sun is still shining and its downright warm As a little joke I take my sleeping bag out and set it on a tarp to begin the drying process which I imagine will really kick into gear in about three hours when were back in Joes living room in Jackson and have turned up the thermostat to about F Just a bit of fun putting the bag out like this I mean its not like were going to need the thing tonight Total silence Wonder where they are these bilers Must be a local tradition to stop at this time each afternoon for a moment of silence or something We start getting a little upset Almost indignant Dont t hese people know how to have fun Where are they A day this beautiful and noones out on their machines Where is everyone off cross country ski ing or something Suns going down now For gods sake WHERE ARE THEY And then just as faint as the sound of a mosquito we hear it A little buzz Was that the wind No I still hear it Could it be a plane Buzz Buzz Buzzzzzzz No sound could be more soothing more friendly more welcome at that moment than this the sound of not one but several two stroke engines heading our way We finally crack Screams high fives arms raised Hysteria release W e knew it We knew wed make it out tonight Victory is ours We are go ing to live After a minute or two I realize that maybe if I stop shouting and set about repacking the crap Ive strewn all over the road well look a little more appealing A little more like someone these gracious heroic goodnatured bilers will want to pick up I lower my arms wipe the te ars off my face and start jamming the ice bag back into its stuff sack We start cleaning up In an instant we are already mentally back in Jackson Back in town Back indoors As if transported by a futuristic machine we are no longer at a remote trailhead miles away from a town o f maybe people in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming We are home We are warm We are about to have dinner Joes in the shower Im checki ng my email Beam me up Scotty For some reason the bilers there are of them have stopped almost a mile short of our little shanty town and have turned off their machines Now that doesnt look good The sun has just gone behind a peak and in abo ut minutes the temperature will go into freefall We cant imagine why anyone would come the miles out here and not go all the way to the lake which is on the other side of us Theyre probably playing a game of rockpaperscissors to decide who will be the lucky two to host us on the ride back but we are sure not taking any chances Maybe they just haven t seen us Before I can suggest that hed probably enjoy some brisk skiin g after such a slack days Joe has stripped off his skins and is skating down the road toward our motorized friends to make sure all is well with uh you know the pickup and the ride back and everything I get out my telephoto lens to watch and maybe document this historic meeting Im sure that as soon as he gets the aok Ill be hearing a lot of noise from Joe I imagine the bilers responses You skied mil es from where Good lord son you get on the back of this machine and were go ing back to my place for a full blown steak dinner right now Here Ill ju st call ahead and get that in the works Now wait just a minute there Bill Who said were going to your place Were having it at my house Jimmy over my dead body Were going to my house and were havi ng a dinner and dance and then were taking them to Vegas for a week And i f anyone else tries to contribute one penny to the expense theres going to be a fight Its all on me Sorry Bobby but its just not going to be like that at all Were going to my place were eating for two days and then Im taking them to meet the Governor before we head to Acapulco for a week And Ill be damned if my two daughters arent coming with us I start to get a warm fuzzy feeling These are my people Im determined to try snowmobiling as soon as possible Maybe even convert Screw this skiing stuff I want horsepower I start singing as I pack up my sled The first sign of trouble is when the four riders start their machines and set off headed toward me But Joe remains standing in place like a fence post Hes not moving at all I figure hes just so bowled over by all the outlandish offers of hospitality weve received that hes wondering h ow were going to be able to make it out of Cora in less than a week What with all the parades barbecues snowmobiling with the mayor square dances and motivational talks at the high school we may have to push back the nex t leg of our Yellowstone traverse by at least a few days Here come the bilers Joe is still doing his frozen in place routine This does not look good I reluctantly clear a path to let the four riders through our barricade Well they may be getting to the lake I think but they cant get out The most worrisome thing is that they do not stop to talk to me and only one even waves No eye contact at all Thats alright I think Out of consideration for us theyre hurrying as fast as they can to get a glimp se of the lake and then theyre going to zip back and get us Well tal k back at their place They just dont want us to spend a single additional mi nute outside How kind of them Thats why they didnt stop Then it hits me The music stops the needle goes screeching across the record Were in trouble here Something is terribly terribly wrong This is just not how people who are about to bring us home to feast with their extended family should be acting Joe is moving now at least He ha s taken his skis off and is walking back toward me at a very slow speed I shout to him Well No response Joe JOE I re peatedly shout at him as he approaches within yards Hes not answering God this lo oks bad I instantly readjust my internal fun meter from being back in Jackson watching tv to Defcon Ive been yanked out of the shower and Im at the North Pole having just been given the news that the pickup flight is not coming and we have to make the mile trek home by dogsled And we don t have any sled dogs so well be using marmots instead Its pretty cl ear we are not getting a ride back with the boys Joe confirms this with very few words when he arrives The party consisted of a Wyoming guide and three clients from Michigan The guide mumbled some bologna about how he could lose his license if anyone saw him giving us a ride Joe kind of tried to laugh this one off at first but then realized the guy was serious He did not want to help us who knows why This outcome was so unexpected and so incomprehensible to us that we just sat there at first It was like a truck coming across someone in the Sahara Desert Sorry Id love to pick you up but you might put your feet on the dash and smudge the leather Would any skier coming across a broken do wn snowmobiler miles from the road refuse to help refuse to lend a hand in any way We couldnt fathom this Where was the back country fellowshi p the shared camaraderie of a couple of hearty souls out in Wyomings wildness Sorry It wasnt there this time We were crushed The previously valiant ambassadors of world peace and brotherhood now hateful bubbleheaded practitioners of an idiotic environmentally damagin g sport came roaring back from the lake on their gas pigs I stared at them menacingly They did not stop Good thing for them We spent minutes on tirades and diatribes best not recalled in print and then we got out ou r pathetic list of options We had already gone about miles that day I dont know about Joe but after straight days of going for it I was a mess It was pm Another miles separated us from the car and salvation We could either camp and continue in the morning or keep going a little further until dark Or of course we could commit to the grand finale death march We decided on the death march We would eat dinner pack it up and go until we got to the car Just another miles It wouldnt be so bad A rational person might have pointed out that we were looking at a mile da y and night but our thinking was not exactly sharp as a laser From step I knew it was a mistake for me but Joe definitely had the fire for getting out We set off at nearly full speed with evening coming on and rich alpenglow coating all peaks in sight Every step hurt Every minute I wanted to stop I lasted about an hour before seriously considering stopping for the night Another key characteristic of the death march is that one person wants to do it and the other really doesnt but just goe s along with it It was clear who was in which role This was sort of a new experience for me for I usually played the guy trying to get the other to keep going Not this time I knew Joe was not going to be happy when he heard I wanted to stop For a seeming eternity I heard myself mouthing the words I think we sh ould stop But I held on Just another step Take another step and see ho w it felt It felt bad My feet were on fire My legs were slightly numb down the sides I was hobbling I felt about as comfortable on skis as Woody Allen But the worst thing was that we had no way to measure our progress We did not recognize the route could not assess how much farther had no landmarks It could be another hour or another I had myself convinced we could ski four miles an hour By that math we should be able to reach Cora in time for last call Or at least in time to round up an angry mob o f torchbearing villagers to go hunt down the four bilers who were guilty of crimes against humanity and must pay Darkness Temperature down to a cheery F Real heat wave here in t he shadow of the Wind River Range Its another clear windless night on t he range as we slowly painfully make our way out of the mountains The ice hard road crunches under our skis Dead silence otherwise At last the pyschological brutality of simply not knowing how much longer breaks me an d hours into the death march even though I have convinced myself we must be half way I mouth the words Im not asking Im telling As sel fish as that may be I cant go on I know Joe is severely displeased but he agrees silently and we stop to set up the tent In minutes we are huddling in the ice bags praying for warmth Looking back I am amazed we survived as long as we did on the trip with ou r sleeping bags considering the state they were in Usually the bag is a saf e house a place to go when all else goes wrong a place to retreat to But in our case it was the opposite Because the weather was so perfect the days were our sanctuary the place we could recover from our torment in the bags and get warm again Had it not been for the perfect weather we could not have lasted But we managed to just barely hang on and tolerate our sleeping bags as they became of less and less use each day Until they were of no use whatsoever Inside the tent we are both thrashing around in our bags fully clothed I put on my down jacket inside the bag for the first time Luckily we both have down pants which we have been wearing to sleep for more than a week The bags are doing more harm than good at this point but we dont really get that The thought does nt occur to us to try sleeping without the bags Its obvious that neither one of us is asleep or headed anywhere remotely near sleep For the first time on the trip I am not satisfactorily warm at night I can survive but it i s not going to be comfortable Maybe wed be better off going for the car I cant face that unknown quantity Another hours More I realize we are looking at a sleepless night hours of waiting for the sun to come back around After an hour Joe announces he cant sleep and wants to keep going He s wet and cold and getting worse in the ice bag We talk about it and decide he will go for the car and I will stay the night continuing at first light The thought of getting out of the bag cold as it is putting on frozen boots hitching up the sled and continuing almost makes me want to get physically ill but Joe still has something left He departs at pm back out into the cold clear Wyoming night I drift in and out of sleep I actually do attain some warmth but somehow I am also getting wet Must have slipped off my pad Dont care I am cramped and crippled a few limbs need blood but rolling over acts like a huge vacuum that takes away any heat I have so I lie still My watch says am when I check it Only another few hours and Ill be on my way I eve n consider getting up right then and continuing but dont I think of Joe and the brutal death march he must have faced or might still be facing Hope he makes it I drift off again am I hear a noise Sounds like an engine Its not a snowmobile Not highpitched enough Sounds like a car In the space of one minut e I go from sleeping to wide awake and out of the ice bag I know exactly whats happened and I am ecstatic Its Joe He has driven the car back down the snowmobile trail to get me Bugles are sounding and the cavalry i s thundering over the hill flags all around No time is spent wondering exactly how Joe got the car here Before he has it turned around I am out of the tent and furiously packing my sled We have the tent down and my gear in the car in under five minutes I slip under skis and sled poles into the passenger seat and want to cry when I feel the heat blast from inside Joes had the heater on high for hours We head off with music playing and Joe hands me a glazed donut The contrast is too stark It cant be real I keep waiting to wake up in northern Iceland with the tent blown to shreds and our bags frozen hard as coffins But I am awake and we are homeward bound at last Joe happily relates his tale like hes telling me who won the Super Bowl and I look for a bullet to bite down on to stop my screams He left the tent to resume the death march at pm We figured we were half way so he was looking at another two or three hours at most More than five hours after leaving the tent close to am Joe reached the car It started Just the thought of going that long not knowing whether it might have been another five hours is too much for me to consider Suddenly all my past death march experiences were transformed into happy jaunts in the country with birds chirping in comparison with Joes saga After starting the car Joe made for a local convenience store and stocking up on junk food and coffee then returned to the trailhead At Green River Lakes we had joked how the snowmobile trail was hard enough to drive on Noticing there was no gate between the parking lot and trail Joe eased his Ford Escort up onto the trail The car didnt sink in at all He kept going and was soon whizzing down the trail So how far was it from the tent to the car Did you measure I asked miles With the heater on full and early morning of our th day starting to show itself in the rosy eastern sky we point the car toward a breakfast of eggs bacon and pancakes We had gotten away with murder and we knew it Never in our wildest dreams could we have hoped for such good weather We had done nothing to deserve it But with this unprecedented window thrown open to us we had breached the Wind River Ranges defenses and squeaked thro ugh In January Joe pops in a Neil Diamond tape and starts singing along Ive got some things to learn from this guy Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer

Goodbody AM To cc Subject Leg Update Hi Here is my update from our second leg Not quite as thorough as the first one Im afraid but were going to be saving our better writing for venues other than the web site Pictures should go up on the site soon yellowstonehtml Win DDD Greater Yellowstone Ski Traverse Update for Leg Cora to Jackson The Unbearable Lightness of Skiing By Win Goodbody Joe and I were in good spirits after the first leg It was a perfect opene r to our winter in Greater Yellowstone Despite the brutal cold and a marathon exit day it was on the whole an enjoyable time Perhaps too enjoyable After almost days back in town mending gear mind and body we departed for our second leg in the Gros Ventre Range with a cavalier attitude Though we had budgeted or days for this traverse we now thought it might take only a week But we were wrong Instead of a walk i n the park the Gros Ventres were a lesson in how slow and difficult progress can be when the weather turns bad We were sternly reminded that in adverse conditions the mountains hold all the cards We traded sleds for packs on this mile trip from Cora to Jackson It ha d been a long time since I carried a full pack and somehow I forgot there is a world of difference between pulling and carrying weight Joe wisely trimmed down as he set out what he was bringing Imagining more stellar sunrises and sunsets ahead I was determined to tote the same pounds of camera gear I had with me on the first leg Big mistake As we hefted our loads and pulled away from the car I knew I was in trouble My pack towered over Joes I could just barely lift it off t he ground It looked like I was setting off for months In addition to filling every cubic inch of interior space I had so many items lashed to the outside I felt like a backpackers version of the Joad family who f led the dustbowl with all worldly possessions hanging off their battered truck in The Grapes of Wrath I was to fare about as well on this trip a s the poor Joads did in Steinbecks bitter novel Good weather persisted as we made our way up Rock Creek to the high crest that runs continuously from just east of Bondurant all the way northwest past Jackson to Slide Lake and the Gros Ventre River We had hardpacked snow machine tracks to follow for the first two days On day approachin g the first pass by Hodges Peak we got a taste of world class wind It is not for no reason that Wyoming is a prime site for development of windgenerated power we learned Like the cold on the first leg wind was to be our constant companion on this trip It raged through the gap knocking over full water bottles left standing on the snow during a break Luckily the air temperature itself was mild or we would have been turned into frozen statues After traversing around the west side of Doubletop Peak through worsening visibility we emerged into clear calm air and a stunning sunset We had not known ahead of time whether or not we could get through a gap between two sets of cliff bands If we couldnt it was going to mean dropping a few thousand feet into a steep drainage we would then have to climb back ou t of a mile or so farther along But the gap went through easily and we turned the corner to find ourselves staring at a classic multitiered rock shelf that stretched away for two miles toward our next pass The red glow of evening coated sheer walls above as we made camp among giant boulders We were now solidly up on the Gros Ventre high route On the map it was amazing how little actual distance remained between us and Slide Lake the terminus of this section We had simply to cross a high basin another drainage and then follow a high plateau to Sheep Mountain from which it was all downhill The wind was blowing hard as we passed Palmer Peak the next day and set our sights on the Crystal Creek drainage A little while later it was blowing really hard We couldnt tell whether the snow flying horizontally past us was falling from the sky or being stripped off the ground but either way visibility was poor We went nonstop for a few hours to get off the expose d high basin where the Gros Ventre River originates Descending Crystal Creek we took our skins off and skied at a pleasant pace through nice powder snow to the valley floor As we went lower and got out of the wind we could see that it was indeed snowing and that there was about a foot of new snow on the ground Whereas up high the wind kept much snow from accumulating and sculpted what little coverage there was into a rock hard surface down here in the still densely treed valley the snow wa s deep and light That night we cheered ourselves by digging out a large shelter for our floorless cooking tent The Megamid is a pyramid tent that sets up easily After digging a square pit several feet down you erect the tent with one center pole and have a large warm area to sit in Sheltered from the wind we were very comfortable and drank cup after cup of tea and cocoa as we consulted the map and assessed the route ahead We hoped to wake and find blue skies Island in the Sky the plateau that was to be our highway for the remaining or miles before we descended toward Slide Lake was not fa r away The storm wasnt over the next day but it had stalled a bit We moved down the valley through deep snow and then started to climb up an adjacent fork Dense woods slowed us to near a standstill but by nightfall we had reached a spot where at least in clear weather we should have been able to see th e final climb up onto the Island The storm was now back on track and as we got higher we could feel the first brushes of what was undoubtedly a screaming wind up on the Island Again we excavated a deep pit for the Megamid and passed a warm evening inside wondering what the weather would do tomorrow The next day as was now becoming the pattern the morning was almost clear We got ourselves going and continued traversing up the side of Crystal Creeks West Fork headed for Island in the Sky As we passed over steep er terrain we noticed how fragile conditions had become with the additional load of new snowfall Everywhere we went we heard the snow collapse and shooting cracks ran in all directions Sloughs moved on even the smallest hillsides We sincerely hoped we would be able to find a route that did no t cross any open slopes By afternoon true to form the storm was back in high gear Trailbreaking was knee deep If film had been taken of us at this point maybe replaying it at fast forward speed would have looked like a normal pace The weight of my pack was becoming painful My left leg had strange tingles running down it and was slightly numb Joe said that happened to him sometimes whe n he carried a heavy pack Have you been carrying a heavy pack recently he deadpanned Despite the storm we could see the edge of the Island We were right at the base of it and only a few hundred feet of climbing would be necessary to get on top We were now at the head of the West Fork drainage and as w e approached treeline the wind increased Though it was only pm we decided to camp and wait one more day to see if the storm would abate If we were going to venture up high in these conditions we wanted to start first thing in the morning to have a full day to make our way across safely For the third night in a row we built a snug Megamid shelter I was awake most of that night listening to the wind and snow sometimes thinking it was easing But by morning the four day old storm was coming o n strong It was day of our trip We werent getting any breaks this t ime Knowing it could in fact go on like this for days we decided the sooner we got up and over the better Trailbreaking was difficult as we left the trees to negotiate a few small cliff bands At one point Joe set off a little slough that moved him downslope about feet The terrain was such that we were in no real danger but conditions were flashing a bright red light at us We knew we had no steep slopes to reckon with so we continued on hugging a scoured ridgeline where grass poked through the snow Soon we were on top Island in the Sky is a featureless plateau that runs for three or four mile s just south of Sheep Mountain and due east of Jackson Hole It is as high o r higher than anything to the immediate west and is thus exposed to the full force of the prevailing wind As we shuffled onto this no mans land I felt like a bug on a windshield The wind was shrieking Visibility was almost zero and we were navigating by compass alone I found that looking straight down at my skis was the best way to maintain balance as otherwise there was nothing to see but white and it was hard to tell whether you were standing or falling We leaned into the wind with poles splayed out on either side Sharp gusts or sudden pauses would precipitate frantic movements as we tried to readjus t our stances We were in the thick of it I think we both realized the seriousness of our position though we didnt talk about it Of course we could always retreat and wait another day but the desire to get out was strong As we continued four or five times just when we really needed some guidance we caught brief glimpses through the clouds of a ridge or valley far below These moments were enough to figure out where we were After two or three hours of feeling our way we made it to the base of Shee p Mountain Visibility was too low to see down the slope we thought we could descend so we set up our tent prepared for a windy night Waking up to clear skies in a place where you went to sleep unable to see anything is an interesting feeling Down below was Jackson and we were eight miles from the road It all seemed so much simpler now that we could see Of course we ended up making a wrong turn and a six hour bushwhack through enormous downfall and dense woods ensued Reminiscent of our last exit darkness saw us staggering onto a packed snow mobile trail A few more miles and darned if those werent headlights coming toward us a fr iend picking us up and just in time We really have to stop driving on those trails Taking that weight off my back for the last time was a relief As blood flowed and feeling returned I resolved to never again overload myself that way No more stuff hanging every which way off my phone boothsized pack Never again I would be a Joad no more Get your FREE download of

Resources Corp From Winston Goodbody AM To cc Subject Yellowstone Ski Traverse Update from Leg Hi All Heres my update for leg of our Yellowstone Ski Traverse As always full info on our trip along with pictures can be found on our web site yellowstonehtml Win Thorofare Yellowstones Heart of Gold By Win Goodbody Thorofare Creek Two Ocean Pass Atlantic Creek Yellowstone Point Ope n Creek To hunters from around the world these are more than just names of geographic features in northwest Wyomings Teton Wilderness They are legendary places renowned for abundant wildlife in the most remote area of the USs lower states The closest road is miles distant Right next door is Yellowstone National Park For those who know some part of the thousands of square miles of rugged terrain here on either side of the Park border the area is simply Thorofare Inside this one word fits th e very heart of Yellowstone country the distilled essence of everything that is great about this crown jewel of Americas natural heritage Thorofare really refers to two main drainages that grow from steep mountain creeks into larger rivers that meander through flat wide valley bottoms before merging Each drainage is initially tight and dense spilling down between rocky Absaroka peaks but then broadens and opens into vast meadows etched with old oxbows where waterways shift back and forth The Thorofare Creek drainage starts on the north face of Younts Peak near the Continental Divide and heads north before turning west The Yellowstone River drainage starts on the south side of Younts and goes west before turning north These two rivers wind around opposite sides of the massive Thorofare Platea u and then join just before entering Yellowstone National Parks southeast corner It seems odd that the river downstream of the confluence is called the Yellowstone for before they meet Thorofare Creek looks larger than the Yellowstone River From this point the Yellowstone flows north into the Park until it hits Yellowstone Lake some miles away Thorofare hosts the bulk of its human visitors during one concentrated period each year Every autumn in those parts of Thorofare outside the Park hunters arrive to pursue elk moose deer and other game Whether o r not they are in harmony with the letter or more importantly the spirit of the law there are in fact many permanent hunting camps scattered throughou t Thorofare and the Teton Wilderness and it is clear that hunting is big business Miniature towns spring up as large groups with convoys of horses haul in everything needed to live well for weeks on end The more developed camps feature raised platforms log furniture corrals and enormous gallon steel drums in which food is secured from bears Though there are usually ample numbers of animals to hunt outside the Park guides and outfitters will place salt licks just beyond the Park boundary in an effort to lure creatures out and ensure that paying clients have something to blast away at Other people far fewer in number come to hunt with camera and binoculars either in summer or fall For them just being in Thorofare and feeling th e pulse of this magnificent land is sufficient payback for the long journey in Here are also to be found animals that cannot be hunted such as wolve s and grizzly bears Despite all of the usual problems that will have an impact on Thorofares future this is still a staggering swath of relati vely undisturbed earth where to paraphrase the Wilderness Act of man is a visitor who does not remain All told several thousand people might pass through during the annual window of milder weather But for more than half the year from early November until early June no one comes With the first real snowfall the back country falls quiet and the last humans decamp for town A visit to Thorofare in winter is therefore a chance to experience real isolation and behold Yellowstones unique beauty during a harsh season This was the fourth leg of our Yellowstone traverse and a return to longer distance travel The second and third legs of the winter had each been hal f as long as the one before the first leg was miles the second was the third was We had to break out of this pattern I realized or we would soon be down to day trips of several hundred yards A trip into Thorofare was just the thing to turn our attentions back to bigger miles an d more challenging territory We figured it would take two weeks to cover th e mile route we had plotted Remote in summer Thorofare is even harder to reach when snow is on the ground Approaching from the south its miles through wild Absaroka territory Continuing from where we left off at the end of our last leg through the northern Gros Ventre Range we depart from Togwotee Pass in unsettled weather Scattered snow showers swirl around in a black sky After several sunny days in town which I used mainly to sit inside and eat too much it looks like we are at last due for some snow Amazingly Togwotee Pass is the first road running east west across the Continental Divide in Wyoming we have come to since starting our trip almos t two months ago miles to the south We will cross only one or two more roads between here and the northern turnaround point of our traverse at Bozeman Montana Heading north from Togwotee feels a little bit bleak even if we do have a groomed road to follow for the first few miles We re really leaving civilization behind and going deep into the woods this time Or so we think Five miles on a stunning old wooden lodge appears Built in it stands on the original highway to Yellowstone and was the stopping point for many illustrious personalities back in the day In more recent years I had heard from someone it was a basic back country lodge where you could stay or eat Just a nice place to stop in We ski hungril y to its door drawn by fullblown fantasies of one more night inside one last meal before being forced back into our pathetic floorless tent it s all weve brought this time where we live on dehydrated beans and stick s of butter Sadly Brooks Lake Lodge has turned into an upscale if barely patronized outfit of late a way station for private snowmobile tours The local henchman materializes instantly and removes us from the bar before we can even inquire whats on tap or find out if any of the paying guests want to put some money on a game of billiards I ask whether by any chance theres some unheated back hallway in employee housing where we could ma ybe curl up in our sleeping bags for the night The response is as warm as a mid February night in Yellowstone No can do We decide to retreat just beyond the fascist compounds perimeter to erect our shantytown for the night Its now snowing in earnest Its hard to explain the kind of magnetic appeal these last outposts of humanity exert on me as we leave on a trip It seems to be getting worse a s the winter wears on Each leg is just a little harder to embark on Each departure day especially if the weather is dark seems a little grimmer I feel I am looking for a reason any reason to put off for one more day the inevitable wilderness death march that is sure to come Any diversion at all to hang us up To be rebuffed at the lodge when comfort is so close seems unbearable Im just not ready to crawl into the sleeping bag aga in I almost want to shell out the for a night indoors And its not just major obvious pitstops like a lodge in front of my sk is that make me want to postpone the inevitable Outward bound on our drives from town to trailheads now every little gas station we pass suddenly look s like a great place to stop and explore They might have precious local gifts we can find nowhere else They might sell those orange hats that say My wife thinks Im hunting I need one of those Or maybe a pi ece of petrified wood with Wyoming emblazoned on it Definitely need one of those in the pack And I must get another road atlas for my collection Any kind of establishment that has anything for sale must be investigated Look over there Dont we need a pound chainsaw wood carving of a m oose head What to take with us Can we stop at this bathroom We just stopped minutes ago I know but I dont want to miss one Should w e stop for lunch here We already had lunch Twice I know butwe may n ever eat again Whoa there A point of historical interest Can we stop and read about how trapper Bucky nearly starved to death at this very spot years ago and had to resort to eating the leather from his snowshoes We really shouldnt Hits too close to home Plus its getting late Thats exactly the point I think If I can just stall for another hour or two we may have to wait another day before casting off Like sand slipping throug h my fingers the few remaining opportunities for frittering away time vanish into the air The trailhead is getting dangerously close now Doesnt look like theres any way out Wait Turn this car around I cant leave without knowing who won the match between the Jersey Penguins and the Hosers I try to disguise my inadequate knowledge of pro sports by keeping the references vague Leave off a city name here the full team moniker there Im sure as heck not going to risk mentioning a specific sport by name Cast the net wide I think Better chance of getting something Could be baseball basketball hockey Australian football or cricket Im talking about Jersey might mean New Jersey or maybe Im off in Britain following a darts tournamen t Have to keep Joe guessing There must be a pro sport game going on somewhere in the world at this moment And I have to know the outcome Im hoping cricket Dont those things go on for days We cant leave now not when Sri Lanka might be trailing Norway by hundreds of points or baskets or yards or whatever they have in that game Come on Sri Lanka No dice A last whimpering claim that Ive forgotten my stock car racing magazines and cant go forwar d without them does nothing to slow the car down The trailhead looms I m being delivered to my doom with no delay The morning after being denied our civil rights at the Brooks Lake Lodge w e awake to more snow Not what I was hoping to see Its coming down N ot really dumping but steadily snowing We may have a few inches from the night This is the first real accumulation from a storm weve seen this winter and it has an immediate effect on our mood Before Im more tha n three words into the sentence Ive crafted to subliminally convince Joe that maybe we should stay put and see what the weather does he practically shouts his assent to the plan Apparently were on the same wavelength Its the first rest day weve taken on the trail the first day we ha vent packed up and kept moving no matter what The very thought of sitting around drinking endless cups of tea and reading sounds like heaven to me And then there is the lodge with roaring fireplaces and gourmet food just across the way We vow to take a second shot at infiltrating the posh resort It turns out the lodge is open to the public read unwashed masses for lunch so we slink over and decide to pay way too much for a fabulous four course meal The fact that we are now actual customers parting with dollar s and not marauding visigoths for the moment keeps the welcoming committee from last night at bay I still feel like there is a closed circuit camera pointing at our table an d burly guards in an underground command center watching our every move but for the moment everything is ok Here it is day and Joes having the mushroom fettuccine while I demolish the linguine with cream sauce Our only concern is the size of the portions but we figure this isnt the u sual all you can eat joint were accustomed to and that a request for some more wouldnt be well received Now that weve taken the financial hit we decide to get our moneys worth We have justified the significant outlay for lunch as tickets to a day indoors the snow continues to fall Even though the restaurant closes at PM we hang around and play pool in the bar Then we settle in with some magazines and try to strike up a conversation with the bartender Maybe we can find some common ground that will lead to an invitation to sta y inside tonight Doesnt happen I watch him periodically out of the co rner of my eye to see if hes whispering into some tiny microphone on his lap el reporting back to the command center on our whereabouts Come PM Joe is still inside by the fire reading and smiling at every staff member who passes by They seem to be appearing with some frequency maybe to check whether hes still there Hes doing his best to look like a legitimate overnight patron but theyre not buying it Theyre prob ably trying to decide which of several different lodge security forces should be tasked with removing him Meanwhile Ive reached my shame threshold and have gone outside for a sk i around the lake not wanting to be present for the inevitable handson eviction that will occur as soon as our goon friend from last night returns Sure enough around PM Joe is formally asked to leave He goes without a fight and heads back to the tent to inform me of the defeat As much as we might want to its pretty clear by now that we are not go ing to be spending the rest of the winter at Brooks Lake Lodge I dont eve n think we can get away with our hour lunch scam again Im picturing a n all out offensive by the authorities to remove us from the immediate area and maybe Wyoming starting first thing in the morning if they so much as catch a glimpse of us We have to move Our choices are to turn around and ski the five miles back to the road wher e well start hitch hiking south to Mexico and a sunny beach or to push o n We decide on the latter and saddle up on the morning of day Were Absaroka bound Not a peep from the lodge as we head across Brooks Lake I look around half expecting to see artillery pieces on surrounding peaks swiveling towards us trained and ready just in case we change our minds an d try to head inside again But the layover was not a total loss Far from it In fact the poor weather motivated us to consult our maps for the first time and see exactly what we were getting into It was a bit of a wake up call We seem to be in the habit of planning most sections of our trip on very large scale maps Restaurant place mats of Wyoming road atlases maps of the US hanging in drug stores globes of the earth all of these have at one point or another been the research tool of choice for plotting our way through Greater Yellowstone The only problem with these topographic specimens is that they yield none o f the lowlevel detail necessary to actually navigate day by day What ends up happening is that the night before we leave on a leg assuming we have had the foresight to get our hands on a quad or other smaller scale map we sit down to examine how we might actually get through wherever it is we are heading Suddenly the landscape is full of cliffs avalanche slopes gorges and dense woods Its sort of like tracing a finger across a map of Arizona thinking it m ight be a fun hike then realizing you just crossed the Grand Canyon What looked pretty straightforward on the map of Wyoming that flashed across the TV screen during an evening weather report now looks downright impossible These are usually quiet moments as we each pore over the maps and realize that there is no way we can go where we thought we could Spreading out all our quad maps on the table in the lodge after lunch I glance nervously at the bartender to see if this breach of decorum might prompt a call to the command center we get a rude shock There is no way we are going to be able to follow the Continental Divide north from Brooks Lake to the headwaters of Thorofare Creek as was our plan The Divide here is a featureless plateau above treeline and getting on and off would require crossing steep slopes With this years poor snow conditions n ot to mention the storm that was currently unloading it would be plain foolis h to head up there Plus we dont have a real tent and our experience on Island in the Sky during leg has already filled my annual quota for traveling not to mention camping on exposed plateaus in high winds during whiteouts Its as if there is a blackboard in front of us with our route chalked o n it We get out the eraser and wipe the slate clean We have to rethink th e entire thing or at least the first half We notice there is a low route option It winds around and follows drainages where the Continental Divide route is straight but there are no dangerous slopes and it stays mostly on valley bottoms We hadnt thought of going this way before because of dreadfully dense wood s and the potential for out of body bushwhacking experiences but now we see there are trails we could follow It might not be too bad Yeah Ive heard that one before Without much discussion we mentally draw the new route up on the board Were happy about it It feels like a huge reli ef now to know that we arent going off to be sacrificed to the weather god s The optimism about our new route more than offsets any bad feelings from th e Brooks Lake Lodge affair and we set off excited and energetic I am rarin g to go and dont want to return to town anymore For two days we hack our way toward the South Buffalo Fork drainage The going isnt great we see some of the same bottomless collapsible junk weve come to expect and love but we are moving forward at least By afternoon of day we arrive at a hunting camp on the side of a large meado w below Pendergraft Peak In a low snow year such as this it is very easy to spot these camps some more elaborate than others The site of crude log structures and a large metal drum inspires us to make ourselves a home away from home We dig a large rectangular pit down to the ground and gather wood for a fire In an hour we are as comfortable as one could be in or out of town There are some large trees above us and even though snow is falling we are sheltered We stoke the fire gaze out into the Absaroka night and enjoy a break from the brutal cold that has followed us on past legs One of my favorite rationalizations is that it cant be brutally cold if its storming and vice versa So the good news tonight is that it isnt brutally cold Because its storming The next morning after more consulting with the maps we make the second major change in our route As snow continues to fall and we look at the area around Younts Peak on the quad for the first time of course we notice what a perfect avalanche slope our route crosses No way to avoid it This is where we planned to get over the Continental Divide which run s along the spine of the high Absaroka crest in this area Worse we notice that the trail on the other side of the Divide up Thorofare Creek stops before the head of the canyon There are several miles between where we would pass Younts Peak and pick up the trail on the valley floor below Hmmm I wonder why that is If there is anything I have learned so far this year it is to STAY ON THE TRAIL I have told Joe I will pay him for every time I suggest leaving the trail as long as he hits me with a shovel and prevents me from actually doing it If there is a trail through an area there is a reason for it And if a trail stops somewhere you can be darn sure there is a reason for it After all people have been traveling through these parts for hundreds even thousands of years Its highly unlikely that all the nice routes through havent been found already Adventurous off trail exploration i n a place like the Absarokas certainly has its place but not when youre tr ying to make good time with heavy packs in February Examining the tight spacing of contour lines on our quad map I see that th e upper Thorofare drainage near Younts Peak looks like prime habitat for some of my least favorite species namely cliffs and gorges I also suspect there are healthy local populations of downed trees and impenetrable brush lurking in there Our experiences leaving the trail along the Green River during leg and then again coming down Redmond Creek during leg have lef t too much emotional scar tissue to ignore I dont want to do it again I picture us rappelling with packs using the shoelace our foot section o f mm chord No thanks Afraid that a descent of the upper Thorofare would use up our lifetime quotas of world class bushwhacking and canyoneering we decide to nix it But we then see there is another way over the Divide with a trail the whole way Instead of going north from Younts and then west following Thorofare Creek toward the massive meadows where Thorofare Creek and the Yellowstone River meet we can go west and then north following the Yellowstone River Im disappointed we are abandoning Thorofare Creek but the idea of descending the Yellowstone River almost from its source which as for Thorofare Creek is Younts Peak is thrilling A few minutes spent with th e map and we are once again excited and happy with this change of plans There is no question its an easier route Also a little bit shorter All these breakthroughs in planning and navigation and its not even am Meanwhile as we realize the route just got easier and shorter and notice snow is still falling on and off and feel the warmth from the morning fire we have going at possibly the best camp site either one of has ever enjoyed in winter what do we decide to do buttake another day off and stay put Were getting used to this rest day thing now Its so easy to do You simply wake up and announce youre not going anywhere and then go back t o sleep Again I am the first to verbalize the concept unsure whether Joe is going to think I have gone completely soft The second rest day and it s only day Instead he responds as if Ive just offered to carry his p ack the rest of the trip A rest day it will be then Back to the fire Once again we are both thinking the same thing We spend the day lounging reading and collecting enough wood for a massiv e bonfire Before this winter I had only experienced one fire on an overnight ski trip and that was in June As I had never done it much before I never thought of making fire a part of the daily winter camping routine If you had asked me about having a fire in winter before this year I probably would have said it was a lot of trouble and not worth the effort But that was before I went ski touring with Joe Hartney A veteran of not one but several courses on tracking and outdoor skills taught by my fellow New Jerseyan Tom Brown Joe knows what hes doing ou t here Thank God one of us does I increasingly feel like I am playing client to Joes guide When it comes to fire Joe leaps into action lik e a dynamo He can have a blaze going in no time and seems to instinctively se t about gathering wood the moment we make camp much as I grab the shovel and start excavating a hole for our tent After seeing how easy it is to get one going in the right conditions I am now a winter fire convert A fire in winter is nice anytime anywhere but in the Absarokas right now conditions are so firefriendly that it is almost foolish not to have one Like much of the west the Absarokas are still bone dry after the active fire year in All the fuel that did not burn is still right there under a few feet of snow Actually the Absarokas themselves did not ignite much this past year but they could have Literally all you need to do to start a fire is brush the snow off a piece of wood and hold a match to it Its astonishing how dry it is You can hold a match to boughs on a dea d tree and ignite the entire canopy Past blazes killed many trees but left them standing They now fall down all over the place There are huge quantities of partially burned trees on the ground It takes little effort to find and collect them Possibly the best thing about winter fires is that you can have them in places you never could in the summer Whereas in current conditions a summer bonfire in South Buffalo Fork would set Wyoming on fire in winter its perfectly safe and manageable We leave our hunting camp on day and even though we have spent almost tw o days there doing nothing but eating and roasting next to the fire its n ot easy to pack up The weather remains spotty and we know were long over due for a pummeling But everything we own is dry and we are fully rested and beyond well fed Building on the obscene amount of food I consumed during the last stint in town I have continued to eat like its the end of the world and now feel a little sick I almost have to force myself to eat dinner just to keep the weight reduction program for my pack going but in truth Im no longer hungry I guess there are worse afflictions I could be suffering from in the back country Having gone as far as possible up the South Buffalo Fork were ascendin g Lake Creek toward the Continental Divide now We have to go up and over to hit the Yellowstone River and we pray for a decent weather window to see u s through Weve made all the route changes we can at this point There s no way to avoid this high crossing The first day going up is pretty good There are so many trail blazes on s o many trees we may as well have a set of runway lights guiding us along We dont even have to pay attention to follow the trail We get some sun splashes but no real views that paint a picture of the route ahead Can t really see where were going up above That night it clears up which brings back the cold Down to around F but were doing fine The next day we get going early and things look good initially We approac h within a mile or two of Ferry Lake Almost to the Divide All the snow thats been falling over the last few days is really adding up now We re glad we dont have to face that blank Younts headwall in what are surely terrible avalanche conditions Its deep powder Would be great skiing but were breaking trail through it A few hundred feet above Ferry Lake is a mild pass over the Divide that wil l deliver us into Woodard Canyon at the bottom of which we will hit the Yellowstone River our highway for the rest of the trip Once we reach the Yellowstone all routefinding and weather issues will be done as its fl at ground on the trail the rest of the way Even if its a raging storm we will be in the trees and can slog along ok I am looking forward to that moment even though I know we are sure to hit some terrible snow down there Id rather face the bad snow demon than be way up here waiting for the Blizzard of to kick in But it will have to be another day that we find out what Woodard Canyon looks like Quickly thoroughly the weather turns evil Its snowing and blowing and visibility deteriorates We cant actually see Ferry Lake but we know it must be there in front of us We leave the trees to start plodding up toward the lake and get a taste of the wind Its not an Is land in the Sky gale but still humming along all the same We cant see a thing We blunder around for an hour and incredibly are still not sure where the lake is This is a decentsized alpine lake and the fact that w e cant find it doesnt bode well for tracking down the pass above We take cover in a clump of windblasted trees to figure out a plan I know Joe wants to go up and over regardless Im not that concerned a bout finding the pass We can get out the compass and start flying blind if it comes to that Its more the question of what descending Woodard Canyon in the maelstrom will be like that has me worried Whereas we can put it in reverse retrace our steps and still find our way back to treeline and a feasible camp site on this side of the Divide once we go through the pass were just on our own in the whiteout with no knowledge of what lies ahe ad The voice of fear and paranoia prevails and I convince Joe that retreat sounds pretty good right about now We turn tail and though its not b een more than minutes or so since we entered the stand of trees our tracks have been erased by the wind We just took it as a given that our tracks would be there as an umbilical chord for at least a few hours or so in case we wanted to go back but theyre gone We eventually find them by prob ing around for a more supportable strip of snow through the white and manage to feel our way along We make it back into the woods by mid afternoon and set up the tent behind a massive tree that shields us from the wind almost completely Time to wait The storm rages on Its Saturday and I realize a good friend is hav ing a noholdsbarred th birthday bash back in Portland OR this very night The theme is Saturday Night Fever What I wouldnt give to be there Instead Im stuck here singing songs from the soundtrack The names of several of them such as Night Fever and Staying Alive seem rather appropriate given our situation From Joes scowl I can tell Im not the only one wishing I were elsewhere We get our window the next day It isnt clear but we can see the lake and once we reach it we can see the pass And then it does clear or at least on the east side of the Divide What we see confirms a halfbaked weather theory we have been working on the last few days Coming up the South Buffalo Fork we have had some real snow but we have also had nearly continuous light flurries as something frozen not snow falls from the air Its more like tiny pieces of frozen vapor This happens all the time even when skies are clear Its almost like any moisture that is in the air even if there are no clouds is being squeezed out Given the local topography this makes sense The Continental Divide here is a high mountain crest above feet and all weather moving west to east gets pushed up over this massive obstacle With the lifting the moisture has no choice but to come out Once we are at the pass and can se e both sides of the Divide we are given a stark piece of visual evidence that seems to support the theory To the west the South Buffalo Fork is a sea o f clouds while to the east down Woodard Canyon its a clear sunny day Descending Woodard Canyon is a joy The upper reaches of the drainage are so open we can just cruise along effortlessly I have taken up the call I championed toward the end of leg in the Wind River Range that its al l downhill from here While technically true its also almost miles to the road Joe strips his climbing skins off his skis and makes a few turns in perfect powder As we get into the woods we find more of the manic trai l blazes everywhere We lose the trail maybe once or twice while crossing open avalanche chutes but quickly rediscover it I have started to photograph these trail blazes I want a collection of them What could be more welcome to the eye of a ski tourer in the Absarokas than big fresh trail blazes We are really getting lucky with this one Before we know i t the downhill stops and we are standing on the bank of the upper Yellowstone River It seems hard to believe but we have penetrated to the inner sanctum How did this happen The moat has been crossed the turret guards sacked door s broken down inner courtyards laid waste maidens rescued from towers We are there We have battled our way through to the most remote place in the lower states And it wasnt even that hard We listen as our shouts of joy echo crazily up into the canyons I cringe to think how enraged the local weather gods will be when they wake up and see that we are already over the Divide and deep into the promised land Nothing they can do about it now Too late to throw the Blizzard of at us Sorry guys Mayb e next time I almost want to cry It feels indescribable to be here at last The Yellowstone River in February miles upstream from Yellowstone Lake I t seems so wild so quiet so alive so free and so far away Its a vis ion that could sustain decades of wilderness ski touring Just the thought tha t one day I might stand right here could get me through anything Steepsided cliffs and slopes of burned thin trees plummet down on all sides It feels massive an ocean of wilderness There are animal tracks everywhere The river itself is not very wide yet After all we are only a few miles downstream from its origin on Younts Peak and its just gett ing going But there is no mistaking that with a little care and feeding and a few hundred miles of flow this little whipper snapper is going to grow int o one of the great rivers of the Northern Rockies We stand and gawk The weather is lovely and late afternoon color starts to paint the scene This is one to remember Eventually we snap out of our stupor somewhat sobered by the realization that even if we have made it this far we still have a long way to go We continue along the trail more blazes for another hour before making camp We can just about see the opening ahead where the river veers north into a broad meadow Well surely reach it tomorrow Joe builds a small fire from burned downfall and we settle in for a cold clear night Day dawns perfectly clear and still A savage cold hangs in the air Th e weather gods know that their snow machine is now more or less useless as we are out of the mountains and can keep going in just about any storm conditions But maybe they can slow us down or at least make life just a bit uncomfortable with their cold machine Either they got a brand new turbocharged model for Christmas or some ace mechanic has given the old on e a complete overhaul The results are impressive Its in the F range which weve seen before but this just feels really really cold Joe and I leave the sleeping bags and immediately start doing the cold weather war dance This consists of jumping hopping running in place swinging arms and legs blowing on fingers anything to keep the blood flowing The dance is an awkward enterprise to begin with and the fact that the snow is completely unsupportable at our camp site doesnt make things any easier You cant just roam around anywhere as one step on any snow we haven t painstakingly packed down will result in a thigh deep plunge Not what we need right now Weve each sculpted our own little platforms and stand watching each other flop and twist Talking at this point is strictly forbidden aside from the occasional obscenity or prehistoric grunt Tra l a la Ah Yellowstone Even as we plow into the normal morning routine of making breakfast and breaking camp the dance must continue This makes for a haphazard on agai n off again kind of progress that would probably be humorous to watch if we werent living it Everything happens in fits and starts You cant get out your stove light it and start melting some snow in one continuous process By that time your hands would be frozen solid You have to do on e little thing then rewarm Do the next little thing then rewarm As it so happens the cooking area we hastily set up the night before is wedged against the fire pit Theres not much room for dancing in there But dancing is mandatory so I frantically pioneer a new traveling variatio n going back and forth between the cooking area and my platform I go and se t up the stove Hands are now numb so I head back to the dance platform careful to only step on the few packed footprints that will support my weight on the way Swing hop jump blow shake Now theres some fee ling so its back to light the stove Into the fire pit I fill the stoves primer cup with fuel Wheres the lighter I start searching zipped compartments in my jacket Damn zippers Cant really operate them with gloves on Not in that one Hands are heading south fast Theres the lighter Its in a ziploc bag Str uggle to open it ATTENTION HANDS WILL BE FROZEN HARD AS WOOD IN SECONDS Im getting an alert from the engine room that I should head back to the dance platform but I just want to get the damn lighter out at least on thi s run Ziploc wont open BEGIN COUNTDOWN Got the light er out May as well try to start the stove while Im here I flick it Nothing Shake it I take off my glove to work th e lighter with my bare hand Boy is it cold It wont light though it n ow feels like my hand is on fire Too late ABORT ABORT I cram my useless limb back in the glove and hobble over toward the dance floor In my haste to get there I miss one of the packed footsteps It s as if I stepped into space I plunge in to my thigh and as I wasnt expecting this at all and am caught completely off guard I fall face first into the snow Getting up isnt easy because again theres nothing to push solidly on to right myself except the packed spots which have now bee n obscured by my floundering Its a full snow bath as I thrash around in the white stuff Joe seems to be enjoying this At last I get up I pull my submerged leg out of the posthole but my camp bootie catches and remains lodged three feet down My socked foot comes ou t on its own and is instantly ice cold I balance on my one foot that has a bootie not wanting to have to step into the snow with my sock but pretty sure thats going to happen Somehow I get the wayward bootie back and put it on On to the dance floor at last for some super charged disco movements Time to get funky And so the morning goes The sun hits camp at about am and the temperature leaps We realize part of the trouble is that weve camped in a classic cold air sink right next to the river bottom Its taken longer than usual this morning to activate the or degree temperature swing weve come to expect Its going to get up to F today As we war m up we wonder what all the fuss was about This is the day we make it out into the open After several hours on the trail we reach the burned fringes of the first of several large meadows along the upper Yellowstone The snow has been mixed alternating between supportable and rotten junk Through the burn its not too bad We re actually covering ground Late in the afternoon when we try to head straight across the first open swath of flood plain we find out what bad snow is all about Its thigh deep junk Each step goes right to the ground We have to l ean back on our skis to keep tips up lest they snag in the ample bushes We re snowshoeing postholing on skis The pace is excruciatingly slow Looking behind us it appears we have shoveled a three foot deep trough through the meadow Were submarining along still about miles from Yellowstone Lake and from the Lake its another miles to the road and have five days of food left At the speed we are going now we could easily run out of food before we make it out Our spirits previously sky high turn morbidly dark Reaching the north side of the meadow we decide to call it a day and resor t to our favorite antidepressant to lighten things up fire Joe starts hauling in entire trees I begin excavating an enormous rectangular area for the fire and our camp The snow is three feet deep but I outline a foot by foot area and start digging An hour and a half later we have ourselves an amazing pit beside a beautiful meadow It is quite possibly the greatest camp site ever And the sun is still up Our moods swing degrees again and we enjoy a long night of stoking the fire and eating Its such a beautiful night we decide to just sleep out under the stars in our giant pit Its going to be another cold one I wake up at am My feet are going numb I wish I had left a stove se t up next to me so that I could cook a hot water bottle to put in my sleeping bag but I forgot Im conscious of a fiendishly powerful force that see ks to strip any warmth I have accumulated in my bag Its horrendous Muc h too cold to even get up and try to put on more clothes or get warmer I huddle and fiercely rub my feet together for the rest of the night I don t fall back asleep This is all part of being admitted to the inner sanctum I say to myself The good news is that it isnt storming Because it s brutally cold Joe probably interprets my getting up at am to build a fire as a weird sign Something must be up Hes done about all the fire building so f ar I just gather wood But here I am out of the bag breaking sticks and stacking them in a pyramid I have waited as long as I can and its no w light out I need to get warm and I know this is no ordinary morning Not a cloud in the sky and dead calm But its colder than usual I can fe el it Before I even consult my little key chain thermometer I am fully prepared to swear that this is the coldest temperature I have ever experienced I just know it is When I check the thermometer its doing something Ive never seen bef ore Whereas we are used to seeing it maxed out at F or so there is alwa ys a little bit of the red column protruding up from the ball at the bottom Just a tiny bit but enough to see that there is a slight rise above the ball I always assumed that this was the max that no matter how cold it got the thermometer would always look the same I actually wished I had a better thermometer that wen lower just so we would know exactly how cold it really was But this morning there is no red column above the ball I look closely because its such a slight difference I could be wrong But there is no mistaking it Only the ball is red Nothing above it In my dementia I imagine that even some of the ball is empty Yikes I estimate by some mystical and completely unscientific method that it is at least F We later find out after exiting that on this morning it is F at West Th umb on Yellowstone Lake We are slightly higher than the lake but more importantly we are in a massive cold air sink with steep walls on all sides It could well be even colder than F where we are Joe gets up and samples the brisk morning air Its too cold for the wa r dance We have to get a fire going pronto We opt for a hot start and splash stove fuel on the wood to speed things up Even white gas is a little ornery at this temperature and requires an open flame applied for several seconds to get a response But once coaxed over the initial hump it goes like crazy in no time We spend the next two hours sitting very close to a raging fire When the sun comes up it feels like a blow torch We spread our sleeping bags out to thaw and steam boils off of them It s the first real drying sun weve had this winter Despite the inhuman co ld I know that spring is on the way For the next four days we continue down the Yellowstone River heading for Yellowstone Lake Just beyond our camp with the swimming poolsized fire pit the snow mysteriously turns supportable and we begin to fly Each day our packs are lighter The cold relents and its so hot during the afternoons that Joe takes off his shirt Animals are everywhere Were just another two beasts roaming the valley floor which is now several mile s across We might even smell worse than most of the other ones around On these final days we hit our stride This is what we came for Its abo ut the most enjoyable time one could have on a wilderness ski trip I don t want it to end For the moment Yellowstone is ours Mighty Thorofare Creek comes in from the east Well have to come back another time to explore that universe We hit the southern boundary of Yellowstone National Park Not far now We see wolf tracks Theyve j ust been here ahead of us We spend a day skiing past The Trident a peak I ve wanted to see for years Were in the home stretch almost to the lake Colter Peak goes by We can see the lake We arrive at the blank expanse of snow and ice welcomed by two bison who look like theyve been postho ling as much as we have this year The Southeast Arm of Yellowstone Lake Day Its the last day to the road We have something like miles to ski to get to Lake Butte near the northeast end of Yellowstone Lake That s where the groomed road from the East Entrance comes in I know well be able to find a ride there around to the South Entrance and from there we ll hitch another ride back to Jackson our home base We take off like Norwegian nordic racers on the most supportable snow we ve seen We can even kick and glide and are really going for it The weather is sitting on the fence at first Looks like maybe the snow machine is sputtering into life but then it dies Must be out for maintenance As we watch Yellowstone Lake appears out of the clouds and we can see everything All the way across We see The Promontory Frank Island Dot Island even West Thumb This is my Park We have talked about maybe trying to ski right across to West Thumb but are wary of open water We stick to the eastern shore and rip past one point after another By early afternoon the day has turned into a keeper Its sunny with ha rdly any wind And we are loose on Yellowstone Lake like a bunch of criminals Just having the time of our lives We stop briefly when trading leads otherwise its heads down hammering But this is not a death march Th is is pure joy We feel invincible and want to see what we can do After a winter of going slow we want to push it home The smell of the barn is overwhelming now We can taste the finish line And its only PM Sometime after rounding Park Point I glimpse Steamboat Point in the far distance I recognize it and know where the road comes in It can only be a few miles now After passing Elk Point I start to go flat out The movement feels good I dont know how long I can keep it up but Il l stick with it for now Joe sees that its still about four miles to go and ha s the sense to maintain a normal pace I cant even feel my pack Either Ive done permanent spinal damage and have lost all feeling in my shoulders or Ive learned how to pack light at last Kick and glide I cant believe Ive been missing this all th ose years I spent skiing on fixed heel gear The snow hisses by Home stretch now One more small bay to cross and thats it I can see the road cut ahead I feel like I could get airborne with a little more effort A thundering final burst sees me to the line Thats it Im there I slide to a stop All the cold all the bad snow Its all been wiped away by the last four days I want to start shoutin g We made it Yellowstone my Yellowstone Thorofare I cant even thin k and luckily there is no need to Joe comes in and we stand there resting Then its time to go ashore Just in time for a glorious sunset across the lake Luck is with us and we get a ride out first thing in the morning as we had hoped Driving back to Jackson my thoughts race over the great landscape we have passed through There are so many more trips to do so much more t o learn But for a first time visit to Thorofare weve done pretty well Not only did we get to the place itself we got to the very heart of its spirit Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at LegVdoc

Winston Goodbody PM To cc Subject Update from First Leg Hi All Heres a preview of a story that should be going up on our site soon Win DDDDDD Greater Yellowstone Ski Traverse Update for Leg South Pass to Cora By Win Goodbody The weather gods must have been in a good mood Maybe they had a good New Years party On previous trips to the Wind River Range I had grown accustomed to spending large blocks of time in the tent waiting for storm after storm to subside If one of every two days was suitable for venturin g outside I considered it a bit of luck But this time was different In the middle of January we enjoyed an amazing consecutive days of good weather for our mile ski traverse of the Wind River Range The drive south toward Lander WY revealed an alarming lack of snow both i n the mountains and lower down where we hoped to start This has not been a good winter so far in the Yellowstone region and we wondered what conditions would be like in the Wind Rivers Luckily with the final gain in elevation as we neared the Continental Divide and South Pass enough coverage materialized for us to ski away from the car We had day packs an d pound sleds Starting out with an approach of several days across lowlands was an interesting way to ease into the trip Instead of driving right up to the base of the mountains we had to work a little bit to get there Even though we were on open range with scattered trees this was some of the trickiest route finding we would encounter anywhere on the route Steepsided drainages and minigorges suddenly appeared in the otherwise mildly rolling terrain requiring detours and delays For a few days we thrashed across the prairie landscape moving toward distant peaks that didnt seem to be getting much closer The or inches of snow on the ground were completely rotten and our movement was half skiing half snowshoeing Each step sank to the ground and ski tips snagged in exposed sage brush When we came upon a perfectly groomed but empty Continental Divide Snowmobile trail we took advantage of it to quickly reach the Little Sandy drainage our entrance to the mountains We were by now settling into our routines relearning winter camping skills dividing repetitive tasks and adjusting to the cold With only about hours of daylight our schedule was remarkably busy It was a struggle to get moving by each morning even though we got up at Lunchtime arrive d immediately Just as quickly the sun dipped behind a peak and it was time to make camp After eating dinner we scurried into our down bags for a hour sleep The days flew by and we focused on putting miles beneath the sleds while the good weather lasted not knowing it would last indefinitely We were comfortable but every waking moment was occupied and there was n o time for relaxing We seemed to be always on the move The price to be paid for clear sunny days is clear cold nights and about a week into the range when we were up above feet nearly all the time we had our first taste of real cold It was the night we camped in the Cirque of the Towers and we were in our floorless cook tent We had excavated a basement a few feet down to the ice of Lonesome Lake Except for the entranceway all the sides of the tent were flush with the snow surface and with both stoves going it was pleasantly warm inside After dinner as we sat reading I sensed some sort of change Then I knew what it was Searing cold air was draining into the tent and spilling across the floor like a poisonous gas You could feel it cool your face try to get inside your clothes turn your water bottle into a frozen brick I imagined my candle snuffing out refusing to burn at such an obscene temperature I went outside to check my key chain thermometer under a sky of blazing stars The cheap gadget was maxed out It was at least F The cold was like a deafening air raid siren There was no escaping it That same cold was to stay with us most nights and mornings for the next or days In the evening before going to bed I would check the thermometer All the red fluid was huddled in the ball at the bottom too scared to try for a run up toward the numbers It was the same each morning The daily temperature swings were tremendous We would go from F or lower to F in a matter of hours in the morning The warm midday sun was always a relief but it didnt last Our joy at being ab le to ski along in just a shirt was tempered by the knowledge we would soon be wearing every layer of clothing we possessed In the evenings as soon as the sun went down the temperature headed south with merciless speed Deep cold is to the sense of touch what the Grand Teton or Old Faithful or a radiant sunrise are to the sense of sight It is truly an amazing natural phenomenon to be reckoned with We marveled at it again and again this thing you cannot see or hear or smell It is both beautiful and horrifying an undeniably authentic experience that leaves an imprint on your memory but with luck not on your toes or fingers It might be hard to explain why it is a fascinating spectacle to behold but there is no denying that it is As the days went by we became students of this strange invisible force But of course we still got cold every day Our good weather continued and we knocked off high pass after high pass on our voyage north Some days we even crossed two passes and multiple drainages For mid winter we were really moving fast With so little sno w on the ground at least we were not delayed by having to worry about avalanches Without consciously deciding to do so we were in fact traveling harder during the day stopping later each night and spending less time readying a good camp More and more we were going flat out all day and then just collapsing at night to wake the next morning and do it again Our traverse was imperceptibly developing all the classic symptoms of what I have come to know as a death march Though a death march typically occurs at the end of a tour when the desire to exit is so strong it can make you g o all day or all night without thinking of the consequences a death march ca n also occur at any time during a trip For example if you discover you havent brought enough food you might need to go full bore for days on e nd Or maybe you hear a storm is coming and decide to turn on the after burner to reach a safe haven Probably the defining characteristic of a death march is that you never intend to get into one to begin with But there comes a point when like an investigator you step back for a minute examine the evidence of your daily life and it suddenly dawns on you that a death march is in full swing and you are powerless to stop it The horror The horror At the outset of the leg we were putting in good days because we wanted to get up into the high peaks where the real trip would begin Once we were there we wanted to put in some good days while the weather lasted to make some progress before the inevitable endless blizzard that would surely descend After we had been going about days and did some math based on the miles we had covered and what still lay ahead we realized that we woul d not have time to exit as we had originally planned In fact even after cutting off some substantial passes and distance it was still going to be all we could do to make it out in the time allotted So we decided to put in more good days We always had a reason for not resting for going hard day after day One night while thawing my foot out over the stove I realized we were not going to have a single rest day We were going for it We had gotten sucked in We were on a death march The long days alone would have been manageable but we had a growing proble m that was interfering with our ability to recover and rest each night Our sleeping bags were filling with ice which impaired their ability to loft and hence insulate us This is a common problem in extreme cold As you sleep you radiate moisture and heat The moisture passes through your sleeping bag and escapes into the air When it is very cold however the temperature difference between the air inside your bag and the air outside is too great for moisture to pass through the bags outer skin As moisture goes to move that last millim eter from the comfortable F temperature inside the bag to the outside air it gets walloped with a degree temperature difference lets say it s F out Instead of escaping the moisture freezes on the inside of the bag s outer shell This problem seems to be worse with high tech laminate materials designed to impede the flow of moisture usually rain into the bag from the outside This is a cumulative condition and gets worse each day as another night s moisture is added to what is already frozen in the bag Unless the bag is thawed out and dried there is no solution and you will reach a point wher e all insulating qualities have been lost and you are better of just sleeping on your insulated pad in your clothes We had already taken to wearing mos t of our clothes inside our sleeping bags and this just barely worked Still more and more of each night was spent tossing and desperately huddling into some new contorted position in an attempt to avoid feeling th e hideous cold of yet another clear night As light at the end of the tunnel appeared our daytime efforts reached a fever pitch Day miles Day miles Day miles Day miles And these were by no means easy flat miles They were trailbreaking miles up and down passes all above feet Reaching th e entrance to Titcomb Basin we veered northwest toward the origin of the Green River at Peak Lake Originally we had planned to go north from Titcomb past Gannett Peak as far as Downs Mountain the last peak above feet in the Winds before falling off to the west down Roaring Fork eventually reaching the Green River drainage But because of time low snow and a desire to live we had altered our course to head directly down the Green Going over the top at Cube Rock Pass we caught a glimpse thousands of feet down the Green River drainage The end was near but we were still looking at another two days to get to Green River Lakes campground where we hoped to solicit a snowmobile ride for the remaining miles to our car in Cora The view down the upper Green as it plummets from near Peak Lake is shocking We silently gazed miles down a classic deeply carved thickl y forested valley wedged between impassable rocks walls Toward their northern end the Winds turn into a series of high broad plateaus above feet and the chief difficulty exiting is finding some way down Many of the drainages that cut this plateau are gorges sheer cliffs or other features unfriendly to ski tourers with sleds As we had changed our exit route we had not gone all the way north to the real plateaus But even here getting down was going to take some doing Day was the first time we allowed that most cruel of thoughts to enter our minds perhaps this was the day we would get out Eating pizza in Jackson tonight Sleeping indoors not encased in an ice tomb No more holding frozen body parts over an open flame Perhaps We slowly suffered up Vista Pass where the summer trail leaves the Green River for about miles and descends a neighboring creek I had got into the habit over the last few days of proclaiming that some feature or other was really goin g to be the last uphill Usually as soon as this sentence hit the air we wo uld round a corner to glimpse another uphill ahead But I was undeterred by past failed prophecies and once again suggested to Joe that this is it He said nothing Whereas early in the trip I felt strong and had been happy to break trail for hours at a time the death march and lack of sleep had taken their toll and the wheels were coming off I had no enthusiasm for leading I felt like the walking dead and just wanted to follow my eyes locked on a track in front of me legs trudging on automatic pilot But as I grew weaker Jo e became unstoppable He was increasingly pulling the boat over the final days and I was happy to let him Especially going downhill though tricky steep sections he raced far ahead Perhaps it was a desire to escape my singing that drove him forward I sang many pop songs past and present but refused to sing Neil Diamond Joes favorite artiste As this dispu ted issue festered Joe seemed eager to put more and more distance between the two of us As it turns out Vista Pass really was the last uphill and now it was time to go down After a few hours of easy traversing we lost the trail and decided to descend a steeply falling stream choked with enormous boulders Seemed like a good idea at the time I guess Joe was in front skiing straight downstream and stopping only for the most absurd drops He was soon out of sight Following his track was a bit of an eye opener It fel t like the cartoon where you come upon a set of ski tracks that split around a tree In leather boots and telemark bindings with a large sled Joe was sticking and foot drops I stared in disbelief at the smooth sled trac k that went over the top of a boulder then straight down for a few feet the n continued on I had more solid AT gear but there was no way I was doing that I was sure Id break a ski Later Joe confided that the way hed been able to descend these boulder s was to surf down sloughs of snow As he went over the tops of rocks snow would slide off and cushion his descent and landing But as the second guy down the course I enjoyed none of this extra padding It was all gone Instead of using the Hartney straightline method I tried side stepping dow n from the top of the boulder turning my skis perpendicular to the fall line that my sled wanted so desperately to follow at great speed It didnt work too well Shorn of most of their snow the boulders it turned out were covered with glare ice Again and again I would be just about to take the final step down when my skis would slip I fell over my skis downhill faceplanting in the stream bed The sled then crashed on top of me I struggled to release skis and waist belts Once I had to get out my shovel and dig to find a pole that went astray in a particularly juicy fall To make matters worse I was getting wet from these repeated snow baths Some time during this carefree afternoon I looked down and noticed that where the solid metal tow bars of my sled connected to the plastic hull there was a grave problem The connection points were tearing away from th e body and threatened to come off altogether When and if that happened I would be reduced to fashioning a rope and stick contraption to bind the sle d to my body I shuddered to think what such a caveman era contraption might do to our progress and tried to face plant less often on the rest of my stream run At last the track I was following left the creek and I thrashed down into dense woods where I found Joe looking at the map and having a snack It looked like hed been there for quite a while I waited for some sign f rom him that maybe the creek had been kind of tough Nothing I acted nonchalant That was fun Yeah Joe said I broke my sled it looks like I countered Oh really Finally I had to ask Did you fall at all back there What He was looking at the map Oh no I did have to slow down at one point though Here Id spent the last hour egg beatering down the creek like someone just introduced to skis And Joe had to slow down once The poor kid Needless to say we didnt make it out that day But we did make it to the valley floor Flat ground at last Now I could claim that there would be no more uphill or downhill But all was not yet goodness and light and we soon found ourselves wallowing in some of the worst snow imaginable Deepe r than the snow we had battled through at South Pass it exhibited the same general characteristics Deeply rotten and unsupportable yet dense and heavy it was nearly impossible to move through We were snowshoeing again pulling our ski tips out of the snow at each step and stepping on the surface only to sink down a foot Pure hell Too spice up what promised to be hours and possibly days of fun battling our way out I decided to make a quick sight seeing trip to the other side of the Green River After plunging through the ice and almost losing a ski in the swift flowing current I reluctantly came back across and started sloshing down the trail like a good boy My skins were now coated with ice which removed any possibility of sliding on them Oh well That night we made a fire and fe d it with prehistoric glee which somewhat warmed our outlook and dried my boots But we still werent out Day Joe and I dont need to verbalize this but its just sort o f understood that there is absolutely no way we are not making it out today No chance of not getting out today Nope I mean zero chance We even ge t up in the dark for an early start to ensure that no matter what the day may throw at us earthquakes volcanic eruptions meteors etc we are still making it out As I flee the ice bag I notice its only F down here in the sultry valley Even though he broke trail most of yesterday Joe is out in front again The snow is worse than ever Somehow even with a trail to follow I can t really keep up I occupy myself with bitter frivolous Well at least were not getting attacked by a moose kind of thoughts I look arou nd for some small forest creature to curse at Anything to divert attention from the pain in my feet and legs Damn pikas Bloody chipmunks But there s nothing about Staggering along I feel almost like a third party to our plight like Im watching it on tv Tra la la This is pretty fun I l ie to myself But our suffering pays off We come upon a lake Could this be Green Rive r Lakes We consult the map Surely there must be some mistake I wait for Joe to inform me that weve made a wrong turn and are actually in northe rn British Columbia hundreds of miles from the nearest road But no As if a ramp of light had descended from parted clouds to our feet the lake lies there like a highway Trumpets are sounding Angels are fluttering above motioning us forward Not only will trail breaking be easier we now have certifiable proof that we are only miles from Green River Lakes campground a snowmobiling mecca Its only about pm and clear and su nny Surely there will be hundreds of people out on a day like this even if i t is a Tuesday We have visions of having to fight back hordes of attractive female snowmachiners all clamoring to be the ones who will give us a ride back to Cora miles distant Well probably need flak jackets We pick up the pace Or rather Joe picks up the pace Apparently he think s he may still have a good chance of competing in some nordic events in the Olympics in Salt Lake because hes going down the lake like a rock et Hes not even going in a straight line Hes swerving all over the p lace going like a madman for the finish line He doesnt care because WE ARE GETTING OUT TODAY One thing I do have going for me is that I can plot a straight course for the point where we will exit the first lake so I regai n some time We cross the first lake There are ski tracks in the snow Humans At the second lake where the wilderness boundary ends I am about as happy as I have ever been to see snowmobile tracks all over the place But strangely ominously no machines At pm we are at the campground Snowmobile tracks everywhere Its j ust a matter of time I tell myself Theyll be here We reach the far end of the campground where the road heads off for Cora and do some gear rearranging readying ourselves for that magic ride We scatter things all over the road effectively blockading it Nobody is getting by here withou t picking us up The sun is still shining and its downright warm As a little joke I take my sleeping bag out and set it on a tarp to begin the drying process which I imagine will really kick into gear in about three hours when were back in Joes living room in Jackson and have turned up the thermostat to about F Just a bit of fun putting the bag out like this I mean its not like were going to need the thing tonight Total silence Wonder where they are these bilers Must be a local tradition to stop at this time each afternoon for a moment of silence or something We start getting a little upset Almost indignant Dont t hese people know how to have fun Where are they A day this beautiful and noones out on their machines Where is everyone off cross country ski ing or something Suns going down now For gods sake WHERE ARE THEY And then just as faint as the sound of a mosquito we hear it A little buzz Was that the wind No I still hear it Could it be a plane Buzz Buzz Buzzzzzzz No sound could be more soothing more friendly more welcome at that moment than this the sound of not one but several two stroke engines heading our way We finally crack Screams high fives arms raised Hysteria release W e knew it We knew wed make it out tonight Victory is ours We are go ing to live After a minute or two I realize that maybe if I stop shouting and set about repacking the crap Ive strewn all over the road well look a little more appealing A little more like someone these gracious heroic goodnatured bilers will want to pick up I lower my arms wipe the te ars off my face and start jamming the ice bag back into its stuff sack We start cleaning up In an instant we are already mentally back in Jackson Back in town Back indoors As if transported by a futuristic machine we are no longer at a remote trailhead miles away from a town o f maybe people in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming We are home We are warm We are about to have dinner Joes in the shower Im checki ng my email Beam me up Scotty For some reason the bilers there are of them have stopped almost a mile short of our little shanty town and have turned off their machines Now that doesnt look good The sun has just gone behind a peak and in abo ut minutes the temperature will go into freefall We cant imagine why anyone would come the miles out here and not go all the way to the lake which is on the other side of us Theyre probably playing a game of rockpaperscissors to decide who will be the lucky two to host us on the ride back but we are sure not taking any chances Maybe they just haven t seen us Before I can suggest that hed probably enjoy some brisk skiin g after such a slack days Joe has stripped off his skins and is skating down the road toward our motorized friends to make sure all is well with uh you know the pickup and the ride back and everything I get out my telephoto lens to watch and maybe document this historic meeting Im sure that as soon as he gets the aok Ill be hearing a lot of noise from Joe I imagine the bilers responses You skied mil es from where Good lord son you get on the back of this machine and were go ing back to my place for a full blown steak dinner right now Here Ill ju st call ahead and get that in the works Now wait just a minute there Bill Who said were going to your place Were having it at my house Jimmy over my dead body Were going to my house and were havi ng a dinner and dance and then were taking them to Vegas for a week And i f anyone else tries to contribute one penny to the expense theres going to be a fight Its all on me Sorry Bobby but its just not going to be like that at all Were going to my place were eating for two days and then Im taking them to meet the Governor before we head to Acapulco for a week And Ill be damned if my two daughters arent coming with us I start to get a warm fuzzy feeling These are my people Im determined to try snowmobiling as soon as possible Maybe even convert Screw this skiing stuff I want horsepower I start singing as I pack up my sled The first sign of trouble is when the four riders start their machines and set off headed toward me But Joe remains standing in place like a fence post Hes not moving at all I figure hes just so bowled over by all the outlandish offers of hospitality weve received that hes wondering h ow were going to be able to make it out of Cora in less than a week What with all the parades barbecues snowmobiling with the mayor square dances and motivational talks at the high school we may have to push back the nex t leg of our Yellowstone traverse by at least a few days Here come the bilers Joe is still doing his frozen in place routine This does not look good I reluctantly clear a path to let the four riders through our barricade Well they may be getting to the lake I think but they cant get out The most worrisome thing is that they do not stop to talk to me and only one even waves No eye contact at all Thats alright I think Out of consideration for us theyre hurrying as fast as they can to get a glimp se of the lake and then theyre going to zip back and get us Well tal k back at their place They just dont want us to spend a single additional mi nute outside How kind of them Thats why they didnt stop Then it hits me The music stops the needle goes screeching across the record Were in trouble here Something is terribly terribly wrong This is just not how people who are about to bring us home to feast with their extended family should be acting Joe is moving now at least He ha s taken his skis off and is walking back toward me at a very slow speed I shout to him Well No response Joe JOE I re peatedly shout at him as he approaches within yards Hes not answering God this lo oks bad I instantly readjust my internal fun meter from being back in Jackson watching tv to Defcon Ive been yanked out of the shower and Im at the North Pole having just been given the news that the pickup flight is not coming and we have to make the mile trek home by dogsled And we don t have any sled dogs so well be using marmots instead Its pretty cl ear we are not getting a ride back with the boys Joe confirms this with very few words when he arrives The party consisted of a Wyoming guide and three clients from Michigan The guide mumbled some bologna about how he could lose his license if anyone saw him giving us a ride Joe kind of tried to laugh this one off at first but then realized the guy was serious He did not want to help us who knows why This outcome was so unexpected and so incomprehensible to us that we just sat there at first It was like a truck coming across someone in the Sahara Desert Sorry Id love to pick you up but you might put your feet on the dash and smudge the leather Would any skier coming across a broken do wn snowmobiler miles from the road refuse to help refuse to lend a hand in any way We couldnt fathom this Where was the back country fellowshi p the shared camaraderie of a couple of hearty souls out in Wyomings wildness Sorry It wasnt there this time We were crushed The previously valiant ambassadors of world peace and brotherhood now hateful bubbleheaded practitioners of an idiotic environmentally damagin g sport came roaring back from the lake on their gas pigs I stared at them menacingly They did not stop Good thing for them We spent minutes on tirades and diatribes best not recalled in print and then we got out ou r pathetic list of options We had already gone about miles that day I dont know about Joe but after straight days of going for it I was a mess It was pm Another miles separated us from the car and salvation We could either camp and continue in the morning or keep going a little further until dark Or of course we could commit to the grand finale death march We decided on the death march We would eat dinner pack it up and go until we got to the car Just another miles It wouldnt be so bad A rational person might have pointed out that we were looking at a mile da y and night but our thinking was not exactly sharp as a laser From step I knew it was a mistake for me but Joe definitely had the fire for getting out We set off at nearly full speed with evening coming on and rich alpenglow coating all peaks in sight Every step hurt Every minute I wanted to stop I lasted about an hour before seriously considering stopping for the night Another key characteristic of the death march is that one person wants to do it and the other really doesnt but just goe s along with it It was clear who was in which role This was sort of a new experience for me for I usually played the guy trying to get the other to keep going Not this time I knew Joe was not going to be happy when he heard I wanted to stop For a seeming eternity I heard myself mouthing the words I think we sh ould stop But I held on Just another step Take another step and see ho w it felt It felt bad My feet were on fire My legs were slightly numb down the sides I was hobbling I felt about as comfortable on skis as Woody Allen But the worst thing was that we had no way to measure our progress We did not recognize the route could not assess how much farther had no landmarks It could be another hour or another I had myself convinced we could ski four miles an hour By that math we should be able to reach Cora in time for last call Or at least in time to round up an angry mob o f torchbearing villagers to go hunt down the four bilers who were guilty of crimes against humanity and must pay Darkness Temperature down to a cheery F Real heat wave here in t he shadow of the Wind River Range Its another clear windless night on t he range as we slowly painfully make our way out of the mountains The ice hard road crunches under our skis Dead silence otherwise At last the pyschological brutality of simply not knowing how much longer breaks me an d hours into the death march even though I have convinced myself we must be half way I mouth the words Im not asking Im telling As sel fish as that may be I cant go on I know Joe is severely displeased but he agrees silently and we stop to set up the tent In minutes we are huddling in the ice bags praying for warmth Looking back I am amazed we survived as long as we did on the trip with ou r sleeping bags considering the state they were in Usually the bag is a saf e house a place to go when all else goes wrong a place to retreat to But in our case it was the opposite Because the weather was so perfect the days were our sanctuary the place we could recover from our torment in the bags and get warm again Had it not been for the perfect weather we could not have lasted But we managed to just barely hang on and tolerate our sleeping bags as they became of less and less use each day Until they were of no use whatsoever Inside the tent we are both thrashing around in our bags fully clothed I put on my down jacket inside the bag for the first time Luckily we both have down pants which we have been wearing to sleep for more than a week The bags are doing more harm than good at this point but we dont really get that The thought does nt occur to us to try sleeping without the bags Its obvious that neither one of us is asleep or headed anywhere remotely near sleep For the first time on the trip I am not satisfactorily warm at night I can survive but it i s not going to be comfortable Maybe wed be better off going for the car I cant face that unknown quantity Another hours More I realize we are looking at a sleepless night hours of waiting for the sun to come back around After an hour Joe announces he cant sleep and wants to keep going He s wet and cold and getting worse in the ice bag We talk about it and decide he will go for the car and I will stay the night continuing at first light The thought of getting out of the bag cold as it is putting on frozen boots hitching up the sled and continuing almost makes me want to get physically ill but Joe still has something left He departs at pm back out into the cold clear Wyoming night I drift in and out of sleep I actually do attain some warmth but somehow I am also getting wet Must have slipped off my pad Dont care I am cramped and crippled a few limbs need blood but rolling over acts like a huge vacuum that takes away any heat I have so I lie still My watch says am when I check it Only another few hours and Ill be on my way I eve n consider getting up right then and continuing but dont I think of Joe and the brutal death march he must have faced or might still be facing Hope he makes it I drift off again am I hear a noise Sounds like an engine Its not a snowmobile Not highpitched enough Sounds like a car In the space of one minut e I go from sleeping to wide awake and out of the ice bag I know exactly whats happened and I am ecstatic Its Joe He has driven the car back down the snowmobile trail to get me Bugles are sounding and the cavalry i s thundering over the hill flags all around No time is spent wondering exactly how Joe got the car here Before he has it turned around I am out of the tent and furiously packing my sled We have the tent down and my gear in the car in under five minutes I slip under skis and sled poles into the passenger seat and want to cry when I feel the heat blast from inside Joes had the heater on high for hours We head off with music playing and Joe hands me a glazed donut The contrast is too stark It cant be real I keep waiting to wake up in northern Iceland with the tent blown to shreds and our bags frozen hard as coffins But I am awake and we are homeward bound at last Joe happily relates his tale like hes telling me who won the Super Bowl and I look for a bullet to bite down on to stop my screams He left the tent to resume the death march at pm We figured we were half way so he was looking at another two or three hours at most More than five hours after leaving the tent close to am Joe reached the car It started Just the thought of going that long not knowing whether it might have been another five hours is too much for me to consider Suddenly all my past death march experiences were transformed into happy jaunts in the country with birds chirping in comparison with Joes saga After starting the car Joe made for a local convenience store and stocking up on junk food and coffee then returned to the trailhead At Green River Lakes we had joked how the snowmobile trail was hard enough to drive on Noticing there was no gate between the parking lot and trail Joe eased his Ford Escort up onto the trail The car didnt sink in at all He kept going and was soon whizzing down the trail So how far was it from the tent to the car Did you measure I asked miles With the heater on full and early morning of our th day starting to show itself in the rosy eastern sky we point the car toward a breakfast of eggs bacon and pancakes We had gotten away with murder and we knew it Never in our wildest dreams could we have hoped for such good weather We had done nothing to deserve it But with this unprecedented window thrown open to us we had breached the Wind River Ranges defenses and squeaked thro ugh In January Joe pops in a Neil Diamond tape and starts singing along Ive got some things to learn from this guy Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer

Goodbody AM To cc Subject Leg Update Hi Here is my update from our second leg Not quite as thorough as the first one Im afraid but were going to be saving our better writing for venues other than the web site Pictures should go up on the site soon yellowstonehtml Win DDD Greater Yellowstone Ski Traverse Update for Leg Cora to Jackson The Unbearable Lightness of Skiing By Win Goodbody Joe and I were in good spirits after the first leg It was a perfect opene r to our winter in Greater Yellowstone Despite the brutal cold and a marathon exit day it was on the whole an enjoyable time Perhaps too enjoyable After almost days back in town mending gear mind and body we departed for our second leg in the Gros Ventre Range with a cavalier attitude Though we had budgeted or days for this traverse we now thought it might take only a week But we were wrong Instead of a walk i n the park the Gros Ventres were a lesson in how slow and difficult progress can be when the weather turns bad We were sternly reminded that in adverse conditions the mountains hold all the cards We traded sleds for packs on this mile trip from Cora to Jackson It ha d been a long time since I carried a full pack and somehow I forgot there is a world of difference between pulling and carrying weight Joe wisely trimmed down as he set out what he was bringing Imagining more stellar sunrises and sunsets ahead I was determined to tote the same pounds of camera gear I had with me on the first leg Big mistake As we hefted our loads and pulled away from the car I knew I was in trouble My pack towered over Joes I could just barely lift it off t he ground It looked like I was setting off for months In addition to filling every cubic inch of interior space I had so many items lashed to the outside I felt like a backpackers version of the Joad family who f led the dustbowl with all worldly possessions hanging off their battered truck in The Grapes of Wrath I was to fare about as well on this trip a s the poor Joads did in Steinbecks bitter novel Good weather persisted as we made our way up Rock Creek to the high crest that runs continuously from just east of Bondurant all the way northwest past Jackson to Slide Lake and the Gros Ventre River We had hardpacked snow machine tracks to follow for the first two days On day approachin g the first pass by Hodges Peak we got a taste of world class wind It is not for no reason that Wyoming is a prime site for development of windgenerated power we learned Like the cold on the first leg wind was to be our constant companion on this trip It raged through the gap knocking over full water bottles left standing on the snow during a break Luckily the air temperature itself was mild or we would have been turned into frozen statues After traversing around the west side of Doubletop Peak through worsening visibility we emerged into clear calm air and a stunning sunset We had not known ahead of time whether or not we could get through a gap between two sets of cliff bands If we couldnt it was going to mean dropping a few thousand feet into a steep drainage we would then have to climb back ou t of a mile or so farther along But the gap went through easily and we turned the corner to find ourselves staring at a classic multitiered rock shelf that stretched away for two miles toward our next pass The red glow of evening coated sheer walls above as we made camp among giant boulders We were now solidly up on the Gros Ventre high route On the map it was amazing how little actual distance remained between us and Slide Lake the terminus of this section We had simply to cross a high basin another drainage and then follow a high plateau to Sheep Mountain from which it was all downhill The wind was blowing hard as we passed Palmer Peak the next day and set our sights on the Crystal Creek drainage A little while later it was blowing really hard We couldnt tell whether the snow flying horizontally past us was falling from the sky or being stripped off the ground but either way visibility was poor We went nonstop for a few hours to get off the expose d high basin where the Gros Ventre River originates Descending Crystal Creek we took our skins off and skied at a pleasant pace through nice powder snow to the valley floor As we went lower and got out of the wind we could see that it was indeed snowing and that there was about a foot of new snow on the ground Whereas up high the wind kept much snow from accumulating and sculpted what little coverage there was into a rock hard surface down here in the still densely treed valley the snow wa s deep and light That night we cheered ourselves by digging out a large shelter for our floorless cooking tent The Megamid is a pyramid tent that sets up easily After digging a square pit several feet down you erect the tent with one center pole and have a large warm area to sit in Sheltered from the wind we were very comfortable and drank cup after cup of tea and cocoa as we consulted the map and assessed the route ahead We hoped to wake and find blue skies Island in the Sky the plateau that was to be our highway for the remaining or miles before we descended toward Slide Lake was not fa r away The storm wasnt over the next day but it had stalled a bit We moved down the valley through deep snow and then started to climb up an adjacent fork Dense woods slowed us to near a standstill but by nightfall we had reached a spot where at least in clear weather we should have been able to see th e final climb up onto the Island The storm was now back on track and as we got higher we could feel the first brushes of what was undoubtedly a screaming wind up on the Island Again we excavated a deep pit for the Megamid and passed a warm evening inside wondering what the weather would do tomorrow The next day as was now becoming the pattern the morning was almost clear We got ourselves going and continued traversing up the side of Crystal Creeks West Fork headed for Island in the Sky As we passed over steep er terrain we noticed how fragile conditions had become with the additional load of new snowfall Everywhere we went we heard the snow collapse and shooting cracks ran in all directions Sloughs moved on even the smallest hillsides We sincerely hoped we would be able to find a route that did no t cross any open slopes By afternoon true to form the storm was back in high gear Trailbreaking was knee deep If film had been taken of us at this point maybe replaying it at fast forward speed would have looked like a normal pace The weight of my pack was becoming painful My left leg had strange tingles running down it and was slightly numb Joe said that happened to him sometimes whe n he carried a heavy pack Have you been carrying a heavy pack recently he deadpanned Despite the storm we could see the edge of the Island We were right at the base of it and only a few hundred feet of climbing would be necessary to get on top We were now at the head of the West Fork drainage and as w e approached treeline the wind increased Though it was only pm we decided to camp and wait one more day to see if the storm would abate If we were going to venture up high in these conditions we wanted to start first thing in the morning to have a full day to make our way across safely For the third night in a row we built a snug Megamid shelter I was awake most of that night listening to the wind and snow sometimes thinking it was easing But by morning the four day old storm was coming o n strong It was day of our trip We werent getting any breaks this t ime Knowing it could in fact go on like this for days we decided the sooner we got up and over the better Trailbreaking was difficult as we left the trees to negotiate a few small cliff bands At one point Joe set off a little slough that moved him downslope about feet The terrain was such that we were in no real danger but conditions were flashing a bright red light at us We knew we had no steep slopes to reckon with so we continued on hugging a scoured ridgeline where grass poked through the snow Soon we were on top Island in the Sky is a featureless plateau that runs for three or four mile s just south of Sheep Mountain and due east of Jackson Hole It is as high o r higher than anything to the immediate west and is thus exposed to the full force of the prevailing wind As we shuffled onto this no mans land I felt like a bug on a windshield The wind was shrieking Visibility was almost zero and we were navigating by compass alone I found that looking straight down at my skis was the best way to maintain balance as otherwise there was nothing to see but white and it was hard to tell whether you were standing or falling We leaned into the wind with poles splayed out on either side Sharp gusts or sudden pauses would precipitate frantic movements as we tried to readjus t our stances We were in the thick of it I think we both realized the seriousness of our position though we didnt talk about it Of course we could always retreat and wait another day but the desire to get out was strong As we continued four or five times just when we really needed some guidance we caught brief glimpses through the clouds of a ridge or valley far below These moments were enough to figure out where we were After two or three hours of feeling our way we made it to the base of Shee p Mountain Visibility was too low to see down the slope we thought we could descend so we set up our tent prepared for a windy night Waking up to clear skies in a place where you went to sleep unable to see anything is an interesting feeling Down below was Jackson and we were eight miles from the road It all seemed so much simpler now that we could see Of course we ended up making a wrong turn and a six hour bushwhack through enormous downfall and dense woods ensued Reminiscent of our last exit darkness saw us staggering onto a packed snow mobile trail A few more miles and darned if those werent headlights coming toward us a fr iend picking us up and just in time We really have to stop driving on those trails Taking that weight off my back for the last time was a relief As blood flowed and feeling returned I resolved to never again overload myself that way No more stuff hanging every which way off my phone boothsized pack Never again I would be a Joad no more Get your FREE download of

Resources Corp From Winston Goodbody AM To cc Subject Yellowstone Ski Traverse Update from Leg Hi All Heres my update for leg of our Yellowstone Ski Traverse As always full info on our trip along with pictures can be found on our web site yellowstonehtml Win Thorofare Yellowstones Heart of Gold By Win Goodbody Thorofare Creek Two Ocean Pass Atlantic Creek Yellowstone Point Ope n Creek To hunters from around the world these are more than just names of geographic features in northwest Wyomings Teton Wilderness They are legendary places renowned for abundant wildlife in the most remote area of the USs lower states The closest road is miles distant Right next door is Yellowstone National Park For those who know some part of the thousands of square miles of rugged terrain here on either side of the Park border the area is simply Thorofare Inside this one word fits th e very heart of Yellowstone country the distilled essence of everything that is great about this crown jewel of Americas natural heritage Thorofare really refers to two main drainages that grow from steep mountain creeks into larger rivers that meander through flat wide valley bottoms before merging Each drainage is initially tight and dense spilling down between rocky Absaroka peaks but then broadens and opens into vast meadows etched with old oxbows where waterways shift back and forth The Thorofare Creek drainage starts on the north face of Younts Peak near the Continental Divide and heads north before turning west The Yellowstone River drainage starts on the south side of Younts and goes west before turning north These two rivers wind around opposite sides of the massive Thorofare Platea u and then join just before entering Yellowstone National Parks southeast corner It seems odd that the river downstream of the confluence is called the Yellowstone for before they meet Thorofare Creek looks larger than the Yellowstone River From this point the Yellowstone flows north into the Park until it hits Yellowstone Lake some miles away Thorofare hosts the bulk of its human visitors during one concentrated period each year Every autumn in those parts of Thorofare outside the Park hunters arrive to pursue elk moose deer and other game Whether o r not they are in harmony with the letter or more importantly the spirit of the law there are in fact many permanent hunting camps scattered throughou t Thorofare and the Teton Wilderness and it is clear that hunting is big business Miniature towns spring up as large groups with convoys of horses haul in everything needed to live well for weeks on end The more developed camps feature raised platforms log furniture corrals and enormous gallon steel drums in which food is secured from bears Though there are usually ample numbers of animals to hunt outside the Park guides and outfitters will place salt licks just beyond the Park boundary in an effort to lure creatures out and ensure that paying clients have something to blast away at Other people far fewer in number come to hunt with camera and binoculars either in summer or fall For them just being in Thorofare and feeling th e pulse of this magnificent land is sufficient payback for the long journey in Here are also to be found animals that cannot be hunted such as wolve s and grizzly bears Despite all of the usual problems that will have an impact on Thorofares future this is still a staggering swath of relati vely undisturbed earth where to paraphrase the Wilderness Act of man is a visitor who does not remain All told several thousand people might pass through during the annual window of milder weather But for more than half the year from early November until early June no one comes With the first real snowfall the back country falls quiet and the last humans decamp for town A visit to Thorofare in winter is therefore a chance to experience real isolation and behold Yellowstones unique beauty during a harsh season This was the fourth leg of our Yellowstone traverse and a return to longer distance travel The second and third legs of the winter had each been hal f as long as the one before the first leg was miles the second was the third was We had to break out of this pattern I realized or we would soon be down to day trips of several hundred yards A trip into Thorofare was just the thing to turn our attentions back to bigger miles an d more challenging territory We figured it would take two weeks to cover th e mile route we had plotted Remote in summer Thorofare is even harder to reach when snow is on the ground Approaching from the south its miles through wild Absaroka territory Continuing from where we left off at the end of our last leg through the northern Gros Ventre Range we depart from Togwotee Pass in unsettled weather Scattered snow showers swirl around in a black sky After several sunny days in town which I used mainly to sit inside and eat too much it looks like we are at last due for some snow Amazingly Togwotee Pass is the first road running east west across the Continental Divide in Wyoming we have come to since starting our trip almos t two months ago miles to the south We will cross only one or two more roads between here and the northern turnaround point of our traverse at Bozeman Montana Heading north from Togwotee feels a little bit bleak even if we do have a groomed road to follow for the first few miles We re really leaving civilization behind and going deep into the woods this time Or so we think Five miles on a stunning old wooden lodge appears Built in it stands on the original highway to Yellowstone and was the stopping point for many illustrious personalities back in the day In more recent years I had heard from someone it was a basic back country lodge where you could stay or eat Just a nice place to stop in We ski hungril y to its door drawn by fullblown fantasies of one more night inside one last meal before being forced back into our pathetic floorless tent it s all weve brought this time where we live on dehydrated beans and stick s of butter Sadly Brooks Lake Lodge has turned into an upscale if barely patronized outfit of late a way station for private snowmobile tours The local henchman materializes instantly and removes us from the bar before we can even inquire whats on tap or find out if any of the paying guests want to put some money on a game of billiards I ask whether by any chance theres some unheated back hallway in employee housing where we could ma ybe curl up in our sleeping bags for the night The response is as warm as a mid February night in Yellowstone No can do We decide to retreat just beyond the fascist compounds perimeter to erect our shantytown for the night Its now snowing in earnest Its hard to explain the kind of magnetic appeal these last outposts of humanity exert on me as we leave on a trip It seems to be getting worse a s the winter wears on Each leg is just a little harder to embark on Each departure day especially if the weather is dark seems a little grimmer I feel I am looking for a reason any reason to put off for one more day the inevitable wilderness death march that is sure to come Any diversion at all to hang us up To be rebuffed at the lodge when comfort is so close seems unbearable Im just not ready to crawl into the sleeping bag aga in I almost want to shell out the for a night indoors And its not just major obvious pitstops like a lodge in front of my sk is that make me want to postpone the inevitable Outward bound on our drives from town to trailheads now every little gas station we pass suddenly look s like a great place to stop and explore They might have precious local gifts we can find nowhere else They might sell those orange hats that say My wife thinks Im hunting I need one of those Or maybe a pi ece of petrified wood with Wyoming emblazoned on it Definitely need one of those in the pack And I must get another road atlas for my collection Any kind of establishment that has anything for sale must be investigated Look over there Dont we need a pound chainsaw wood carving of a m oose head What to take with us Can we stop at this bathroom We just stopped minutes ago I know but I dont want to miss one Should w e stop for lunch here We already had lunch Twice I know butwe may n ever eat again Whoa there A point of historical interest Can we stop and read about how trapper Bucky nearly starved to death at this very spot years ago and had to resort to eating the leather from his snowshoes We really shouldnt Hits too close to home Plus its getting late Thats exactly the point I think If I can just stall for another hour or two we may have to wait another day before casting off Like sand slipping throug h my fingers the few remaining opportunities for frittering away time vanish into the air The trailhead is getting dangerously close now Doesnt look like theres any way out Wait Turn this car around I cant leave without knowing who won the match between the Jersey Penguins and the Hosers I try to disguise my inadequate knowledge of pro sports by keeping the references vague Leave off a city name here the full team moniker there Im sure as heck not going to risk mentioning a specific sport by name Cast the net wide I think Better chance of getting something Could be baseball basketball hockey Australian football or cricket Im talking about Jersey might mean New Jersey or maybe Im off in Britain following a darts tournamen t Have to keep Joe guessing There must be a pro sport game going on somewhere in the world at this moment And I have to know the outcome Im hoping cricket Dont those things go on for days We cant leave now not when Sri Lanka might be trailing Norway by hundreds of points or baskets or yards or whatever they have in that game Come on Sri Lanka No dice A last whimpering claim that Ive forgotten my stock car racing magazines and cant go forwar d without them does nothing to slow the car down The trailhead looms I m being delivered to my doom with no delay The morning after being denied our civil rights at the Brooks Lake Lodge w e awake to more snow Not what I was hoping to see Its coming down N ot really dumping but steadily snowing We may have a few inches from the night This is the first real accumulation from a storm weve seen this winter and it has an immediate effect on our mood Before Im more tha n three words into the sentence Ive crafted to subliminally convince Joe that maybe we should stay put and see what the weather does he practically shouts his assent to the plan Apparently were on the same wavelength Its the first rest day weve taken on the trail the first day we ha vent packed up and kept moving no matter what The very thought of sitting around drinking endless cups of tea and reading sounds like heaven to me And then there is the lodge with roaring fireplaces and gourmet food just across the way We vow to take a second shot at infiltrating the posh resort It turns out the lodge is open to the public read unwashed masses for lunch so we slink over and decide to pay way too much for a fabulous four course meal The fact that we are now actual customers parting with dollar s and not marauding visigoths for the moment keeps the welcoming committee from last night at bay I still feel like there is a closed circuit camera pointing at our table an d burly guards in an underground command center watching our every move but for the moment everything is ok Here it is day and Joes having the mushroom fettuccine while I demolish the linguine with cream sauce Our only concern is the size of the portions but we figure this isnt the u sual all you can eat joint were accustomed to and that a request for some more wouldnt be well received Now that weve taken the financial hit we decide to get our moneys worth We have justified the significant outlay for lunch as tickets to a day indoors the snow continues to fall Even though the restaurant closes at PM we hang around and play pool in the bar Then we settle in with some magazines and try to strike up a conversation with the bartender Maybe we can find some common ground that will lead to an invitation to sta y inside tonight Doesnt happen I watch him periodically out of the co rner of my eye to see if hes whispering into some tiny microphone on his lap el reporting back to the command center on our whereabouts Come PM Joe is still inside by the fire reading and smiling at every staff member who passes by They seem to be appearing with some frequency maybe to check whether hes still there Hes doing his best to look like a legitimate overnight patron but theyre not buying it Theyre prob ably trying to decide which of several different lodge security forces should be tasked with removing him Meanwhile Ive reached my shame threshold and have gone outside for a sk i around the lake not wanting to be present for the inevitable handson eviction that will occur as soon as our goon friend from last night returns Sure enough around PM Joe is formally asked to leave He goes without a fight and heads back to the tent to inform me of the defeat As much as we might want to its pretty clear by now that we are not go ing to be spending the rest of the winter at Brooks Lake Lodge I dont eve n think we can get away with our hour lunch scam again Im picturing a n all out offensive by the authorities to remove us from the immediate area and maybe Wyoming starting first thing in the morning if they so much as catch a glimpse of us We have to move Our choices are to turn around and ski the five miles back to the road wher e well start hitch hiking south to Mexico and a sunny beach or to push o n We decide on the latter and saddle up on the morning of day Were Absaroka bound Not a peep from the lodge as we head across Brooks Lake I look around half expecting to see artillery pieces on surrounding peaks swiveling towards us trained and ready just in case we change our minds an d try to head inside again But the layover was not a total loss Far from it In fact the poor weather motivated us to consult our maps for the first time and see exactly what we were getting into It was a bit of a wake up call We seem to be in the habit of planning most sections of our trip on very large scale maps Restaurant place mats of Wyoming road atlases maps of the US hanging in drug stores globes of the earth all of these have at one point or another been the research tool of choice for plotting our way through Greater Yellowstone The only problem with these topographic specimens is that they yield none o f the lowlevel detail necessary to actually navigate day by day What ends up happening is that the night before we leave on a leg assuming we have had the foresight to get our hands on a quad or other smaller scale map we sit down to examine how we might actually get through wherever it is we are heading Suddenly the landscape is full of cliffs avalanche slopes gorges and dense woods Its sort of like tracing a finger across a map of Arizona thinking it m ight be a fun hike then realizing you just crossed the Grand Canyon What looked pretty straightforward on the map of Wyoming that flashed across the TV screen during an evening weather report now looks downright impossible These are usually quiet moments as we each pore over the maps and realize that there is no way we can go where we thought we could Spreading out all our quad maps on the table in the lodge after lunch I glance nervously at the bartender to see if this breach of decorum might prompt a call to the command center we get a rude shock There is no way we are going to be able to follow the Continental Divide north from Brooks Lake to the headwaters of Thorofare Creek as was our plan The Divide here is a featureless plateau above treeline and getting on and off would require crossing steep slopes With this years poor snow conditions n ot to mention the storm that was currently unloading it would be plain foolis h to head up there Plus we dont have a real tent and our experience on Island in the Sky during leg has already filled my annual quota for traveling not to mention camping on exposed plateaus in high winds during whiteouts Its as if there is a blackboard in front of us with our route chalked o n it We get out the eraser and wipe the slate clean We have to rethink th e entire thing or at least the first half We notice there is a low route option It winds around and follows drainages where the Continental Divide route is straight but there are no dangerous slopes and it stays mostly on valley bottoms We hadnt thought of going this way before because of dreadfully dense wood s and the potential for out of body bushwhacking experiences but now we see there are trails we could follow It might not be too bad Yeah Ive heard that one before Without much discussion we mentally draw the new route up on the board Were happy about it It feels like a huge reli ef now to know that we arent going off to be sacrificed to the weather god s The optimism about our new route more than offsets any bad feelings from th e Brooks Lake Lodge affair and we set off excited and energetic I am rarin g to go and dont want to return to town anymore For two days we hack our way toward the South Buffalo Fork drainage The going isnt great we see some of the same bottomless collapsible junk weve come to expect and love but we are moving forward at least By afternoon of day we arrive at a hunting camp on the side of a large meado w below Pendergraft Peak In a low snow year such as this it is very easy to spot these camps some more elaborate than others The site of crude log structures and a large metal drum inspires us to make ourselves a home away from home We dig a large rectangular pit down to the ground and gather wood for a fire In an hour we are as comfortable as one could be in or out of town There are some large trees above us and even though snow is falling we are sheltered We stoke the fire gaze out into the Absaroka night and enjoy a break from the brutal cold that has followed us on past legs One of my favorite rationalizations is that it cant be brutally cold if its storming and vice versa So the good news tonight is that it isnt brutally cold Because its storming The next morning after more consulting with the maps we make the second major change in our route As snow continues to fall and we look at the area around Younts Peak on the quad for the first time of course we notice what a perfect avalanche slope our route crosses No way to avoid it This is where we planned to get over the Continental Divide which run s along the spine of the high Absaroka crest in this area Worse we notice that the trail on the other side of the Divide up Thorofare Creek stops before the head of the canyon There are several miles between where we would pass Younts Peak and pick up the trail on the valley floor below Hmmm I wonder why that is If there is anything I have learned so far this year it is to STAY ON THE TRAIL I have told Joe I will pay him for every time I suggest leaving the trail as long as he hits me with a shovel and prevents me from actually doing it If there is a trail through an area there is a reason for it And if a trail stops somewhere you can be darn sure there is a reason for it After all people have been traveling through these parts for hundreds even thousands of years Its highly unlikely that all the nice routes through havent been found already Adventurous off trail exploration i n a place like the Absarokas certainly has its place but not when youre tr ying to make good time with heavy packs in February Examining the tight spacing of contour lines on our quad map I see that th e upper Thorofare drainage near Younts Peak looks like prime habitat for some of my least favorite species namely cliffs and gorges I also suspect there are healthy local populations of downed trees and impenetrable brush lurking in there Our experiences leaving the trail along the Green River during leg and then again coming down Redmond Creek during leg have lef t too much emotional scar tissue to ignore I dont want to do it again I picture us rappelling with packs using the shoelace our foot section o f mm chord No thanks Afraid that a descent of the upper Thorofare would use up our lifetime quotas of world class bushwhacking and canyoneering we decide to nix it But we then see there is another way over the Divide with a trail the whole way Instead of going north from Younts and then west following Thorofare Creek toward the massive meadows where Thorofare Creek and the Yellowstone River meet we can go west and then north following the Yellowstone River Im disappointed we are abandoning Thorofare Creek but the idea of descending the Yellowstone River almost from its source which as for Thorofare Creek is Younts Peak is thrilling A few minutes spent with th e map and we are once again excited and happy with this change of plans There is no question its an easier route Also a little bit shorter All these breakthroughs in planning and navigation and its not even am Meanwhile as we realize the route just got easier and shorter and notice snow is still falling on and off and feel the warmth from the morning fire we have going at possibly the best camp site either one of has ever enjoyed in winter what do we decide to do buttake another day off and stay put Were getting used to this rest day thing now Its so easy to do You simply wake up and announce youre not going anywhere and then go back t o sleep Again I am the first to verbalize the concept unsure whether Joe is going to think I have gone completely soft The second rest day and it s only day Instead he responds as if Ive just offered to carry his p ack the rest of the trip A rest day it will be then Back to the fire Once again we are both thinking the same thing We spend the day lounging reading and collecting enough wood for a massiv e bonfire Before this winter I had only experienced one fire on an overnight ski trip and that was in June As I had never done it much before I never thought of making fire a part of the daily winter camping routine If you had asked me about having a fire in winter before this year I probably would have said it was a lot of trouble and not worth the effort But that was before I went ski touring with Joe Hartney A veteran of not one but several courses on tracking and outdoor skills taught by my fellow New Jerseyan Tom Brown Joe knows what hes doing ou t here Thank God one of us does I increasingly feel like I am playing client to Joes guide When it comes to fire Joe leaps into action lik e a dynamo He can have a blaze going in no time and seems to instinctively se t about gathering wood the moment we make camp much as I grab the shovel and start excavating a hole for our tent After seeing how easy it is to get one going in the right conditions I am now a winter fire convert A fire in winter is nice anytime anywhere but in the Absarokas right now conditions are so firefriendly that it is almost foolish not to have one Like much of the west the Absarokas are still bone dry after the active fire year in All the fuel that did not burn is still right there under a few feet of snow Actually the Absarokas themselves did not ignite much this past year but they could have Literally all you need to do to start a fire is brush the snow off a piece of wood and hold a match to it Its astonishing how dry it is You can hold a match to boughs on a dea d tree and ignite the entire canopy Past blazes killed many trees but left them standing They now fall down all over the place There are huge quantities of partially burned trees on the ground It takes little effort to find and collect them Possibly the best thing about winter fires is that you can have them in places you never could in the summer Whereas in current conditions a summer bonfire in South Buffalo Fork would set Wyoming on fire in winter its perfectly safe and manageable We leave our hunting camp on day and even though we have spent almost tw o days there doing nothing but eating and roasting next to the fire its n ot easy to pack up The weather remains spotty and we know were long over due for a pummeling But everything we own is dry and we are fully rested and beyond well fed Building on the obscene amount of food I consumed during the last stint in town I have continued to eat like its the end of the world and now feel a little sick I almost have to force myself to eat dinner just to keep the weight reduction program for my pack going but in truth Im no longer hungry I guess there are worse afflictions I could be suffering from in the back country Having gone as far as possible up the South Buffalo Fork were ascendin g Lake Creek toward the Continental Divide now We have to go up and over to hit the Yellowstone River and we pray for a decent weather window to see u s through Weve made all the route changes we can at this point There s no way to avoid this high crossing The first day going up is pretty good There are so many trail blazes on s o many trees we may as well have a set of runway lights guiding us along We dont even have to pay attention to follow the trail We get some sun splashes but no real views that paint a picture of the route ahead Can t really see where were going up above That night it clears up which brings back the cold Down to around F but were doing fine The next day we get going early and things look good initially We approac h within a mile or two of Ferry Lake Almost to the Divide All the snow thats been falling over the last few days is really adding up now We re glad we dont have to face that blank Younts headwall in what are surely terrible avalanche conditions Its deep powder Would be great skiing but were breaking trail through it A few hundred feet above Ferry Lake is a mild pass over the Divide that wil l deliver us into Woodard Canyon at the bottom of which we will hit the Yellowstone River our highway for the rest of the trip Once we reach the Yellowstone all routefinding and weather issues will be done as its fl at ground on the trail the rest of the way Even if its a raging storm we will be in the trees and can slog along ok I am looking forward to that moment even though I know we are sure to hit some terrible snow down there Id rather face the bad snow demon than be way up here waiting for the Blizzard of to kick in But it will have to be another day that we find out what Woodard Canyon looks like Quickly thoroughly the weather turns evil Its snowing and blowing and visibility deteriorates We cant actually see Ferry Lake but we know it must be there in front of us We leave the trees to start plodding up toward the lake and get a taste of the wind Its not an Is land in the Sky gale but still humming along all the same We cant see a thing We blunder around for an hour and incredibly are still not sure where the lake is This is a decentsized alpine lake and the fact that w e cant find it doesnt bode well for tracking down the pass above We take cover in a clump of windblasted trees to figure out a plan I know Joe wants to go up and over regardless Im not that concerned a bout finding the pass We can get out the compass and start flying blind if it comes to that Its more the question of what descending Woodard Canyon in the maelstrom will be like that has me worried Whereas we can put it in reverse retrace our steps and still find our way back to treeline and a feasible camp site on this side of the Divide once we go through the pass were just on our own in the whiteout with no knowledge of what lies ahe ad The voice of fear and paranoia prevails and I convince Joe that retreat sounds pretty good right about now We turn tail and though its not b een more than minutes or so since we entered the stand of trees our tracks have been erased by the wind We just took it as a given that our tracks would be there as an umbilical chord for at least a few hours or so in case we wanted to go back but theyre gone We eventually find them by prob ing around for a more supportable strip of snow through the white and manage to feel our way along We make it back into the woods by mid afternoon and set up the tent behind a massive tree that shields us from the wind almost completely Time to wait The storm rages on Its Saturday and I realize a good friend is hav ing a noholdsbarred th birthday bash back in Portland OR this very night The theme is Saturday Night Fever What I wouldnt give to be there Instead Im stuck here singing songs from the soundtrack The names of several of them such as Night Fever and Staying Alive seem rather appropriate given our situation From Joes scowl I can tell Im not the only one wishing I were elsewhere We get our window the next day It isnt clear but we can see the lake and once we reach it we can see the pass And then it does clear or at least on the east side of the Divide What we see confirms a halfbaked weather theory we have been working on the last few days Coming up the South Buffalo Fork we have had some real snow but we have also had nearly continuous light flurries as something frozen not snow falls from the air Its more like tiny pieces of frozen vapor This happens all the time even when skies are clear Its almost like any moisture that is in the air even if there are no clouds is being squeezed out Given the local topography this makes sense The Continental Divide here is a high mountain crest above feet and all weather moving west to east gets pushed up over this massive obstacle With the lifting the moisture has no choice but to come out Once we are at the pass and can se e both sides of the Divide we are given a stark piece of visual evidence that seems to support the theory To the west the South Buffalo Fork is a sea o f clouds while to the east down Woodard Canyon its a clear sunny day Descending Woodard Canyon is a joy The upper reaches of the drainage are so open we can just cruise along effortlessly I have taken up the call I championed toward the end of leg in the Wind River Range that its al l downhill from here While technically true its also almost miles to the road Joe strips his climbing skins off his skis and makes a few turns in perfect powder As we get into the woods we find more of the manic trai l blazes everywhere We lose the trail maybe once or twice while crossing open avalanche chutes but quickly rediscover it I have started to photograph these trail blazes I want a collection of them What could be more welcome to the eye of a ski tourer in the Absarokas than big fresh trail blazes We are really getting lucky with this one Before we know i t the downhill stops and we are standing on the bank of the upper Yellowstone River It seems hard to believe but we have penetrated to the inner sanctum How did this happen The moat has been crossed the turret guards sacked door s broken down inner courtyards laid waste maidens rescued from towers We are there We have battled our way through to the most remote place in the lower states And it wasnt even that hard We listen as our shouts of joy echo crazily up into the canyons I cringe to think how enraged the local weather gods will be when they wake up and see that we are already over the Divide and deep into the promised land Nothing they can do about it now Too late to throw the Blizzard of at us Sorry guys Mayb e next time I almost want to cry It feels indescribable to be here at last The Yellowstone River in February miles upstream from Yellowstone Lake I t seems so wild so quiet so alive so free and so far away Its a vis ion that could sustain decades of wilderness ski touring Just the thought tha t one day I might stand right here could get me through anything Steepsided cliffs and slopes of burned thin trees plummet down on all sides It feels massive an ocean of wilderness There are animal tracks everywhere The river itself is not very wide yet After all we are only a few miles downstream from its origin on Younts Peak and its just gett ing going But there is no mistaking that with a little care and feeding and a few hundred miles of flow this little whipper snapper is going to grow int o one of the great rivers of the Northern Rockies We stand and gawk The weather is lovely and late afternoon color starts to paint the scene This is one to remember Eventually we snap out of our stupor somewhat sobered by the realization that even if we have made it this far we still have a long way to go We continue along the trail more blazes for another hour before making camp We can just about see the opening ahead where the river veers north into a broad meadow Well surely reach it tomorrow Joe builds a small fire from burned downfall and we settle in for a cold clear night Day dawns perfectly clear and still A savage cold hangs in the air Th e weather gods know that their snow machine is now more or less useless as we are out of the mountains and can keep going in just about any storm conditions But maybe they can slow us down or at least make life just a bit uncomfortable with their cold machine Either they got a brand new turbocharged model for Christmas or some ace mechanic has given the old on e a complete overhaul The results are impressive Its in the F range which weve seen before but this just feels really really cold Joe and I leave the sleeping bags and immediately start doing the cold weather war dance This consists of jumping hopping running in place swinging arms and legs blowing on fingers anything to keep the blood flowing The dance is an awkward enterprise to begin with and the fact that the snow is completely unsupportable at our camp site doesnt make things any easier You cant just roam around anywhere as one step on any snow we haven t painstakingly packed down will result in a thigh deep plunge Not what we need right now Weve each sculpted our own little platforms and stand watching each other flop and twist Talking at this point is strictly forbidden aside from the occasional obscenity or prehistoric grunt Tra l a la Ah Yellowstone Even as we plow into the normal morning routine of making breakfast and breaking camp the dance must continue This makes for a haphazard on agai n off again kind of progress that would probably be humorous to watch if we werent living it Everything happens in fits and starts You cant get out your stove light it and start melting some snow in one continuous process By that time your hands would be frozen solid You have to do on e little thing then rewarm Do the next little thing then rewarm As it so happens the cooking area we hastily set up the night before is wedged against the fire pit Theres not much room for dancing in there But dancing is mandatory so I frantically pioneer a new traveling variatio n going back and forth between the cooking area and my platform I go and se t up the stove Hands are now numb so I head back to the dance platform careful to only step on the few packed footprints that will support my weight on the way Swing hop jump blow shake Now theres some fee ling so its back to light the stove Into the fire pit I fill the stoves primer cup with fuel Wheres the lighter I start searching zipped compartments in my jacket Damn zippers Cant really operate them with gloves on Not in that one Hands are heading south fast Theres the lighter Its in a ziploc bag Str uggle to open it ATTENTION HANDS WILL BE FROZEN HARD AS WOOD IN SECONDS Im getting an alert from the engine room that I should head back to the dance platform but I just want to get the damn lighter out at least on thi s run Ziploc wont open BEGIN COUNTDOWN Got the light er out May as well try to start the stove while Im here I flick it Nothing Shake it I take off my glove to work th e lighter with my bare hand Boy is it cold It wont light though it n ow feels like my hand is on fire Too late ABORT ABORT I cram my useless limb back in the glove and hobble over toward the dance floor In my haste to get there I miss one of the packed footsteps It s as if I stepped into space I plunge in to my thigh and as I wasnt expecting this at all and am caught completely off guard I fall face first into the snow Getting up isnt easy because again theres nothing to push solidly on to right myself except the packed spots which have now bee n obscured by my floundering Its a full snow bath as I thrash around in the white stuff Joe seems to be enjoying this At last I get up I pull my submerged leg out of the posthole but my camp bootie catches and remains lodged three feet down My socked foot comes ou t on its own and is instantly ice cold I balance on my one foot that has a bootie not wanting to have to step into the snow with my sock but pretty sure thats going to happen Somehow I get the wayward bootie back and put it on On to the dance floor at last for some super charged disco movements Time to get funky And so the morning goes The sun hits camp at about am and the temperature leaps We realize part of the trouble is that weve camped in a classic cold air sink right next to the river bottom Its taken longer than usual this morning to activate the or degree temperature swing weve come to expect Its going to get up to F today As we war m up we wonder what all the fuss was about This is the day we make it out into the open After several hours on the trail we reach the burned fringes of the first of several large meadows along the upper Yellowstone The snow has been mixed alternating between supportable and rotten junk Through the burn its not too bad We re actually covering ground Late in the afternoon when we try to head straight across the first open swath of flood plain we find out what bad snow is all about Its thigh deep junk Each step goes right to the ground We have to l ean back on our skis to keep tips up lest they snag in the ample bushes We re snowshoeing postholing on skis The pace is excruciatingly slow Looking behind us it appears we have shoveled a three foot deep trough through the meadow Were submarining along still about miles from Yellowstone Lake and from the Lake its another miles to the road and have five days of food left At the speed we are going now we could easily run out of food before we make it out Our spirits previously sky high turn morbidly dark Reaching the north side of the meadow we decide to call it a day and resor t to our favorite antidepressant to lighten things up fire Joe starts hauling in entire trees I begin excavating an enormous rectangular area for the fire and our camp The snow is three feet deep but I outline a foot by foot area and start digging An hour and a half later we have ourselves an amazing pit beside a beautiful meadow It is quite possibly the greatest camp site ever And the sun is still up Our moods swing degrees again and we enjoy a long night of stoking the fire and eating Its such a beautiful night we decide to just sleep out under the stars in our giant pit Its going to be another cold one I wake up at am My feet are going numb I wish I had left a stove se t up next to me so that I could cook a hot water bottle to put in my sleeping bag but I forgot Im conscious of a fiendishly powerful force that see ks to strip any warmth I have accumulated in my bag Its horrendous Muc h too cold to even get up and try to put on more clothes or get warmer I huddle and fiercely rub my feet together for the rest of the night I don t fall back asleep This is all part of being admitted to the inner sanctum I say to myself The good news is that it isnt storming Because it s brutally cold Joe probably interprets my getting up at am to build a fire as a weird sign Something must be up Hes done about all the fire building so f ar I just gather wood But here I am out of the bag breaking sticks and stacking them in a pyramid I have waited as long as I can and its no w light out I need to get warm and I know this is no ordinary morning Not a cloud in the sky and dead calm But its colder than usual I can fe el it Before I even consult my little key chain thermometer I am fully prepared to swear that this is the coldest temperature I have ever experienced I just know it is When I check the thermometer its doing something Ive never seen bef ore Whereas we are used to seeing it maxed out at F or so there is alwa ys a little bit of the red column protruding up from the ball at the bottom Just a tiny bit but enough to see that there is a slight rise above the ball I always assumed that this was the max that no matter how cold it got the thermometer would always look the same I actually wished I had a better thermometer that wen lower just so we would know exactly how cold it really was But this morning there is no red column above the ball I look closely because its such a slight difference I could be wrong But there is no mistaking it Only the ball is red Nothing above it In my dementia I imagine that even some of the ball is empty Yikes I estimate by some mystical and completely unscientific method that it is at least F We later find out after exiting that on this morning it is F at West Th umb on Yellowstone Lake We are slightly higher than the lake but more importantly we are in a massive cold air sink with steep walls on all sides It could well be even colder than F where we are Joe gets up and samples the brisk morning air Its too cold for the wa r dance We have to get a fire going pronto We opt for a hot start and splash stove fuel on the wood to speed things up Even white gas is a little ornery at this temperature and requires an open flame applied for several seconds to get a response But once coaxed over the initial hump it goes like crazy in no time We spend the next two hours sitting very close to a raging fire When the sun comes up it feels like a blow torch We spread our sleeping bags out to thaw and steam boils off of them It s the first real drying sun weve had this winter Despite the inhuman co ld I know that spring is on the way For the next four days we continue down the Yellowstone River heading for Yellowstone Lake Just beyond our camp with the swimming poolsized fire pit the snow mysteriously turns supportable and we begin to fly Each day our packs are lighter The cold relents and its so hot during the afternoons that Joe takes off his shirt Animals are everywhere Were just another two beasts roaming the valley floor which is now several mile s across We might even smell worse than most of the other ones around On these final days we hit our stride This is what we came for Its abo ut the most enjoyable time one could have on a wilderness ski trip I don t want it to end For the moment Yellowstone is ours Mighty Thorofare Creek comes in from the east Well have to come back another time to explore that universe We hit the southern boundary of Yellowstone National Park Not far now We see wolf tracks Theyve j ust been here ahead of us We spend a day skiing past The Trident a peak I ve wanted to see for years Were in the home stretch almost to the lake Colter Peak goes by We can see the lake We arrive at the blank expanse of snow and ice welcomed by two bison who look like theyve been postho ling as much as we have this year The Southeast Arm of Yellowstone Lake Day Its the last day to the road We have something like miles to ski to get to Lake Butte near the northeast end of Yellowstone Lake That s where the groomed road from the East Entrance comes in I know well be able to find a ride there around to the South Entrance and from there we ll hitch another ride back to Jackson our home base We take off like Norwegian nordic racers on the most supportable snow we ve seen We can even kick and glide and are really going for it The weather is sitting on the fence at first Looks like maybe the snow machine is sputtering into life but then it dies Must be out for maintenance As we watch Yellowstone Lake appears out of the clouds and we can see everything All the way across We see The Promontory Frank Island Dot Island even West Thumb This is my Park We have talked about maybe trying to ski right across to West Thumb but are wary of open water We stick to the eastern shore and rip past one point after another By early afternoon the day has turned into a keeper Its sunny with ha rdly any wind And we are loose on Yellowstone Lake like a bunch of criminals Just having the time of our lives We stop briefly when trading leads otherwise its heads down hammering But this is not a death march Th is is pure joy We feel invincible and want to see what we can do After a winter of going slow we want to push it home The smell of the barn is overwhelming now We can taste the finish line And its only PM Sometime after rounding Park Point I glimpse Steamboat Point in the far distance I recognize it and know where the road comes in It can only be a few miles now After passing Elk Point I start to go flat out The movement feels good I dont know how long I can keep it up but Il l stick with it for now Joe sees that its still about four miles to go and ha s the sense to maintain a normal pace I cant even feel my pack Either Ive done permanent spinal damage and have lost all feeling in my shoulders or Ive learned how to pack light at last Kick and glide I cant believe Ive been missing this all th ose years I spent skiing on fixed heel gear The snow hisses by Home stretch now One more small bay to cross and thats it I can see the road cut ahead I feel like I could get airborne with a little more effort A thundering final burst sees me to the line Thats it Im there I slide to a stop All the cold all the bad snow Its all been wiped away by the last four days I want to start shoutin g We made it Yellowstone my Yellowstone Thorofare I cant even thin k and luckily there is no need to Joe comes in and we stand there resting Then its time to go ashore Just in time for a glorious sunset across the lake Luck is with us and we get a ride out first thing in the morning as we had hoped Driving back to Jackson my thoughts race over the great landscape we have passed through There are so many more trips to do so much more t o learn But for a first time visit to Thorofare weve done pretty well Not only did we get to the place itself we got to the very heart of its spirit Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at LegVdoc

Winston Goodbody PM To cc Subject Update from First Leg Hi All Heres a preview of a story that should be going up on our site soon Win DDDDDD Greater Yellowstone Ski Traverse Update for Leg South Pass to Cora By Win Goodbody The weather gods must have been in a good mood Maybe they had a good New Years party On previous trips to the Wind River Range I had grown accustomed to spending large blocks of time in the tent waiting for storm after storm to subside If one of every two days was suitable for venturin g outside I considered it a bit of luck But this time was different In the middle of January we enjoyed an amazing consecutive days of good weather for our mile ski traverse of the Wind River Range The drive south toward Lander WY revealed an alarming lack of snow both i n the mountains and lower down where we hoped to start This has not been a good winter so far in the Yellowstone region and we wondered what conditions would be like in the Wind Rivers Luckily with the final gain in elevation as we neared the Continental Divide and South Pass enough coverage materialized for us to ski away from the car We had day packs an d pound sleds Starting out with an approach of several days across lowlands was an interesting way to ease into the trip Instead of driving right up to the base of the mountains we had to work a little bit to get there Even though we were on open range with scattered trees this was some of the trickiest route finding we would encounter anywhere on the route Steepsided drainages and minigorges suddenly appeared in the otherwise mildly rolling terrain requiring detours and delays For a few days we thrashed across the prairie landscape moving toward distant peaks that didnt seem to be getting much closer The or inches of snow on the ground were completely rotten and our movement was half skiing half snowshoeing Each step sank to the ground and ski tips snagged in exposed sage brush When we came upon a perfectly groomed but empty Continental Divide Snowmobile trail we took advantage of it to quickly reach the Little Sandy drainage our entrance to the mountains We were by now settling into our routines relearning winter camping skills dividing repetitive tasks and adjusting to the cold With only about hours of daylight our schedule was remarkably busy It was a struggle to get moving by each morning even though we got up at Lunchtime arrive d immediately Just as quickly the sun dipped behind a peak and it was time to make camp After eating dinner we scurried into our down bags for a hour sleep The days flew by and we focused on putting miles beneath the sleds while the good weather lasted not knowing it would last indefinitely We were comfortable but every waking moment was occupied and there was n o time for relaxing We seemed to be always on the move The price to be paid for clear sunny days is clear cold nights and about a week into the range when we were up above feet nearly all the time we had our first taste of real cold It was the night we camped in the Cirque of the Towers and we were in our floorless cook tent We had excavated a basement a few feet down to the ice of Lonesome Lake Except for the entranceway all the sides of the tent were flush with the snow surface and with both stoves going it was pleasantly warm inside After dinner as we sat reading I sensed some sort of change Then I knew what it was Searing cold air was draining into the tent and spilling across the floor like a poisonous gas You could feel it cool your face try to get inside your clothes turn your water bottle into a frozen brick I imagined my candle snuffing out refusing to burn at such an obscene temperature I went outside to check my key chain thermometer under a sky of blazing stars The cheap gadget was maxed out It was at least F The cold was like a deafening air raid siren There was no escaping it That same cold was to stay with us most nights and mornings for the next or days In the evening before going to bed I would check the thermometer All the red fluid was huddled in the ball at the bottom too scared to try for a run up toward the numbers It was the same each morning The daily temperature swings were tremendous We would go from F or lower to F in a matter of hours in the morning The warm midday sun was always a relief but it didnt last Our joy at being ab le to ski along in just a shirt was tempered by the knowledge we would soon be wearing every layer of clothing we possessed In the evenings as soon as the sun went down the temperature headed south with merciless speed Deep cold is to the sense of touch what the Grand Teton or Old Faithful or a radiant sunrise are to the sense of sight It is truly an amazing natural phenomenon to be reckoned with We marveled at it again and again this thing you cannot see or hear or smell It is both beautiful and horrifying an undeniably authentic experience that leaves an imprint on your memory but with luck not on your toes or fingers It might be hard to explain why it is a fascinating spectacle to behold but there is no denying that it is As the days went by we became students of this strange invisible force But of course we still got cold every day Our good weather continued and we knocked off high pass after high pass on our voyage north Some days we even crossed two passes and multiple drainages For mid winter we were really moving fast With so little sno w on the ground at least we were not delayed by having to worry about avalanches Without consciously deciding to do so we were in fact traveling harder during the day stopping later each night and spending less time readying a good camp More and more we were going flat out all day and then just collapsing at night to wake the next morning and do it again Our traverse was imperceptibly developing all the classic symptoms of what I have come to know as a death march Though a death march typically occurs at the end of a tour when the desire to exit is so strong it can make you g o all day or all night without thinking of the consequences a death march ca n also occur at any time during a trip For example if you discover you havent brought enough food you might need to go full bore for days on e nd Or maybe you hear a storm is coming and decide to turn on the after burner to reach a safe haven Probably the defining characteristic of a death march is that you never intend to get into one to begin with But there comes a point when like an investigator you step back for a minute examine the evidence of your daily life and it suddenly dawns on you that a death march is in full swing and you are powerless to stop it The horror The horror At the outset of the leg we were putting in good days because we wanted to get up into the high peaks where the real trip would begin Once we were there we wanted to put in some good days while the weather lasted to make some progress before the inevitable endless blizzard that would surely descend After we had been going about days and did some math based on the miles we had covered and what still lay ahead we realized that we woul d not have time to exit as we had originally planned In fact even after cutting off some substantial passes and distance it was still going to be all we could do to make it out in the time allotted So we decided to put in more good days We always had a reason for not resting for going hard day after day One night while thawing my foot out over the stove I realized we were not going to have a single rest day We were going for it We had gotten sucked in We were on a death march The long days alone would have been manageable but we had a growing proble m that was interfering with our ability to recover and rest each night Our sleeping bags were filling with ice which impaired their ability to loft and hence insulate us This is a common problem in extreme cold As you sleep you radiate moisture and heat The moisture passes through your sleeping bag and escapes into the air When it is very cold however the temperature difference between the air inside your bag and the air outside is too great for moisture to pass through the bags outer skin As moisture goes to move that last millim eter from the comfortable F temperature inside the bag to the outside air it gets walloped with a degree temperature difference lets say it s F out Instead of escaping the moisture freezes on the inside of the bag s outer shell This problem seems to be worse with high tech laminate materials designed to impede the flow of moisture usually rain into the bag from the outside This is a cumulative condition and gets worse each day as another night s moisture is added to what is already frozen in the bag Unless the bag is thawed out and dried there is no solution and you will reach a point wher e all insulating qualities have been lost and you are better of just sleeping on your insulated pad in your clothes We had already taken to wearing mos t of our clothes inside our sleeping bags and this just barely worked Still more and more of each night was spent tossing and desperately huddling into some new contorted position in an attempt to avoid feeling th e hideous cold of yet another clear night As light at the end of the tunnel appeared our daytime efforts reached a fever pitch Day miles Day miles Day miles Day miles And these were by no means easy flat miles They were trailbreaking miles up and down passes all above feet Reaching th e entrance to Titcomb Basin we veered northwest toward the origin of the Green River at Peak Lake Originally we had planned to go north from Titcomb past Gannett Peak as far as Downs Mountain the last peak above feet in the Winds before falling off to the west down Roaring Fork eventually reaching the Green River drainage But because of time low snow and a desire to live we had altered our course to head directly down the Green Going over the top at Cube Rock Pass we caught a glimpse thousands of feet down the Green River drainage The end was near but we were still looking at another two days to get to Green River Lakes campground where we hoped to solicit a snowmobile ride for the remaining miles to our car in Cora The view down the upper Green as it plummets from near Peak Lake is shocking We silently gazed miles down a classic deeply carved thickl y forested valley wedged between impassable rocks walls Toward their northern end the Winds turn into a series of high broad plateaus above feet and the chief difficulty exiting is finding some way down Many of the drainages that cut this plateau are gorges sheer cliffs or other features unfriendly to ski tourers with sleds As we had changed our exit route we had not gone all the way north to the real plateaus But even here getting down was going to take some doing Day was the first time we allowed that most cruel of thoughts to enter our minds perhaps this was the day we would get out Eating pizza in Jackson tonight Sleeping indoors not encased in an ice tomb No more holding frozen body parts over an open flame Perhaps We slowly suffered up Vista Pass where the summer trail leaves the Green River for about miles and descends a neighboring creek I had got into the habit over the last few days of proclaiming that some feature or other was really goin g to be the last uphill Usually as soon as this sentence hit the air we wo uld round a corner to glimpse another uphill ahead But I was undeterred by past failed prophecies and once again suggested to Joe that this is it He said nothing Whereas early in the trip I felt strong and had been happy to break trail for hours at a time the death march and lack of sleep had taken their toll and the wheels were coming off I had no enthusiasm for leading I felt like the walking dead and just wanted to follow my eyes locked on a track in front of me legs trudging on automatic pilot But as I grew weaker Jo e became unstoppable He was increasingly pulling the boat over the final days and I was happy to let him Especially going downhill though tricky steep sections he raced far ahead Perhaps it was a desire to escape my singing that drove him forward I sang many pop songs past and present but refused to sing Neil Diamond Joes favorite artiste As this dispu ted issue festered Joe seemed eager to put more and more distance between the two of us As it turns out Vista Pass really was the last uphill and now it was time to go down After a few hours of easy traversing we lost the trail and decided to descend a steeply falling stream choked with enormous boulders Seemed like a good idea at the time I guess Joe was in front skiing straight downstream and stopping only for the most absurd drops He was soon out of sight Following his track was a bit of an eye opener It fel t like the cartoon where you come upon a set of ski tracks that split around a tree In leather boots and telemark bindings with a large sled Joe was sticking and foot drops I stared in disbelief at the smooth sled trac k that went over the top of a boulder then straight down for a few feet the n continued on I had more solid AT gear but there was no way I was doing that I was sure Id break a ski Later Joe confided that the way hed been able to descend these boulder s was to surf down sloughs of snow As he went over the tops of rocks snow would slide off and cushion his descent and landing But as the second guy down the course I enjoyed none of this extra padding It was all gone Instead of using the Hartney straightline method I tried side stepping dow n from the top of the boulder turning my skis perpendicular to the fall line that my sled wanted so desperately to follow at great speed It didnt work too well Shorn of most of their snow the boulders it turned out were covered with glare ice Again and again I would be just about to take the final step down when my skis would slip I fell over my skis downhill faceplanting in the stream bed The sled then crashed on top of me I struggled to release skis and waist belts Once I had to get out my shovel and dig to find a pole that went astray in a particularly juicy fall To make matters worse I was getting wet from these repeated snow baths Some time during this carefree afternoon I looked down and noticed that where the solid metal tow bars of my sled connected to the plastic hull there was a grave problem The connection points were tearing away from th e body and threatened to come off altogether When and if that happened I would be reduced to fashioning a rope and stick contraption to bind the sle d to my body I shuddered to think what such a caveman era contraption might do to our progress and tried to face plant less often on the rest of my stream run At last the track I was following left the creek and I thrashed down into dense woods where I found Joe looking at the map and having a snack It looked like hed been there for quite a while I waited for some sign f rom him that maybe the creek had been kind of tough Nothing I acted nonchalant That was fun Yeah Joe said I broke my sled it looks like I countered Oh really Finally I had to ask Did you fall at all back there What He was looking at the map Oh no I did have to slow down at one point though Here Id spent the last hour egg beatering down the creek like someone just introduced to skis And Joe had to slow down once The poor kid Needless to say we didnt make it out that day But we did make it to the valley floor Flat ground at last Now I could claim that there would be no more uphill or downhill But all was not yet goodness and light and we soon found ourselves wallowing in some of the worst snow imaginable Deepe r than the snow we had battled through at South Pass it exhibited the same general characteristics Deeply rotten and unsupportable yet dense and heavy it was nearly impossible to move through We were snowshoeing again pulling our ski tips out of the snow at each step and stepping on the surface only to sink down a foot Pure hell Too spice up what promised to be hours and possibly days of fun battling our way out I decided to make a quick sight seeing trip to the other side of the Green River After plunging through the ice and almost losing a ski in the swift flowing current I reluctantly came back across and started sloshing down the trail like a good boy My skins were now coated with ice which removed any possibility of sliding on them Oh well That night we made a fire and fe d it with prehistoric glee which somewhat warmed our outlook and dried my boots But we still werent out Day Joe and I dont need to verbalize this but its just sort o f understood that there is absolutely no way we are not making it out today No chance of not getting out today Nope I mean zero chance We even ge t up in the dark for an early start to ensure that no matter what the day may throw at us earthquakes volcanic eruptions meteors etc we are still making it out As I flee the ice bag I notice its only F down here in the sultry valley Even though he broke trail most of yesterday Joe is out in front again The snow is worse than ever Somehow even with a trail to follow I can t really keep up I occupy myself with bitter frivolous Well at least were not getting attacked by a moose kind of thoughts I look arou nd for some small forest creature to curse at Anything to divert attention from the pain in my feet and legs Damn pikas Bloody chipmunks But there s nothing about Staggering along I feel almost like a third party to our plight like Im watching it on tv Tra la la This is pretty fun I l ie to myself But our suffering pays off We come upon a lake Could this be Green Rive r Lakes We consult the map Surely there must be some mistake I wait for Joe to inform me that weve made a wrong turn and are actually in northe rn British Columbia hundreds of miles from the nearest road But no As if a ramp of light had descended from parted clouds to our feet the lake lies there like a highway Trumpets are sounding Angels are fluttering above motioning us forward Not only will trail breaking be easier we now have certifiable proof that we are only miles from Green River Lakes campground a snowmobiling mecca Its only about pm and clear and su nny Surely there will be hundreds of people out on a day like this even if i t is a Tuesday We have visions of having to fight back hordes of attractive female snowmachiners all clamoring to be the ones who will give us a ride back to Cora miles distant Well probably need flak jackets We pick up the pace Or rather Joe picks up the pace Apparently he think s he may still have a good chance of competing in some nordic events in the Olympics in Salt Lake because hes going down the lake like a rock et Hes not even going in a straight line Hes swerving all over the p lace going like a madman for the finish line He doesnt care because WE ARE GETTING OUT TODAY One thing I do have going for me is that I can plot a straight course for the point where we will exit the first lake so I regai n some time We cross the first lake There are ski tracks in the snow Humans At the second lake where the wilderness boundary ends I am about as happy as I have ever been to see snowmobile tracks all over the place But strangely ominously no machines At pm we are at the campground Snowmobile tracks everywhere Its j ust a matter of time I tell myself Theyll be here We reach the far end of the campground where the road heads off for Cora and do some gear rearranging readying ourselves for that magic ride We scatter things all over the road effectively blockading it Nobody is getting by here withou t picking us up The sun is still shining and its downright warm As a little joke I take my sleeping bag out and set it on a tarp to begin the drying process which I imagine will really kick into gear in about three hours when were back in Joes living room in Jackson and have turned up the thermostat to about F Just a bit of fun putting the bag out like this I mean its not like were going to need the thing tonight Total silence Wonder where they are these bilers Must be a local tradition to stop at this time each afternoon for a moment of silence or something We start getting a little upset Almost indignant Dont t hese people know how to have fun Where are they A day this beautiful and noones out on their machines Where is everyone off cross country ski ing or something Suns going down now For gods sake WHERE ARE THEY And then just as faint as the sound of a mosquito we hear it A little buzz Was that the wind No I still hear it Could it be a plane Buzz Buzz Buzzzzzzz No sound could be more soothing more friendly more welcome at that moment than this the sound of not one but several two stroke engines heading our way We finally crack Screams high fives arms raised Hysteria release W e knew it We knew wed make it out tonight Victory is ours We are go ing to live After a minute or two I realize that maybe if I stop shouting and set about repacking the crap Ive strewn all over the road well look a little more appealing A little more like someone these gracious heroic goodnatured bilers will want to pick up I lower my arms wipe the te ars off my face and start jamming the ice bag back into its stuff sack We start cleaning up In an instant we are already mentally back in Jackson Back in town Back indoors As if transported by a futuristic machine we are no longer at a remote trailhead miles away from a town o f maybe people in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming We are home We are warm We are about to have dinner Joes in the shower Im checki ng my email Beam me up Scotty For some reason the bilers there are of them have stopped almost a mile short of our little shanty town and have turned off their machines Now that doesnt look good The sun has just gone behind a peak and in abo ut minutes the temperature will go into freefall We cant imagine why anyone would come the miles out here and not go all the way to the lake which is on the other side of us Theyre probably playing a game of rockpaperscissors to decide who will be the lucky two to host us on the ride back but we are sure not taking any chances Maybe they just haven t seen us Before I can suggest that hed probably enjoy some brisk skiin g after such a slack days Joe has stripped off his skins and is skating down the road toward our motorized friends to make sure all is well with uh you know the pickup and the ride back and everything I get out my telephoto lens to watch and maybe document this historic meeting Im sure that as soon as he gets the aok Ill be hearing a lot of noise from Joe I imagine the bilers responses You skied mil es from where Good lord son you get on the back of this machine and were go ing back to my place for a full blown steak dinner right now Here Ill ju st call ahead and get that in the works Now wait just a minute there Bill Who said were going to your place Were having it at my house Jimmy over my dead body Were going to my house and were havi ng a dinner and dance and then were taking them to Vegas for a week And i f anyone else tries to contribute one penny to the expense theres going to be a fight Its all on me Sorry Bobby but its just not going to be like that at all Were going to my place were eating for two days and then Im taking them to meet the Governor before we head to Acapulco for a week And Ill be damned if my two daughters arent coming with us I start to get a warm fuzzy feeling These are my people Im determined to try snowmobiling as soon as possible Maybe even convert Screw this skiing stuff I want horsepower I start singing as I pack up my sled The first sign of trouble is when the four riders start their machines and set off headed toward me But Joe remains standing in place like a fence post Hes not moving at all I figure hes just so bowled over by all the outlandish offers of hospitality weve received that hes wondering h ow were going to be able to make it out of Cora in less than a week What with all the parades barbecues snowmobiling with the mayor square dances and motivational talks at the high school we may have to push back the nex t leg of our Yellowstone traverse by at least a few days Here come the bilers Joe is still doing his frozen in place routine This does not look good I reluctantly clear a path to let the four riders through our barricade Well they may be getting to the lake I think but they cant get out The most worrisome thing is that they do not stop to talk to me and only one even waves No eye contact at all Thats alright I think Out of consideration for us theyre hurrying as fast as they can to get a glimp se of the lake and then theyre going to zip back and get us Well tal k back at their place They just dont want us to spend a single additional mi nute outside How kind of them Thats why they didnt stop Then it hits me The music stops the needle goes screeching across the record Were in trouble here Something is terribly terribly wrong This is just not how people who are about to bring us home to feast with their extended family should be acting Joe is moving now at least He ha s taken his skis off and is walking back toward me at a very slow speed I shout to him Well No response Joe JOE I re peatedly shout at him as he approaches within yards Hes not answering God this lo oks bad I instantly readjust my internal fun meter from being back in Jackson watching tv to Defcon Ive been yanked out of the shower and Im at the North Pole having just been given the news that the pickup flight is not coming and we have to make the mile trek home by dogsled And we don t have any sled dogs so well be using marmots instead Its pretty cl ear we are not getting a ride back with the boys Joe confirms this with very few words when he arrives The party consisted of a Wyoming guide and three clients from Michigan The guide mumbled some bologna about how he could lose his license if anyone saw him giving us a ride Joe kind of tried to laugh this one off at first but then realized the guy was serious He did not want to help us who knows why This outcome was so unexpected and so incomprehensible to us that we just sat there at first It was like a truck coming across someone in the Sahara Desert Sorry Id love to pick you up but you might put your feet on the dash and smudge the leather Would any skier coming across a broken do wn snowmobiler miles from the road refuse to help refuse to lend a hand in any way We couldnt fathom this Where was the back country fellowshi p the shared camaraderie of a couple of hearty souls out in Wyomings wildness Sorry It wasnt there this time We were crushed The previously valiant ambassadors of world peace and brotherhood now hateful bubbleheaded practitioners of an idiotic environmentally damagin g sport came roaring back from the lake on their gas pigs I stared at them menacingly They did not stop Good thing for them We spent minutes on tirades and diatribes best not recalled in print and then we got out ou r pathetic list of options We had already gone about miles that day I dont know about Joe but after straight days of going for it I was a mess It was pm Another miles separated us from the car and salvation We could either camp and continue in the morning or keep going a little further until dark Or of course we could commit to the grand finale death march We decided on the death march We would eat dinner pack it up and go until we got to the car Just another miles It wouldnt be so bad A rational person might have pointed out that we were looking at a mile da y and night but our thinking was not exactly sharp as a laser From step I knew it was a mistake for me but Joe definitely had the fire for getting out We set off at nearly full speed with evening coming on and rich alpenglow coating all peaks in sight Every step hurt Every minute I wanted to stop I lasted about an hour before seriously considering stopping for the night Another key characteristic of the death march is that one person wants to do it and the other really doesnt but just goe s along with it It was clear who was in which role This was sort of a new experience for me for I usually played the guy trying to get the other to keep going Not this time I knew Joe was not going to be happy when he heard I wanted to stop For a seeming eternity I heard myself mouthing the words I think we sh ould stop But I held on Just another step Take another step and see ho w it felt It felt bad My feet were on fire My legs were slightly numb down the sides I was hobbling I felt about as comfortable on skis as Woody Allen But the worst thing was that we had no way to measure our progress We did not recognize the route could not assess how much farther had no landmarks It could be another hour or another I had myself convinced we could ski four miles an hour By that math we should be able to reach Cora in time for last call Or at least in time to round up an angry mob o f torchbearing villagers to go hunt down the four bilers who were guilty of crimes against humanity and must pay Darkness Temperature down to a cheery F Real heat wave here in t he shadow of the Wind River Range Its another clear windless night on t he range as we slowly painfully make our way out of the mountains The ice hard road crunches under our skis Dead silence otherwise At last the pyschological brutality of simply not knowing how much longer breaks me an d hours into the death march even though I have convinced myself we must be half way I mouth the words Im not asking Im telling As sel fish as that may be I cant go on I know Joe is severely displeased but he agrees silently and we stop to set up the tent In minutes we are huddling in the ice bags praying for warmth Looking back I am amazed we survived as long as we did on the trip with ou r sleeping bags considering the state they were in Usually the bag is a saf e house a place to go when all else goes wrong a place to retreat to But in our case it was the opposite Because the weather was so perfect the days were our sanctuary the place we could recover from our torment in the bags and get warm again Had it not been for the perfect weather we could not have lasted But we managed to just barely hang on and tolerate our sleeping bags as they became of less and less use each day Until they were of no use whatsoever Inside the tent we are both thrashing around in our bags fully clothed I put on my down jacket inside the bag for the first time Luckily we both have down pants which we have been wearing to sleep for more than a week The bags are doing more harm than good at this point but we dont really get that The thought does nt occur to us to try sleeping without the bags Its obvious that neither one of us is asleep or headed anywhere remotely near sleep For the first time on the trip I am not satisfactorily warm at night I can survive but it i s not going to be comfortable Maybe wed be better off going for the car I cant face that unknown quantity Another hours More I realize we are looking at a sleepless night hours of waiting for the sun to come back around After an hour Joe announces he cant sleep and wants to keep going He s wet and cold and getting worse in the ice bag We talk about it and decide he will go for the car and I will stay the night continuing at first light The thought of getting out of the bag cold as it is putting on frozen boots hitching up the sled and continuing almost makes me want to get physically ill but Joe still has something left He departs at pm back out into the cold clear Wyoming night I drift in and out of sleep I actually do attain some warmth but somehow I am also getting wet Must have slipped off my pad Dont care I am cramped and crippled a few limbs need blood but rolling over acts like a huge vacuum that takes away any heat I have so I lie still My watch says am when I check it Only another few hours and Ill be on my way I eve n consider getting up right then and continuing but dont I think of Joe and the brutal death march he must have faced or might still be facing Hope he makes it I drift off again am I hear a noise Sounds like an engine Its not a snowmobile Not highpitched enough Sounds like a car In the space of one minut e I go from sleeping to wide awake and out of the ice bag I know exactly whats happened and I am ecstatic Its Joe He has driven the car back down the snowmobile trail to get me Bugles are sounding and the cavalry i s thundering over the hill flags all around No time is spent wondering exactly how Joe got the car here Before he has it turned around I am out of the tent and furiously packing my sled We have the tent down and my gear in the car in under five minutes I slip under skis and sled poles into the passenger seat and want to cry when I feel the heat blast from inside Joes had the heater on high for hours We head off with music playing and Joe hands me a glazed donut The contrast is too stark It cant be real I keep waiting to wake up in northern Iceland with the tent blown to shreds and our bags frozen hard as coffins But I am awake and we are homeward bound at last Joe happily relates his tale like hes telling me who won the Super Bowl and I look for a bullet to bite down on to stop my screams He left the tent to resume the death march at pm We figured we were half way so he was looking at another two or three hours at most More than five hours after leaving the tent close to am Joe reached the car It started Just the thought of going that long not knowing whether it might have been another five hours is too much for me to consider Suddenly all my past death march experiences were transformed into happy jaunts in the country with birds chirping in comparison with Joes saga After starting the car Joe made for a local convenience store and stocking up on junk food and coffee then returned to the trailhead At Green River Lakes we had joked how the snowmobile trail was hard enough to drive on Noticing there was no gate between the parking lot and trail Joe eased his Ford Escort up onto the trail The car didnt sink in at all He kept going and was soon whizzing down the trail So how far was it from the tent to the car Did you measure I asked miles With the heater on full and early morning of our th day starting to show itself in the rosy eastern sky we point the car toward a breakfast of eggs bacon and pancakes We had gotten away with murder and we knew it Never in our wildest dreams could we have hoped for such good weather We had done nothing to deserve it But with this unprecedented window thrown open to us we had breached the Wind River Ranges defenses and squeaked thro ugh In January Joe pops in a Neil Diamond tape and starts singing along Ive got some things to learn from this guy Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer

Goodbody AM To cc Subject Leg Update Hi Here is my update from our second leg Not quite as thorough as the first one Im afraid but were going to be saving our better writing for venues other than the web site Pictures should go up on the site soon yellowstonehtml Win DDD Greater Yellowstone Ski Traverse Update for Leg Cora to Jackson The Unbearable Lightness of Skiing By Win Goodbody Joe and I were in good spirits after the first leg It was a perfect opene r to our winter in Greater Yellowstone Despite the brutal cold and a marathon exit day it was on the whole an enjoyable time Perhaps too enjoyable After almost days back in town mending gear mind and body we departed for our second leg in the Gros Ventre Range with a cavalier attitude Though we had budgeted or days for this traverse we now thought it might take only a week But we were wrong Instead of a walk i n the park the Gros Ventres were a lesson in how slow and difficult progress can be when the weather turns bad We were sternly reminded that in adverse conditions the mountains hold all the cards We traded sleds for packs on this mile trip from Cora to Jackson It ha d been a long time since I carried a full pack and somehow I forgot there is a world of difference between pulling and carrying weight Joe wisely trimmed down as he set out what he was bringing Imagining more stellar sunrises and sunsets ahead I was determined to tote the same pounds of camera gear I had with me on the first leg Big mistake As we hefted our loads and pulled away from the car I knew I was in trouble My pack towered over Joes I could just barely lift it off t he ground It looked like I was setting off for months In addition to filling every cubic inch of interior space I had so many items lashed to the outside I felt like a backpackers version of the Joad family who f led the dustbowl with all worldly possessions hanging off their battered truck in The Grapes of Wrath I was to fare about as well on this trip a s the poor Joads did in Steinbecks bitter novel Good weather persisted as we made our way up Rock Creek to the high crest that runs continuously from just east of Bondurant all the way northwest past Jackson to Slide Lake and the Gros Ventre River We had hardpacked snow machine tracks to follow for the first two days On day approachin g the first pass by Hodges Peak we got a taste of world class wind It is not for no reason that Wyoming is a prime site for development of windgenerated power we learned Like the cold on the first leg wind was to be our constant companion on this trip It raged through the gap knocking over full water bottles left standing on the snow during a break Luckily the air temperature itself was mild or we would have been turned into frozen statues After traversing around the west side of Doubletop Peak through worsening visibility we emerged into clear calm air and a stunning sunset We had not known ahead of time whether or not we could get through a gap between two sets of cliff bands If we couldnt it was going to mean dropping a few thousand feet into a steep drainage we would then have to climb back ou t of a mile or so farther along But the gap went through easily and we turned the corner to find ourselves staring at a classic multitiered rock shelf that stretched away for two miles toward our next pass The red glow of evening coated sheer walls above as we made camp among giant boulders We were now solidly up on the Gros Ventre high route On the map it was amazing how little actual distance remained between us and Slide Lake the terminus of this section We had simply to cross a high basin another drainage and then follow a high plateau to Sheep Mountain from which it was all downhill The wind was blowing hard as we passed Palmer Peak the next day and set our sights on the Crystal Creek drainage A little while later it was blowing really hard We couldnt tell whether the snow flying horizontally past us was falling from the sky or being stripped off the ground but either way visibility was poor We went nonstop for a few hours to get off the expose d high basin where the Gros Ventre River originates Descending Crystal Creek we took our skins off and skied at a pleasant pace through nice powder snow to the valley floor As we went lower and got out of the wind we could see that it was indeed snowing and that there was about a foot of new snow on the ground Whereas up high the wind kept much snow from accumulating and sculpted what little coverage there was into a rock hard surface down here in the still densely treed valley the snow wa s deep and light That night we cheered ourselves by digging out a large shelter for our floorless cooking tent The Megamid is a pyramid tent that sets up easily After digging a square pit several feet down you erect the tent with one center pole and have a large warm area to sit in Sheltered from the wind we were very comfortable and drank cup after cup of tea and cocoa as we consulted the map and assessed the route ahead We hoped to wake and find blue skies Island in the Sky the plateau that was to be our highway for the remaining or miles before we descended toward Slide Lake was not fa r away The storm wasnt over the next day but it had stalled a bit We moved down the valley through deep snow and then started to climb up an adjacent fork Dense woods slowed us to near a standstill but by nightfall we had reached a spot where at least in clear weather we should have been able to see th e final climb up onto the Island The storm was now back on track and as we got higher we could feel the first brushes of what was undoubtedly a screaming wind up on the Island Again we excavated a deep pit for the Megamid and passed a warm evening inside wondering what the weather would do tomorrow The next day as was now becoming the pattern the morning was almost clear We got ourselves going and continued traversing up the side of Crystal Creeks West Fork headed for Island in the Sky As we passed over steep er terrain we noticed how fragile conditions had become with the additional load of new snowfall Everywhere we went we heard the snow collapse and shooting cracks ran in all directions Sloughs moved on even the smallest hillsides We sincerely hoped we would be able to find a route that did no t cross any open slopes By afternoon true to form the storm was back in high gear Trailbreaking was knee deep If film had been taken of us at this point maybe replaying it at fast forward speed would have looked like a normal pace The weight of my pack was becoming painful My left leg had strange tingles running down it and was slightly numb Joe said that happened to him sometimes whe n he carried a heavy pack Have you been carrying a heavy pack recently he deadpanned Despite the storm we could see the edge of the Island We were right at the base of it and only a few hundred feet of climbing would be necessary to get on top We were now at the head of the West Fork drainage and as w e approached treeline the wind increased Though it was only pm we decided to camp and wait one more day to see if the storm would abate If we were going to venture up high in these conditions we wanted to start first thing in the morning to have a full day to make our way across safely For the third night in a row we built a snug Megamid shelter I was awake most of that night listening to the wind and snow sometimes thinking it was easing But by morning the four day old storm was coming o n strong It was day of our trip We werent getting any breaks this t ime Knowing it could in fact go on like this for days we decided the sooner we got up and over the better Trailbreaking was difficult as we left the trees to negotiate a few small cliff bands At one point Joe set off a little slough that moved him downslope about feet The terrain was such that we were in no real danger but conditions were flashing a bright red light at us We knew we had no steep slopes to reckon with so we continued on hugging a scoured ridgeline where grass poked through the snow Soon we were on top Island in the Sky is a featureless plateau that runs for three or four mile s just south of Sheep Mountain and due east of Jackson Hole It is as high o r higher than anything to the immediate west and is thus exposed to the full force of the prevailing wind As we shuffled onto this no mans land I felt like a bug on a windshield The wind was shrieking Visibility was almost zero and we were navigating by compass alone I found that looking straight down at my skis was the best way to maintain balance as otherwise there was nothing to see but white and it was hard to tell whether you were standing or falling We leaned into the wind with poles splayed out on either side Sharp gusts or sudden pauses would precipitate frantic movements as we tried to readjus t our stances We were in the thick of it I think we both realized the seriousness of our position though we didnt talk about it Of course we could always retreat and wait another day but the desire to get out was strong As we continued four or five times just when we really needed some guidance we caught brief glimpses through the clouds of a ridge or valley far below These moments were enough to figure out where we were After two or three hours of feeling our way we made it to the base of Shee p Mountain Visibility was too low to see down the slope we thought we could descend so we set up our tent prepared for a windy night Waking up to clear skies in a place where you went to sleep unable to see anything is an interesting feeling Down below was Jackson and we were eight miles from the road It all seemed so much simpler now that we could see Of course we ended up making a wrong turn and a six hour bushwhack through enormous downfall and dense woods ensued Reminiscent of our last exit darkness saw us staggering onto a packed snow mobile trail A few more miles and darned if those werent headlights coming toward us a fr iend picking us up and just in time We really have to stop driving on those trails Taking that weight off my back for the last time was a relief As blood flowed and feeling returned I resolved to never again overload myself that way No more stuff hanging every which way off my phone boothsized pack Never again I would be a Joad no more Get your FREE download of

Resources Corp From Winston Goodbody AM To cc Subject Yellowstone Ski Traverse Update from Leg Hi All Heres my update for leg of our Yellowstone Ski Traverse As always full info on our trip along with pictures can be found on our web site yellowstonehtml Win Thorofare Yellowstones Heart of Gold By Win Goodbody Thorofare Creek Two Ocean Pass Atlantic Creek Yellowstone Point Ope n Creek To hunters from around the world these are more than just names of geographic features in northwest Wyomings Teton Wilderness They are legendary places renowned for abundant wildlife in the most remote area of the USs lower states The closest road is miles distant Right next door is Yellowstone National Park For those who know some part of the thousands of square miles of rugged terrain here on either side of the Park border the area is simply Thorofare Inside this one word fits th e very heart of Yellowstone country the distilled essence of everything that is great about this crown jewel of Americas natural heritage Thorofare really refers to two main drainages that grow from steep mountain creeks into larger rivers that meander through flat wide valley bottoms before merging Each drainage is initially tight and dense spilling down between rocky Absaroka peaks but then broadens and opens into vast meadows etched with old oxbows where waterways shift back and forth The Thorofare Creek drainage starts on the north face of Younts Peak near the Continental Divide and heads north before turning west The Yellowstone River drainage starts on the south side of Younts and goes west before turning north These two rivers wind around opposite sides of the massive Thorofare Platea u and then join just before entering Yellowstone National Parks southeast corner It seems odd that the river downstream of the confluence is called the Yellowstone for before they meet Thorofare Creek looks larger than the Yellowstone River From this point the Yellowstone flows north into the Park until it hits Yellowstone Lake some miles away Thorofare hosts the bulk of its human visitors during one concentrated period each year Every autumn in those parts of Thorofare outside the Park hunters arrive to pursue elk moose deer and other game Whether o r not they are in harmony with the letter or more importantly the spirit of the law there are in fact many permanent hunting camps scattered throughou t Thorofare and the Teton Wilderness and it is clear that hunting is big business Miniature towns spring up as large groups with convoys of horses haul in everything needed to live well for weeks on end The more developed camps feature raised platforms log furniture corrals and enormous gallon steel drums in which food is secured from bears Though there are usually ample numbers of animals to hunt outside the Park guides and outfitters will place salt licks just beyond the Park boundary in an effort to lure creatures out and ensure that paying clients have something to blast away at Other people far fewer in number come to hunt with camera and binoculars either in summer or fall For them just being in Thorofare and feeling th e pulse of this magnificent land is sufficient payback for the long journey in Here are also to be found animals that cannot be hunted such as wolve s and grizzly bears Despite all of the usual problems that will have an impact on Thorofares future this is still a staggering swath of relati vely undisturbed earth where to paraphrase the Wilderness Act of man is a visitor who does not remain All told several thousand people might pass through during the annual window of milder weather But for more than half the year from early November until early June no one comes With the first real snowfall the back country falls quiet and the last humans decamp for town A visit to Thorofare in winter is therefore a chance to experience real isolation and behold Yellowstones unique beauty during a harsh season This was the fourth leg of our Yellowstone traverse and a return to longer distance travel The second and third legs of the winter had each been hal f as long as the one before the first leg was miles the second was the third was We had to break out of this pattern I realized or we would soon be down to day trips of several hundred yards A trip into Thorofare was just the thing to turn our attentions back to bigger miles an d more challenging territory We figured it would take two weeks to cover th e mile route we had plotted Remote in summer Thorofare is even harder to reach when snow is on the ground Approaching from the south its miles through wild Absaroka territory Continuing from where we left off at the end of our last leg through the northern Gros Ventre Range we depart from Togwotee Pass in unsettled weather Scattered snow showers swirl around in a black sky After several sunny days in town which I used mainly to sit inside and eat too much it looks like we are at last due for some snow Amazingly Togwotee Pass is the first road running east west across the Continental Divide in Wyoming we have come to since starting our trip almos t two months ago miles to the south We will cross only one or two more roads between here and the northern turnaround point of our traverse at Bozeman Montana Heading north from Togwotee feels a little bit bleak even if we do have a groomed road to follow for the first few miles We re really leaving civilization behind and going deep into the woods this time Or so we think Five miles on a stunning old wooden lodge appears Built in it stands on the original highway to Yellowstone and was the stopping point for many illustrious personalities back in the day In more recent years I had heard from someone it was a basic back country lodge where you could stay or eat Just a nice place to stop in We ski hungril y to its door drawn by fullblown fantasies of one more night inside one last meal before being forced back into our pathetic floorless tent it s all weve brought this time where we live on dehydrated beans and stick s of butter Sadly Brooks Lake Lodge has turned into an upscale if barely patronized outfit of late a way station for private snowmobile tours The local henchman materializes instantly and removes us from the bar before we can even inquire whats on tap or find out if any of the paying guests want to put some money on a game of billiards I ask whether by any chance theres some unheated back hallway in employee housing where we could ma ybe curl up in our sleeping bags for the night The response is as warm as a mid February night in Yellowstone No can do We decide to retreat just beyond the fascist compounds perimeter to erect our shantytown for the night Its now snowing in earnest Its hard to explain the kind of magnetic appeal these last outposts of humanity exert on me as we leave on a trip It seems to be getting worse a s the winter wears on Each leg is just a little harder to embark on Each departure day especially if the weather is dark seems a little grimmer I feel I am looking for a reason any reason to put off for one more day the inevitable wilderness death march that is sure to come Any diversion at all to hang us up To be rebuffed at the lodge when comfort is so close seems unbearable Im just not ready to crawl into the sleeping bag aga in I almost want to shell out the for a night indoors And its not just major obvious pitstops like a lodge in front of my sk is that make me want to postpone the inevitable Outward bound on our drives from town to trailheads now every little gas station we pass suddenly look s like a great place to stop and explore They might have precious local gifts we can find nowhere else They might sell those orange hats that say My wife thinks Im hunting I need one of those Or maybe a pi ece of petrified wood with Wyoming emblazoned on it Definitely need one of those in the pack And I must get another road atlas for my collection Any kind of establishment that has anything for sale must be investigated Look over there Dont we need a pound chainsaw wood carving of a m oose head What to take with us Can we stop at this bathroom We just stopped minutes ago I know but I dont want to miss one Should w e stop for lunch here We already had lunch Twice I know butwe may n ever eat again Whoa there A point of historical interest Can we stop and read about how trapper Bucky nearly starved to death at this very spot years ago and had to resort to eating the leather from his snowshoes We really shouldnt Hits too close to home Plus its getting late Thats exactly the point I think If I can just stall for another hour or two we may have to wait another day before casting off Like sand slipping throug h my fingers the few remaining opportunities for frittering away time vanish into the air The trailhead is getting dangerously close now Doesnt look like theres any way out Wait Turn this car around I cant leave without knowing who won the match between the Jersey Penguins and the Hosers I try to disguise my inadequate knowledge of pro sports by keeping the references vague Leave off a city name here the full team moniker there Im sure as heck not going to risk mentioning a specific sport by name Cast the net wide I think Better chance of getting something Could be baseball basketball hockey Australian football or cricket Im talking about Jersey might mean New Jersey or maybe Im off in Britain following a darts tournamen t Have to keep Joe guessing There must be a pro sport game going on somewhere in the world at this moment And I have to know the outcome Im hoping cricket Dont those things go on for days We cant leave now not when Sri Lanka might be trailing Norway by hundreds of points or baskets or yards or whatever they have in that game Come on Sri Lanka No dice A last whimpering claim that Ive forgotten my stock car racing magazines and cant go forwar d without them does nothing to slow the car down The trailhead looms I m being delivered to my doom with no delay The morning after being denied our civil rights at the Brooks Lake Lodge w e awake to more snow Not what I was hoping to see Its coming down N ot really dumping but steadily snowing We may have a few inches from the night This is the first real accumulation from a storm weve seen this winter and it has an immediate effect on our mood Before Im more tha n three words into the sentence Ive crafted to subliminally convince Joe that maybe we should stay put and see what the weather does he practically shouts his assent to the plan Apparently were on the same wavelength Its the first rest day weve taken on the trail the first day we ha vent packed up and kept moving no matter what The very thought of sitting around drinking endless cups of tea and reading sounds like heaven to me And then there is the lodge with roaring fireplaces and gourmet food just across the way We vow to take a second shot at infiltrating the posh resort It turns out the lodge is open to the public read unwashed masses for lunch so we slink over and decide to pay way too much for a fabulous four course meal The fact that we are now actual customers parting with dollar s and not marauding visigoths for the moment keeps the welcoming committee from last night at bay I still feel like there is a closed circuit camera pointing at our table an d burly guards in an underground command center watching our every move but for the moment everything is ok Here it is day and Joes having the mushroom fettuccine while I demolish the linguine with cream sauce Our only concern is the size of the portions but we figure this isnt the u sual all you can eat joint were accustomed to and that a request for some more wouldnt be well received Now that weve taken the financial hit we decide to get our moneys worth We have justified the significant outlay for lunch as tickets to a day indoors the snow continues to fall Even though the restaurant closes at PM we hang around and play pool in the bar Then we settle in with some magazines and try to strike up a conversation with the bartender Maybe we can find some common ground that will lead to an invitation to sta y inside tonight Doesnt happen I watch him periodically out of the co rner of my eye to see if hes whispering into some tiny microphone on his lap el reporting back to the command center on our whereabouts Come PM Joe is still inside by the fire reading and smiling at every staff member who passes by They seem to be appearing with some frequency maybe to check whether hes still there Hes doing his best to look like a legitimate overnight patron but theyre not buying it Theyre prob ably trying to decide which of several different lodge security forces should be tasked with removing him Meanwhile Ive reached my shame threshold and have gone outside for a sk i around the lake not wanting to be present for the inevitable handson eviction that will occur as soon as our goon friend from last night returns Sure enough around PM Joe is formally asked to leave He goes without a fight and heads back to the tent to inform me of the defeat As much as we might want to its pretty clear by now that we are not go ing to be spending the rest of the winter at Brooks Lake Lodge I dont eve n think we can get away with our hour lunch scam again Im picturing a n all out offensive by the authorities to remove us from the immediate area and maybe Wyoming starting first thing in the morning if they so much as catch a glimpse of us We have to move Our choices are to turn around and ski the five miles back to the road wher e well start hitch hiking south to Mexico and a sunny beach or to push o n We decide on the latter and saddle up on the morning of day Were Absaroka bound Not a peep from the lodge as we head across Brooks Lake I look around half expecting to see artillery pieces on surrounding peaks swiveling towards us trained and ready just in case we change our minds an d try to head inside again But the layover was not a total loss Far from it In fact the poor weather motivated us to consult our maps for the first time and see exactly what we were getting into It was a bit of a wake up call We seem to be in the habit of planning most sections of our trip on very large scale maps Restaurant place mats of Wyoming road atlases maps of the US hanging in drug stores globes of the earth all of these have at one point or another been the research tool of choice for plotting our way through Greater Yellowstone The only problem with these topographic specimens is that they yield none o f the lowlevel detail necessary to actually navigate day by day What ends up happening is that the night before we leave on a leg assuming we have had the foresight to get our hands on a quad or other smaller scale map we sit down to examine how we might actually get through wherever it is we are heading Suddenly the landscape is full of cliffs avalanche slopes gorges and dense woods Its sort of like tracing a finger across a map of Arizona thinking it m ight be a fun hike then realizing you just crossed the Grand Canyon What looked pretty straightforward on the map of Wyoming that flashed across the TV screen during an evening weather report now looks downright impossible These are usually quiet moments as we each pore over the maps and realize that there is no way we can go where we thought we could Spreading out all our quad maps on the table in the lodge after lunch I glance nervously at the bartender to see if this breach of decorum might prompt a call to the command center we get a rude shock There is no way we are going to be able to follow the Continental Divide north from Brooks Lake to the headwaters of Thorofare Creek as was our plan The Divide here is a featureless plateau above treeline and getting on and off would require crossing steep slopes With this years poor snow conditions n ot to mention the storm that was currently unloading it would be plain foolis h to head up there Plus we dont have a real tent and our experience on Island in the Sky during leg has already filled my annual quota for traveling not to mention camping on exposed plateaus in high winds during whiteouts Its as if there is a blackboard in front of us with our route chalked o n it We get out the eraser and wipe the slate clean We have to rethink th e entire thing or at least the first half We notice there is a low route option It winds around and follows drainages where the Continental Divide route is straight but there are no dangerous slopes and it stays mostly on valley bottoms We hadnt thought of going this way before because of dreadfully dense wood s and the potential for out of body bushwhacking experiences but now we see there are trails we could follow It might not be too bad Yeah Ive heard that one before Without much discussion we mentally draw the new route up on the board Were happy about it It feels like a huge reli ef now to know that we arent going off to be sacrificed to the weather god s The optimism about our new route more than offsets any bad feelings from th e Brooks Lake Lodge affair and we set off excited and energetic I am rarin g to go and dont want to return to town anymore For two days we hack our way toward the South Buffalo Fork drainage The going isnt great we see some of the same bottomless collapsible junk weve come to expect and love but we are moving forward at least By afternoon of day we arrive at a hunting camp on the side of a large meado w below Pendergraft Peak In a low snow year such as this it is very easy to spot these camps some more elaborate than others The site of crude log structures and a large metal drum inspires us to make ourselves a home away from home We dig a large rectangular pit down to the ground and gather wood for a fire In an hour we are as comfortable as one could be in or out of town There are some large trees above us and even though snow is falling we are sheltered We stoke the fire gaze out into the Absaroka night and enjoy a break from the brutal cold that has followed us on past legs One of my favorite rationalizations is that it cant be brutally cold if its storming and vice versa So the good news tonight is that it isnt brutally cold Because its storming The next morning after more consulting with the maps we make the second major change in our route As snow continues to fall and we look at the area around Younts Peak on the quad for the first time of course we notice what a perfect avalanche slope our route crosses No way to avoid it This is where we planned to get over the Continental Divide which run s along the spine of the high Absaroka crest in this area Worse we notice that the trail on the other side of the Divide up Thorofare Creek stops before the head of the canyon There are several miles between where we would pass Younts Peak and pick up the trail on the valley floor below Hmmm I wonder why that is If there is anything I have learned so far this year it is to STAY ON THE TRAIL I have told Joe I will pay him for every time I suggest leaving the trail as long as he hits me with a shovel and prevents me from actually doing it If there is a trail through an area there is a reason for it And if a trail stops somewhere you can be darn sure there is a reason for it After all people have been traveling through these parts for hundreds even thousands of years Its highly unlikely that all the nice routes through havent been found already Adventurous off trail exploration i n a place like the Absarokas certainly has its place but not when youre tr ying to make good time with heavy packs in February Examining the tight spacing of contour lines on our quad map I see that th e upper Thorofare drainage near Younts Peak looks like prime habitat for some of my least favorite species namely cliffs and gorges I also suspect there are healthy local populations of downed trees and impenetrable brush lurking in there Our experiences leaving the trail along the Green River during leg and then again coming down Redmond Creek during leg have lef t too much emotional scar tissue to ignore I dont want to do it again I picture us rappelling with packs using the shoelace our foot section o f mm chord No thanks Afraid that a descent of the upper Thorofare would use up our lifetime quotas of world class bushwhacking and canyoneering we decide to nix it But we then see there is another way over the Divide with a trail the whole way Instead of going north from Younts and then west following Thorofare Creek toward the massive meadows where Thorofare Creek and the Yellowstone River meet we can go west and then north following the Yellowstone River Im disappointed we are abandoning Thorofare Creek but the idea of descending the Yellowstone River almost from its source which as for Thorofare Creek is Younts Peak is thrilling A few minutes spent with th e map and we are once again excited and happy with this change of plans There is no question its an easier route Also a little bit shorter All these breakthroughs in planning and navigation and its not even am Meanwhile as we realize the route just got easier and shorter and notice snow is still falling on and off and feel the warmth from the morning fire we have going at possibly the best camp site either one of has ever enjoyed in winter what do we decide to do buttake another day off and stay put Were getting used to this rest day thing now Its so easy to do You simply wake up and announce youre not going anywhere and then go back t o sleep Again I am the first to verbalize the concept unsure whether Joe is going to think I have gone completely soft The second rest day and it s only day Instead he responds as if Ive just offered to carry his p ack the rest of the trip A rest day it will be then Back to the fire Once again we are both thinking the same thing We spend the day lounging reading and collecting enough wood for a massiv e bonfire Before this winter I had only experienced one fire on an overnight ski trip and that was in June As I had never done it much before I never thought of making fire a part of the daily winter camping routine If you had asked me about having a fire in winter before this year I probably would have said it was a lot of trouble and not worth the effort But that was before I went ski touring with Joe Hartney A veteran of not one but several courses on tracking and outdoor skills taught by my fellow New Jerseyan Tom Brown Joe knows what hes doing ou t here Thank God one of us does I increasingly feel like I am playing client to Joes guide When it comes to fire Joe leaps into action lik e a dynamo He can have a blaze going in no time and seems to instinctively se t about gathering wood the moment we make camp much as I grab the shovel and start excavating a hole for our tent After seeing how easy it is to get one going in the right conditions I am now a winter fire convert A fire in winter is nice anytime anywhere but in the Absarokas right now conditions are so firefriendly that it is almost foolish not to have one Like much of the west the Absarokas are still bone dry after the active fire year in All the fuel that did not burn is still right there under a few feet of snow Actually the Absarokas themselves did not ignite much this past year but they could have Literally all you need to do to start a fire is brush the snow off a piece of wood and hold a match to it Its astonishing how dry it is You can hold a match to boughs on a dea d tree and ignite the entire canopy Past blazes killed many trees but left them standing They now fall down all over the place There are huge quantities of partially burned trees on the ground It takes little effort to find and collect them Possibly the best thing about winter fires is that you can have them in places you never could in the summer Whereas in current conditions a summer bonfire in South Buffalo Fork would set Wyoming on fire in winter its perfectly safe and manageable We leave our hunting camp on day and even though we have spent almost tw o days there doing nothing but eating and roasting next to the fire its n ot easy to pack up The weather remains spotty and we know were long over due for a pummeling But everything we own is dry and we are fully rested and beyond well fed Building on the obscene amount of food I consumed during the last stint in town I have continued to eat like its the end of the world and now feel a little sick I almost have to force myself to eat dinner just to keep the weight reduction program for my pack going but in truth Im no longer hungry I guess there are worse afflictions I could be suffering from in the back country Having gone as far as possible up the South Buffalo Fork were ascendin g Lake Creek toward the Continental Divide now We have to go up and over to hit the Yellowstone River and we pray for a decent weather window to see u s through Weve made all the route changes we can at this point There s no way to avoid this high crossing The first day going up is pretty good There are so many trail blazes on s o many trees we may as well have a set of runway lights guiding us along We dont even have to pay attention to follow the trail We get some sun splashes but no real views that paint a picture of the route ahead Can t really see where were going up above That night it clears up which brings back the cold Down to around F but were doing fine The next day we get going early and things look good initially We approac h within a mile or two of Ferry Lake Almost to the Divide All the snow thats been falling over the last few days is really adding up now We re glad we dont have to face that blank Younts headwall in what are surely terrible avalanche conditions Its deep powder Would be great skiing but were breaking trail through it A few hundred feet above Ferry Lake is a mild pass over the Divide that wil l deliver us into Woodard Canyon at the bottom of which we will hit the Yellowstone River our highway for the rest of the trip Once we reach the Yellowstone all routefinding and weather issues will be done as its fl at ground on the trail the rest of the way Even if its a raging storm we will be in the trees and can slog along ok I am looking forward to that moment even though I know we are sure to hit some terrible snow down there Id rather face the bad snow demon than be way up here waiting for the Blizzard of to kick in But it will have to be another day that we find out what Woodard Canyon looks like Quickly thoroughly the weather turns evil Its snowing and blowing and visibility deteriorates We cant actually see Ferry Lake but we know it must be there in front of us We leave the trees to start plodding up toward the lake and get a taste of the wind Its not an Is land in the Sky gale but still humming along all the same We cant see a thing We blunder around for an hour and incredibly are still not sure where the lake is This is a decentsized alpine lake and the fact that w e cant find it doesnt bode well for tracking down the pass above We take cover in a clump of windblasted trees to figure out a plan I know Joe wants to go up and over regardless Im not that concerned a bout finding the pass We can get out the compass and start flying blind if it comes to that Its more the question of what descending Woodard Canyon in the maelstrom will be like that has me worried Whereas we can put it in reverse retrace our steps and still find our way back to treeline and a feasible camp site on this side of the Divide once we go through the pass were just on our own in the whiteout with no knowledge of what lies ahe ad The voice of fear and paranoia prevails and I convince Joe that retreat sounds pretty good right about now We turn tail and though its not b een more than minutes or so since we entered the stand of trees our tracks have been erased by the wind We just took it as a given that our tracks would be there as an umbilical chord for at least a few hours or so in case we wanted to go back but theyre gone We eventually find them by prob ing around for a more supportable strip of snow through the white and manage to feel our way along We make it back into the woods by mid afternoon and set up the tent behind a massive tree that shields us from the wind almost completely Time to wait The storm rages on Its Saturday and I realize a good friend is hav ing a noholdsbarred th birthday bash back in Portland OR this very night The theme is Saturday Night Fever What I wouldnt give to be there Instead Im stuck here singing songs from the soundtrack The names of several of them such as Night Fever and Staying Alive seem rather appropriate given our situation From Joes scowl I can tell Im not the only one wishing I were elsewhere We get our window the next day It isnt clear but we can see the lake and once we reach it we can see the pass And then it does clear or at least on the east side of the Divide What we see confirms a halfbaked weather theory we have been working on the last few days Coming up the South Buffalo Fork we have had some real snow but we have also had nearly continuous light flurries as something frozen not snow falls from the air Its more like tiny pieces of frozen vapor This happens all the time even when skies are clear Its almost like any moisture that is in the air even if there are no clouds is being squeezed out Given the local topography this makes sense The Continental Divide here is a high mountain crest above feet and all weather moving west to east gets pushed up over this massive obstacle With the lifting the moisture has no choice but to come out Once we are at the pass and can se e both sides of the Divide we are given a stark piece of visual evidence that seems to support the theory To the west the South Buffalo Fork is a sea o f clouds while to the east down Woodard Canyon its a clear sunny day Descending Woodard Canyon is a joy The upper reaches of the drainage are so open we can just cruise along effortlessly I have taken up the call I championed toward the end of leg in the Wind River Range that its al l downhill from here While technically true its also almost miles to the road Joe strips his climbing skins off his skis and makes a few turns in perfect powder As we get into the woods we find more of the manic trai l blazes everywhere We lose the trail maybe once or twice while crossing open avalanche chutes but quickly rediscover it I have started to photograph these trail blazes I want a collection of them What could be more welcome to the eye of a ski tourer in the Absarokas than big fresh trail blazes We are really getting lucky with this one Before we know i t the downhill stops and we are standing on the bank of the upper Yellowstone River It seems hard to believe but we have penetrated to the inner sanctum How did this happen The moat has been crossed the turret guards sacked door s broken down inner courtyards laid waste maidens rescued from towers We are there We have battled our way through to the most remote place in the lower states And it wasnt even that hard We listen as our shouts of joy echo crazily up into the canyons I cringe to think how enraged the local weather gods will be when they wake up and see that we are already over the Divide and deep into the promised land Nothing they can do about it now Too late to throw the Blizzard of at us Sorry guys Mayb e next time I almost want to cry It feels indescribable to be here at last The Yellowstone River in February miles upstream from Yellowstone Lake I t seems so wild so quiet so alive so free and so far away Its a vis ion that could sustain decades of wilderness ski touring Just the thought tha t one day I might stand right here could get me through anything Steepsided cliffs and slopes of burned thin trees plummet down on all sides It feels massive an ocean of wilderness There are animal tracks everywhere The river itself is not very wide yet After all we are only a few miles downstream from its origin on Younts Peak and its just gett ing going But there is no mistaking that with a little care and feeding and a few hundred miles of flow this little whipper snapper is going to grow int o one of the great rivers of the Northern Rockies We stand and gawk The weather is lovely and late afternoon color starts to paint the scene This is one to remember Eventually we snap out of our stupor somewhat sobered by the realization that even if we have made it this far we still have a long way to go We continue along the trail more blazes for another hour before making camp We can just about see the opening ahead where the river veers north into a broad meadow Well surely reach it tomorrow Joe builds a small fire from burned downfall and we settle in for a cold clear night Day dawns perfectly clear and still A savage cold hangs in the air Th e weather gods know that their snow machine is now more or less useless as we are out of the mountains and can keep going in just about any storm conditions But maybe they can slow us down or at least make life just a bit uncomfortable with their cold machine Either they got a brand new turbocharged model for Christmas or some ace mechanic has given the old on e a complete overhaul The results are impressive Its in the F range which weve seen before but this just feels really really cold Joe and I leave the sleeping bags and immediately start doing the cold weather war dance This consists of jumping hopping running in place swinging arms and legs blowing on fingers anything to keep the blood flowing The dance is an awkward enterprise to begin with and the fact that the snow is completely unsupportable at our camp site doesnt make things any easier You cant just roam around anywhere as one step on any snow we haven t painstakingly packed down will result in a thigh deep plunge Not what we need right now Weve each sculpted our own little platforms and stand watching each other flop and twist Talking at this point is strictly forbidden aside from the occasional obscenity or prehistoric grunt Tra l a la Ah Yellowstone Even as we plow into the normal morning routine of making breakfast and breaking camp the dance must continue This makes for a haphazard on agai n off again kind of progress that would probably be humorous to watch if we werent living it Everything happens in fits and starts You cant get out your stove light it and start melting some snow in one continuous process By that time your hands would be frozen solid You have to do on e little thing then rewarm Do the next little thing then rewarm As it so happens the cooking area we hastily set up the night before is wedged against the fire pit Theres not much room for dancing in there But dancing is mandatory so I frantically pioneer a new traveling variatio n going back and forth between the cooking area and my platform I go and se t up the stove Hands are now numb so I head back to the dance platform careful to only step on the few packed footprints that will support my weight on the way Swing hop jump blow shake Now theres some fee ling so its back to light the stove Into the fire pit I fill the stoves primer cup with fuel Wheres the lighter I start searching zipped compartments in my jacket Damn zippers Cant really operate them with gloves on Not in that one Hands are heading south fast Theres the lighter Its in a ziploc bag Str uggle to open it ATTENTION HANDS WILL BE FROZEN HARD AS WOOD IN SECONDS Im getting an alert from the engine room that I should head back to the dance platform but I just want to get the damn lighter out at least on thi s run Ziploc wont open BEGIN COUNTDOWN Got the light er out May as well try to start the stove while Im here I flick it Nothing Shake it I take off my glove to work th e lighter with my bare hand Boy is it cold It wont light though it n ow feels like my hand is on fire Too late ABORT ABORT I cram my useless limb back in the glove and hobble over toward the dance floor In my haste to get there I miss one of the packed footsteps It s as if I stepped into space I plunge in to my thigh and as I wasnt expecting this at all and am caught completely off guard I fall face first into the snow Getting up isnt easy because again theres nothing to push solidly on to right myself except the packed spots which have now bee n obscured by my floundering Its a full snow bath as I thrash around in the white stuff Joe seems to be enjoying this At last I get up I pull my submerged leg out of the posthole but my camp bootie catches and remains lodged three feet down My socked foot comes ou t on its own and is instantly ice cold I balance on my one foot that has a bootie not wanting to have to step into the snow with my sock but pretty sure thats going to happen Somehow I get the wayward bootie back and put it on On to the dance floor at last for some super charged disco movements Time to get funky And so the morning goes The sun hits camp at about am and the temperature leaps We realize part of the trouble is that weve camped in a classic cold air sink right next to the river bottom Its taken longer than usual this morning to activate the or degree temperature swing weve come to expect Its going to get up to F today As we war m up we wonder what all the fuss was about This is the day we make it out into the open After several hours on the trail we reach the burned fringes of the first of several large meadows along the upper Yellowstone The snow has been mixed alternating between supportable and rotten junk Through the burn its not too bad We re actually covering ground Late in the afternoon when we try to head straight across the first open swath of flood plain we find out what bad snow is all about Its thigh deep junk Each step goes right to the ground We have to l ean back on our skis to keep tips up lest they snag in the ample bushes We re snowshoeing postholing on skis The pace is excruciatingly slow Looking behind us it appears we have shoveled a three foot deep trough through the meadow Were submarining along still about miles from Yellowstone Lake and from the Lake its another miles to the road and have five days of food left At the speed we are going now we could easily run out of food before we make it out Our spirits previously sky high turn morbidly dark Reaching the north side of the meadow we decide to call it a day and resor t to our favorite antidepressant to lighten things up fire Joe starts hauling in entire trees I begin excavating an enormous rectangular area for the fire and our camp The snow is three feet deep but I outline a foot by foot area and start digging An hour and a half later we have ourselves an amazing pit beside a beautiful meadow It is quite possibly the greatest camp site ever And the sun is still up Our moods swing degrees again and we enjoy a long night of stoking the fire and eating Its such a beautiful night we decide to just sleep out under the stars in our giant pit Its going to be another cold one I wake up at am My feet are going numb I wish I had left a stove se t up next to me so that I could cook a hot water bottle to put in my sleeping bag but I forgot Im conscious of a fiendishly powerful force that see ks to strip any warmth I have accumulated in my bag Its horrendous Muc h too cold to even get up and try to put on more clothes or get warmer I huddle and fiercely rub my feet together for the rest of the night I don t fall back asleep This is all part of being admitted to the inner sanctum I say to myself The good news is that it isnt storming Because it s brutally cold Joe probably interprets my getting up at am to build a fire as a weird sign Something must be up Hes done about all the fire building so f ar I just gather wood But here I am out of the bag breaking sticks and stacking them in a pyramid I have waited as long as I can and its no w light out I need to get warm and I know this is no ordinary morning Not a cloud in the sky and dead calm But its colder than usual I can fe el it Before I even consult my little key chain thermometer I am fully prepared to swear that this is the coldest temperature I have ever experienced I just know it is When I check the thermometer its doing something Ive never seen bef ore Whereas we are used to seeing it maxed out at F or so there is alwa ys a little bit of the red column protruding up from the ball at the bottom Just a tiny bit but enough to see that there is a slight rise above the ball I always assumed that this was the max that no matter how cold it got the thermometer would always look the same I actually wished I had a better thermometer that wen lower just so we would know exactly how cold it really was But this morning there is no red column above the ball I look closely because its such a slight difference I could be wrong But there is no mistaking it Only the ball is red Nothing above it In my dementia I imagine that even some of the ball is empty Yikes I estimate by some mystical and completely unscientific method that it is at least F We later find out after exiting that on this morning it is F at West Th umb on Yellowstone Lake We are slightly higher than the lake but more importantly we are in a massive cold air sink with steep walls on all sides It could well be even colder than F where we are Joe gets up and samples the brisk morning air Its too cold for the wa r dance We have to get a fire going pronto We opt for a hot start and splash stove fuel on the wood to speed things up Even white gas is a little ornery at this temperature and requires an open flame applied for several seconds to get a response But once coaxed over the initial hump it goes like crazy in no time We spend the next two hours sitting very close to a raging fire When the sun comes up it feels like a blow torch We spread our sleeping bags out to thaw and steam boils off of them It s the first real drying sun weve had this winter Despite the inhuman co ld I know that spring is on the way For the next four days we continue down the Yellowstone River heading for Yellowstone Lake Just beyond our camp with the swimming poolsized fire pit the snow mysteriously turns supportable and we begin to fly Each day our packs are lighter The cold relents and its so hot during the afternoons that Joe takes off his shirt Animals are everywhere Were just another two beasts roaming the valley floor which is now several mile s across We might even smell worse than most of the other ones around On these final days we hit our stride This is what we came for Its abo ut the most enjoyable time one could have on a wilderness ski trip I don t want it to end For the moment Yellowstone is ours Mighty Thorofare Creek comes in from the east Well have to come back another time to explore that universe We hit the southern boundary of Yellowstone National Park Not far now We see wolf tracks Theyve j ust been here ahead of us We spend a day skiing past The Trident a peak I ve wanted to see for years Were in the home stretch almost to the lake Colter Peak goes by We can see the lake We arrive at the blank expanse of snow and ice welcomed by two bison who look like theyve been postho ling as much as we have this year The Southeast Arm of Yellowstone Lake Day Its the last day to the road We have something like miles to ski to get to Lake Butte near the northeast end of Yellowstone Lake That s where the groomed road from the East Entrance comes in I know well be able to find a ride there around to the South Entrance and from there we ll hitch another ride back to Jackson our home base We take off like Norwegian nordic racers on the most supportable snow we ve seen We can even kick and glide and are really going for it The weather is sitting on the fence at first Looks like maybe the snow machine is sputtering into life but then it dies Must be out for maintenance As we watch Yellowstone Lake appears out of the clouds and we can see everything All the way across We see The Promontory Frank Island Dot Island even West Thumb This is my Park We have talked about maybe trying to ski right across to West Thumb but are wary of open water We stick to the eastern shore and rip past one point after another By early afternoon the day has turned into a keeper Its sunny with ha rdly any wind And we are loose on Yellowstone Lake like a bunch of criminals Just having the time of our lives We stop briefly when trading leads otherwise its heads down hammering But this is not a death march Th is is pure joy We feel invincible and want to see what we can do After a winter of going slow we want to push it home The smell of the barn is overwhelming now We can taste the finish line And its only PM Sometime after rounding Park Point I glimpse Steamboat Point in the far distance I recognize it and know where the road comes in It can only be a few miles now After passing Elk Point I start to go flat out The movement feels good I dont know how long I can keep it up but Il l stick with it for now Joe sees that its still about four miles to go and ha s the sense to maintain a normal pace I cant even feel my pack Either Ive done permanent spinal damage and have lost all feeling in my shoulders or Ive learned how to pack light at last Kick and glide I cant believe Ive been missing this all th ose years I spent skiing on fixed heel gear The snow hisses by Home stretch now One more small bay to cross and thats it I can see the road cut ahead I feel like I could get airborne with a little more effort A thundering final burst sees me to the
