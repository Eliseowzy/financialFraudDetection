Rod Subject RE PGE Power Costs Gay heres the story and some numbers for the Q comparison Please remember the context of our phone conversion this morning when looking at this Hopefully this helps Investor Relations put the story together for the Earnings Release Power Cost Adjustment We now expect to have an amount collectable from customers to record all Q of m Since we were basically at the deadband level at the end of Q we end up eating our way through the deadband and up into the collection band all in Q On a stand alone basis we will incur about m of net variable power costs Q that we wont have any revenues for but remember to keep this in context for the entire month period The following shows how this is calculated Projected Net Variable Power Costs m Baseline for PCA m Difference Subject to PCA Collection Deadband m no collection band m collect m no collection band m collect m no collection The bands above m Collections m No Collection PGE eats m Again without the PCA mechanism and no other price increase between and PGE would be m worse off As we discussed before pulling our request for a rate increase to be effective which was replaced with the PCA mechanism the latest amount being offered up by our PUC would have been around a m increase for the month period although the evidence was quickly moving towards no need for an increase so we probably wouldnt have got the rate increase and without a PCA would have been worse off today Quarter to Quarter Comparison Margins As we discussed things were looking really good for us through Q but price caps and other factors in late Qearly Q really dropped the price we could sell our excess power for and accordingly has dropped our margins In addition a slowing economy and customer energy efficiency measures have resulted in significant reductions in our retail revenues compared to last year Another point on the this yearlast year quarter to quarter comparisons is that we went into Q with length purchased at fairly lowreasonable costs over the prior year or so In Q wholesale sales prices increased dramatically California market so we made tremendous margins above normal Going into Q much of the power we purchased was at higher prices than the previous year because of the higher wholesale power market operating over the past year When price caps and other events dropped the bottom out of the wholesale power prices our margins on our power lenght dropped dramatically The PCA only picks up a power of this increase in net variable power costs as outlined above Also remember that we have a regulatory obligation to serve our customers so we have to go into a month with length in order to ensure we can handle any potential load spikes or unplanned plant outages Any excess power is sold in the wholesale market in the dayahead or realtime markets Big story price caps and lower retail revenues have really hurt us year to year but our new rate case effective should get us back on track Gross Margin Comparisons Based on our latest forecast heres a breakdown of our gross margins on a year to year comparison for Q This gives you a high level look at the impact the above events have had on our margins year to year m decrease in gross margin Q Q Retail Revenues m m Wholesale Revenues m m Other Revenues m m Variable Power Costs m m Gross Margin m m Let me know if you have questions

Administrative Issues Strategic and Business Plan Priorities for the strategic plan for through were outlined yeste rday and include a promoting secure highquality environmentally responsi ble energy infrastructure with consistent policies b encouraging competit ive markets in lieu of traditional regulation c protection of marketscus tomers through fair market oversight and d efficiently running FERC In r eaching these goals FERC intends several initiatives such as removing impe diments to market investment encouraging use of new technology continuing to advance competitive markets addressing landowner safety and environme ntal concerns and striving for clarity not only in specific areas such as c ost recovery but also in communications to stakeholders Shortly Staff wil l be recommending a twelvemonth plan as part of the overall strategic plan Infrastructure Adequacy There will be a series of open commission meetings held throughout the US beginning in November in the West in December or early spring a meeting w ill be held in the northeast and later in for the Midwest and south T he intent is to reach out to the states for greater cohesion California Infrastructure Update Staff concluded that the California natural gas market for takeaway capaci ty was insufficient to accept delivery of all interstate capacity The Cali fornia Energy Commission released a report on September that agrees that more expansion in California is needed Constraint Study FERC will complete a constraint study with associated costs that should be completed by November Staff cited constraints in central New York state and California Massey asked if the study was to provide solutions or recommendations It is a study to identify the constrained areas and the r esulting costs to consumers RTO FERC is imposing additional incentives to encourage the formation or join ing in RTOs The Midwest Northeast and Southeast RTOs will be considered a t a FERC meeting in October There will be a series of meetings in RTO wee k to focus on congestion management cost recovery marketing monitoring transmission planning reliability standards and transmission rights A NOP R is expected to be issued on market design and structure Marketing Affiliate NOPR RM The Notice of Propose Rulemaking would apply one set of rules across both n atural gas pipelines and electric utilities Under the proposal transmissi on providers must operate independently and treat all customers on a nondis criminatory basis The rules would be codified in a new section of the reg ulations and would broaden the definition of affiliate to include all ener gy affiliates The only exception noted in the discussion was the exclusi on of Regional Transmission Organizations RTOs from the definition of ene rgy affiliates The Commission was presented two options to address the applicability of th e rule to public utilities native load merchant functions Option A Status Quo the rule would not apply to the bundled retail merc hant function Option B The rule applies to the bundled retail merchant function and wou ld prohibit merchant employees from having access to the control room of th e utility After extensive discussion the NOPR was approved with additional langu age added on behalf of Commissioner Breathitt to state that Option B may no t be included in the final rule and encourage comments by affected parties and the States Massey questioned whether the NOPR is primarily focusing on broadening the definition of energy affiliate and whether there are any energytype affi liates that would be exempt Staff responded that the emphasis is on broade ning the definition to include all energy affiliates and no energytype m arketing affiliates would be exempt except RTOs The proposed rule extents the current prohibition against disclosing certai n information to all energy affiliates The rules do not directly govern energy affiliates but they govern the disclosure of information and the s eparation of transmission employees officers and directors from other busi nesses Under the proposal waivers may be requested if operationally required or under emergency protocols particularly for small systems Gas Pipeline Operational Flow FERC has tabled this item for the next public meeting on October

however is to do so according to the benefits received That way no one can argue that they didnt get the same deal If the deal makes sense from a group standpoint then it should make sense from an individual pipeline standpoint Project economics need to be looked at in ways The project economics on a stand alone basis and then the more accurate approach of what does the project do to the entity the with and without approach The accounting return in the second approach has become actually the more important measure of success From Denis Tu on AM To James NRON cc Caroline NRON Rod NRON Subject Re Project Economics When we meet on Friday after Rods meeting should we also address the pipeline cost allocation issue if we have to continue do project economics by pipeline in addition to by ETS James Saunders AM To Denis NRON cc Caroline NRON Rod NRON Subject Re Project Economics Its a bit difficult to distinguish capital vs om from your list below since youve used the same item description in both categories ie Resources I would be more than happy to develop a specific list or matrix with you Additional discretionay items to consider are overheads perhaps AFUDC and perhaps indirect allocations ie corporate allocations There is more than capital and om to consider when developing a comprehensive project economic analysis or accounting recap From an economic standpoint its critically important to identify all of the cash flows and their timing both in savings and out and not worry about accounting From an accounting standpoint and if an ORR is necessary its important to identify the accounting flow of a project which will always vary from the cash flow Components may include Initial Capital Ongoing Capital Overheads and AFUDC if applied Net OM direct and indirect BookDeperciation Tax Depreciation Advalorem Current taxes Deferred taxes Capital allocations From Denis Tu on AM To Caroline NRON cc Rod NRON James NRON Subject Re Project Economics In addition to the

BarnesFGTEnron on AM Rod Hayslett AM To Caroline NRON cc Subject Re Project Economics Pretty good I would suggest you run these by Jim Saunders to check on what should be capitalized and what shouldnt and by Denis Tu to see if he has run across any other things you might have left out in his experience As to the question How will we account for the additional OM budget dollars which could start hitting the OM budget in the same year the project is completed thats pretty easy they arent authorized to be spent If the dollars for the support of projects arent budgeted or specifically authorized in the project funding document then something must be cut to allow for the dollars to be spent or we will have to request additional funding to carry out the program When we do that unless we are beating budget somewhere else it would appear that we would not meet our goal and therefore the bonus pool of dollars would be reduced directly as a result of the additional costs Bonus pool about of net income This is why its so important to get the numbers right as soon as is practical Caroline Barnes PM To Rod NRON cc Subject Project Economics Steve asked me to put together something for everyone to follow in regards to Projects ASAP If my understanding is correct to do the economics on a project all costs must be included ie capital dollars OM dollars and ongoin OM dollars for the estimated project life This is a sample breakdown of what I came up with Current year Budget Capital Dollars Hardware Software Resources all areas IT and User includes pagers cell phone salaries and

existing contractors additional Special services Other I know we did not budget OM costs related to projects in the budget because it would be unknown at budget time and not known until the project is actually studied in detail to be recommended to be done How will we account for the additional OM budget dollars which could start hitting the OM budget in the same year the project is completed Once a project is completed it is easy to account for the additional OM dollars in future budgets Please let me know ASAP if I am on the right track with this From what Steve stated in his staff meeting

Re Project Economics When we meet on Friday after Rods meeting should we also address the pipeline cost allocation issue if we have to continue do project economics by pipeline in addition to by ETS James Saunders AM To Denis NRON cc Caroline NRON Rod NRON Subject Re Project Economics Its a bit difficult to distinguish capital vs om from your list below since youve used the same item description in both categories ie Resources I would be more than happy to develop a specific list or matrix with you Additional discretionay items to consider are overheads perhaps AFUDC and perhaps indirect allocations ie corporate allocations There is more than capital and om to consider when developing a comprehensive project economic analysis or accounting recap From an economic standpoint its critically important to identify all of the cash flows and their timing both in savings and out and not worry about accounting From an accounting standpoint and if an ORR is necessary its important to identify the accounting flow of a project which will always vary from the cash flow Components may include Initial Capital Ongoing Capital Overheads and AFUDC if applied Net OM direct and indirect BookDeperciation Tax Depreciation Advalorem Current taxes Deferred taxes Capital allocations From Denis Tu on AM To Caroline NRON cc Rod NRON James NRON Subject Re Project Economics In addition to the

BarnesFGTEnron on AM Rod Hayslett AM To Caroline NRON cc Subject Re Project Economics Pretty good I would suggest you run these by Jim Saunders to check on what should be capitalized and what shouldnt and by Denis Tu to see if he has run across any other things you might have left out in his experience As to the question How will we account for the additional OM budget dollars which could start hitting the OM budget in the same year the project is completed thats pretty easy they arent authorized to be spent If the dollars for the support of projects arent budgeted or specifically authorized in the project funding document then something must be cut to allow for the dollars to be spent or we will have to request additional funding to carry out the program When we do that unless we are beating budget somewhere else it would appear that we would not meet our goal and therefore the bonus pool of dollars would be reduced directly as a result of the additional costs Bonus pool about of net income This is why its so important to get the numbers right as soon as is practical Caroline Barnes PM To Rod NRON cc Subject Project Economics Steve asked me to put together something for everyone to follow in regards to Projects ASAP If my understanding is correct to do the economics on a project all costs must be included ie capital dollars OM dollars and ongoin OM dollars for the estimated project life This is a sample breakdown of what I came up with Current year Budget Capital Dollars Hardware Software Resources all areas IT and User includes pagers cell phone salaries and benefits etc internal existing internal additional contractors existing contractors additional Project related Expenses Special services dedicated phone line while in development etc Other OM Dollars

maintenance Software maintenance Resources all areas IT and User includes employee expenses training pagers cell phone salaries and benefitstaxes etc internal existing internal additional contractors existing contractors additional Special services Other I know we did not budget OM costs related to projects in the budget because it would be unknown at budget time and not known until the project is actually studied in detail to be recommended to be done How will we account for the additional OM budget dollars which could start hitting the OM budget in the same year the project is completed Once a project is completed it is easy to account for the additional OM dollars in future budgets Please let me know ASAP if I am on the right track with this From what Steve stated in his staff meeting

Wednesday October PM To Walden Clint Causey Richard Hayslett Rod Cc Allen Joe Dimacali Aurora Subject RE FW Third Quarter Review of Northern and Transwestern Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday October PM To Saunders James Cc Subject Re FW Third Quarter Review of Northern and Transwestern Jim thanks for the note Please forward this on to Clint Walden Rick Causey and Rod Hayslett and anyone else you think needs this information I have a couple of comments on the conditions below that were discussed on the phone but were not included in the list below We would expect a representation from the Board as well as outside legal counsel on point below Also I assume this review is a condition precedent in the debt documents Enron should be aware that there may be issues that arise that do not allow us to complete our work in the timetable necessary and should consider whether wording the loan documents relating to this cp should be modified to describe the review as something that is a condition precendent if it is professionally able to be completed Also all of these conditions assume there are no financial obligations from the entities in the reviews from or to Enron corp If so those contractual relationships will need to be evaluted to determine if overhang issues combined with the financial obligations might preclude us from completing our review This is a high priority item I would ask that the company assist us in immediately identifying and evaluating those financial obligations if any to determine if significant issues exist We can get started now on that Please call Heather Mueck and Chris Herbold I would like to get that identification work completed by end of business tomorrow Heather and Gerrad will be leading the review work and Chris will be assisting also Overall debt questions We need to understand terms conditions and debt documents Who has these We are ready to start reviewing today Financial statements and review work What periods are going to be included in the documents The comment below says quarterly Which quarters Yeartodate Comparison to prior years We would expect a full set of financial statements with footnotes for all periods presented balance sheets income statements and cash flows Who is drafting the footnote that describes the overhang issues This is a high priority item that will get much review and scrutiny l would like to get the Companys signed off footnote disclosure on the overhang issues tomorrow Also we will need immediate access to the financials and your people to answer questions When can we get the financials that will be included in the deal I assume Enron personnel will be available to answer questions beginning today to complete this work in the necessary timeframe I know these are many questions More to come I am sure But I also want to get started and focused on time consuming issues We will be determining our expanded scope procedures that are referred to below To Roger D NDERSEN

not seen this Thanks for your help and let me know of any issues Thanks again Original Message From Walden Clint Sent Wednesday October AM To Butts Bob Peng Gary Cc Causey Richard Subject Third Quarter Review of Northern and Transwestern FYI Andersen has agreed that they will be able to issue review reports on the pipelines based on the following terms The review opinions must be restricted to the lenders only There must be a substantial footnote on the overhang issues ie SEC investigation potential bankruptcy asset carryvalues in certain situations etc The review opinion will contain an emphasis of matter paragraph related to the above footnote ENE management rep and OS legal must rep that nothing they are working on related to investigation affects the pipelines or its management Pipelines must represent that it is not involved in any of the matters under investigation In addition to the above AA believes that they must expand their review work in order to satisfy themselves related to the issues and reps required above In connection with all of this the banks need these reviews completed by the closing date which is currently expected to be November I believe that the following are our immediate to dos in order to get Andersen started Ene to provide full quarterly statements of Northern and Transwestern to Andersen ASAP Discuss w WillardDuncan the level of detailanalysis that they will need to perform review Provide necessary PBC schedules etc Draft the footnote discussed in above and get approved by Rick and Legal Get Andersen to draft the language they would like to see in rep letters Get approved by Rick Legal As to each of the above to dos Gary can you contact the pipeline group as soon as you get in this morning and see if the financial statements for the Q have already been put together If they have not we need to get them produced ASAP They have already been put on notice that these statements will be a priority Also lets see what type of support they typically provide to AA for their quarterly financial reveiws I assume the scopes will now be much lower since the reviews are on stand alone pipes instead of ENE Consol Bob can you call Saunders and fill him in Once I get in I want to talk to Duncan and Willard about and above You are welcome to be a part of those discussions Also we should discuss what we believe the

just like has happened to El Paso that Enforcement could still open the case since FERC is still out trying to find a way to get us It is true that the ALJ did not help them out but that decision is not binding upon the commission Neither Stan Drew or I are comfortable yet that we have the win We are pleased with the ALJ decision but know that the ALJ did not get to the answer the Commission intended Original Message From Saunders James Sent Sunday November PM To Cc Hayslett Rod Chandler Bob Subject RE Initial Decision of ALJ in TW Negotiated Rates Proceeding i think mgmt will rep that it is still operating under a show cause order and the ultimate outcome has yet to be determined Original Message From mailto Sent Sunday November PM To Chandler Bob Cc Saunders James Fancler Dan Zahn Gary Porter Gregory J Subject RE Initial Decision of ALJ in TW Negotiated Rates Proceeding Unlike your regulatory liabilities in the past subject to refund in which there is an order from the FERC stating you can increase rates but you need to reserve for them because they are subject to refund until the final order comes out this is a GAAP contingency and must meet the definition of probable liability Does mangement really believe that it is probable they will not be able to recover the million Especially given the initial decision do you really believe it is not recoverable given the fact youve publicly stated that you are entitled to it the paying parties have stated you are entitled to it and now the ALJ has stated that you are entitled to it Will management represent to us that it is probable TW will not be able to recover in the general rep To Heather L NDERSEN WO cc Date PM From Subject RE Initial Decision of ALJ in TW Negotiated Rates Proceeding Im not sure this qualifies as a subsequent event because it isnt conclusive enough to trigger a reserve reversal I think we should disclose it in the interests of full disclosure but certainly doesnt require a change in financials Original Message From ENRON Sent Sunday November PM To Saunders James Cc Chandler Bob Fancler Dan Zahn Gary Porter Gregory J Subject RE Initial Decision of ALJ in TW Negotiated Rates Proceeding I very much agree with the below and the reason for establishing the reserve however given the positive order from the ALJ is this a type I or type II subsequent event one requires adjustment to the financial statements and one that does not I realize the FERC still needs to approve however I think that the heat as described below has cooled down and a recommendation from the ALJ to the FERC would be viewed as a positive thing causing the need to reverse the reserve see below literature from SAS Two types of subsequent events require consideration by management and evaluation by the independent auditor The first type consists of those events that provide additional evidence with respect to conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet and affect the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements All information that becomes available prior to the issuance of the financial statements should be used by management in its evaluation of the conditions on which the estimates were based The financial statements should be adjusted for any changes in estimates resulting from the use of such evidence Identifying events that require adjustment of the financial statements under the criteria stated above calls for the exercise of judgment and knowledge of the facts and circumstances For example a loss on an uncollectible trade account receivable as a result of a customers deteriorating financial condition leading to bankruptcy subsequent to the balancesheet date would be indicative of conditions existing at the balancesheet date thereby calling for adjustment of the financial statements before their issuance On the other hand a similar loss resulting from a customers major casualty such as a fire or flood subsequent to the balancesheet date would not be indicative of conditions existing at the balancesheet date and adjustment of the financial statements would not be appropriate The settlement of litigation for an amount different from the liability recorded in the accounts would require adjustment of the financial statements if the events such as personal injury or patent infringement that gave rise to the litigation had taken place prior to the balancesheet date The second type consists of those events that provide evidence with respect to conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet being reported on but arose subsequent to that date These events should not result in adjustment of the financial statementssuperscript Some of these events however may be of such a nature that disclosure of them is required to keep the financial statements from being misleading Occasionally such an event may be so significant that disclosure can best be made by supplementing the historical financial statements with pro forma financial data giving effect to the event as if it had occurred on the date of the balance sheet It may be desirable to present pro forma statements usually a balance sheet only in columnar form on the face of the historical statements superscript This paragraph is not intended to preclude giving effect in the balance sheet with appropriate disclosure to stock dividends or stock splits or reverse splits consummated after the balancesheet date but before issuance of the financial statements Examples of events of the second type that require disclosure to the financial statements but should not result in adjustment are a Sale of a bond or capital stock issue b Purchase of a business c Settlement of litigation when the event giving rise to the claim took place subsequent to the balancesheet date d Loss of plant or inventories as a result of fire or flood e Losses on receivables resulting from conditions such as a customers major casualty arising subsequent to the balancesheet date Subsequent events affecting the realization of assets such as receivables and inventories or the settlement of estimated liabilities ordinarily will require adjustment of the financial statements see paragraph Document link PAUAUPROSTD because such events typically represent the culmination of conditions that existed over a relatively long period of time Subsequent events such as changes in the quoted market prices of securities ordinarily should not result in adjustment of the financial statements see paragraph Document link PAUAUPROSTD because such changes typically reflect a concurrent evaluation of new conditions Comments To Heather L NDERSEN WO cc Date PM From Subject RE Initial Decision of ALJ in TW Negotiated Rates Proceeding At the time the reserve early was eatablished the CA situation was much much much more contentious and likely recovery of amounts negotiated was at that time in jeopardy Over the course of

PM To Thompson Charlie Subject RE Need for Rutherford Consulting Complete This question has been raised several times over the past years should we combine GMS Field Operations and some of the Gas Control functions to create a single source for measurement data I do not feel that changing a reporting relationship would correct any problems I feel the time and effort can e better spent improving our current data collect process and data flow between SCADA and PGAS While this process is working I feel that it requires to much manual intervention and handling The IT department Measurement Technology Gas Control Hot Seat and the Data Analysis are all involved in keeping the data flowing between SCADA and PGAS We should step back and re look and the current process and see what improvements can be made to better control and maintain this process A second area that should be looked at is the data validation process Currently Field Operations Data Analysis and GMS all manually review measurement data With all of the computer and software technology available I feel that we could easily automate most of the current manual data validation I have limited experience with the

PM To Barnes Caroline Hayslett Rod Saunders James Hotte Steve Cc Stern Ellis Lewis Greg Subject RE Need for Rutherford Consullting Complete The PGAS reporting project recently completed requirements gathering meetings with data users in gas measurement technology gas control gms gas accounting and gas logistics We think those discussions have pointed to a need to assess inefficiencies that appear to exist related to data integrity as data moves between systems and users that span the entire gas volumequality collection transformation and delivery process In other words there seem to be too many questions and reconcilliations that people have to address along the process as data changes hands and is used for different internal and external purposes There also appears to be a lack of a single point of responsibility in the organization for gas volume data from start to finish The PGAS reporting project proposed to assess this at a high level and make some recommendations But as important as the issue appears to be you might want to consider using Rutherford to help ETS do a more thorough job of this This effort would extend outside FAA Please advise Original Message From Barnes Caroline Sent Thursday October AM To Hayslett Rod Cc Stern Ellis Sullivan Michael Subject Need for Rutherford Consullting Complete Mike Ellis and I are in agreement that the need for the Rutherford Consulting group is complete Rutherford achieved what their goal was to provide structure and format for the PGAS issues to be addressed in an efficient manner The procedures for listing new issues are in place and are being followed by the team The meetings are efficient in that only status updates and priorities are reviewed and discussed There is now only one list for all issues that are being addressed or need to be addressed and they are prioritized The monthly meetings are now only needed twice a month What is the procedure for notifying Rutherford that their services are no longer needed on this project as they have completed what was asked of them cvb

collecting validating and distributing measurement data and consider new ideas and alternatives to improve the process Assistance from a consulting firm that specializes in this area would probably be better than using Rutherford Charlie Original Message From Cessac Kenneth Sent Tuesday October PM To Thompson Charlie Subject RE Need for Rutherford Consulting Complete This question has been raised several times over the past years should we combine GMS Field Operations and some of the Gas Control functions to create a single source for measurement data I do not feel that changing a reporting relationship would correct any problems I feel the time and effort can e better spent improving our current data collect process and data flow between SCADA and PGAS While this process is working I feel that it requires to much manual intervention and handling The IT department Measurement Technology Gas Control Hot Seat and the Data Analysis are all involved in keeping the data flowing between SCADA and PGAS We should step back and re look and the current process and see what improvements can be made to better control and maintain this process A second area that should be looked at is the data validation process Currently Field Operations Data Analysis and GMS all manually review measurement data With all of the computer and software technology available I feel that we could easily automate most of the current manual data validation I have limited experience with the Rutherford company and what they could provide towards improving these items I feel that a company that specializes in SCADA and such as UTSI would be a better option Original Message From Hawkins Don Sent Friday October AM To Thompson Charlie Cessac Kenneth Cc Hayslett Rod Subject RE Need for

Would you agree that something needs to be done Original Message From Sullivan Michael Sent Thursday October PM To Barnes Caroline Hayslett Rod Saunders James Hotte Steve Cc Stern Ellis Lewis Greg Subject RE Need for Rutherford Consullting Complete The PGAS reporting project recently completed requirements gathering meetings with data users in gas measurement technology gas control gms gas accounting and gas logistics We think those discussions have pointed to a need to assess inefficiencies that appear to exist related to data integrity as data moves between systems and users that span the entire gas volumequality collection transformation and delivery process In other words there seem to be too many questions and reconcilliations that people have to address along the process as data changes hands and is used for different internal and external purposes There also appears to be a lack of a single point of responsibility in the organization for gas volume data from start to finish The PGAS reporting project proposed to assess this at a high level and make some recommendations But as important as the issue appears to be you might want to consider using Rutherford to help ETS do a more thorough job of this This effort would extend outside FAA Please advise Original Message From Barnes Caroline Sent Thursday October AM To Hayslett Rod Cc Stern Ellis Sullivan Michael Subject Need for Rutherford Consullting Complete Mike Ellis and I are in agreement that the need for the Rutherford Consulting group is complete Rutherford achieved what their goal was to provide structure and format for the PGAS issues to be addressed in an efficient manner The procedures for listing new issues are in place and are being followed by the team The meetings are efficient in that only status updates and priorities are reviewed and discussed There is now only one list for all issues that are being addressed or need to be addressed and they are prioritized The monthly meetings are now only needed twice a month What is the procedure for notifying Rutherford that their services are no longer needed on this project as they have completed what was asked of them cvb

Original Message From Lee Jebong Sent Fri PM To Hill Robert Gadd Eric Cc Ratner Michael Kissner Tim Reinecke Bryan Miller Mary Kay Haysl ett Rod Subject Toll Model Review Meeting Updates The model review meeting on Thursday went well and the consensus was that there are many changes to be made to the current Foothills economic model Many assumptions in the current model were challenged by the participant co mpanies Foothills agreed to reflect the suggested changes to the model An dy is supposed to send out a summary of the discussion and provided an ele ctronic copy of the model for withdrawn partners review Withdrawn partner s agreed to give their commentsfeedback on the model to Foothills until and another meeting to reach an agreement on economic modeltoll was scheduled for or The data from economictoll model will be used in commercial proposalpresentation to the ANS producers which ANN GTC intends to have by Tim and I will review Foothills cash flow and COS model and prepare comments Overall the participants though that the current Foothills model MM Btu toll for Alaska section has very aggressive assumptions in many ways and it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after a ll the appropriate revisions are made The following are the main discussio n points of the meeting Item and are expected to have a very large imp act on the toll Capex and Opex need to have annualmonthly escalation current model has escalation For example Foothills sensitivity analysis shows that Capex escalation would increase the toll by Numbers such as f or Capex and for Opex were thrown during the meeting but more reviews need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates Do you have any op inion on this Bryan Foothills is using Flowthrough method using cash taxes in COS calculati on to calculate income taxes that go into the Cost of Service and might be underestimating Cost of Service Tim thought that the Flowthrough method w ill not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed by IRS and FERC Foothills said that they can still have same toll under No rmalized tax method by changing the depreciation number but Tim was concer ned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation Fo othills declined our request to share their Cost of Service model and insis ted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the ca sh flow model They agreed to provide a hard copy of their Cost of Service model in the end but Tim and I were under impression that Foothills was tr ying to lower the toll as much as they can Tim was also concerned about le velized toll approach because of FERC might lower allowed return in the lat er rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this Please correc t me if I am wrong here Tim OM A is currently estimated to be of Capex but this might be too lo w OMA in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx of total Capex The Withdrawn Partners historical contributions million will be added to the Rate Base but this might be dropped if necessary Success fee of million should be included in the project budget Working Capital will be added to the project cost The Line Pack cost Bcf for the whole section was assumed to be borne by ANS producers but some participants highly doubted that that would be the case The Line Pac k gas might have to be bought by the Partnership or the Producers will at l east demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for year s For Return on Capital and AFUDC ROE and Interest on Debt assumin g capital structure is likely to be kept However the current drawdo wn schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginnin g which will not be true Certain assumptions should be made on the financ ial close date and commercial agreementpreliminary determination date to c alculate AFUDC more accurately Current financing assumption in the model is a year bank loan with ba lloon amortization and DSCR of In reality the initial bank loans will be of shorter maturity years and certain rollover financing will b e unavoidable It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches with different terms interest rate seniority etc There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of t he ANGTS considering that some sources of capital revenues and part of ope rating expenses will be in Canadian dollars A mechanis to mitigate currenc y risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it Property taxes of in Alaska seems high but Property taxes during con struction period should be added Lastly there is about million difference between ETS c urrent cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model excludi ng IDC and AFUDC Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for la rger pipe size or inch as noted in Bryans email Thanks JB Jebong Lee office cell

Consulting Complete This question has been raised several times over the past years should we combine GMS Field Operations and some of the Gas Control functions to create a single source for measurement data I do not feel that changing a reporting relationship would correct any problems I feel the time and effort can e better spent improving our current data collect process and data flow between SCADA and PGAS While this process is working I feel that it requires to much manual intervention and handling The IT department Measurement Technology Gas Control Hot Seat and the Data Analysis are all involved in keeping the data flowing between SCADA and PGAS We should step back and re look and the current process and see what improvements can be made to better control and maintain this process A second area that should be looked at is the data validation process Currently Field Operations Data Analysis and GMS all manually review measurement data With all of the computer and software technology available I feel that we could easily automate most of the current manual data validation I have limited experience with the Rutherford company and what they could

Saunders James Hotte Steve Cc Stern Ellis Lewis Greg Subject RE Need for Rutherford Consullting Complete The PGAS reporting project recently completed requirements gathering meetings with data users in gas measurement technology gas control gms gas accounting and gas logistics We think those discussions have pointed to a need to assess inefficiencies that appear to exist related to data integrity as data moves between systems and users that span the entire gas volumequality collection transformation and delivery process In other words there seem to be too many questions and reconcilliations that people have to address along the process as data changes hands and is used for different internal and external purposes There also appears to be a lack of a single point of responsibility in the organization for gas volume data from start to finish The PGAS reporting project proposed to assess this at a high level and make some recommendations But as important as the issue appears to be you might want to consider using Rutherford to help ETS do a more thorough job of this This effort would extend outside FAA Please advise Original Message From Barnes Caroline Sent Thursday October AM To

team The meetings are efficient in that only status updates and priorities are reviewed and discussed There is now only one list for all issues that are being addressed or need to be addressed and they are prioritized The monthly meetings are now only needed twice a month What is the procedure for notifying Rutherford that their services are no longer needed on this project as they have

Re Project Economics When we meet on Friday after Rods meeting should we also address the pipeline cost allocation issue if we have to continue do project economics by pipeline in addition to by ETS James Saunders AM To Denis NRON cc Caroline NRON Rod NRON Subject Re Project Economics Its a bit difficult to distinguish capital vs om from your list below since youve used the same item description in both categories ie Resources I would be more than happy to develop a specific list or matrix with you Additional discretionay items to consider are overheads perhaps AFUDC and perhaps indirect allocations ie corporate allocations There is more than capital and om to consider when developing a comprehensive project economic analysis or accounting recap From an economic standpoint its critically important to identify all of the cash flows and their timing both in savings and out and not worry about accounting From an accounting standpoint and if an ORR is necessary its important to identify the accounting flow of a project which will always vary from the cash flow Components may include Initial Capital Ongoing Capital Overheads and AFUDC if applied Net OM direct and indirect

BarnesFGTEnron on AM Rod Hayslett AM To Caroline NRON cc Subject Re Project Economics Pretty good I would suggest you run these by Jim Saunders to check on what should be capitalized and what shouldnt and by Denis Tu to see if he has run across any other things you might have left out in his experience As to the question How will we account for the additional OM budget dollars which could start hitting the OM budget in the same year the project is completed thats pretty easy they arent authorized to be spent If the dollars for the support of projects arent budgeted or specifically authorized in the project funding document then something must be cut to allow for the dollars to be spent or we will have to request additional funding to carry out the program When we do that unless we are beating budget somewhere else it would appear that we would not meet our goal and therefore the bonus pool of dollars would be reduced directly as a result of the additional costs Bonus pool about of net income This is why its so important to get the numbers right as soon as is practical Caroline Barnes PM To Rod NRON cc Subject Project Economics Steve asked me to put together something for everyone to follow in regards to Projects ASAP If my understanding is correct to do the economics on a project all costs must be included ie capital dollars OM dollars and ongoin OM dollars for the

existing contractors additional Special services Other I know we did not budget OM costs related to projects in the budget because it would be unknown at budget time and not known until the project is actually studied in detail to be recommended to be done How will we account for the additional OM budget dollars which could start hitting the OM budget in the same year the project is completed Once a project is completed it is easy to account for the additional OM dollars in future budgets Please let me know ASAP if I am on the right track with this From what Steve stated in his staff meeting

review meeting on Thursday went well and the consensus was that there are many changes to be made to the current Foothills economic model Many assumptions in the current model were challenged by the participant co mpanies Foothills agreed to reflect the suggested changes to the model An dy is supposed to send out a summary of the discussion and provided an ele ctronic copy of the model for withdrawn partners review Withdrawn partner s agreed to give their commentsfeedback on the model to Foothills until and another meeting to reach an agreement on economic modeltoll was scheduled for or The data from economictoll model will be used in commercial proposalpresentation to the ANS producers which ANN GTC intends to have by Tim and I will review Foothills cash flow and COS model and prepare comments Overall the participants though that the current Foothills model MM Btu toll for Alaska section has very aggressive assumptions in many ways and it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after a ll the appropriate revisions are made The following are the main discussio n points of the meeting Item and are expected to have a very large imp act on the toll Capex and Opex need to have annualmonthly escalation current model has escalation For example Foothills sensitivity analysis shows that Capex escalation would increase the toll by Numbers such as f or Capex and for Opex were thrown during the meeting but more reviews need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates Do you have any op inion on this Bryan Foothills is using Flowthrough method using cash taxes in COS calculati on to calculate income taxes that go into the Cost of Service and might be underestimating Cost of Service Tim thought that the Flowthrough method w ill not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed by IRS and FERC Foothills said that they can still have same toll under No rmalized tax method by changing the depreciation number but Tim was concer ned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation Fo othills declined our request to share their Cost of Service model and insis ted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the ca sh flow model They agreed to provide a hard copy of their Cost of Service model in the end but Tim and I were under impression that Foothills was tr ying to lower the toll as much as they can Tim was also concerned about le velized toll approach because of FERC might lower allowed return in the lat er rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this Please correc t me if I am wrong here Tim OM A is currently estimated to be of Capex but this might be too lo w OMA in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx of total Capex The Withdrawn Partners historical contributions million will be added to the Rate Base but this might be dropped if necessary Success fee of million should be included in the project budget Working Capital will be added to the project cost The Line Pack cost Bcf for the whole section was assumed to be borne by ANS producers but some participants highly doubted that that would be the case The Line Pac k gas might have to be bought by the Partnership or the Producers will at l east demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for year s For Return on Capital and AFUDC ROE and Interest on Debt assumin g capital structure is likely to be kept However the current drawdo wn schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginnin g which will not be true Certain assumptions should be made on the financ ial close date and commercial agreementpreliminary determination date to c alculate AFUDC more accurately Current financing assumption in the model is a year bank loan with ba lloon amortization and DSCR of In reality the initial bank loans will be of shorter maturity years and certain rollover financing will b e unavoidable It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches with different terms interest rate seniority etc There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of t he ANGTS considering that some sources of capital revenues and part of ope rating expenses will be in Canadian dollars A mechanis to mitigate currenc y risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it Property taxes of in Alaska seems high but Property taxes during con struction period should be added Lastly there is about million difference between ETS c urrent cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model excludi ng IDC and AFUDC Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for la rger pipe size or inch as noted in Bryans email Thanks JB Jebong Lee office cell

assume that by entering into a financing deal we will be any better off I would tell you that to the extent there was any risk in the deal that we should probably charge someone else about as well Think abo ut it is only after tax Has some one enumerated the risks and v alued them on this deal I havent seen any of that work if it has been done I think I understand the concept proposed and I understand the proposed goa l line return with little or no expense up front I would assume that we would be willing to enter into a fixed price service agreement for a num ber of years Is Halliburton willing to take any risks whatsoever Alternatively why dont we go through GSS Global Strategic Sourcing to l ook for a better deal Jim Have you looked at this for ideas on the accounting side Why can t I do a prepayment of a service contract fee and recognize the expense ov er the life of the deal Original Message From Waymire Dave SentWednesday October AM ToHayslett Rod Gilbert Steve CcCentilli James SubjectRE Redfield Deliverability Project Rod Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selected wells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to thei r original levels The work overs are planned over a year period and a re expected to have a lasting effect of at least years The cost to mod el and rework these wells is estimated to be MM A test program would be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing the program at a cost of If the test program did not prove out t he project would be terminated at this point The original proposal was to treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred Bob Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment This would result as Kent ha s indicated negative EBIT for the first years As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into a year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage f ield Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test resu lts indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would s pend an additional MM on a total of well workovers in the first y ears of the contract NNG currently budgets per year for Redfield well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability Operations has c ommitted per year in well maintenance over the next years to thi s project for a total of MM Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer but has indicated that they would require a to return for assuming the financing Hallibu rton indicated that this is a nonstandard deal for them and that is the re ason for high return requirement The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with a n Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third party at a more reasonable rate Even at an estimated return prelimi nary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are b etween to the first years and to for the out years Original Message From

unlikely that we will not get an OK rate from a FERC perspective but highly unlikely we will get an allowed rate of return high enough to satisfy the current Enron hurdle rates Negotiated rates in these types of deals basis for new builds have been allowed to stand for the life of the contracts in the case of Kern River and Mojave But in reality FERC can always change their mind and that is a risk that we will model in the deal Original Message From McCarty Danny Sent Wednesday June PM To Hayslett Rod Subject TransPecos Letter of Intent with Pemex Rod The negotiated rate is intended to provide us sufficient returns to meet or exceed Corporate hurdle rates If FERC does not allow us to charge our proposed initial rate we have the option not to build the project pursuant to b We will change d to provide a flat negotiated rate per Dthd rather than capping the rate at the mawimum rate allowed by FERC We do have a risk that FERC might revisit its negotiated rate policy which is the same risk that we run with the Red Rock expansion Any other ideas Dan Forwarded by Danny McCartyETSEnron on PM From Jeffery nronxgate on AM To Rod nronXgate cc James CentilliET NRON Jerry nronXgate Paul NRON Danny McCartyET nron Subject TransPecos Letter of Intent with Pemex Rod I hear you However whats changed since the last time you and I spoke about this project is that our friend Bill Wise has been talking with the Chairman of Pemex about doing a similar mile expansion of El Pasos system from Waha to Samalayuca His proposal was to provide incremental firm service to Pemex at EPNGs currently effective Texas rates low cent range Pemex management is willing to recommend to its Board of Directors going with a slightly higher rate on TransPecos in order to get the benefits of supply diversity and leverage but the TransPecos rate needs to be as close to EPNGs as possible to make the case compelling Therefore what were trying to accomplish here is to give Pemex a rate representing effectively a rate cap with an upside that if the FERC rate is less than the cap which it might well be then Pemex gets the lower rate Its just going to be damned difficult to hit a McGwire home run here with El Paso breathing down our neck I truly believe this is the best we can negotiate for fear of Pemex going back to their comfort zone with EPNG Dan McCarty was with me in our last meeting in Mexico City and I think he was reading the tea leaves similarly Original Message From Hayslett Rod Sent Wednesday June AM To Fawcett Jeffery Cc Centilli James Peters Jerry Cherry Paul Subject RE TransPecos Letter of Intent with Pemex We will get allowed whatever we get from FERC but I am here to tell you that if that the FERC allowed rate is the best we can do then we will have a more difficult time convincing Enron to invest the equity Why in the deal are we limiting our upside to the maximum rate allowed by FERC d Our current return level is about on equity with leverage applied so anything less than that reduces our overall return to Enron Because this is a partnership we will be off balance sheet and will have met the first hurdle The second hurdle will be arranging nonrecourse financing guaranties during construction OK Original Message From Fawcett Jeffery Sent Tuesday June PM To Cherry Paul Cc Hayslett Rod Centilli James Subject TransPecos Letter of Intent with Pemex Paul I think James Centilli is running his model against a rate of return on equity I dont know if the FERC would otherwise provide for a return unless a case could be made for the higher rate to compensate the partners for the credit riskcost of noninvestment grade financing I think this is a call maybe for Rod Hayslett to make with respect to FERC regulated ROE If we think is insufficient then what is the appropriate level Regards Jeff Original Message From Cherry Paul Sent Tuesday June AM To Fawcett Jeffery Cc Peters Jerry Hayslett Rod Subject Re TransPecos Letter of Intent with Pemex Jeff In reference to the project the comment I would offer is in regard to the currrent SP rating of Pemex Presently they are rated from USD perspective of BB and in Pesos BBB Due to their USD rating of one level below investment grade the question was raised by Jerry if the rate of return would increase Also it is my understanding that the contracting entity is MGI Supply and
