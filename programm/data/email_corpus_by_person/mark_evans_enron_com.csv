I am not at all sure that Enron could rely on the Solely for Investment Purposes exemption of Section of the Rules promulgated under the HartScottRodino Antitrust Improvements Act On its face the rule seems to be applicable if the voting securities are acquired for investment purposes only and the postacquisition holdings will be or less regardless of dollar value Section i defines solely for purpose of investment as having no intention of participating in the formulation determination o r direction of the basic business decisions of the issuer Background Information published by the FTC relating to Rule i in the Statement of Basis and Purpose lists conduct which may be viewed as inconsistent with an investment purpose Those include i nominating a candidate for the Board of Directors ii proposing corporate action requiring shareholder approval iii soliciting proxies iv having a controlling shareholder director officer or employee simultaneously serving as an officer or director of the issuer v being a competitor of the issuer or vi doing any of the foregoing with respect to any entity directly or indirectly controlling the issuer Although the Statement of Basis and Purpose says that the presence of any of these factors will be taken into account in determining whether or not an investment purposes exists I have been advis ed recently by Neil Imus a partner in the Antitrust Section of Vinson Elkins Washington Office that the FTC Staff does not like the Section exemption and will not allow a competitor to rely on the exemption If an investment of more than million of voting securities will be made then we should consider whether to make further inquiry with the FTC staff or ma ke a filing under the HSR Act The filing fee is US and the waiting period would begin upon filing by Enron and expire days later It is likely that early termination of the waiting period would be granted as I assume that there would be no substantive antitrust issues The penalty fo r violating the HSR Act is up to per day I would be very interested if anyone has gotten different advice on this exemption from other counsel Paul CT AM To Sheila CT Donna CT Lance Schuler CT Ann NRON cc Richard CT Mark CT Mark E CT Subject Equity Stake in British Energy Confidential We are currently analysing British Energy to ascertain whether or not we wa nt to take an equity stake in them Our equity trading capability in London i s not quite up and running which means that if a decision is taken to move forward with this investment the equity trades would need to be executed b y traders based in Houston Lance has kindly provided some useful initial information on this and has indicated that you may be able to assist further The issues would seem to be as follows Chinese Walls Procedures I understand that your Chinese Walls procedures require all proposed investments of this kind to be routed through Donna Lowry Donna on the assumption that our decision to invest is not based on pricesensitive nonpublic information please let us know what other procedures we need to follow to satisfy your requirements Hart Scott Redino I gather that these issues will not arise if the stake we are looking to ta ke is less than million or less than We will certainly be taking le ss than of BE but it is not clear to me what the size of our investment is likely to be Richard Lance you mentioned that if the shares are being acquired for investment purposes only then we would be exempt from these requirements Presumably this is in addition to the size requirements mentioned above My understanding is that our stake would be purely for investment purposes essentially to hedge our trading position should the price of power go up and that we are not looking to acquire BE or a substantial stake in BE which is in the same sector as Enron Assuming this is the case and Richard please correct me if Im mistaken please let me know whether we need to take this issue further PUHCA Issues I am not sure what these are but perhaps Sheila could comment on wheth er any arise on the facts given above It may also be helpful to note that British Energy is a UK company quoted o n the London Stock Exchange but not on any North American Exchange It does however have substantial assets in Canada and a joint venture with a US partner which owns Three Mile Island and another generating

have been involved in this gambling issue from the beginning Jeremy Pitts and I have had a brief conversation re my email to him below this afternoon but he will not be able to get written comments signed off by Japanese lawyers to me until Monday The situation relates to the Tokyos offices first weather derivatives deal which is with a company called Toa Reinsurance In a nutshell the situation is that negotiations have come to a standstill because neither side can move on their positions re the gambling warranties The deal of course though has already been done over the telephone several weeks ago In a nutshell then based on discussions with Jeremy Pitts but to be clarified by Japanese lawyer on Monday the situation is In terms of Enron Japans ability to trade weather derivatives here we are operating in the grey even if we can get warranty cii from them ToaRe will not give us the important warranty cii below because they say they cant They say they are not actually entering into the deal to hedge weather related risks arising in the ordinary course of their business which is what the subject warranty says BM have advised that the obtaining of this warranty from a counter party helps keep us in the grey and out of the red in terms of what we are doing and also gives us comfort that the counter party can do the deal ToaRe is in addition separately asking us to give them the same warranty Jane McBride analysis Re Given that our legal situation is grey at best I do not think we should be giving the warranty they have requested They say they will not give us that warranty The issue then is whether we can go ahead without getting the warranty from them bearing in mind that a binding telephone deal has been done If you agree with me that we cant give the

Advice Dear Jeremy I would like to refine the following instructions There are two only issues on which we need specific written advice and they both relate to Warranty cii of the draft which says XYZ is entering into a weather derivative transaction to hedge weather related risks arising in the ordinary course of its business a Can Enron Japan give the warranty at this stage in its growth Have we already had any written advice from you on whether Enron Japan can warrant along these lines If so when If not the facts seem to be that Enron Japan plans to trade commodities which are energy related but because we are still building up the business we are not trading these products yet As you know we are getting into the power market If we have done a weather derivative then we can of course offer better prices on the electricity deals we are negotiating Other Enron companies are of course already trading many weather dependant commodities and power It could be argued therefore that unless we can rely on the weather related risks of other Enron companies to justify our weather derivative transacting in these early days that this is a speculative transaction constituting gambling depending on how the law on this works It is understandable that ToaRe would want us to warranty in effect that we are not gambling because we are asking them to do so I know we have had sign off from BM re our weather derivative trading but I wonder if anyone considered what the situation would be before we ourselves had other transactions giving us weather related risks b If not how could it be amended so that we can give it c If still relevant in the context of your answers to a and b above they did offer previously to take out all warranties so that neither party gives any warranties The deal cannot be cancelled because it was done on the telephone late Sept Accordingly what is the practical risk of us proceeding without the benefit of any warranties from ToaRe including the warranty that they are under the Insurance Business Law ie an insurance company They are insisting they not give ii and that we be satisfied with iii only for the purposes of the Gambling Law Pls confirm in

page about this Firstly the decision to add a Hong Kong password application on the registration screen was taken in full knowledge of the relevant law and everyone should be aware of the process that was gone through Secondly if I understand Davids note the conclusion is we believe there is no problem but we may attract some attention We need to determine how concerned we are about that and whether our concern merits the inconvenience is that all it is of removing the password application Thirdly we are already pregnant The application is already there If removing it solves the problem

to EnronOnline or the products contained on EnronOnline What are the HK Securities regulations and what is requried for compliance Is this painful or do we qualify with little effort What happens if

just not the public David NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Amita CT David CT cc Paul SmithENRON NRON CT Dale CT Justin TimothyENRON NRON CT Mark CT Justin CT Jonathan CT Subject Re Hong Kong Weather Products There is one issue outstanding concerning our due diligence for Hong Kong It does not relate specifically to Hong Kong weather but rather whether we should revisit the decision to last month list a Hong Kong Password Application on the EOL registration screen As I raised in my email last week the Hong Kong regulator SFC has issued internet trading guidelines that state that internet sites that target Hong Kong residents will be expected to comply with HK securities legislation Under the HK Protection of Investors Ordinance there are restrictions on making public offers regarding i securities and ii investment arrangements relating to property other than securities Whilst it is difficult to see how a HK weather swap or any other product listed on EOL would fall with in these definitions it is not beyond doubt that the SFC may want to investigate EOL if they believe it is targeting offers to Hong Kong residents My concern is that if the SFC logged onto EOL following the publicity surrounding the HK weather launch they will find a password application for Hong Kong residents The SFC could well take the view that a HK password application is evidence that EOL is targeting Hong Kong Again it is the act of making the offer not entering into the transaction that is the subject of the Ordinance Hence arrangements to restrict with whom we ultimately enter into password agreements or conduct trades may not be viewed as conclusive in determining to whom offers are being made l have had an opportunity to review a September advice that Jonathan Marsh obtained from Allen Overy HK In Section they raise similar concerns with regard to the Protection of Investors Ordinance Way Forward I would recommend that the Password Application for Hong Kong immediately be removed from the list on the EOL registration screen at least for the present The chance that this HK PA may invite the attention of the HK SFC needs to be recognised This possibility exists irrespective of the decision to list HK weather products Clearly on a practical level a greater awareness in HK of EOL generated by the launch of HK weather may be the catalyst that attracts SFC interest Whilst our legal analysis has not identified any breach of HK legislation by EOL I would prefer if we mitigated the risk of an SFC instigated dialogue on this point This would mean a Hong Kong resident would need to call up to get a password application If we wish to include on the parts of the EOL site that are available to the public ie where no password is needed provisions that are unambiguously directed to HK residents then it would be prudent for us to talk to the SFC first I note Allen Overy also raised this as a possibility I recognise this is a judgment call on what is one of those grey areas But the prospect of publicity in HK for EOL was the determining factor in concluding that this more conservative approach is warranted at present Amita CT AM To Paul SmithENRON

unless we can rely on the weather related risks of other Enron companies to justify our weather derivative transacting in these early days that this is a speculative transaction constituting gambling depending on how the law on this works It is understandable that ToaRe would want us to warranty in effect that we are not gambling because we are asking them to do so I know we have had sign off from BM re our weather derivative trading but I wonder if anyone considered what the situation would be before we ourselves had other transactions giving us weather related risks b If not how could it be amended so that we can give it c If still relevant in the context of your answers to a and b above they did offer previously to take out all warranties so that neither party gives any warranties The deal cannot be cancelled because it was done on the telephone late Sept Accordingly what is the practical risk of us proceeding without the benefit of any warranties from ToaRe including the warranty that they are under the Insurance Business Law ie an insurance company They are insisting they not give ii and that we be satisfied with iii only for the purposes of the Gambling Law Pls confirm in

page about this Firstly the decision to add a Hong Kong password application on the registration screen was taken in full knowledge of the relevant law and everyone should be aware of the process that was gone through Secondly if I understand Davids note the conclusion is we believe there is no problem but we may attract some attention We need to determine how concerned we are about that and whether our concern merits the inconvenience is that all it is of removing the password application Thirdly we are already pregnant The application is already there If removing it solves the problem why not wait until we know we have the problem and then remove it Fourthly all Davids questions are valid and should be answered When we have discussed it the right decision may well be to remove the password application Mark David F could you make pm today London time am yours Justin and I will call you Mark at pm If not Ill ask Tracy to fix something up Obviously David Minns cant make that but I

list of online PAs effective for tonight This does not prohibit us from distributing PAs directly if it is decided that direct distribution is OK However I am keen to answer the following questions as soon as possible so we can establish whether or not the PA can be put back on Does listing a PA for Hong Kong constitute targetting Hong Kong residents Does the Protection of Investors Ordinance apply to EnronOnline or the products contained on EnronOnline What are the HK Securities regulations and what is requried for compliance Is this painful or do we qualify with little effort What happens if we come to the attention of the HK regulator Does it just mean some getting to know you meetings or something more serious Is the Protection of Investors Ordinance aimed at individuals or is it intended to cover companies as well Dave From Mark CT on PM EST To David MinnsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Amita CT Dale CT David CT Jonathan NRONDEVELOPMENT Justin CT Justin TimothyENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Paul SmithENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Hong Kong Weather Products I concur in Davids analysis Any idea who the target market is in HK If we have specific customers in mind would it be possible to approach them directly rather than making the password application generally available Its not clear to me that even that would solve the problem since there would still be some targeted HK residents just not the public David NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Amita CT David CT cc Paul SmithENRON NRON CT Dale CT Justin TimothyENRON NRON CT Mark CT Justin CT Jonathan CT Subject Re Hong Kong Weather Products There is one issue outstanding concerning our due diligence for Hong Kong It does not relate specifically to Hong Kong weather but rather whether we should revisit the decision to last month list a Hong Kong Password Application on the EOL registration screen As I raised in my email last week the Hong Kong regulator SFC has issued internet trading guidelines that state that internet sites that target Hong Kong residents will be expected to comply with HK securities legislation Under the HK Protection of Investors Ordinance there are restrictions on making public offers regarding i securities and ii investment arrangements relating to property other than securities Whilst it is difficult to see how a HK weather swap or any other product listed on EOL would fall with in these definitions it is not beyond doubt that the SFC may want to investigate EOL if they believe it is targeting offers to Hong Kong residents My concern is that if the SFC logged onto EOL following the publicity surrounding the HK weather launch they will find a password application for Hong Kong residents The SFC could well take the view that a HK password application is evidence that EOL is targeting Hong Kong Again it is the act of making the offer not entering into the transaction that is the subject of the Ordinance Hence arrangements to restrict with whom we ultimately enter into password agreements or conduct trades may not be viewed as conclusive in determining to whom offers are being made l have had an opportunity to review a September advice that Jonathan Marsh obtained from Allen Overy HK In Section they raise similar concerns with regard to the Protection of Investors Ordinance Way Forward I would recommend that the Password Application for Hong Kong immediately be removed from the list on the EOL registration screen at least for the present The chance that this HK PA may invite the attention of the HK SFC needs to be recognised This possibility exists irrespective of the decision to list HK weather products Clearly on a practical level a greater awareness in HK of EOL generated by the launch of HK weather may be the catalyst that attracts SFC interest Whilst our legal analysis has not identified any breach of HK legislation by EOL I would prefer if we mitigated the risk of an SFC instigated dialogue on this point This would mean a Hong Kong resident would need to call up to get a password application If we wish to include on the parts of the EOL site that are available to the public ie where no password is needed provisions that are unambiguously directed to HK residents then it would be prudent for us to talk to the SFC first I note Allen Overy also raised this as a possibility I recognise this is a judgment call on what is one of those grey areas But the prospect of publicity in HK for EOL was the determining factor in concluding that this more conservative approach is warranted at present Amita CT AM To Paul SmithENRON
