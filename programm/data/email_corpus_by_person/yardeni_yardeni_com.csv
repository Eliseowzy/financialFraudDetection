also blessed with the resolve to keep shopping during these unsettled times We are the spenders of last resort If we give in to terrorism then the US economic recession will worsen and so will the global recession That is why President George Bush has been encouraging us to try to go back to business as usual as best we can Mayor Rudy Guilliani wants New Yorkers to spend money at the stores restaurants and the shows The President was right on the money in his speech delivered Saturday in Shanghai when he observed that the terrorists tried to disrupt the global economy They are attacking globalization Mr Bush intends to push for more globalization First our governments must keep the path of economic progress That progress begins with freer trade Trade is the engine of economic advancement On every continent in every culture trade generates opportunity enhances entrepreneur growth And trade applies the power of markets to the needs of the poor It is hard to be bullish on the outlook for the economy and the stock market especially in New York City since the attack hit us so close to home Throughout the country people are jittery about bioterrorism Yet we should remain optimistic that the disaster has created some opportunities that may lead to better times again Relations among the United States Russia and China are improving as they confront the common threat of terrorism We are all taking this problem more seriously now as it is very apparent that the random acts of terror around the world are not random shocks but rather coordinated attempts to destroy centuries of human progress with the intent of restoring a medieval and evil new order The triumph of capitalism over communism more than a decade ago was not the end of history as suggested by some The War on Terrorism may be an even greater challenge to capitalism but capitalism will triumph The end of the Cold War was very bullish for stocks This was one of my major themes in numerous Topical Studies that I wrote during the s See wwwyardenicomtopicalasp The end of the War on Terrorism is likely to be equally as bullish if it leads to increased globalization world trade and prosperity But this war has just started it could last years and it isnt likely that any particular event will mark its end as did the demolition of the Berlin Wall mark the end of the Cold War Some observers see similarities between the two wars because they see a need to contain terror now just as the United States struggled to contain communism in the past The difference is that the Soviets at least valued their own lives while the terrorists are suicidal and readily kill civilians SUBSCRIBERS In this weeks GLOBAL PORTFOLIO STRATEGY I reassess the outlook for consumer spending I conclude that the key is jobs as has always been the case The prospects are not good because many companies overhired during the s I also examine two other dueling excesses capacity versus liquidity I am betting that liquidity will win but not until the second half of next year In Mondays WEEKLY AUDIO FORUM Ill discuss this subject and explain why the widely embraced V scenario may not be so bullish after all In brief A V cant happen unless housing and auto sales plunge over the next several months DBAB analyst Rod Lache will join me to discuss the auto industry and to explain why Ford isnt giving workers free PCs anymore PUBLIC I concluded in my recent Global Strategists Handbook Stock Market CyclesBottom Fishing the panic selling during the week ended September probably made a major cyclical low Of course another terror attack at home could trigger a retest of that low Heck lousy earnings reports could do the same So could weakerthanexpected consumer spending caused by a soaring unemployment rate which could jump to by the end of the year and by next spring in my opinion If September was the bottom then here are a few industries that have had the best relative performance immediately after SP troughs since Paper Forest Products Department Stores Auto Parts Thrifts and Truckers If you think that we are still in store for a megarecession then the best relative performance prior to the stock market bottom was in Paper Forest Products Chemicals Aluminum Iron Steel Metals Mining Containers Packaging Entertainment Domestic Integrated Oil Oil Gas Drilling Equipment Money Center Banks Pharmaceuticals Truckers Railroads and Gold Precious Metals Mining The worst relative performers before the stock market trough were Computer Hardware Retail Department Stores Consumer Finance Autos Auto Parts Alcoholic and Nonalcoholic Beverages Personal Care Property Casualty Insurance and Electric Companies Of course as we all know past performance is not a guarantee of future results

wonderful holiday All you have to do is give thanks and eat We have much to be thankful for The war on terrorism is progressing better than had been widely expected US authorities are acting to foil new terrorist strikes at home The intelligence agencies of nations around the world are cooperating more in the effort to attack the global network of terrorists The new airline security legislation should revive public confidence in flying again over the next six to months US relations with Russia have improved greatly Freer trade is increasingly viewed as one of the best responses to antiglobilization China has joined the World Trade Organization Russia could be next There is ample financial liquidity Energy costs are low Interest rates are low too and financing has boosted auto sales The economic recession is likely to remain shallow and should end by next spring The profits recovery during the second half of should be robust The bond market seems to share this assessment Two weeks ago I wrote the flood of liquidity is likely to revive the economy next year This suggests that the bond rally may be coming to an end This is why I am raising my stocksbonds ratio Since then the year bond yield is up an extraordinary basis points Over this same twoweek period the Dow Jones Industrials Average rose closer to In when the Dow crossed I predicted it would cross by It did so on March I didnt expect it would rise above two times again as it has since then Odds are the Dow will soon this week rise above yet again for the fourth time How much longer will the Dow remain flat around this level It could be a long time After all it did rise tenfold from to from through following two decades of meandering in a flat trend between and A long period of consolidation after the extraordinary gains of the s and s is possible The Dows day moving average has been relatively flat between and since late The week following the September terrorist attacks the Dow bottomed at which was points or below its day moving average That was probably the bottom Bottoms are often made by panic selling during major crises The Dow was oversold and it quickly bounced back It is hard to see the Dow moving much higher soon since it is already discounting a solid rebound in earnings next year with a reasonable valuation of those earnings expectations Since the week consensus expected forward earnings per share has hovered around per share and the forward PE has hovered around If both continue to do so through the first half of as I expect the Dow Jones Industrials will continue to hover around By the end of next year however the Dow could retest the record high set in early of about That would be a return from current levels The major risk is that consumer spending might weaken significantly in early Auto sales are bound to tumble as the stimulative impact of financing wears off While the pace of layoffs may be slowing it is becoming harder to find a job because many firms have imposed hiring freezes Also the coming bonus season will probably be the worst since the early s Many job losers are losing high incomes and are unlikely to find comparablepaying jobs soon The good news for many of them is that they are receiving large severance pay packages This development may partly explain the surprising resilience of consumer spending as well as some of the amazing surge in liquidity this year MZMwhich includes M savings deposits and money market mutual fundsis up billion over the past weeks a record rate GOODWILL The November issue of EARNINGS WEEK examines the likely impact on earnings of the elimination of goodwill amortization expense next year We come up with a per share boost Will the market treat the accounting rule change as a technical adjustment with no impact on stock prices In other words will a lower PE offset the higher E My hunch is that there will be some bullish impact even though nothing real changes What does reality have to do with stock valuation Reality probably matters in the long run but perceptions certainly matter in the short run MOVIES Harry Potter was too long It reminded me of Star Wars set in a British boarding school for wouldbe wizards It isnt my cup of tea My yearold son enjoyed it but he isnt interested in seeing it again I predict that Harry Potter II will be much less successful The Man Who Wasnt There

of the May CIO Magazine Tech Poll Last summer I partnered with the good folks at the magazine to conduct a webbased poll of chief information officers to assess the outlook for information technology IT spending on a monthly basis The resulting CIO Magazine Tech Poll in partnership with yardenicom is already proving to be an accurate measure of technology spending and business trends In May our panel predicted IT budgets will grow by just over the next months down from a prediction in April and down sharply from last November The panel reported IT budgets grew an average over the previous months down from the April estimate and again down sharply from last September Now we know HighTech spending is not recession proof Like the lowtech variety of capital spending it depends on profits and financing conditions It will rebound when these two conditions improve Since February weve asked our CIO panelists what is the number one negative for IT spending In May weak profits was cited by of the panelists as the primary negative factor facing IT spending plans in That is up from in February In May another saw tight financial conditions as the main problem down from in February The Feds aggressive easing has had an impact on our panelists perceptions of credit conditions since fewer are reporting that this is a number one problem for IT spending At the same time more of our respondents say that weak profits are depressing technology budgets SUBSCRIBERS For more on the poll and tech capital spending see my latest GLOBAL PORTFOLIO STRATEGY In last weeks GPS I examined the valuation question The mean and not marketcapweighted PE for the SP is down from a record high of last year in March to now Stocks are cheaper but certainly not cheap The median PE for the SP actually rose over this period from to SP technology stocks are also cheaper but not cheap The mean tech PE is now down from while the median is down to from Despite the Tech Wreck technology stocks remain the most highly priced in the market with a marketcap weighted PE of That is down from a high of early last year Transportation valuations remain in the bargain basement Makes sense right Technology earnings grow faster than Transportation earnings so they deserve a higher PE Yet when we actually compare the performance of the two since the fact is that Transportation has outperformed Technology

<24998696.1075851538965.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,yardeni@yardeni.com,2001-10-10 13:49:53,New On Dr Eds Economics NetworkWednesday afternoon October New Research Report From Dr Ed Yardeni STOCK MARKET CYCLES BOTTOM FISHING publicmktcyclepdf During bear markets stock investors and investment strategists are constantly on the lookout for the bottom This time is no different Indeed many of them thought they caught it at the beginning of April this year They were wrong Picking the exact bottom can be very rewarding of course Since there have been nine major troughs in the SP following declines of or more and averaging minus After these cyclical lows in stock prices the average month gain was an impressive In this special issue of the Global Strategists Handbook I present numerous charts relating key economic and financial indicators to the cycle in stock prices with the focus on finding the ones that are most useful in picking bottoms My conclusion is that many of the ones that have worked best in the past are currently suggesting that the panicselling low of September was probably the bottom for this cycle There are no guarantees Past performance does not indicate future results as we say in the investment business The low might be retested A lower low might still be in the cards Moreover even if it was the bottom the rebound in stock prices over the next months may be well below the average in my judgment because stocks are not as undervalued as they were at previous bottoms One of the best times to buy stocks is during crises when panic selling occurs The crises usually trigger corrective policy responses which prove the doomsayers wrong So they present great buying opportunities for bargain hunters Of course this is easier said than done For example during the first week that the stock market was open for trading after the Attack the right time to buy was on Friday not Monday By the end of the following week most of the bargains were gone Exhibits in my latest research report show many of the best market timing tools including a few that are not as useful as widely believed pricetoearnings ratios valuation the federal funds rate bond yields the yield curve creditquality yield spreads earnings production commodity prices employment and money Most institutional investors cant raise a great deal of cash while waiting for the next crisis to create buying opportunities Most tend to be always fully invested so market timing may not be a very relevant exercise for them Nevertheless market timing can help boost performance by identifying sectors and industries that tend to either underperform or outperform during a cyclical recovery in stock prices Exhibits in this report are designed to provide some insights for the selected industries where relative performance data are available for several years You can find the complete report at publicmktcyclepdf Dr Ed Home wwwyardenicom Global Portfolio Strategy

<9465179.1075845227455.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,yardeni@yardeni.com,2001-04-18 22:44:57,Dr Eds Comment On The Feds Latest Rate CutHpst COMMENT ON FED RATE CUT Dr Ed Yardeni Chief Investment Strategist Deutsche Banc Alex Brown April Now there are basis points left between the federal funds rate and zero Since the start of the yearin less than four monthsthe Fed folks have reduced the rate by basis points while the jobless rate has remained close to The message to equity investors is clear The folks at the Fed dont want a recession and they do want consumers to keep shopping According to the official easing statement yesterday they acted in response to a recent set of developments that threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably weak This wording suggests that they must be aiming for economic growth that is acceptably strong Apparently they now understand that the profits recession was on the verge of turning into an economywide recession Nearly every company reporting disappointing profits in recent weeks also announced plans to cut employment Obviously if many companies do so consumer spending would be depressed and profits would continue to fall during the second half of the year Interestingly the Fed folks strongly implied in their statement that they now want stock prices to rise to offset the possible negative effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption This is a dramatic reversal from early last year when the Fed Chairman said that the stock market rally was causing a wealth effect that was stimulating excess demand Our Chief Economist Peter Hooper has accurately anticipated that the Fed would respond to a weakening economy by lowering interest rates He expects that another halfpoint cut is coming at the May meeting of the policy committee I have shared this outlook You might recall that at the end of last year I suggested you should chant the following mantra to calm any recession anxiety There are still basis points between the fed funds rate and zero So how does the Feds latest action change the outlook for the stock market Most importantly it reduces the likelihood that consensus earnings expectations will continue to decline over the remainder of the year Even if there are some more negative surprises for the first and second quarters most analysts are likely to remain optimistic about the second half of the year and especially now that the Fed has sent such a clear progrowth message On the other hand earnings valuation multiples are unlikely to rise from currently high levels if the year government bond yield remains around through the end of the year as no seems more likely than another drop Furthermore stocks are now overvalued as a result of the dramatic rally in stock prices in recent days combined with the backup in yields The bulls can rightly cheer The Fed is our friend However stocks arent cheap though many are certainly cheaper than a year ago The Fed is clearly the consumers friend So I reiterate my preference for consumer cyclicals especially retailers However if retailers continue to advance we may have to lighten up at some point if valuations become overly rich I think entertainment recreation and media stocks should also benefit from easier credit conditions Consumer finance stocks should remain strong since the risk of recessioninduced loan delinquencies is reduced Money center and regional banks are also winners now that the yield curve is no longer inverted thanks to the Fed In addition the quality of their loan portfolios is likely to remain sound Investment bankers and asset managers should be more profitable in this improved outlook for the financial markets during the second half of the year Nevertheless I am neutral on the bondsensitive industries Life Insurance PCs and SLs which will probably mark time for the rest of the year I may have overstayed my underweight position in technology given the impressive rebound over the past week Fortunately I continue to recommend an overweight in software no inventory or commoditization issues and a market weight in semiconductors high profit margins when sales rebound More generally Tech remains an earningschallenged sector but investors seem to mostly believe that its so bad it cant get any worse They are probably right but it may not get much better either for a while There are still plenty of dotcoms that havent crashed and burned yet but are burning cash fast Cisco can writeoff inventories but they still need to be sold On the other hand I do expect a wave of MA activity in the Tech and Telecom sectors Such consolidation could help to solve some of the excess capacity and competitive issues hurting many tech industries profitability For this reason I am raising my Computer Hardware recommendation to market weight I remain fond of wireless infrastructure equipment for running businesses on a truly realtime basis My Power Play stocks Energy Utilities did not participate in yesterdays rally But I think once the Tech euphoria cools off and the summer heat drives up gasoline and electricity rates they will do well In about a month the Bush Administration will release its energy plan which should raise awareness of how much we must invest in power production and distribution after so many years of neglect Health Care also was left behind yesterday Maybe it is too defensive for yesterdays growth chasers However I think that a Biotechled advance for this sector is likely over the remainder of the year The more established Biotech companies are actually reporting some very respectable earnings performances Finally let me mention that Basic Materials a tiny sector in the SP is rapidly consolidating most recently in the metals mining paper and steel industries I like the stocks I also like Defense Aerospace Im neutral on Consumer Staples and Transportation Dr Ed You can now automatically adddelete this update and other

describe the growing power of fixed income investors and traders over the economy In recent years theyve lost some of their clout because the US Treasury is paying off the federal debt Also inflation has been relatively tame and so have they Venture capitalists became the new power elite in the late s leading the Nasdaq to record highs Now the bond crowd is back They are tightening credit conditions while the Fed is easing The Treasury bond yield is up over basis points since March which is boosting mortgage rates The spread between Arated corporate and year Treasury yields has widened dramatically from around basis points at the end of to more than basis points recently The highyield and commercial paper markets are essentially shutdown for all but prime borrowers On the other hand the yield curve is ascending again with the year yield more than basis points above the month Tbill rate At the start of the year the curve was inverted with a spread of basis points This is good news because an ascending yield curve gives banks and other financial intermediaries an incentive to lend The banks also have lots of money to lend because shellshocked stock investors are putting more of their funds into bank deposits which are up billion over the past months The resulting rapid rise in the monetary aggregates is Exhibit A in the case against both a recession and a prolonged bear market in stocks Indeed real GDP was up during the first quarter and stock prices have rebounded nicely since early April Still the rolling recession is likely to continue rolling over the technology industry and shows more signs of spreading to labor markets around the country Furthermore the stock market is now more than overvalued as stock prices rose at the same time that earnings expectations fell and bond yields moved higher SUBSCRIBERS I can only conclude that either bond investors need Prozac or stock investors are back on Ecstasy For more on this subject see my latest GLOBAL PORTFOLIO

<6883422.1075845228084.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,yardeni@yardeni.com,2001-05-13 05:50:42,New On Dr Eds Economics NetworkHpst Sunday morning May COMMENT Many economists are surprised by the strength in retail and housing sales Apparently they dont have kids As the father of five I know that we Baby Boomers will be spending lots of money on our Baby Boomlet for quite some time even if weve lost some of our job security and some of our stock market wealth Today there are roughly million Baby Boomers who were born between and They are years old Theyve been busy with their careers but not too busy to have some sex along the way Theyve had an estimated million kidscurrently aged to years old since These kids cost lots of money to house clothe feed transport entertain and educate In poor agrarian societies having kids is often an economic necessity to provide extra labor to tend the livestock and bring in the crops In modern industrial societies having kids is a sign of optimism about the future The birth rate is currently relatively high in the US and low in Japan Rapid population growth in modern economies often is associated with rapid economic growth The Census counted million people in the United States a increase from The population growth of million persons represents the largest censustocensus increase in American history The previous record increase was million people an increase between and Both the s and s were decades of prosperity Lets keep the prosperity going Have kids I am doing my part for the good of the country Laura Juliette joined the Yardeni Bunch on Friday May Fortunately the beautiful baby girl looks just like her beautiful Mom SUBSCRIBERS As the new kid on the blocie the new investment strategist on Wall StreetIve been working hard to develop my models for analyzing earnings valuation and performance Of course the tools of the trade also include stocksversusbonds asset allocation models as well as equity sector allocation models I think my tool kit is fairly complete However my strong suit in my previous life as an economist was focusing on longterm trends that have important investment implications I intend to build on this foundation by identifying investment themes for longterm investors and selecting companies that are likely to be major beneficiaries I plan to track the performance of these themes This is a work in progress I begin with the following five themes Power Play China Challenge TMT The Brady Bunch and Jurassic Park I pick stocks in my latest GLOBAL PORTFOLIO STRATEGY In Mondays WEEKLY AUDIO FORUM well discuss whether the profits slump is ending or spreading In addition my special guest will explore the outlook for biotech PUBLIC The latest EARNINGS WEEK covers the retailers a sector that I favor and has performed relatively well so far this year The May GLOBAL STRATEGISTS HANDBOOK is posted on the HOME page So are the latest ANALYST S HANDBOOKs covering Consumer Spending HighTech Energy and Basic Materials The KEY WEEKLY INDICATORS and the FED WATCHER have been expanded BUBBLE II May Global Column printed in leading financial publications around the world I recently reread a wonderfully written book titled Manias Panics and Crashes by the great economist and financial historian Charles P Kindleberger It is a history of financial crises Professor Kindleberger who taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology also presents a thoughtful analysis of why they occur Finally he offers valuable advice to central bankers on how to avoid such crises and how to deal with them if they do occur The book was written in but remains remarkably relevant today Indeed new editions were printed in and I am sure that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has read it Perhaps he should read it again if he wants to avoid another bubble in the stock market The recent dramatic rebound in US stock prices in response to stimulative monetary policy is a hopeful sign for the rapidly deteriorating economy However the rally already shows signs of renewed irrational exuberance especially once again among technology stocks Reflating the techheavy Nasdaq bubble would be good news for some investors in the short run but a Bubble II scenario could be bad news for the longterm health of the global economy Professor Kindleberger convincingly argues that speculative bubbles are mostly monetary phenomena They occur because money is too easily available The bubbles burst when the easy money stops How should central banks manage the resulting crises Kindleberger warns the lender of last resort should exist but his presence should be doubted Furthermore he advises that the central bank should always come to the rescue to halt deflation but always leave it uncertain whether rescue will arrive in time or at all so as to instill caution in other speculators Currently there is no uncertainty about the Feds goal The message to investors is clear The folks at the Fed dont want a recession On April the Fed lowered the federal funds rate by half a point the fourth cut this year Now there are basis points left between the federal funds rate and zero The US monetary policymakers are expected to lower rates again by half a point when they meet on May Since the start of the yearin less than four monthsthe Fed folks have reduced the rate by basis points while the jobless rate has remained close to According to the April official easing statement they acted in response to a recent set of developments that threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably weak This wording suggests that they must be aiming for economic growth that is acceptably strong Apparently they are very concerned that the profits recession is on the verge of turning into an economywide recession Nearly every company reporting disappointing profits so far this year also announced plans to cut employment Obviously if many companies do so consumer spending would be depressed and profits would continue to fall during the second half of the year The Fed folks strongly implied in their April statement that they now want stock prices to rise to offset the possible negative effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption This is a dramatic reversal from early last year when the Fed Chairman said that the stock market rally was causing a wealth effect that was stimulating excess demand This explicit statement violates Professor Kindlebergers advice to keep speculators guessing What should investors do Bond investors have already decided that a progrowth Fed is not in their best interest This explains why bond yields have not declined along with shortterm interest rates so far this year Indeed yields have been mostly moving higher Obviously bond investors believe that the Fed will succeed in reviving economic growth and maybe even lift inflation Monetarists observe that the money supply as measure by M is up at an annualized over the past weeks An ascending yield curvewith bond yields above moneymarket interest rateand rapidly growing M are both bullish for the economy and therefore for stocks The problem is that stocks are not cheap In early May the pricetoearnings ratio based on month forward consensus expected earnings was back up to from a low of earlier this year It hit a record high of at the end of just a few months before the bubble burst Back then the Fed had provided easy money to cushion anticipated YK problems that never happened Now the Fed is providing easy money to minimize the pain resulting from the bursting of Bubble I which seems to be setting the stage for Bubble II I like bubbles You can make lots of money very quickly when a bubble is inflating as long as you get out just before it bursts I am amazed though that so many investors remain so obsessed with technology stocks despite the fact that so much money was lost in these stocks over the past year Many tech stocks rebounded or more during April Of course many tech stocks are up from to after plunging from highs of or more early last year Nevertheless the bulls charged in recently snorting that the worst is over They are probably right but many tech pricetoearnings ratios are back over suggesting that the good old days of plus earnings growth will soon be back I doubt that I also doubt that technology deserves a valuation multiple well above the overall markets multiple especially after the tech wreck of the past year Nevertheless if you must play tech then do so with software companies that are not as vulnerable as are tech hardware companies to inventory problems and competitive pressures on profit margins Professor Kindleberger concludes his book by asking whether we even need a lender of last resort Some monetarists and other critics of central banking practices observe that the monetary authorities usually cause the financial crisis by providing easy money for too long Perhaps it is time for the Fed Chairman to declare that the Fed has eased enough as evidenced by the ascending yield curve and the rapid growth in M It has done enough to revive economic growth in the long run although there might be some more pain in the short run Then we could remain rationally exuberant about the longterm prospects for stocks Dr Ed You can now automatically adddelete this update and other products Just click on Fido the dog at

<21394743.1075845228162.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,yardeni@yardeni.com,2001-05-17 05:15:30,Comment On The Fed StocksHpst Thursday morning May COMMENT I believe the Fed made a mistake on Tuesday The basispoint cut in the federal funds rate was not necessary at this time That was the message from the bond market rising yields the yield curve steepening slope and the stock market rebounding prices following the previous rate cut on April More recently the rising prices of gold and gold stocks also confirm the growing market consensus that the Fed may be easing too much The rapid growth in M also suggests that the Fed has done enough to revive economic growth later this year and may now be overshooting on the easing side My main issue with the Feds latest move isnt the rate cut itself but rather the press release that explained the reasons for the action It was almost a carbon copy of the statement issued by the Fed following the previous rate cut on April The message is that the economic risks are still on the downside and that monetary policy is still biased to ease In my opinion the message should have observed that the federal funds rate has been cut five times in five months by basis points to and that this might be enough for now The message should have been biased toward a neutral monetary policy stance In my comment this past Sunday I wrote Now the Fed is providing easy money to minimize the pain resulting from the bursting of Bubble I which seems to be setting the stage for Bubble II Stock investors agreed with this conclusion on Wednesday a day after the Fed folks cut the federal funds rate yet again They understand that the Feds rush to ease credit conditions may not revive economic growth as quickly as the monetary authorities would like Instead the resulting flood of liquidity is likely to pour into the stock market Indeed both the April and May statements clearly implied that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues now want to promote a positive wealth effect in the stock market to boost consumer spending This is quite a reversal from early last year when the Fed Chairman worried that the soaring stock market was pushing consumer demand above available supply Here is the relevant excerpt from the May statement The erosion in current and prospective profitability in combination with considerable uncertainty about the business outlook seems likely to hold down capital spending going forward This potential restraint together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad continues to weigh on the economy Here is the relevant excerpt from the April statement Nonetheless capital investment has continued to soften and the persistent erosion in current and expected profitability in combination with rising uncertainty about the business outlook seems poised to dampen capital spending going forward This potential restraint together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably weak The message is loud and clear The Fed folks believe that the negative equity wealth effect they helped to engineer over the past year has gone too far A rebound in stock prices is now welcome The Feds welcome wagon is stocked with lots of bottles of champagne and the speculators are drinking the liquidity with gusto The bubbly is bringing back irrational exuberance fast For a complete history of the Feds policy statements see FOMCasp As I stated in my Sunday comment I like bubbles You can make lots of money very quickly when a bubble is inflating as long as you get out just before it bursts As of yesterdays close the SP was overvalued based on the Feds Stock Valuation Model FSVM Five more percentage points and the market will be as overvalued as it was just before the crash though it would still be cheaper than at the start of last year when it was overvalued But that was Bubble I Bubble II may surpass the overvaluation but I suspect it will burst somewhere below the level My asset allocation model which is based on the FSVM suggests that the right stocksbonds mix whenever the market is more than overvalued is a very conservative The recommended mix is whenever the market is to overvalued For the past few weeks I have hesitated to lower my stocksbonds recommended mix from because the Feds liquidity party is likely to drive stock prices up further In addition the sober bond vigilantes are back trying to offset the Feds easing policy by pushing yields up For a weekly update of the FSVM see publicstkvalupdf If the year Treasury yield rises closer to and stocks become more than overvalued which seems increasingly likely over the next few months then I may go to If I think we are close to bursting Bubble II Ill suggest The Fed is certainly our friend However true friends dont let their friends drink and drive I would prefer an earningsdriven bull market rather than a liquiditydriven one For now May the bubble be with you NEW ON SITE For those of you who still care about
