Fwd Fw Osama Bin Laden Observations In a message dated PM Central Daylight Time writes Its good to see a little American humor again We are getting more and more insight into the life of Osama bin Laden Today the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States said that bin Laden had an unhappy childhood growing up brothers and sisters You think his childhood was unhappy wait til we deliver his midlife crisis Jay Leno It was reported today that Osama Bin Laden has brothers and sisters Which absolutely shocked me because I had no idea he was Catholic Conan OBrien You read about all these terrorists most of them came here legally but they hung around on these expired visas some for as long as years Now compare that to Blockbuster you are two days late with a video and these people are all over you Lets put Blockbuster in charge of immigration Jay Leno The Taliban has asked Osama bin Laden to voluntarily leave the country They said they delivered him a note asking him to leave which is a pretty good trick considering they claim they dont even know where he is Jay Leno I read in the paper today this bin Laden guy is the wealthiest guy in Afghanistan Thats when you know your government is no good when the wealthiest guy in the country lives in a cave Jay Leno There are reports on the news tonight that members of the Taliban feel persecuted and fear their own safety So now they know what it is like to feel like a woman in their country Jay Leno There was a rumor that Jesse Jackson was going to go over there to talk with the Taliban apparently they were having trouble rhyming the word Jihad Jay Leno US Government has said they are now going to go after the terrorists electronic banking system You know what they should do They should transfer bin Ladens funds to my bank Theyd mess up his deposits screw up his statement and nickel and dime him to death with service charges Jay Leno More and more details coming out now about spoiled rich kid Usama bin Laden Time reports this week he was one of kids Mother must be exhausted This guy inherited million at age and has since expanded it to million through construction smart investments and gas and oil investments This way he can use the money in his war against capitalism Jay Leno The leaders of the Taliban said today that killing bin Laden wont solve the problem But you know it couldnt hurt Jay Leno More and more facts coming out about Osama bin Laden You know he never sleeps in the same place two nights in a row just like Clinton Jay Leno This Osama bin Laden guy spoiled rich kid worth M I have three
