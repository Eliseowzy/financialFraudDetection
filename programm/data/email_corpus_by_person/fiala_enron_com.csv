off point required to determine your understanding of the business and how we intend to go forward This is top priority MKF From Iris nronXgate on CDT To Scott nron cc Vince J nronXgate Amitava nronXgate Vasant nronXgate Jeff nronXgate Bryan CT Markus CT Tanya nronXgate Subject RE Scotts concerns about the Public Firm Models Hi Scott I stand to be corrected I forgot that the recording of dates in the UK is different from the way it is recorded in the US The date on Geoges document is ie October Again Jeff stated that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to sort out the public firm model issues Until then I am busy trying to develop the private firm model which is the deliverable we promised to Enron Credit as stated in the Elaboration Document I sent last week Best regards Iris Original Message From Salmon Scott Sent Monday May PM To Mack Iris Cc Kaminski Vince J Dhar Amitava Shanbhogue Vasant Kinneman Jeff Seyfried Bryan Fiala Markus Tamarchenko Tanya Subject RE Scotts concerns about the Public Firm Models Hi Iris I also have copies of and have read the documents you mention while they contain some good information especially the movement model plan the meeting summary is just thata very general summary of a meeting with recommendations like hire quants and make sure there is adequate communication among the different teams The meeting summary addresses testing only briefly in saying be aware of the time dimension which is obvious and has been addressed by adding more equity driven ratios as well as our plan to add a time dimension to capture ratings momentum following a downgrade Perhaps you didnt understand my specific request for any ideas you might have to assist in model testing and also for an update on the Duffie report We still have not seen any drafts of what you learned As Im sure you recall the teleconference with Vince Vasant and Amitava focused exclusively on private firm models the scope of the project and data acquisition considerations After the call you suggested to Bryan Eric Mike and I that your report would include many of the issues in Georges documents movement model and meeting summary My personal hope echoed by Bryan at that time was that your report might be more insightful since the movement model as you surely learned in your visit is in its infancy and only one portion of the modelling effort and the meeting summary covered the most basic issues with minimal detail I sincerely want to establish a solid relationship with Houston Research and hope we can move forward together in a coordinated teamoriented approach I look forward to discussing it with you at our Tuesday teleconference Best regards Scott FYI George joined the company in Sep so could not have written the Movement Model proposal in April From Iris nronXgate on CDT To Scott nron cc Vince J nronXgate Amitava nronXgate Vasant nronXgate Jeff nronXgate Bryan CT Markus CT Tanya nronXgate Subject RE Scotts concerns about the Public Firm Models Hi Scott How are you Thanks for your email I can appreciate your concerns about the public firm models but am at a loss for what more I can say that has not already been said Recall that during my recent trip to London we had a conference call with Houston research you Bryan Mike and Eric During this conference call Vince Vasant Amitava and I pointed out some of the issues with the public firm models and the data used to develop these models In addition after that conference call you Bryan Mike Eric and I had further discussions as to how to sort out the public firm models During this discussion we all agreed that most of these issues had already been raised and addressed by George Albanis in the following documents EnronCreditcom Project Proposal Movement Model and Parallel Work Phases IV by George Albanis December Meeting Review by George Albanis I also forwarded copies of these documents to you and Ben via email on May th Just in case you cant find them I will forward them again Based on recent discussions with Jeff Kinneman it is my understanding that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to figure out how to repair the public firm models Hence it may be more appropriate to direct any future concerns about the public firm models to their attention Regards Iris Original Message From Salmon Scott Sent Friday May AM To Mack Iris Cc Kaminski Vince J Dhar Amitava Subject Report to Professor Duffie Hi Iris I wasnt sure if you had already sent your report to Professor Duffie yet or not but Ive been thinking about ways that his group or the Research team could really add value in an area where were admittedly weak model testing If you havent sent the report to him yet perhaps we can request his opinions on best practices for testing models with limited quality out of sample test sets Obviously Id like to discuss this in detail with you as well especially since you understand the characteristics of the models and data better now but Ill do that via phone Im hoping there are some statistical techniques were currently ignoring that we can employ to maximize the testing we do and get a better handle on judging our accuracy If youve got some time Tuesday after our meeting where Mike catches us up on the DB issues Id love to get your views as the model testbed is now in place and were starting a model recalbration phase Im least comfortable about our plans for stress testing the models once weve recalibrated them Looking forward to talking to you Tuesday Regards Scott
