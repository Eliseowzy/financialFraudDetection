WOODLANDS TEXAS EMAIL WEB PAGE wwwflexnetsnk DONALD S STIRMAN MEDIATOR CLIFFORD L PARMLEY MD JD OF COUNSEL JOSEPH T KENNEDY ERIC R HIRD KEVIN T SHEA TELEPHONE FAX February Via email Mr Mrs Mike McConnell Belhaven Drive Houston TX RE Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair Construction Co Inc as Seller and Mike and Chris McConnell as Buyer Dear Mike We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract and your letter to us regarding same dated February We want to respond to the questions and issues raised in your letter as well as make some suggestions and comments about the proposed Contract itself First the Contract being used is the standard type of Contract used for the proposed transaction The Contract is promulgated by the Texas Real Estate Commission and is to be used by all licensed Real Estate Brokers and Agents We are interested in knowing however if the Contract was filled out by Mr Larry Williams of Prudential Gary Greene Realtors If so does Mr Williams represent you or Flair Construction Co Inc Please advise us accordingly As we discussed we think it is most important that you have the opportunity to read and review the Construction Agreement that Flair Construction Co Inc intends on using for the construction of your home The fact that Flair is both the Developer as well as the potential Builder raises some issues Usually Builders have agreements with the Developer regarding the purchase of lots and building on same Often lots are reserved to certain Builders and if you purchase those lots you are required to use the designated Builders However often lots are free to be purchased by potential homeowners who then can choose the Builder they want We are interested in knowing if the lots you are purchasing are actually reserved to Flair Construction Co Inc or is Flair just requiring you to use them to build your home since they are selling you the lots in question As you point out in your letter if you sign the Contract as it now reads you are captive to the Builder and are not free to negotiate with other Builders It appears to us that you will be one of the first homeowners in this new subdivision We think it is critically important that you get a copy of the Deed Restrictions even before you sign the Contract to make sure that there are restrictions in place regarding the size of homes to be built size of lots etc We want to make sure that your home is not horribly atypical for the neighborhood We do not know if The Lakes of Sterling Gate Estates is in the City of Houston or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction This is something you may want to find out as soon as possible If it is outside the city limits is there already a MUD district in place to provide water and sewer services Since this is a brand new subdivision your concern regarding its future development and tax rate is very legitimate Usually until the subdivision is fairly well built out the Developer controls the Community Association as well as the Architectural Control Committee Therefore if this subdivision does not take off you will be under the control of the Developer We recommend in the strongest terms possible that you talk with recent customers of Flair Construction Co Inc to make sure that they were happy with the construction of their homes as well as warranty work Some Builders are far better than others as it relates to followup warranty work after their customers move into their homes We normally recommend that homeowners do not move into their homes until all punch list items are completed to the satisfaction of the homeowner The foregoing was our general comments regarding the proposed Contract We will now make more specific comments and suggestions in chronological order regarding the Contract Paragraph PROPERTY As we previously stated we think it is important that you acquire copies of the Restrictive Covenants and Deed Restrictions as soon as possible You will be responsible to pay assessments to the Property Owners Association Since Flair is both the Builder and Developer you may want to ask Mr Kent for an estimate of what your Community Association Fees will be Paragraph EARNEST MONEY We suggest that the earnest money be paid to the Title Company and not to Flair Construction Co Inc Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY The standard printed exception as to discrepancies conflicts shortages in area or boundary lines encroachments or protrusions or overlapping improvements is in your Owners Policy In other words the title policy does not cover these types of discrepancies or conflicts However if a survey is completed and an additional fifteen percent of the policy premium is paid the title company will probably delete this exception This is something you may want to consider However this cost would be yours to incur If however it is subsequently discovered that there are such discrepancies and conflicts or shortages then you will have title insurance coverage accordingly Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY last paragraph Make sure you are provided a copy of the Commitment for Title Insurance as soon as possible Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY B It appears to us that the only survey you will be provided with by the Seller is one for the new recorded plat of the subdivision Therefore the Seller is not providing you a survey of your actual lots If you were to have the standard printed exception as to discrepancies and conflicts deleted we believe you would need a survey of your lots You will have seven days after you receive the Commitment andor the survey to object in writing to any matters disclosed or you will be deemed to waive such objections accordingly Therefore please make sure that we have the opportunity to review the survey and commitment as soon as possible after you receive same Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY We agree that this paragraph relating to the Sellers right to continue to show the property for sale should be deleted Paragraph PROPERTY CONDITION B We suggest that this paragraph be checked and utilized rather than paragraph B which states that you will be accepting the property in its present condition Paragraph B states that you will pay a fee usually very small like for the unrestricted right to terminate the contract in the event the property is not suitable for the purposes for which you intend on using it In other words you can have whatever inspectors you deem necessary to look at the property to make sure that it is satisfactory for your home construction We often suggest that an independent inspector be hired by the homeowner to inspect and review the construction of the home as it progresses In addition there may be some environmental issues or soil condition questions that an inspector might raise if given the opportunity As the Contract now reads you are simply accepting the property as is and have no right to send an inspector out to the property accordingly Paragraph BROKERS FEES You may want an affirmative statement that you as the Buyer will not be responsible for or pay any Brokers fees Paragraph SPECIAL PROVISIONS It is written in that the closing on these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March whichever is later However we do not know what roads are being addressed and think that this sentence needs far more specificity The second sentence regarding your obligation to use Flair Homes has already been addressed earlier The third sentence regarding when construction must start should be revised to give you more time as you make reference in your letter However we also suggest that the Builder be put under an obligation to start construction within thirty days after the date you notify him that you are ready for construction to begin Paragraph ROLLBACK TAXES If there was ever an agricultural or timber exemption on this property you need to know Otherwise you will be obligated to pay rollback taxes on the property which may go back five years Paragraph ESCROW As we indicated earlier we believe your earnest money should be paid to the title company In light of the fact that the earnest money is in excess of and the closing date on the lots is somewhat uncertain we suggest that you ask the title company to deposit the earnest money in an interest bearing account and that you receive a credit accordingly Please call us after you read and review this letter Very truly yours Donald S Stirman DSScsb

WOODLANDS TEXAS EMAIL WEB PAGE wwwflexnetsnk DONALD S STIRMAN MEDIATOR CLIFFORD L PARMLEY MD JD OF COUNSEL JOSEPH T KENNEDY ERIC R HIRD KEVIN T SHEA TELEPHONE FAX February Via email Mr Mrs Mike McConnell Belhaven Drive Houston TX RE Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair Construction Co Inc as Seller and Mike and Chris McConnell as Buyer Dear Mike We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract and your letter to us regarding same dated February We want to respond to the questions and issues raised in your letter as well as make some suggestions and comments about the proposed Contract itself First the Contract being used is the standard type of Contract used for the proposed transaction The Contract is promulgated by the Texas Real Estate Commission and is to be used by all licensed Real Estate Brokers and Agents We are interested in knowing however if the Contract was filled out by Mr Larry Williams of Prudential Gary Greene Realtors If so does Mr Williams represent you or Flair Construction Co Inc Please advise us accordingly As we discussed we think it is most important that you have the opportunity to read and review the Construction Agreement that Flair Construction Co Inc intends on using for the construction of your home The fact that Flair is both the Developer as well as the potential Builder raises some issues Usually Builders have agreements with the Developer regarding the purchase of lots and building on same Often lots are reserved to certain Builders and if you purchase those lots you are required to use the designated Builders However often lots are free to be purchased by potential homeowners who then can choose the Builder they want We are interested in knowing if the lots you are purchasing are actually reserved to Flair Construction Co Inc or is Flair just requiring you to use them to build your home since they are selling you the lots in question As you point out in your letter if you sign the Contract as it now reads you are captive to the Builder and are not free to negotiate with other Builders It appears to us that you will be one of the first homeowners in this new subdivision We think it is critically important that you get a copy of the Deed Restrictions even before you sign the Contract to make sure that there are restrictions in place regarding the size of homes to be built size of lots etc We want to make sure that your home is not horribly atypical for the neighborhood We do not know if The Lakes of Sterling Gate Estates is in the City of Houston or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction This is something you may want to find out as soon as possible If it is outside the city limits is there already a MUD district in place to provide water and sewer services Since this is a brand new subdivision your concern regarding its future development and tax rate is very legitimate Usually until the subdivision is fairly well built out the Developer controls the Community Association as well as the Architectural Control Committee Therefore if this subdivision does not take off you will be under the control of the Developer We recommend in the strongest terms possible that you talk with recent customers of Flair Construction Co Inc to make sure that they were happy with the construction of their homes as well as warranty work Some Builders are far better than others as it relates to followup warranty work after their customers move into their homes We normally recommend that homeowners do not move into their homes until all punch list items are completed to the satisfaction of the homeowner The foregoing was our general comments regarding the proposed Contract We will now make more specific comments and suggestions in chronological order regarding the Contract Paragraph PROPERTY As we previously stated we think it is important that you acquire copies of the Restrictive Covenants and Deed Restrictions as soon as possible You will be responsible to pay assessments to the Property Owners Association Since Flair is both the Builder and Developer you may want to ask Mr Kent for an estimate of what your Community Association Fees will be Paragraph EARNEST MONEY We suggest that the earnest money be paid to the Title Company and not to Flair Construction Co Inc Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY The standard printed exception as to discrepancies conflicts shortages in area or boundary lines encroachments or protrusions or overlapping improvements is in your Owners Policy In other words the title policy does not cover these types of discrepancies or conflicts However if a survey is completed and an additional fifteen percent of the policy premium is paid the title company will probably delete this exception This is something you may want to consider However this cost would be yours to incur If however it is subsequently discovered that there are such discrepancies and conflicts or shortages then you will have title insurance coverage accordingly Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY last paragraph Make sure you are provided a copy of the Commitment for Title Insurance as soon as possible Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY B It appears to us that the only survey you will be provided with by the Seller is one for the new recorded plat of the subdivision Therefore the Seller is not providing you a survey of your actual lots If you were to have the standard printed exception as to discrepancies and conflicts deleted we believe you would need a survey of your lots You will have seven days after you receive the Commitment andor the survey to object in writing to any matters disclosed or you will be deemed to waive such objections accordingly Therefore please make sure that we have the opportunity to review the survey and commitment as soon as possible after you receive same Paragraph TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY We agree that this paragraph relating to the Sellers right to continue to show the property for sale should be deleted Paragraph PROPERTY CONDITION B We suggest that this paragraph be checked and utilized rather than paragraph B which states that you will be accepting the property in its present condition Paragraph B states that you will pay a fee usually very small like for the unrestricted right to terminate the contract in the event the property is not suitable for the purposes for which you intend on using it In other words you can have whatever inspectors you deem necessary to look at the property to make sure that it is satisfactory for your home construction We often suggest that an independent inspector be hired by the homeowner to inspect and review the construction of the home as it progresses In addition there may be some environmental issues or soil condition questions that an inspector might raise if given the opportunity As the Contract now reads you are simply accepting the property as is and have no right to send an inspector out to the property accordingly Paragraph BROKERS FEES You may want an affirmative statement that you as the Buyer will not be responsible for or pay any Brokers fees Paragraph SPECIAL PROVISIONS It is written in that the closing on these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March whichever is later However we do not know what roads are being addressed and think that this sentence needs far more specificity The second sentence regarding your obligation to use Flair Homes has already been addressed earlier The third sentence regarding when construction must start should be revised to give you more time as you make reference in your letter However we also suggest that the Builder be put under an obligation to start construction within thirty days after the date you notify him that you are ready for construction to begin Paragraph ROLLBACK TAXES If there was ever an agricultural or timber exemption on this property you need to know Otherwise you will be obligated to pay rollback taxes on the property which may go back five years Paragraph ESCROW As we indicated earlier we believe your earnest money should be paid to the title company In light of the fact that the earnest money is in excess of and the closing date on the lots is somewhat uncertain we suggest that you ask the title company to deposit the earnest money in an interest bearing account and that you receive a credit accordingly Please call us after you read and review this letter Very truly yours Donald S Stirman DSScsb
