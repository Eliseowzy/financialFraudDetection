coming to a head there Southern Co was in town last Thursday to visit us and Les agreed to start working on a letter of intent with Southern Co for the sale of gas from the terminal We have been asked to work up a good price for gas at Elba by Les I have started working with John Hodge and John Griffith on this So Cos latest offer was Hub for all dtd So Co wants dtd at Elba and will give us the option of selling to them the remaining dtd at Elba or Destin at our option We have not discussed what a price at Destin should be So Co has some leverage with El Paso that can be instrumental in helping Les with his negotiations below Additionally they may be the only party that can burn the high btu gas and significantly improve the btu issue at Elba We should be better prepared to talk about this by Wednesday Let me know if you have any questions Forwarded by Phil DeMoesCorpEnron on AM Les Webber ENRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Doug ArnellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Nancy CorbetENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Daniel R RogersENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Shelley NRON Phil NRON David L CT Subject SOUTHERN LNG re ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL GREETINGS On November Southern LNG advised the FERC that it has determined to withdraw the Btu stabilization options from the instant certificate application such application being the one seeking to amend the certificate issued by the FERC in March authorizing Southern LNG to reactivate the LNG terminal at Elba Island With this withdrawal the El Paso organization has drawn its line in the sand We plan to vigorously protest this withdrawal at the FERC within the day period allowed by FERC procedures This gives us until December to file which presumably would be extended until Monday December Our filing will be of an adversarial nature so the Enron organization needs to be on board with our intended filing which we will commence drafting on November Drafts will be circulated to the appropriate personnel so please advise us re any additions in that regard At the same time this decision by Southern LNG will focus our resolve to complete the commercial transaction with El Paso Merchant Energy We have come to accept some of the less desirable features of the Letter AgreementTerm Sheet signed with El Paso Merchant Energy on October inasmuch as the more important aspects are very much in our favor including several that Southern LNG found rather unsettling We will discuss the path forward with El Paso Merchant Energy on November While we remain open to a solution to the quality issue that leaves our commercial flexibility and optionality intact we must be positioned to move forward resolutely and in a timely manner with both El Paso Merchant Energy and Southern LNG We cannot afford to stop these processes while we discuss alternative solutions On Wednesday November we gave both Mike Varagona and David Jenkins of El Paso Merchant Energy a headsup regarding our likely response to Southern LNGs proposed letter agreement dated November We indicated we would be asking Southern LNG to bifurcate the FERC proceeding into the Vaporizer Project that could proceed quickly and on an independent path to certification and the Stabilization Project that required considerably more technical analyses before it could proceed When I contacted Mike Varagona on Friday November after we received a copy of Southern LNGs letter to the FERC he stated that he had not been advised by Southern LNG regarding its decision hence had not been positioned to return the favor Mr Varagona will be in Houston on November and and he wants to meet with us He is still pushing for a commercial solution that sees El Paso take on the quality risk in return for our firming up our volumes to El Paso Merchant Energy at an improved price of Henry Hub plus approx per MMBtu Let there be no doubt that El Paso and Southern LNG will find a solution to the quality issue at little or no cost He said he would like to prepare us an outline of an offer to which I responded that he had nothing to lose by doing so The usual practice has been for Enron to do this and for El Paso to respond with I dont think that will work Mr Varagona also indicated that he did not see how the Letter AgreementTerm Sheet could form the basis of the commercial arrangement between our respective companies It just wont work As a consequence he stated that Clarke Smith head of El Paso Merchant Energy has already contacted or will shortly contact our Mike McConnell to see if they can work to resolve this matter Apparently these gentlemen have developed a good working relationship over the years He also alluded to the possibility that Mr Smith may have also contacted our Stan Horton for less than obvious reasons to me Mr Varagona further advised me that a DukeWilliams joint venture had just acquired the rights to the Gulfstream Pipeline Project from Coastal divestment of this asset was required I understand as part of the El PasoCoastal merger This situation gives added impetus to development of the Cypress Pipeline project by Enron and El Paso There is considerable merit in Enron retaining the right to market its own gas out of the Elba Island LNG Terminal However we may find it desirable to reach some commercial resolution with El Paso Merchant Energy for a portion of our volumes that also makes the quality issue disappear However should we decide to so compromise we must either fully engage Southern LNG in that solution or totally eliminate them from all aspects of our agreement with El Paso In the case of Southern LNG we are dealing with one or more individuals who see only one way to do things namely their way and who are totally opposed to working with Enron I would recommend any compromise with El Paso Merchant Energy be conditioned on first reaching agreement with Southern LNG on explicit terms acceptable to us and checking it twice I would appreciate receiving your comments if any before Thanksgiving Regards Les

coming to a head there Southern Co was in town last Thursday to visit us and Les agreed to start working on a letter of intent with Southern Co for the sale of gas from the terminal We have been asked to work up a good price for gas at Elba by Les I have started working with John Hodge and John Griffith on this So Cos latest offer was Hub for all dtd So Co wants dtd at Elba and will give us the option of selling to them the remaining dtd at Elba or Destin at our option We have not discussed what a price at Destin should be So Co has some leverage with El Paso that can be instrumental in helping Les with his negotiations below Additionally they may be the only party that can burn the high btu gas and significantly improve the btu issue at Elba We should be better prepared to talk about this by Wednesday Let me know if you have any questions Forwarded by Phil DeMoesCorpEnron on AM Les Webber ENRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Doug ArnellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Nancy CorbetENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Daniel R RogersENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Shelley NRON Phil NRON David L CT Subject SOUTHERN LNG re ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL GREETINGS On November Southern LNG advised the FERC that it has determined to withdraw the Btu stabilization options from the instant certificate application such application being the one seeking to amend the certificate issued by the FERC in March authorizing Southern LNG to reactivate the LNG terminal at Elba Island With this withdrawal the El Paso organization has drawn its line in the sand We plan to vigorously protest this withdrawal at the FERC within the day period allowed by FERC procedures This gives us until December to file which presumably would be extended until Monday December Our filing will be of an adversarial nature so the Enron organization needs to be on board with our intended filing which we will commence drafting on November Drafts will be circulated to the appropriate personnel so please advise us re any additions in that regard At the same time this decision by Southern LNG will focus our resolve to complete the commercial transaction with El Paso Merchant Energy We have come to accept some of the less desirable features of the Letter AgreementTerm Sheet signed with El Paso Merchant Energy on October inasmuch as the more important aspects are very much in our favor including several that Southern LNG found rather unsettling We will discuss the path forward with El Paso Merchant Energy on November While we remain open to a solution to the quality issue that leaves our commercial flexibility and optionality intact we must be positioned to move forward resolutely and in a timely manner with both El Paso Merchant Energy and Southern LNG We cannot afford to stop these processes while we discuss alternative solutions On Wednesday November we gave both Mike Varagona and David Jenkins of El Paso Merchant Energy a headsup regarding our likely response to Southern LNGs proposed letter agreement dated November We indicated we would be asking Southern LNG to bifurcate the FERC proceeding into the Vaporizer Project that could proceed quickly and on an independent path to certification and the Stabilization Project that required considerably more technical analyses before it could proceed When I contacted Mike Varagona on Friday November after we received a copy of Southern LNGs letter to the FERC he stated that he had not been advised by Southern LNG regarding its decision hence had not been positioned to return the favor Mr Varagona will be in Houston on November and and he wants to meet with us He is still pushing for a commercial solution that sees El Paso take on the quality risk in return for our firming up our volumes to El Paso Merchant Energy at an improved price of Henry Hub plus approx per MMBtu Let there be no doubt that El Paso and Southern LNG will find a solution to the quality issue at little or no cost He said he would like to prepare us an outline of an offer to which I responded that he had nothing to lose by doing so The usual practice has been for Enron to do this and for El Paso to respond with I dont think that will work Mr Varagona also indicated that he did not see how the Letter AgreementTerm Sheet could form the basis of the commercial arrangement between our respective companies It just wont work As a consequence he stated that Clarke Smith head of El Paso Merchant Energy has already contacted or will shortly contact our Mike McConnell to see if they can work to resolve this matter Apparently these gentlemen have developed a good working relationship over the years He also alluded to the possibility that Mr Smith may have also contacted our Stan Horton for less than obvious reasons to me Mr Varagona further advised me that a DukeWilliams joint venture had just acquired the rights to the Gulfstream Pipeline Project from Coastal divestment of this asset was required I understand as part of the El PasoCoastal merger This situation gives added impetus to development of the Cypress Pipeline project by Enron and El Paso There is considerable merit in Enron retaining the right to market its own gas out of the Elba Island LNG Terminal However we may find it desirable to reach some commercial resolution with El Paso Merchant Energy for a portion of our volumes that also makes the quality issue disappear However should we decide to so compromise we must either fully engage Southern LNG in that solution or totally eliminate them from all aspects of our agreement with El Paso In the case of Southern LNG we are dealing with one or more individuals who see only one way to do things namely their way and who are totally opposed to working with Enron I would recommend any compromise with El Paso Merchant Energy be conditioned on first reaching agreement with Southern LNG on explicit terms acceptable to us and checking it twice I would appreciate receiving your comments if any before Thanksgiving Regards Les
