ON CONDITIONS IMPOSED ON AOLTIME WARNER MERGER One of the FCCs last major actions during the tenure of Chairman William E Kennard marks the agencys first effort to oversee Internet instant messaging services The move last night came as the FCC announced its longawaited decision to clear the merger of America Online Inc and Time Warner Inc All five Commissioners voted to approve the mergerrelated application but the majoritys vote to attach conditions as competitive safeguards prompted sharp criticism from the person widely expected to succeed Mr Kennard Commissioner Michael K Powell warned that the FCC was taking a substantial leap by declaring broad jurisdiction over the Internet And Commissioner Harold FurchtgottRoth reiterated his strong view that the FCC lacks authority to extract conditions through its public interest reviews of mergerrelated license transfers The FCCs merger conditions mandate that the combined company known as AOL Time Warner Incallow all customers to choose Internet service from any unaffiliated ISP that has a contract with the merged company to use its cable TV facilities Customers must be able to have their chosen ISPs provide their first screen when they go online without going through an AOL Time Warneraffiliated ISP as an intermediary The merged company must allow unaffiliated ISPs to have direct billing relationships with its subscribers And it may not discriminate in favor of its affiliated ISP in terms of caching services customer technical support multicasting capabilities address management or other technical functions The FCC also indicated its concern that without conditions AOL Time Warner would be able to leverage its dominance in textbased instant messaging IM into the nontextbased IM market As a condition of the merger approval therefore the FCC prohibited AOL Time Warner from offering any new advanced IMbased highspeed service AIHS feature or enhancement that includes one or two way streaming video communications using a names and presence directory NPD The prohibition could be lifted however if AOL Time Warner demon strated that it had complied with certain safeguards Commissioner Powell said the majority had given in too much to their collective imaginations in imposing the IM conditions In a separate statement he said he was unwilling to join them in mak ing the substantial leap to find that the FCC has jurisdiction to regulate virtually every Internet product Neither the record nor anticompetitive theory supports mandating IM interoperability Mr Powell said No competent antitrust authority to my mind would conclude intervention was necessary nor do I believe such an analysis would withstand judicial review he said During a press briefing this morning Mr Kennard insisted that the IM conditions were very narrowly tailored and minimally intrusive Although he wouldnt speak directly to Mr Powells criticism the chairman said At the end of the day I feltand my two other colleagues feltthat in order to protect consumers we had to impose some conditions For more details see Mondays TR KENNARD SUBMITS RESIGNATION PLANS TO LEAVE FCC POST FOR THINK TANK FCC Chairman William E Kennard has submitted his resignation to the White House effective Jan and will take a temporary senior fellow position at the Aspen Institute a think tank in Washington Ending a threeyear term as the nations top telecommunications regulator Mr Kennard made his resignation public during a press conference this morning to discuss the FCCs approval of the merger America Online IncTime Warner Inc merger see story above At the Aspen Institute Mr Kennard will be advisory board chairman of the Communications and Society Program Although his term on the Commission does not expire until the end of June Mr Kennard said Our work is complete and its time for me to go Most industry observers predict that Presidentelect George W Bush will appoint FCC Commissioner Michael K Powell chairman In one scenario some see as likely President Bush could nominate Texas Public Utility Commission Chairman Patrick H Wood III to be an FCC commissioner to succeed Mr Kennard After Mr Wood had been con firmed and dealt with federal communications industry issues for a while he could be named chairman of the agency leaving Mr Powell free to accept another appointment possibly in the Justice Depart ment these sources say Mr Kennard has been FCC chairman since he was the Commissions general counsel from Previously he was a partner at the law firm of Verner Liipfert Bernhard McPherson Hand and counsel to the agencys reigns as interim chairman FCC TRANSITION TEAM LEANS HEAVILY ON COMMON CARRIER REPRESENTATIVES Presidentelect George W Bush has begun rounding out the transition advisory team that will work with the

A Eisenach and Randolph J May FCC WONT PREEMPT MISSOURI BAN ON CITYOWNED TELECOM UTILITIES The FCC today said it wouldnt preempt a Missouri state law that effectively forbids cityowned utilities from providing telecom services The ShowMe State cities had tried to distinguish their request from that of Texas cities that had asked in vain for FCC preemption of a similar law several years ago In the Texas case the FCC refused to a preempt a state law barring cities from offering telecom services directly The Missouri cities argued that their situation was different because they wished to offer telecom services through municipal utility companies But the FCC said that in general such utilities are a part of the state itself and therefore dont fall under provisions in section of the federal Telecommunications Act of barring states from preventing an entity from entering a telecommunications service market If a municipal utility has an independent corporate identity thats separate from the state however it may be eligible for protection under those barriertoentry provisions found in sec tion of the Act the FCC said The Missouri utility company didnt show that they had such an independent identity it added In statements released with the decision FCC Chairman William E Kennard and Commissioners Gloria Tristani and Susan Ness said the utility companies represented a promising class of competitors They asked Congress to amend the language in that section to address clearly municipallyowned entities Ms Ness also suggested that states adopt less restrictive measures such as separation or nondiscrimination requirements to prevent cityowned utilities from having unfair competitive ad vantages over privatesector service providers ALCATEL TO BUILD TRANSATLANTIC NETWORK FOR CW Alcatel SA said it will build a transatlantic telecommunications network for Cable Wireless plc of London which will use the new undersea cable system in anticipation of data traffic growth between Europe and North Atlantic The Apollo network project which Alcatel said is worth several hundred million US dollars will be designed to handle highspeed data transmissions and will be adaptive to future traffic patterns A Yankee Group analyst expressed confidence that Alcatel will complete the project by the promised delivery target of summer and cited Alcatels proven track record in deploying top notch submarine networks Nancee Ruzicka a longhaul telecom infrastructure analyst also said that CWs projections for transatlantic datatraffic growth likely will prove accurate Ms Ruzicka told TR she believes data capacity on the network which will handle terabitpersecond speeds will be exhausted in a short period of time Continued growth in the deployment of VPN virtual private network and Internet protocol systems will contribute to escalating demand she said The demand is starting to show up she said I think that capacity will get used up pretty quickly Alcatel said the Apollo network will be built using DWDM dense wavelength division multiplexing technology Apollo will have four fiber pairs equipped with wavelengths at gigabits per second the highest capacity and lowest unit cost of any transatlantic system Alcatel said The project includes an additional fouryear marine maintenance contract Alcatel will devote two cablevessels for cable fault and marine repair services TAUZIN CALLS HEARING ON ICANNs DOMAIN NAME PROCESS The House Energy and Commerce Committees telecommunications subcommittee plans to hold a hearing in February to examine the

ON CONDITIONS IMPOSED ON AOLTIME WARNER MERGER One of the FCCs last major actions during the tenure of Chairman William E Kennard marks the agencys first effort to oversee Internet instant messaging services The move last night came as the FCC announced its longawaited decision to clear the merger of America Online Inc and Time Warner Inc All five Commissioners voted to approve the mergerrelated application but the majoritys vote to attach conditions as competitive safeguards prompted sharp criticism from the person widely expected to succeed Mr Kennard Commissioner Michael K Powell warned that the FCC was taking a substantial leap by declaring broad jurisdiction over the Internet And Commissioner Harold FurchtgottRoth reiterated his strong view that the FCC lacks authority to extract conditions through its public interest reviews of mergerrelated license transfers The FCCs merger conditions mandate that the combined company known as AOL Time Warner Incallow all customers to choose Internet service from any unaffiliated ISP that has a contract with the merged company to use its cable TV facilities Customers must be able to have their chosen ISPs provide their first screen when they go online without going through an AOL Time Warneraffiliated ISP as an intermediary The merged company must allow unaffiliated ISPs to have direct billing relationships with its subscribers And it may not discriminate in favor of its affiliated ISP in terms of caching services customer technical support multicasting capabilities address management or other technical functions The FCC also indicated its concern that without conditions AOL Time Warner would be able to leverage its dominance in textbased instant messaging IM into the nontextbased IM market As a condition of the merger approval therefore the FCC prohibited AOL Time Warner from offering any new advanced IMbased highspeed service AIHS feature or enhancement that includes one or two way streaming video communications using a names and presence directory NPD The prohibition could be lifted however if AOL Time Warner demon strated that it had complied with certain safeguards Commissioner Powell said the majority had given in too much to their collective imaginations in imposing the IM conditions In a separate statement he said he was unwilling to join them in mak ing the substantial leap to find that the FCC has jurisdiction to regulate virtually every Internet product Neither the record nor anticompetitive theory supports mandating IM interoperability Mr Powell said No competent antitrust authority to my mind would conclude intervention was necessary nor do I believe such an analysis would withstand judicial review he said During a press briefing this morning Mr Kennard insisted that the IM conditions were very narrowly tailored and minimally intrusive Although he wouldnt speak directly to Mr Powells criticism the chairman said At the end of the day I feltand my two other colleagues feltthat in order to protect consumers we had to impose some conditions For more details see Mondays TR KENNARD SUBMITS RESIGNATION PLANS TO LEAVE FCC POST FOR THINK TANK FCC Chairman William E Kennard has submitted his resignation to the White House effective Jan and will take a temporary senior fellow position at the Aspen Institute a think tank in Washington Ending a threeyear term as the nations top telecommunications regulator Mr Kennard made his resignation public during a press conference this morning to discuss the FCCs approval of the merger America Online IncTime Warner Inc merger see story above At the Aspen Institute Mr Kennard will be advisory board chairman of the Communications and Society Program Although his term on the Commission does not expire until the end of June Mr Kennard said Our work is complete and its time for me to go Most industry observers predict that Presidentelect George W Bush will appoint FCC Commissioner Michael K Powell chairman In one scenario some see as likely President Bush could nominate Texas Public Utility Commission Chairman Patrick H Wood III to be an FCC commissioner to succeed Mr Kennard After Mr Wood had been con firmed and dealt with federal communications industry issues for a while he could be named chairman of the agency leaving Mr Powell free to accept another appointment possibly in the Justice Depart ment these sources say Mr Kennard has been FCC chairman since he was the Commissions general counsel from Previously he was a partner at the law firm of Verner Liipfert Bernhard McPherson Hand and counsel to the agencys reigns as interim chairman FCC TRANSITION TEAM LEANS HEAVILY ON COMMON CARRIER REPRESENTATIVES Presidentelect George W Bush has begun rounding out the transition advisory team that will work with the

A Eisenach and Randolph J May FCC WONT PREEMPT MISSOURI BAN ON CITYOWNED TELECOM UTILITIES The FCC today said it wouldnt preempt a Missouri state law that effectively forbids cityowned utilities from providing telecom services The ShowMe State cities had tried to distinguish their request from that of Texas cities that had asked in vain for FCC preemption of a similar law several years ago In the Texas case the FCC refused to a preempt a state law barring cities from offering telecom services directly The Missouri cities argued that their situation was different because they wished to offer telecom services through municipal utility companies But the FCC said that in general such utilities are a part of the state itself and therefore dont fall under provisions in section of the federal Telecommunications Act of barring states from preventing an entity from entering a telecommunications service market If a municipal utility has an independent corporate identity thats separate from the state however it may be eligible for protection under those barriertoentry provisions found in sec tion of the Act the FCC said The Missouri utility company didnt show that they had such an independent identity it added In statements released with the decision FCC Chairman William E Kennard and Commissioners Gloria Tristani and Susan Ness said the utility companies represented a promising class of competitors They asked Congress to amend the language in that section to address clearly municipallyowned entities Ms Ness also suggested that states adopt less restrictive measures such as separation or nondiscrimination requirements to prevent cityowned utilities from having unfair competitive ad vantages over privatesector service providers ALCATEL TO BUILD TRANSATLANTIC NETWORK FOR CW Alcatel SA said it will build a transatlantic telecommunications network for Cable Wireless plc of London which will use the new undersea cable system in anticipation of data traffic growth between Europe and North Atlantic The Apollo network project which Alcatel said is worth several hundred million US dollars will be designed to handle highspeed data transmissions and will be adaptive to future traffic patterns A Yankee Group analyst expressed confidence that Alcatel will complete the project by the promised delivery target of summer and cited Alcatels proven track record in deploying top notch submarine networks Nancee Ruzicka a longhaul telecom infrastructure analyst also said that CWs projections for transatlantic datatraffic growth likely will prove accurate Ms Ruzicka told TR she believes data capacity on the network which will handle terabitpersecond speeds will be exhausted in a short period of time Continued growth in the deployment of VPN virtual private network and Internet protocol systems will contribute to escalating demand she said The demand is starting to show up she said I think that capacity will get used up pretty quickly Alcatel said the Apollo network will be built using DWDM dense wavelength division multiplexing technology Apollo will have four fiber pairs equipped with wavelengths at gigabits per second the highest capacity and lowest unit cost of any transatlantic system Alcatel said The project includes an additional fouryear marine maintenance contract Alcatel will devote two cablevessels for cable fault and marine repair services TAUZIN CALLS HEARING ON ICANNs DOMAIN NAME PROCESS The House Energy and Commerce Committees telecommunications subcommittee plans to hold a hearing in February to examine the
