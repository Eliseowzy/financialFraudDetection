October IMAGE IMAGE Volume IV Issue IMAGE Email URL To OTC J ournal Members IMAGE Special Announcement When I look back on a ll these worries I remember the story of the old man who said on his deathb ed that he had had a lot of trouble in his life most of which never happen ed Sir Winston Churchill from Their Finest Hour We are working on a very special edition custom tailored for bargain hunters The last three weeks h ave led investors to believe there are other directions stocks can go besid es straight down There are many technology stocks trading at less than of their previous highs Stocks are so low the NASDAQ has suspended its m inimum bid rule for the remainder of the year and has announced it will review the rule early next year Unlike most market environments individ ual investors have a competitive advantage over fund managers with stocks a t these levels Most fund managers have thresholds below which they are not allowed to hold stocks Many funds cannot hold stocks below and others have a threshold Fund managers have been forced to sell stocks at thes e levels in order to comply with the rules of their fund oftentimes agains t their personal wishes and their own common sense Fund managers will be a ble to purchase these stocks again once they appreciate above and We are working on a list of stocks with compelling values that are very ove rsold In order to make the list the stock must be trading below the cash value the company has per share and have little or no debt We will try to publish this exciting edition next weekend We might call it the Riskless Rebound edition Stayed tuned IMAGE Energy Power Systems OTC BB EYPSF Updated Profile IMAGE Followers of Energy Power know it has been trading up and down the charts over the last weeks We are suggesting the company change its symbol to OTIS as the stock goes up and down like an Ot is Elevator For investors looking for more information on Energy Power the editors of the OTC Journal have updated our

an excellent opportunity to familiarize yoursel f with this company IMAGE Envoy Communications NASDAQ ECGI Update IMAGE Our inbox is filled with questions on Envoy as the stocks fades i nto the oblivion of the range The stock is behaving as if there is some thing wrong with the company We spoke with management briefly this week about this issue At the corporate level nothing has changed Fiscal which ended at the end of September still looks like roughly million C DN in EBITDA profits As of right now business for fiscal looks about the same as The stock is trading at about times EBITDA The i ndustry average is currently times EBITDA Whats the explanation for this pathetic performance Simple management is doing nothing at this time to market their company to investors Their only audience is the memb ers of the OTC Journal A plan for a nationwide institutional road show w as in place prior to Attack on America but that is now on hold We can onl y hope management will wake up and recognize their responsibility to shareh olders and get proactive in telling their story Tax selling could hurt this stock so it could go lower One can only hope that despite management s failure to get out and tell their story someone will come along and rec ognize the inherent value in this company Bottom line Not worth selling at this price but it could go lower IMAGE Attention

already a ppreciated from our February th introduction in at O ur to target price is based on the company making a prolific find at the new drilling site in the Ladyfern region on the AlbertaBritish Columb ia border Test well drilling was announced by the company on January t h and it took the market a few days to wake up to this development Since the market has begun to recognize the potential magnitude of this test dril ling the stock has been trading extremely well as revealed in the current chart An article published in the July edition of Torontos Glob e and Mail contains the following paragraph which helps explain the recent surge in price and volume Ladyfern discovered just months ago by US Independent producer Murphy Oil Corp began production this year and is already generating more than million cubic feet a day of natural gas a number that is still growing The field by itself has accounted for p er cent of Western Canadas production growth in the first half of the year While the size of Ladyferns reserves still arent clear analysts estima te it could contain as much as one trillion cubic feet of gas which would make it the biggest gas find in Western Canada in the past years Dav id Parkinson the author of the article also observes Its hard to have a conversation with a natural gas analyst without Ladyfern coming up often accompied by neargiddy enthusiasm The mere mention of the name makes som e of them drool more than Pavlovs dog at a bellringing festival Apach e Energy Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Alberta Energy Corp have all partnered with Murphy

have their t elevisions tuned in to this event The St Louis Rams are favored by two touchdowns and most odds makers give the Patriots no chance The SuperBowl has a well deserved reputation for being a

to believe the end of the recession is right on schedule Ho wever this good news was overshadowed by scandal related selling early in the week The Dow and Nasdaq were clobbered early in the week slipping bel ow and respectively The thinking on Wall Street was dominated by the belief that the Enron accounting scandal was just the tip of the ice berg and other companys financial statements would come under increased s crutiny Behemoth multi national Tyco NYSE TYC was annihilated early in the week on fears they have been cooking the books It was disclosed one of their directors received a million payment for arranging an acquisi tion Many feel this was a blatant conflict of interest Telecommunicatio ns giant Global Crossing NYSE GX filed bankruptcy this week Chairman Ga ry Winnick

key clinical trial Harlan Waksal filed a Form with the SEC on Dec to sell million worth of ImClone stock Wall Street is afraid earnings and accounting scandals will dominate financial news fo r some time to come Arthur Andersen generated million in accounting fe es from Enron last year and companies like Enron have a lot of muscle with their auditors In order to win the business the consulting arm comes up with the tax avoidance scheme and earnings enhancement method and the audi ting division implements the strategy Like a weight lifter taking stero ids large cap companies are addicted to beefing up their financial perform ance at any cost And just like the weightlifter taking steroids this perf ormance enhancement is not only toxic long term it is also illegal In t he small and micro cap arena there is significant risk associated with fail ed corporate performance However these smaller companies do not have the fiscal muscle to make their auditors bend the rules to enhance financial pe rformance You wont see many small company scandals associated with accoun ting irregularities Their auditors take a much more conservative approach as the auditor is more concerned with covering his own butt than collectin g the reduced fees During this past week while Wall Street was annihila ting several of its large cap favorites Cross Media AMEX XMM and Energy Power OTC BB EYPSF
