went steady and girls wore a class ring with an inch of wrapped dental floss or yarn coated with pastel frost nail polish so it would fit her finger And no one ever asked where the car keys were cause they were always in the car in the ignition and the doors were never locked And you got in big trouble if you accidentally locked the doors at home since no one ever had a key Remember lying on your

and summers filled with bike rides playing in cowboy land baseball games bowling and visits to the pool and eating KoolAid powder with sugar When being sent to the principals office was nothing compared to the fate that awaited a misbehaving student at home Basically we were in fear for our lives but it wasnt because of drive by shootings drugs gangs etc Our parents and grandparents were a much bigger threat But we all survived because their love was greater than the threat Didnt that feel good just to go back and say Yeah I remember that
