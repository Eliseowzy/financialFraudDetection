NRONDEVELOPMENt Dave ES Gary ES Scott ES Jubran ES Neil ES Leslie nron Robert nron Scott ES Subject ABX Response Needed Mike Day left me a message saying in discussions yesterday on AB X Wrights load curtailment bill the utilities were making the point that x should only address bundled customers since the utilities were making the incentive payments out of funds that would otherwise go to pay DWR in effect the curtailments are reducing the utility net short position They were ok with having ESPs aggregate the loads of bundled customers which will be a very significant win if we get it They think DA customers can get curtailment benefits through existing and new ISO programs The dilemmas are the ISO programs may or may not be finalized for this summer and may or may not give incentives that are as beneficial as ABX the utility plan discriminates against DA The ISO program definitely does not sound as beneficial as ABX I have a call into the ISO the last I heard was that the Demand Relief Program was the closest product they had to being finalized preferably the ISO would administer the programs described by ABX for all customers but that puts the ISO in the position of having to get approvals from FERC for a CAlegislated program they will have to do this anyway nearly all of our customers will be bundled this summer anyway so theres no immediate loss from going with the utilitys position We owe Mike an answer today Any thoughts My suggestion at this point is to stick with the high road and argue for nondiscriminatory treatment with equal incentives paid to bundled and DA customers At this point a nondiscriminatory treatment with equal incentives is the only way you are going to get participation Background ABX would give mwh incentives for day ahead curtailment mwh incentives for dayof curtailments and incentives to be determined for scheduled load reductions The ISO would invoke the programs based on system conditions These prices seem reasonably priced and should definitely persuaded customers to participate The ISO so far has put in place the equivalent of a scheduled load reduction program with specific payments but has not finalized any day ahead or day of programs The current proposed ISO Programs outlined Below Program Demand Relief Program The customer will curtail prior to stage rotating blackout Loads without backup generators can be curtailed up to hours per month and loads with backup generators can be curtailed a total of hours for the duration of the program The duration of the program is scheduled for June through September There will be a fixed monthly capacity reservation payment adjusted based on actual average monthly performance and a performance energy payment that will be made for each curtailment The performance energy provides incentives for over performance and penalties for under performance Additionally loads that dont perform will be penalized through loss of a portion of their capacity payment Settlement will occur through SCsAggregators separately from the normal retail billing process The reservation price is preset at per MWmonth and the curtailment performance payment is per MWh Eligibility for this program is still being worked out Currently loads that were served under an interruptible tariff in were not allowed to participate in the February submittal for the Summer program ISO management may open subject to board approval the Demand Response Program to a subsequent bids from PGE and possibly SCE interruptiple customers that have exhausted their required curtailments pending CPUC rulemaking on interruptibles As soon as the board approves in the program which is expected in days the ISO will initiate a major activity immediately to have all participants ready by May to establish the day baseline for performance measurement Program ISO Discretionary Load Program Intent of this program is to attract significant voluntary curtailments before the ISO enters emergency conditions This program provides a set energyonly payment of MWh This provides the ISO a Known curtailment comminment Notifications will be sent to SCsAggregators when the ISO issues warnings and anticipates a stage emergency typically early morning There will be to minutes for the SCsAggregators to issue their voluntary curtailment notices and firmup the actual block of curtailment available to the ISO This Program will operate through March ISO plans to accept proposals from aggregators starting on February March th Payment will be based on an asdelivered basis with a preset payment per MWhour ISO is considering several options on where to set there price range One proposal is MWhMWh There is no capacity or reservation payment Program ISO Participating Ancillary Services Load Program This allows loads to bid into the AS and supplemental energy market The program allows loads to participate as priceresponsive demand in the ISO AS market and Supplemental markets This market has been extended indefinitely as part of the semiannually filing to FERC in the ISO tariff As an amendment to the tariff the ISO is making the following changes The telemetry requirement has also been relaxed some for loads bidding into the supplemental energy market Loads bidding into the Nonspinning and spinning reserve will still require telemetry Loads can bid in above the cap but must have cost justification for bids selected above the cap Jubran

request that the Load Aggregators communicate to the EndUse Loads the required curtailment amoun t and duration This will be the only communication dispatch to the Load Aggregators detailing the curtailment DLCP Performance The effectiveness of the DLCP will be based on the performance of each EndUse Load in curtailing their confirmed curtailment amount The ISO expects that the committed curtailment will occur based on the hours as confirmed through the DLCP Confirmation notices An aggregator has the responsibility to produce the demand reduction it confirms There is no se t penalty except that continued poor performance could result in revocation of the DLCP Agreement Performance Measurement Guidelines The measurement of performance for each EndUse Load will be performed by t he Load Aggregators Each Load Aggregator will have an ISO approved performan ce measurement plan which will be used to calculate the DLCP performance Th e performance measurement plan shall include the following For interval metered EndUse Loads the Load Aggregator will calculate a baseline Load profile DLCP performance will be measured by the difference between baseline Load profile and the meter read for the hours of curtailment For noninterval metered Loads DLCP performance will be calculated by using a combination of sample measurements historic data process controls use of data loggers and any other performance measurement method approved by the ISO Load Aggregators shall obtained ISO approval prior to offering DL CP for noninterval metered EndUse Loads It should be noted that the ISO favors interval meters DLCP Settlement Each DLCP Offer for which a DLCP Confirmation was issued by the ISO shall b e uniquely identified Therefore DLCP Day Ahead and DLCP Day Of offers must be separately identified The Load Aggregators except for the UDCs shall submit the DLCP Performance Measurement for each confirmed offer by using t he DLCP website no later than days following the operating day of the DLCP Curtailment The ISO will calculate the performance payment by simply multiplying the DLCP energy price MWh for DLCP Day Ahead and MWh for DLCP Day Of by the amount of DLCP in MWs for each hour of confirmed curtailment For each month the performance payments will be summed up for all the confirmed curtailments and paid to the Load Aggregators nominat ed Scheduling Coordinator The payment will be made to the Scheduling Coordinator in accordance to the ISO Payment Calendar timeline The ISO recognizes that UDCs acting as Load Aggregators will have specific rules to follow for the settlement of the dispatched curtailment The UDCs will be responsible for following the settlement rules and regulations set forth by the CPUC for the EndUse Loads How to enroll in

Aggregator In order to be eligible for the DLCP Load Aggregators including UDCs Must be able to provide a portfolio that contains a net reduction in Demand of at least MW either alone or when aggregated with other customer s Must sign a DLCP Agreement Must have an ISO approved performance measurement process Must be capable of interacting with the ISOs DLCP infrastructure as well as communicate with the enduse Load customer Must nominate an SC for settlement transactions with the ISO DLCP EndUse Load Customer In order to be eligible for the DLCP an enduse Load customer Must be able to provide a net reduction in Demand that meets the criteri a of the LA or the Local Regulatory Authority Must have an interval meter approved by the Local Regulatory Authority or have the appropriate measuring devices as required by the approved LA s performance measurement process Must be located inside the ISO Control Area ask your LA if you are not sure Must not concurrently participate in the ISOs Summer DRP howev er may participate during months outside of the DRP contracted period May September If the enduse load is a UDC interruptible customer the customer may participate in the DLCP as long as the customer has met all the contractual obligations of an interruptible customer Must not have a Participating Load Agreement PLA with the ISO for the same Load offered under the DLCP Must obtain and provide positive proof of all necessary permits of operation or approvals from the local Air Pollution Control District or Air Quality Management District for each individual Generating Unit designated for participation in the DLCP DLCP Process DLCP Request DLCP Day Ahead Request The ISO will project the need for demand response The ISO may call on this program based upon the best temperature load and resource forecast information available by PM the day ahead The ISO will issue a DLCP D ay Ahead Request by email to all contracted Load Aggregators The email notice will request the curtailment amounts for twohour blocks within the ISO specified curtailment timeframe The ISO will provide any constraints in the notice DLCP Day Of Request The ISO will project the need for demand response The ISO will base this projection upon the best temperature load and resource forecast informati on available by AM of the day of the request The ISO will issue a DLCP Da y Of Request by email to all Load Aggregators The email notice will reque st the curtailment amounts for each twohour block requested The ISO will provide any constraints in the notice DLCP Offer By PM on the Day Ahead the Load Aggregators will submit to the ISO through the ISO DLCP website their committed amounts of Load Curtailment The ISO expects that the Load Aggregators will have contacted the EndUse Loads in their program to determine how much curtailment will be available and for which hours of the day By AM of the Day Of the Load Aggregators will submit their committe d amounts of curtailment DLCP Confirmation Once the ISO reviews submitted DLCP Offers ISO Operations will issue an email notice to both the Load Aggregators and their Scheduling Coordinator s accepting specific DLCP Offers The ISO will issue the DLCP Confirmation notice by PM on the day the Day Ahead Request was made and by AM fo r the Day Of Requests These confirmation notices will request that the Load Aggregators communicate to the EndUse Loads the required curtailment amoun t and duration This will be the only communication dispatch to the Load Aggregators detailing the curtailment DLCP Performance The effectiveness of the DLCP will be based on the performance of each EndUse Load in curtailing their confirmed curtailment amount The ISO expects that the committed curtailment will occur based on the hours as confirmed through the DLCP Confirmation notices An aggregator has the responsibility to produce the demand reduction it confirms There is no se t penalty except that continued poor performance could result in revocation of the DLCP Agreement Performance Measurement Guidelines The measurement of performance for each EndUse Load will be performed by t he Load Aggregators Each Load Aggregator will have an ISO approved performan ce measurement plan which will be used to calculate the DLCP performance Th e performance measurement plan shall include the following For interval metered EndUse Loads the Load Aggregator will calculate a baseline Load profile DLCP performance will be measured by the difference between baseline Load profile and the meter read for the hours of curtailment For noninterval metered Loads DLCP performance will be calculated by using a combination of sample measurements historic data process controls use of data loggers and any other performance measurement method approved by the ISO Load Aggregators shall obtained ISO approval prior to offering DL CP for noninterval metered EndUse Loads It should be noted that the ISO favors interval meters DLCP Settlement Each DLCP Offer for which a DLCP Confirmation was issued by the ISO shall b e uniquely identified Therefore DLCP Day Ahead and DLCP Day Of offers must be separately identified The Load Aggregators except for the UDCs shall submit the DLCP Performance Measurement for each confirmed offer by using t he DLCP website no later than days following the operating day of the DLCP Curtailment The ISO will calculate the performance payment by simply multiplying the DLCP energy price MWh for DLCP Day Ahead and MWh for DLCP Day Of by the amount of DLCP in MWs for each hour of confirmed curtailment For each month the performance payments will be summed up for all the confirmed curtailments and paid to the Load Aggregators nominat ed Scheduling Coordinator The payment will be made to the Scheduling Coordinator in accordance to the ISO Payment Calendar timeline The ISO recognizes that UDCs acting as Load Aggregators will have specific rules to follow for the settlement of the dispatched curtailment The UDCs will be responsible for following the settlement rules and regulations set forth by the CPUC for the EndUse Loads How to enroll in

NRONDEVELOPMENt Dave ES Gary ES Scott ES Jubran ES Neil ES Leslie nron Robert nron Scott ES Subject ABX Response Needed Mike Day left me a message saying in discussions yesterday on AB X Wrights load curtailment bill the utilities were making the point that x should only address bundled customers since the utilities were making the incentive payments out of funds that would otherwise go to pay DWR in effect the curtailments are reducing the utility net short position They were ok with having ESPs aggregate the loads of bundled customers which will be a very significant win if we get it They think DA customers can get curtailment benefits through existing and new ISO programs The dilemmas are the ISO programs may or may not be finalized for this summer and may or may not give incentives that are as beneficial as ABX the utility plan discriminates against DA The ISO program definitely does not sound as beneficial as ABX I have a call into the ISO the last I heard was that the Demand Relief Program was the closest product they had to being finalized preferably the ISO would administer the programs described by ABX for all customers but that puts the ISO in the position of having to get approvals from FERC for a CAlegislated program they will have to do this anyway nearly all of our customers will be bundled this summer anyway so theres no immediate loss from going with the utilitys position We owe Mike an answer today Any thoughts My suggestion at this point is to stick with the high road and argue for nondiscriminatory treatment with equal incentives paid to bundled and DA customers At this point a nondiscriminatory treatment with equal incentives is the only way you are going to get participation Background ABX would give mwh incentives for day ahead curtailment mwh incentives for dayof curtailments and incentives to be determined for scheduled load reductions The ISO would invoke the programs based on system conditions These prices seem reasonably priced and should definitely persuaded customers to participate The ISO so far has put in place the equivalent of a scheduled load reduction program with specific payments but has not finalized any day ahead or day of programs The current proposed ISO Programs outlined Below Program Demand Relief Program The customer will curtail prior to stage rotating blackout Loads without backup generators can be curtailed up to hours per month and loads with backup generators can be curtailed a total of hours for the duration of the program The duration of the program is scheduled for June through September There will be a fixed monthly capacity reservation payment adjusted based on actual average monthly performance and a performance energy payment that will be made for each curtailment The performance energy provides incentives for over performance and penalties for under performance Additionally loads that dont perform will be penalized through loss of a portion of their capacity payment Settlement will occur through SCsAggregators separately from the normal retail billing process The reservation price is preset at per MWmonth and the curtailment performance payment is per MWh Eligibility for this program is still being worked out Currently loads that were served under an interruptible tariff in were not allowed to participate in the February submittal for the Summer program ISO management may open subject to board approval the Demand Response Program to a subsequent bids from PGE and possibly SCE interruptiple customers that have exhausted their required curtailments pending CPUC rulemaking on interruptibles As soon as the board approves in the program which is expected in days the ISO will initiate a major activity immediately to have all participants ready by May to establish the day baseline for performance measurement Program ISO Discretionary Load Program Intent of this program is to attract significant voluntary curtailments before the ISO enters emergency conditions This program provides a set energyonly payment of MWh This provides the ISO a Known curtailment comminment Notifications will be sent to SCsAggregators when the ISO issues warnings and anticipates a stage emergency typically early morning There will be to minutes for the SCsAggregators to issue their voluntary curtailment notices and firmup the actual block of curtailment available to the ISO This Program will operate through March ISO plans to accept proposals from aggregators starting on February March th Payment will be based on an asdelivered basis with a preset payment per MWhour ISO is considering several options on where to set there price range One proposal is MWhMWh There is no capacity or reservation payment Program ISO Participating Ancillary Services Load Program This allows loads to bid into the AS and supplemental energy market The program allows loads to participate as priceresponsive demand in the ISO AS market and Supplemental markets This market has been extended indefinitely as part of the semiannually filing to FERC in the ISO tariff As an amendment to the tariff the ISO is making the following changes The telemetry requirement has also been relaxed some for loads bidding into the supplemental energy market Loads bidding into the Nonspinning and spinning reserve will still require telemetry Loads can bid in above the cap but must have cost justification for bids selected above the cap Jubran
