Pipelines By RICHARD A OPPEL Jr and LOWELL BERGMAN Join a Discussion on Future Energy Sources Related Sites Interactive Guide California Power Woes California ISO Energy Department Statistics Western Governors Association Get Stock Quotes Look Up Symbols Separate symbols with a space Portfolio Stock Markets Mutual Funds Bonds Currencies Bank Rates Industries arly last year the El Paso Natural Gas Company took bids from two dozen companies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline fro m Texas and New Mexico to meet onesixth of the daily demand of energystarve d California The winner El Pasos sister company the El Paso Merchant Energy Company which buys sells and trades natural gas The bidding was not close El Pas o Merchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid in total for bits and pieces Why pay so much more California officials who are pressing a complaint against El Paso at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say the answer is simple The state contends that El Paso Merchant with help from its sister company saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of natural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity According to sealed documents obtained by The New York Times that are part of filings in the federal case executives at El Paso Merchant said internally that the deal would give them more control of gas markets including the ability to influence the physical market to benefit the companys financi al positions El Paso executives called the accusations fanciful and in a formal respons e to Californias complaint said the state grossly distorted company documents by quoting words and phrases out of context The dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the natural gas industry which fuels a growing share of the nations electric power plants At issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas and whether federal regulators adequately enforce existing rules In particular many industry officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximiz e profits More than miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country moving natural gas from Canada the Southwest and other producing regions t o fuel factories power utilities and heat houses Not long ago many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity But experts say that several regions including California New York and New England now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants In California state officials and utility executives said the documents in the federal case and El Pasos actions were proof that the states energy crisis stemmed not just from an illconceived deregulation plan but from price manipulation and profiteering They are the market maker with this pipeline said Loretta Lynch the president of the California Public Utilities Commission which has struggle d to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages El Paso sets the price in California Ms Lynch said and what it did was intentional It has affected the price she said for everything related to heat and electrical power prices in the state Californias complaint to the federal agency contends that El Paso Merchant has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity on the pipeline The state also charges that El Paso Natural Gas the pipeline s owner has had no incentive to spur competition by offering discounts to other users because the two companies are corporate siblings The state sa id that El Paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit anticompetitive behavior The sealed filings in the El Paso case indicated that the company expected to make money by widening the basis spread the difference between what gas can be bought for in producing basins of Texas and New Mexico at one end o f the pipeline and its price on delivery to Southern California As it turned out spreads widened enormously over the last year as the pric e of gas soared in California adding to costs for wholesale electricity that pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy California utilities paid billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last months state officials estimated The utilities are not allowed to recoup the costs from customers While the cost of cubic feet of gas typical ly is less than higher at the California end of the pipeline spot prices i n the state rose to almost more than the Texas New Mexico price in December To executives of the parent company the El Paso Corporation the accusatio ns of market manipulation are ludicrous High gas prices in California El Paso executives said in interviews are easily explained by soaring demand the poor credit standing of the states utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or store enough gas for winter The idea that anybody is holding back on California is really ridiculous said Clark C Smith president of El Paso Merchants operations in North America Some El Paso customers though agreed with California officials The Pacif ic Gas Electric Company the San Franciscobased utility condemned El Paso in a filing with the federal agency after its lawyers reviewed the sealed company documents It is now very clear from the business records of El Paso Energy Corporation the utility said in the filing that the business strategy E l Paso Merchant was authorized at the highest corporate levels to pursue involved manipulation of price spreads The agency has not ruled on Californias complaint which asks that the dea l between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant be invalidated Based on t he agencys history of policing energy providers lightly many industry observers predicted that the complaint would be dismissed perhaps as soon as the agencys public meeting on Wednesday Nonetheless El Paso Merchant is feeling some pressure The subsidiary said recently that it planned to relinquish control of all but about percent of the capacity on the pipeline to California rather than exercise an option that would have allowed it to retain the entire capacity of billion cub ic feet of gas a day Critics said they believed El Paso made the move in hopes of lessening the chance of government action El Paso executives deny that but do say that their decision was influenced by the backlash over the arrangement Surrendering the pipeline capacity made for a gutwrenching decision Mr Smith said but was a first class gesture to California El Paso Merchan t paid million to control the pipeline capacity from March unt il May While Mr Clark said he did not know the return on that investment he acknowledged that it was lucrative No doubt about it Mr Clark said we made good money The question of whether El Pasos conduct has driven gas prices higher is expected to be scrutinized by legislators in Sacramento this week The company also faces several lawsuits including one by the city of Los Angeles that accuse it of conspiring with other companies to prevent pipeline projects that could have eased Californias energy crisis El Paso denied the accusation With pipeline capacity and gas supplies tighter concerns about anticompetitive behavior have increased as price volatility has created soaring profits for energy marketers and traders Dynegy Inc a Houstonbased energy trader was once the target of complain ts to federal regulators that it had artificially raised prices by abusing capacity that it controlled on El Pasos pipeline to California In a filing with regulators in January Dynegy contended that pipeline companies routinely favored affiliates Abuses abound because of financial windfalls difficulty of detection lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market the company said There are some red flags right now said William L Massey a member of t he Federal Energy Regulatory Commission since Mr Massey said he was troubled by the potential for abuses when pipeline companies own gas and power marketing subsidiaries as well as electric plants fueled by natural gas El Paso is in all those businesses What the commission ought to be serious about is What are the forces at work Is it simply robust markets responding to true supplyanddemand signals or is it a market defined by market power and some measure of affiliate abuse he said Many in the industry do not believe changes are needed There are rules in place today that protect against affiliate abuse said Stanley Horton chief executive for gas pipeline operations at the Enron Corporation and chairman of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America the industrys trade group referring to the rules under which California has brought its complaint about El Paso To its critics El Paso epitomizes competitive concerns It operates the nations largest network of interstate pipelines and owns one of the larges t reserves of natural gas With its recent acquisition of the Coastal Corporation another large pipeline operator El Paso has a market capitalization of billion At a conference at El Paso headquarters in Houston in February analysts heard executives predict net profits of billion this year El Pasos much better known rival Enron with its headquarters a few blocks away is expected to earn about billion El Paso Merchant provides the strongest growth Two years ago the units profits before interest payments and taxes were million this year i t is expected to have million in North America alone In its latest quarterly report El Paso attributed those profits in part to commodity market and trading margins that were enhanced by power price volatility particularly in the Western United States Critics contend that El Paso set out to exploit those conditions According to the sealed filings on Feb the day before El Paso Merchant wa s awarded the pipeline capacity executives made a presentation to William A Wise chief executive of the parent company laying out the rationale for t he bid The presentation outlined what it termed strategic advantages including more control of total physical markets and the ability to influence the physical market to the benefit of any financialhedge position according to the sealed filings The passages suggested that El Paso expected the deal t o give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to suppo rt financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its risk For every onecent increase in the spread on gas prices the presentation said El Paso Merchant stood to make an additional million Under the heading Challenges according to the sealed filings the presentation stated that storage was needed to help manipulate physical spreads adding to the overall transportstorage cost On April according to the sealed filings El Paso Merchants president at the time Greg G Jenkins wrote a memorandum to Mr Wise involving an upda te for directors meeting later that month The memorandum stated We will mak e money two ways increase the load factor widen the basis spread The language appears to suggest that El Paso Merchant would profit by increasing the gas flow in the pipeline the load factor while inc reasing the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it could be sold for at the other end the basis spread In an interview Mr Smith the El Paso Merchant executive said that the units prices and profits on bulk gas sales in California were locked in months in advance so that the company could not benefit from rising prices in the spot market Otherwise Mr Smith declined to provide any details about money made on th e pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in prices ahead of time In addition Mr Smith said that nearly all of El Pas o Merchants pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late las t year with no capacity withheld to increase prices The company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information i n the sealed documents But El Paso Merchant in a filing with federal regulators said Californias complaint had misconstrued and incorrectly interpreted what it termed snippets of data

electricity if prices dont come down David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifcaMNDTL Sacramento Gov Gray Davis threatened last night to seize excess power generated by Californias municipal utility districts which he said have charged even higher electricity prices than outofstate generators Davis said in an interview with The Chronicle that some municipal utility districts have charged the state as much as percent more than the average wholesale cost demanded by private power companies The governors tough talk came as California suffered through a Stage power alert and faced the prospect of a long hot summer of rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices So far this year the state has paid more than billion to buy power for its cashstrapped utilities In a variation on his threat to seize power plants from outofstate generators if they continue gouging California ratepayers the governor said he would use his executive powers to claim excess juice from the locally owned utilities if they do not lower their prices He said he is ready to go to court if they offer resistance Were going to get that power one way or another Davis said Municipal utilities are cityowned power companies In Northern California there are municipal utilities in Alameda Palo Alto Redding Sacramento and Santa Clara Los Angeles has the largest municipal utility in the state DAYS TILL CONTRACT DETAILS For the first time the governor also gave a time frame for releasing details of more than longterm electricity contracts California is signing with generators since the financial meltdown of the states two biggest utilities He said that after about six more contracts get nailed down he expects full details to be made available within days Although the contracts involve nearly billion in public funds Davis and other state officials have adamantly refused to divulge their contents insisting that secrecy is needed to remain competitive during negotiations The Chronicle and other media outlets have filed suit for access to the contracts arguing that the public has a right to know how its money is being spent RUDE AWAKENING While going toetotoe with the outofstate generators the last thing Davis needed was for municipal utilities the home team as it were to emulate the Texas big boys and dig deep into Californias pockets Yet the governors negotiators have been struggling for weeks to convince municipals that they are obliged to provide power at cost which Davis insisted they are required to do by law He met last week with the heads of a dozen municipal utilities and told them explicitly that he would not tolerate gouging from within the state as California faces a summer of potential blackouts The governor said after the meeting that the municipals had agreed to make most of their excess power available this summer at prices significantly lower than those being charged on the spot market Apparently however little progress has been made since that declaration Davis told The Chronicle last night that he is still trying very hard to promote this notion that were all in this together While unwilling to specify which municipal utilities have been most aggressive in their pricing and refusing to place a dollar amount on how much the utilities charged Davis said he is prepared to seize up to megawatts of output if the they do not change their ways Eight hundred megawatts is enough power to light about homes Representatives of the various municipal utilities could not be reached for comment nor could a spokesperson for the California Municipal Utilities Association in Sacramento I told them that they will either reduce their prices voluntarily or involuntarily the governor said UNCERTAIN FUTURE It remains to be seen however whether the municipal utilities will play ball To date they have shown a firm inclination to go their own way In March Lodis municipal

Diego Where Rates First Rose No Longer Conserves Energy By LAURA M HOLSON The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company SAN DIEGO Jan It was here in the heat of last summer that consumers got their initial lesson in how painful Californias experiment with deregulation could be With electricity supplies short and the states power grid on the brink of collapse wholesale electricity costs nearly tripled and the San Diego Gas and Electric Company the first utility in the state freed by deregulation passed those costs on to its customers Homeowners took to the streets and businesses threatened to leave the city Californias second largest Logic would suggest that San Diego consumers having felt the price shock that the rest of the state so far had been shielded from would be wiser about using electricity than other Californians But the price shock was too short In September California legislators called off the experiment capping retail electrical rates at cents a kilowatt hour the average market price paid in the month before the summer crisis Now six months later San Diegans are back to their old ways Electricity use which dropped percent in August is back up to precrisis levels according to San Diego Gas and Electric Rather than investing in insulation or energyefficient airconditioners consumers here seem to be hovering between denial and defiance I feel I do all that I can to conserve said Vicki Barber an escrow coordinator for a real estate broker in San Diego But Im not going to spend all this money upgrading my house when it doesnt matter anyway As a test laboratory of consumer behavior when the cost of a necessity skyrockets San Diego seems confused by how politicians reacted when consumers here revolted last summer demanding relief In September when California legislators restored the lower rates residential and smallbusiness rate payers received credits on their utility bills even though the credits are really a postponed debt that is expected to come due as soon as And it is true that the utilitys largest customers are already paying market rates Still Jeannie Thompsons reaction was typical In August Ms Thompson the branch manager of a Coldwell Banker real estate office in the Pacific Beach district made it her business to turn off office lights and computers every night When the news first came out you wanted to do your part she said Then in October the office got its credit and we started to go back to the way things were before Economists look at San Diegans behavior and draw this lesson Consumers must suffer a lot before they willingly give up comfort and conveniences they have grown used to Summer should have been a wakeup call said Peter Navarro associate professor of economics and public policy at the University of California at Irvine You cant blame San Diego consumers for not doing anything because legislators stepped in and lowered prices If the discomfort isnt of a lengthy duration the adjustments to behavior that need to take place wont Indeed in a recent paper a group of energy experts and economists including two Nobel Prize winners made the same point saying that if consumers knew the true cost of electricity they would conserve more Even Gov Gray Davis seems to be backing away from his promise that rates would not rise But San Diego consumers once again insulated from rate increases have shrugged off the crisis in part because they have taken to heart the governors oftrepeated claim that the problems are the fault of outofstate power generators that need to be reined in Ask these people if they feel safe at night Pete Phelps said wryly of those generators Mr Phelps an airline pilot was with his wife Pat loading a gallon water heater into the back of his pickup truck at a Home Depot near the San Diego Sports Arena Mrs Phelps added You dont know what is legitimate who to believe So the Phelpses have done little in recent months to conserve except turning off lights as their monthly electricity bill has climbed to from about in the past two years Their new water heater was billed as energy efficient and while it should save them a year they did not buy it with conservation in mind I spill that in beer money Mr Phelps said High prices alone cannot change consumer behavior Mr Navarro the economist said If consumers for instance believe that turning off lights benefits someone other than themselves they will feel no incentive to conserve That he said is the situation in the Pacific Northwest where many residents believe that any power they save will simply be diverted to hot tubs in the San Francisco suburbs But in San Diego people have gotten a particularly mixed message To begin with high rates did not last long enough to make an impact Rather the lingering impression was that legislators would step in to protect consumers at any cost The math said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute was simple If you go from cents to cents to cents then the response will be to weather the storm Mr Borenstein said referring to the price of a kilowatt hour But if it stays at cents then it makes sense for people to go out and invest in ways to save energy Mr Borenstein drew a parallel to the gasoline shortages of the s At first he said motorists demonized Middle East oil producers as lines of cars snaked around gasoline stations waiting for rationed supplies Only after high prices persisted did consumers begin to change their habits buying more fuelefficient cars he said Still some San Diegans insist that they are pitching in I have not put the heat on said Ms Thompson the real estate agent I close my doors and put on a sweater But she has not had an energy audit of her home a service provided by San Diego Gas and Electric or bought energysaving appliances During last summers price spike surveys by San Diego Gas and Electric found that percent of its million users did not think the utility was being wholly honest with them about the crisis said Stephen L Baum chairman of Sempra Energy the utilitys parent company And there is bound to be more anger now that the utility has requested a surcharge of about percent in March to pay off million it owes its power suppliers Higher rates will also make life harder for people who are just getting by At a recent outdoor farmers market in El Cajon a workingclass town miles east of San Diego Heidi Van Horn a massage therapist and her fiance Bernie Herloss a handyman were supplementing their monthly income by selling grilled bratwurst and hamburgers to hungry shoppers For the twobedroom apartment they share the couple have in pastdue energy bills Those bills hover at about a month up from two years ago We arent one of these highrollers who make an hour Ms Van Horn said We either pay the electricity or have the phone shut off Even so she said they do what they can to conserve turning down the thermostat or turning off the occasional light But their apartment building is poorly insulated Cold wind seeps in through closed windows and the heating vents are near the ceiling where the warmth is wasted Their only energyefficient light bulb is the one that came in the mail from San Diego Gas and Electric And the two birds and the iguana they keep Ms Van Horn said would die if she turned off any of the three heat lamps that run continuously in the apartment She would never consider getting rid of the pets Ms Van Horn said They are family Photo Jeannie Thompson who manages a Coldwell Banker office in San Diego said

electricity if prices dont come down David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday May San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifcaMNDTL Sacramento Gov Gray Davis threatened last night to seize excess power generated by Californias municipal utility districts which he said have charged even higher electricity prices than outofstate generators Davis said in an interview with The Chronicle that some municipal utility districts have charged the state as much as percent more than the average wholesale cost demanded by private power companies The governors tough talk came as California suffered through a Stage power alert and faced the prospect of a long hot summer of rolling blackouts and skyrocketing electricity prices So far this year the state has paid more than billion to buy power for its cashstrapped utilities In a variation on his threat to seize power plants from outofstate generators if they continue gouging California ratepayers the governor said he would use his executive powers to claim excess juice from the locally owned utilities if they do not lower their prices He said he is ready to go to court if they offer resistance Were going to get that power one way or another Davis said Municipal utilities are cityowned power companies In Northern California there are municipal utilities in Alameda Palo Alto Redding Sacramento and Santa Clara Los Angeles has the largest municipal utility in the state DAYS TILL CONTRACT DETAILS For the first time the governor also gave a time frame for releasing details of more than longterm electricity contracts California is signing with generators since the financial meltdown of the states two biggest utilities He said that after about six more contracts get nailed down he expects full details to be made available within days Although the contracts involve nearly billion in public funds Davis and other state officials have adamantly refused to divulge their contents insisting that secrecy is needed to remain competitive during negotiations The Chronicle and other media outlets have filed suit for access to the contracts arguing that the public has a right to know how its money is being spent RUDE AWAKENING While going toetotoe with the outofstate generators the last thing Davis needed was for municipal utilities the home team as it were to emulate the Texas big boys and dig deep into Californias pockets Yet the governors negotiators have been struggling for weeks to convince municipals that they are obliged to provide power at cost which Davis insisted they are required to do by law He met last week with the heads of a dozen municipal utilities and told them explicitly that he would not tolerate gouging from within the state as California faces a summer of potential blackouts The governor said after the meeting that the municipals had agreed to make most of their excess power available this summer at prices significantly lower than those being charged on the spot market Apparently however little progress has been made since that declaration Davis told The Chronicle last night that he is still trying very hard to promote this notion that were all in this together While unwilling to specify which municipal utilities have been most aggressive in their pricing and refusing to place a dollar amount on how much the utilities charged Davis said he is prepared to seize up to megawatts of output if the they do not change their ways Eight hundred megawatts is enough power to light about homes Representatives of the various municipal utilities could not be reached for comment nor could a spokesperson for the California Municipal Utilities Association in Sacramento I told them that they will either reduce their prices voluntarily or involuntarily the governor said UNCERTAIN FUTURE It remains to be seen however whether the municipal utilities will play ball To date they have shown a firm inclination to go their own way In March Lodis municipal utility district and a Northern California municipal utility cooperative that includes Palo Alto Santa Clara and Alameda told Pacific Gas and Electric Co that they will not participate in rolling

Pipelines By RICHARD A OPPEL Jr and LOWELL BERGMAN Join a Discussion on Future Energy Sources Related Sites Interactive Guide California Power Woes California ISO Energy Department Statistics Western Governors Association Get Stock Quotes Look Up Symbols Separate symbols with a space Portfolio Stock Markets Mutual Funds Bonds Currencies Bank Rates Industries arly last year the El Paso Natural Gas Company took bids from two dozen companies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline fro m Texas and New Mexico to meet onesixth of the daily demand of energystarve d California The winner El Pasos sister company the El Paso Merchant Energy Company which buys sells and trades natural gas The bidding was not close El Pas o Merchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid in total for bits and pieces Why pay so much more California officials who are pressing a complaint against El Paso at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say the answer is simple The state contends that El Paso Merchant with help from its sister company saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of natural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity According to sealed documents obtained by The New York Times that are part of filings in the federal case executives at El Paso Merchant said internally that the deal would give them more control of gas markets including the ability to influence the physical market to benefit the companys financi al positions El Paso executives called the accusations fanciful and in a formal respons e to Californias complaint said the state grossly distorted company documents by quoting words and phrases out of context The dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the natural gas industry which fuels a growing share of the nations electric power plants At issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas and whether federal regulators adequately enforce existing rules In particular many industry officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximiz e profits More than miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country moving natural gas from Canada the Southwest and other producing regions t o fuel factories power utilities and heat houses Not long ago many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity But experts say that several regions including California New York and New England now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants In California state officials and utility executives said the documents in the federal case and El Pasos actions were proof that the states energy crisis stemmed not just from an illconceived deregulation plan but from price manipulation and profiteering They are the market maker with this pipeline said Loretta Lynch the president of the California Public Utilities Commission which has struggle d to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages El Paso sets the price in California Ms Lynch said and what it did was intentional It has affected the price she said for everything related to heat and electrical power prices in the state Californias complaint to the federal agency contends that El Paso Merchant has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity on the pipeline The state also charges that El Paso Natural Gas the pipeline s owner has had no incentive to spur competition by offering discounts to other users because the two companies are corporate siblings The state sa id that El Paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit anticompetitive behavior The sealed filings in the El Paso case indicated that the company expected to make money by widening the basis spread the difference between what gas can be bought for in producing basins of Texas and New Mexico at one end o f the pipeline and its price on delivery to Southern California As it turned out spreads widened enormously over the last year as the pric e of gas soared in California adding to costs for wholesale electricity that pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy California utilities paid billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last months state officials estimated The utilities are not allowed to recoup the costs from customers While the cost of cubic feet of gas typical ly is less than higher at the California end of the pipeline spot prices i n the state rose to almost more than the Texas New Mexico price in December To executives of the parent company the El Paso Corporation the accusatio ns of market manipulation are ludicrous High gas prices in California El Paso executives said in interviews are easily explained by soaring demand the poor credit standing of the states utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or store enough gas for winter The idea that anybody is holding back on California is really ridiculous said Clark C Smith president of El Paso Merchants operations in North America Some El Paso customers though agreed with California officials The Pacif ic Gas Electric Company the San Franciscobased utility condemned El Paso in a filing with the federal agency after its lawyers reviewed the sealed company documents It is now very clear from the business records of El Paso Energy Corporation the utility said in the filing that the business strategy E l Paso Merchant was authorized at the highest corporate levels to pursue involved manipulation of price spreads The agency has not ruled on Californias complaint which asks that the dea l between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant be invalidated Based on t he agencys history of policing energy providers lightly many industry observers predicted that the complaint would be dismissed perhaps as soon as the agencys public meeting on Wednesday Nonetheless El Paso Merchant is feeling some pressure The subsidiary said recently that it planned to relinquish control of all but about percent of the capacity on the pipeline to California rather than exercise an option that would have allowed it to retain the entire capacity of billion cub ic feet of gas a day Critics said they believed El Paso made the move in hopes of lessening the chance of government action El Paso executives deny that but do say that their decision was influenced by the backlash over the arrangement Surrendering the pipeline capacity made for a gutwrenching decision Mr Smith said but was a first class gesture to California El Paso Merchan t paid million to control the pipeline capacity from March unt il May While Mr Clark said he did not know the return on that investment he acknowledged that it was lucrative No doubt about it Mr Clark said we made good money The question of whether El Pasos conduct has driven gas prices higher is expected to be scrutinized by legislators in Sacramento this week The company also faces several lawsuits including one by the city of Los Angeles that accuse it of conspiring with other companies to prevent pipeline projects that could have eased Californias energy crisis El Paso denied the accusation With pipeline capacity and gas supplies tighter concerns about anticompetitive behavior have increased as price volatility has created soaring profits for energy marketers and traders Dynegy Inc a Houstonbased energy trader was once the target of complain ts to federal regulators that it had artificially raised prices by abusing capacity that it controlled on El Pasos pipeline to California In a filing with regulators in January Dynegy contended that pipeline companies routinely favored affiliates Abuses abound because of financial windfalls difficulty of detection lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market the company said There are some red flags right now said William L Massey a member of t he Federal Energy Regulatory Commission since Mr Massey said he was troubled by the potential for abuses when pipeline companies own gas and power marketing subsidiaries as well as electric plants fueled by natural gas El Paso is in all those businesses What the commission ought to be serious about is What are the forces at work Is it simply robust markets responding to true supplyanddemand signals or is it a market defined by market power and some measure of affiliate abuse he said Many in the industry do not believe changes are needed There are rules in place today that protect against affiliate abuse said Stanley Horton chief executive for gas pipeline operations at the Enron Corporation and chairman of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America the industrys trade group referring to the rules under which California has brought its complaint about El Paso To its critics El Paso epitomizes competitive concerns It operates the nations largest network of interstate pipelines and owns one of the larges t reserves of natural gas With its recent acquisition of the Coastal Corporation another large pipeline operator El Paso has a market capitalization of billion At a conference at El Paso headquarters in Houston in February analysts heard executives predict net profits of billion this year El Pasos much better known rival Enron with its headquarters a few blocks away is expected to earn about billion El Paso Merchant provides the strongest growth Two years ago the units profits before interest payments and taxes were million this year i t is expected to have million in North America alone In its latest quarterly report El Paso attributed those profits in part to commodity market and trading margins that were enhanced by power price volatility particularly in the Western United States Critics contend that El Paso set out to exploit those conditions According to the sealed filings on Feb the day before El Paso Merchant wa s awarded the pipeline capacity executives made a presentation to William A Wise chief executive of the parent company laying out the rationale for t he bid The presentation outlined what it termed strategic advantages including more control of total physical markets and the ability to influence the physical market to the benefit of any financialhedge position according to the sealed filings The passages suggested that El Paso expected the deal t o give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to suppo rt financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its risk For every onecent increase in the spread on gas prices the presentation said El Paso Merchant stood to make an additional million Under the heading Challenges according to the sealed filings the presentation stated that storage was needed to help manipulate physical spreads adding to the overall transportstorage cost On April according to the sealed filings El Paso Merchants president at the time Greg G Jenkins wrote a memorandum to Mr Wise involving an upda te for directors meeting later that month The memorandum stated We will mak e money two ways increase the load factor widen the basis spread The language appears to suggest that El Paso Merchant would profit by increasing the gas flow in the pipeline the load factor while inc reasing the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it could be sold for at the other end the basis spread In an interview Mr Smith the El Paso Merchant executive said that the units prices and profits on bulk gas sales in California were locked in months in advance so that the company could not benefit from rising prices in the spot market Otherwise Mr Smith declined to provide any details about money made on th e pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in prices ahead of time In addition Mr Smith said that nearly all of El Pas o Merchants pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late las t year with no capacity withheld to increase prices The company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information i n the sealed documents But El Paso Merchant in a filing with federal regulators said Californias complaint had misconstrued and incorrectly interpreted what it termed snippets of data

Diego Where Rates First Rose No Longer Conserves Energy By LAURA M HOLSON The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company SAN DIEGO Jan It was here in the heat of last summer that consumers got their initial lesson in how painful Californias experiment with deregulation could be With electricity supplies short and the states power grid on the brink of collapse wholesale electricity costs nearly tripled and the San Diego Gas and Electric Company the first utility in the state freed by deregulation passed those costs on to its customers Homeowners took to the streets and businesses threatened to leave the city Californias second largest Logic would suggest that San Diego consumers having felt the price shock that the rest of the state so far had been shielded from would be wiser about using electricity than other Californians But the price shock was too short In September California legislators called off the experiment capping retail electrical rates at cents a kilowatt hour the average market price paid in the month before the summer crisis Now six months later San Diegans are back to their old ways Electricity use which dropped percent in August is back up to precrisis levels according to San Diego Gas and Electric Rather than investing in insulation or energyefficient airconditioners consumers here seem to be hovering between denial and defiance I feel I do all that I can to conserve said Vicki Barber an escrow coordinator for a real estate broker in San Diego But Im not going to spend all this money upgrading my house when it doesnt matter anyway As a test laboratory of consumer behavior when the cost of a necessity skyrockets San Diego seems confused by how politicians reacted when consumers here revolted last summer demanding relief In September when California legislators restored the lower rates residential and smallbusiness rate payers received credits on their utility bills even though the credits are really a postponed debt that is expected to come due as soon as And it is true that the utilitys largest customers are already paying market rates Still Jeannie Thompsons reaction was typical In August Ms Thompson the branch manager of a Coldwell Banker real estate office in the Pacific Beach district made it her business to turn off office lights and computers every night When the news first came out you wanted to do your part she said Then in October the office got its credit and we started to go back to the way things were before Economists look at San Diegans behavior and draw this lesson Consumers must suffer a lot before they willingly give up comfort and conveniences they have grown used to Summer should have been a wakeup call said Peter Navarro associate professor of economics and public policy at the University of California at Irvine You cant blame San Diego consumers for not doing anything because legislators stepped in and lowered prices If the discomfort isnt of a lengthy duration the adjustments to behavior that need to take place wont Indeed in a recent paper a group of energy experts and economists including two Nobel Prize winners made the same point saying that if consumers knew the true cost of electricity they would conserve more Even Gov Gray Davis seems to be backing away from his promise that rates would not rise But San Diego consumers once again insulated from rate increases have shrugged off the crisis in part because they have taken to heart the governors oftrepeated claim that the problems are the fault of outofstate power generators that need to be reined in Ask these people if they feel safe at night Pete Phelps said wryly of those generators Mr Phelps an airline pilot was with his wife Pat loading a gallon water heater into the back of his pickup truck at a Home Depot near the San Diego Sports Arena Mrs Phelps added You dont know what is legitimate who to believe So the Phelpses have done little in recent months to conserve except turning off lights as their monthly electricity bill has climbed to from about in the past two years Their new water heater was billed as energy efficient and while it should save them a year they did not buy it with conservation in mind I spill that in beer money Mr Phelps said High prices alone cannot change consumer behavior Mr Navarro the economist said If consumers for instance believe that turning off lights benefits someone other than themselves they will feel no incentive to conserve That he said is the situation in the Pacific Northwest where many residents believe that any power they save will simply be diverted to hot tubs in the San Francisco suburbs But in San Diego people have gotten a particularly mixed message To begin with high rates did not last long enough to make an impact Rather the lingering impression was that legislators would step in to protect consumers at any cost The math said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute was simple If you go from cents to cents to cents then the response will be to weather the storm Mr Borenstein said referring to the price of a kilowatt hour But if it stays at cents then it makes sense for people to go out and invest in ways to save energy Mr Borenstein drew a parallel to the gasoline shortages of the s At first he said motorists demonized Middle East oil producers as lines of cars snaked around gasoline stations waiting for rationed supplies Only after high prices persisted did consumers begin to change their habits buying more fuelefficient cars he said Still some San Diegans insist that they are pitching in I have not put the heat on said Ms Thompson the real estate agent I close my doors and put on a sweater But she has not had an energy audit of her home a service provided by San Diego Gas and Electric or bought energysaving appliances During last summers price spike surveys by San Diego Gas and Electric found that percent of its million users did not think the utility was being wholly honest with them about the crisis said Stephen L Baum chairman of Sempra Energy the utilitys parent company And there is bound to be more anger now that the utility has requested a surcharge of about percent in March to pay off million it owes its power suppliers Higher rates will also make life harder for people who are just getting by At a recent outdoor farmers market in El Cajon a workingclass town miles east of San Diego Heidi Van Horn a massage therapist and her fiance Bernie Herloss a handyman were supplementing their monthly income by selling grilled bratwurst and hamburgers to hungry shoppers For the twobedroom apartment they share the couple have in pastdue energy bills Those bills hover at about a month up from two years ago We arent one of these highrollers who make an hour Ms Van Horn said We either pay the electricity or have the phone shut off Even so she said they do what they can to conserve turning down the thermostat or turning off the occasional light But their apartment building is poorly insulated Cold wind seeps in through closed windows and the heating vents are near the ceiling where the warmth is wasted Their only energyefficient light bulb is the one that came in the mail from San Diego Gas and Electric And the two birds and the iguana they keep Ms Van Horn said would die if she turned off any of the three heat lamps that run continuously in the apartment She would never consider getting rid of the pets Ms Van Horn said They are family Photo Jeannie Thompson who manages a Coldwell Banker office in San Diego said
