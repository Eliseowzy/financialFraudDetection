students were walking across campus when one said Where did you get such a great bike The second engineer replied Well I was walking along yesterday minding my own business when a beautiful woman rode up on this bike She threw the bike to the ground took off all her clothes and said Take what you want The second engineer nodded approvingly Good choice the clothes probably wouldnt have fit anyway Comprehending Engineers Take Two To the optimist the glass is half full to the pessimist the glass is halfempty to the engineer the glass is twice as big as it needs to be Comprehending Engineers Take Three A pastor a doctor and an engineer were waiting one morning for a particularly slow group of golfers The engineer fumed Whats with these guys We must have been waiting for minutes The doctor chimed in I dont know but Ive never seen such ineptitude The pastor said Hey here comes the greenskeeper Lets have a word with him Hi George Say whats with that group ahead of us Theyre rather slow arent they The greenskeeper replied Oh yes thats a group of blind firefighters They lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year so we always let them play for free anytime The group was silent for a moment The pastor said Thats so sad I think I will say a special prayer for them tonight The doctor said Good idea and Im going to contact my ophthalmologist buddy and see if theres anything he can do for them The engineer said Why cant these guys play at night Comprehending Engineers Take Four There was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all things mechanical After serving his company loyally for over years he happily retired Several years later the company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multimilliondollar machines They had tried every thing and everyone else to get the machine to work but to no avail In desperation they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past The engineer reluctantly took the challenge He spent a day studying the huge machine At the end of the day he marked a small x in chalk on a particular component of the machine and stated This is where your problem is The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again The company received a bill for from the engineer for his service They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges The engineer responded briefly One chalk mark Knowing where to put it It was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace Comprehending Engineers Take Five What is the difference between Mechanical Engineers and Civil Engineers Mechanical Engineers build weapons Civil Engineers build targets Comprehending Engineers Take Six Three engineering students were gathered together discussing the possible designers of the human body One said It was a mechanical engineer Just look at all the joints Another said No it was an electrical engineer The nervous system has many thousands of electrical connections The last said Actually it was a civil engineer Who else would run a toxic waste pipeline through a recreational area Comprehending Engineers Take Seven Normal people believe that if it aint broke dont fix it Engineers believe that if it aint broke it doesnt have enough features yet Comprehending Engineers Take Eight An architect an artist and an engineer were discussing whether it was better to spend time with the wife or a mistress The architect said he enjoyed time with his wife building a solid foundation for an enduring relationship The artist said he enjoyed time with his mistress because of the passion and mystery he found there The engineer said I like both Both The Engineer said Yeah If you have a wife and a mistress they will each assume you are spending time with the other woman and you can go to the office and get some work done Comprehending Engineers Take Nine An engineer was crossing a road oneday when a frog called out to him and said If you kiss me Ill turn into a beautiful princess He bent over picked up the frog and put it in his pocket The frog spoke up again and said If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess I will stay with you for one week The engineer took the frog out of his pocket smiled at it and returned it to the pocket The frog then cried out If you kiss me and turn me back into a princess Ill stay with you and do ANYTHING you want Again the engineer took the frog out smiled at it and put it back into his pocket Finally the frog asked What is the matter Ive told you Im a beautiful princess and that Ill stay with you for a week and do anything you want Why wont you kiss me The engineer said Look Im an engineer I dont have time for a girlfriend but a talking frogthats cool picpcx
