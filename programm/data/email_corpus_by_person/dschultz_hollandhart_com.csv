The Coordinated Defendants in the Grynberg cases respond as follows to the Courts invitation to submit comments on discovery issues related to the Governments motion to dismiss portions of the Grynberg complaints First the Coordinated Defendants silence as a group regarding the Governments motion to dismiss should not be viewed as an indication that we believe the Governments motion lacks merit The Defendants have simply been at a disadvantage in presenting their views because the Governments motion is in large measure dependent upon facts such as the adequacy of the submissions Grynberg made to the Government not known to the Defendants due in part as discussed below to Grynbergs failure to serve the Defendants with materials he has submitted to the Court The Coordinated Defendants remain of one mind however in their belief that all of the Grynberg complaints should be dismissed for the entirely separate reasons that they are improperly pled under Fed R Civ Proc b and fail to state a claim under Fed R Civ Proc b The Coordinated Defendants are also united in their belief that consideration of the Governments motion should not take precedence over the Coordinated Defendants pending motion to dismiss We were thus pleased to learn at the status conference on December and from the Courts Order Following Status Conference that the Court proceeding ahead with a ruling on the Defendants pending motions to dismiss without regard to other pending matters Specifically with regard to Grynbergs position on discovery as outlined in Mr Figas letter to the Court on December we feel compelled to point out that the Grynberg request for discovery has implications far beyond the narrow issues raised by the governments motion to dismiss Grynberg essentially is requesting discovery on whether he or Wright is the proper relator on royalty valuation claims See Dec letter at While Grynberg is not necessarily volunteering to open himself up to discovery on whether he is the original source of the information he claims to have given to Wrights attorneys he is specifically asking for public disclosureoriginal source discovery from Wright and certainly the

necessary any subsequent constitutional challenges to the Grynberg complaints That orderly progression should not be upset by the sudden intrusion of the Governments motion and Grynbergs request for

Court grants Grynbergs request for discovery it enter an order directing that any information produced in discovery or submitted to the Court in this case be provided to all parties alike This requirement is so fundamental that it ordinarily does not require an order of the Court to implement However Grynberg has already submitted to this Court under seal documents that he claims support his position on the Governments motion to dismiss and he has requested that the Clerk not make those documents available to the Defendants Absent direction to the contrary from the Court the Clerk has thus far complied with Grynbergs request and denied the Defendants access to those documents This submission of documents to the Court by Mr Gynberg is a clear violation of Fed R Civ P a which

Don Schultz To Kansas JDT Participants Re motion hearing A transcript has been ordered Below is my recap I encourage other attendees to reply with corrections or additions you think would be helpful to folks who did not attend Overall Impressions Rex Sharps arguments were unclear complicated and at times inconsistent I think plaintiffs lawyers left the Court with the impression that they are in disarray not well organized and not ready to proceed with a workable approach to the case Dave Rebein did an excellent job of illustrating how bizaare this case is in scope and substance youll want to read the motorcycle story he told Judge Smith at the start of his argument to illustrate this His creative approach struck a chord Judge Smith put his hands in front of his face in order not to laugh so obviously but laugh he did Jim Griffin showed the Judge that the defendants have invested thousands of hours collectively to produce the information on their Kansas contacts and ably reviewed the case law which frowns on allowing discovery into either pjd or merits where a conspiracy has been pleaded only in conclusory terms Jim and Dave presented coordinated clear arguments and presented them persuasively Their hard preparation work and that of the Akin Gump team and many other volunteers seemed to me to pay off in a very strong showing Smith listened to the arguments without saying much or asking questions My sense at the conclusion of the arguments was that the Judge had not read much of the defendants briefs but that Messrs Rebein and Griffin had made compelling arguments in line with those in the briefs whereas Sharps arguments remained muddled Smiths comments and decisions on the motions thus far are summarized as follows Sharps Pseudo Motion to Compel Judge Smith will review the interrogs and requests for production which Sharp served as personal jurisdiction discovery He will issue some form of order or statement he said by this Friday which identifies those questions which go too far are outside what he contemplated in the case management order as limited personal jurisdiction discovery versus those questions he thinks defendants should answer because they bear on personal jurisdiction This will not constitute a ruling on any objections The defendants will have ten days to further answer or object to any of the discovery which the Court finds is within the intent of the case management order as to the scope of personal jurisdiction issues Judge Smith said that he wants future discovery objections to be filed withsent to him immediately so he can get a response from the other side and rule on objections quickly he wants to know about discovery objections before God hears the news something like that Judge Smith gave a brief overview of the parties opposing positions on the scope of permissible jurisdiction discovery the defendants limiting that scope to contacts and the plaintiffs treating it as tantamount to merits discovery He did not seem prepared to agree with either party completely He said that it was his intent from the outset to spare the defendants from full merits discovery until he determined the scope of the courts jurisdiction and it seemed that he intends to continue to draw a distinction between limited and full discovery Pointing to a blowup which Messrs Rebein and Griffin used he indicated that some of the requests do appear to go well beyond personal jurisdiction issues He also said though that the jurisdictional issues may not be limited to contacts as the defendants contend I left the courtroom unsure how Smith will decide which questions he thinks are within and without the limited personal jurisdiction discovery the CMO allows It is not clear whether he will look at the law on the sufficiency of pleading a conspiracy or whether he will look at the case law on whether or not pleading a conspiracy can extend the scope of personal jursdiction to reach nocontacts alleged conspirators Neither side really pushed him to decide those legal points now He left himself all options as still open I had the impression that the Judge had not read the discovery requests at all even though defendants had attached them as an exhibit and that he expects perhaps naively that the boundary between limited personal jurisdiction and merits discovery to be clear to him as he looks at the questions one at a time Sharp tendered to the Judge a copy of the Tejas defendants objections and answers Other defense counsel requested leave to submit their defendants responses and objections The Court finally realized that the defendants were concerned he would be ruling to compel discovery without having considered the various objections and so made clear he is only going to now evaluate Sharps questions give some guidance on which questions seem within the scope of the order and the defendants can make objections as needed The Judge seemed frustrated that Sharp had not provided him the discovery questions with his motion and also seemed perturbed by the form of the motion He said I dont know what this motion is there is no such motion Plaintiffs are just making stuff up I dont like it when parties make stuff up because then I dont know what to do PSCo Colorado and KCS motions to compel Jim Eisenbrandt and Jim Flaherty argued persuasively that Plaintiffs should have to respond to the personal jurisdiction discovery they had submitted even if the answers are that the plaintiffs dont have evidence to support jurisdiction over individual defendants Judge Smith denied Sharps motion for a protective order that plaintiffs not have to respond to that discovery He rejected Sharps argument that it is not fair for plaintiffs to have to respond when the defendants have asserted objections As with Sharps questions Judge Smith will review the questions submitted by KCS and PSCo and identify those which the plaintiffs must answer Dan Church will submit his separate discovery served on the plaintiffs since he asked some additional and different questions Discussion of Case Management Order In arguing his motion Sharp emphasized that with the passage of time and lack of discovery he does not believe the CMO deadlines on the personal jurisdiction motion can be met Later off the record after the arguments Sharp and Kerry McQueen apprised the Court that Mike Moore cannot attend to this case due to the illness of his office manager that Moore cannot be deposed for the foreseeable future as a class representative and that Moore may have to reevaluate in about a month whether he even wants to participate in this case McQueen said if Moore does not want to participate then he and Sharp will face some hard decisions Though Sharp reiterated at points in his arguments that he thinks the class certification should proceed ahead of the personal jurisdiction factual motions because the latter require discovery tantamount to merits discovery he also seems to want to delay class certification but has been unclear in that respect There were no formal proposals made to change the CMO and no rulings to do so The Judge indicated that if the parties agree to change the CMO deadlines and schedule he will not have a problem doing so subject to him deciding the hearing dates He wants the events calendared at all times to give him management control over the case but he is amenable to changing the time lines I think both sides will wait to see what the Judge says about the scope of limited personal jurisdiction discovery then reevaluate how to proceed with CMO negotiations It seems likely to me that we will get to the hearing on the initial motion to dismiss without the discovery having progressed far in substance It is not at all clear whether the defendants will still want to or be able to continue pressing forward with the personal jurisdiction motion including undertaking needed discovery and a decision on same before class certification Judge Smith still seems to think that is the correct logical sequence for the case but his guidance on the discovery scope will be pivotal Don

heard any suggestion that the Quinque defendants should weigh in on the subject of whether or not Grynberg should be allowed the discovery he requests which seems to be a FCA subject There is no requirement that the Quinque defendants submit anything on this Please let me know if you think there is a need for the Quinque defendants to speak to this topic Don Re In re Natural Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigtion MDL Docket No All Cases Dear Judge Downes The Coordinated Defendants in the Grynberg cases respond as follows to the Courts invitation to submit comments on discovery issues related to the Governments motion to dismiss portions of the Grynberg complaints First the Coordinated Defendants silence as a group regarding the Governments motion to dismiss should not be viewed as an indication that we believe the Governments motion lacks merit The Defendants have simply been at a disadvantage in presenting their views because the Governments motion is in large measure dependent upon facts such as the adequacy of the submissions Grynberg made to the Government not known to the Defendants due in part as discussed below to Grynbergs failure to serve the Defendants with materials he has submitted to the Court The Coordinated Defendants remain of one mind however in their belief that all of the Grynberg complaints should be dismissed for the entirely separate reasons that they are improperly pled under Fed R Civ Proc b and fail to state a claim under Fed R Civ Proc b The Coordinated Defendants are also united in their belief that consideration of the Governments motion should not take precedence over the Coordinated Defendants pending motion to dismiss We were thus pleased to learn at the status conference on December and from the Courts Order Following Status Conference that the Court proceeding ahead with a ruling on the Defendants pending motions to dismiss without regard to other pending matters Specifically with regard to Grynbergs position on discovery as outlined in Mr Figas letter to the Court on December we feel compelled to point out that the Grynberg request for discovery has implications far beyond the narrow issues raised by the governments motion to dismiss Grynberg essentially is requesting discovery on whether he or Wright is the proper relator on royalty valuation claims See Dec letter at While Grynberg is not necessarily volunteering to open himself up to discovery on whether he is the original source of the information he claims to have given to Wrights attorneys he is specifically asking for public disclosureoriginal source discovery from Wright and certainly the discovery Grynberg is seeking may well overlap discovery on whether he himself was the original source In light of this fact we remind the Court that the Coordinated Defendants have with the Courts concurrence delayed seeking discovery on and filing their own public disclosureoriginal source motion until the Court has ruled on the pending motions to dismiss the Grynberg complaints and if necessary any subsequent constitutional challenges to the Grynberg complaints That orderly progression should not be upset by the sudden intrusion of the Governments motion and Grynbergs request for discovery Therefore if the Court should decide that some discovery between and among Grynberg Wright and the Government is appropriate to resolve the limited issues raised by the Governments motion to dismiss we respectfully request that the Court make it abundantly clear that such discovery will in no way prejudice or restrict the right of the Defendants in the Grynberg cases to take their own discovery at the appropriate time and assuming these cases have not previously been dismissed on the public disclosureoriginal source issues Finally we respectfully request that whether or not the Court grants Grynbergs request for discovery it enter an order directing that any information produced in discovery or submitted to the Court in this case be provided to all parties alike This requirement is so fundamental that it ordinarily does not require an order of the Court to implement However Grynberg has already submitted to this Court under seal documents that he claims support his position on the Governments motion to dismiss and he has requested that the Clerk not make those documents available to the Defendants Absent direction to the contrary from the Court the Clerk has thus far complied with Grynbergs request and denied the Defendants access to those documents This submission of documents to the Court by Mr Gynberg is a clear violation of Fed R Civ P a which requires that all filings with the limited exception of motions that the movant specifically requests be heard ex parte be served on all parties If Grynberg truly has a legitimate reason for asking that the documents be placed under seal such as that they contain proprietary information the Defendants will happy to agree to an appropriate protective order restricting access to those documents But in no event should the Defendants be denied any access whatsoever to documents relevant to these cases The Coordinated Defendants appreciate this opportunity to present these views to the Court Respectfully submitted
