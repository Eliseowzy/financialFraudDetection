But what a bout the demand side of the issue What about getting customers involved in the solution by allowing them to sell their excess power back into the system Negawatts nothing new Granted the concept of negawatts is nothing new it was coined roughly a quartercentury ago by the founder of the Boulderbased consulting firm E Source Amory Lovins Many utilities today use customer curtailment to get them through wattage rough spots from time to time All the existing independent system operators have actively considered demandside bids at one time or another according to Richard Rudden president of the consulting firm RJ Rudden Associates in Hauppauge NY But what about a negawatt program serving the entire Western Interconnectio n Rather than a supply exchange aka an independent system operator put in place a demand exchange where customers could make a choice Do I produce widgets run my milling machines build product or take the power I would have used bid it out and see what happens Just such a demand exchange within the Western Interconnection is being championed by an unlikely proponent Reliant Energy Inc The Houstonbased energy giant already has testified in Washington DC concerning the proposal has had meetings with key Western state government leadership and pitched its idea to trade associations and environmental groups The scorecard Thus far no one has laughed no one has walked away from th e conversationsno one has said no according to Reliants John H Stout senior vice president of asset commercialization Youre taking forced rotating outages and prioritizing the interruption with the customer that can take the outage doing so said Stout Much of what Reliant proposes is included in Texas Republican Congressman J oe Bartons Electricity Emergency Assistance bill but no big generator is pushing from the industry side like Reliant A demand exchange Like generators including Reliant bidding load into the independent syste m operator pool a demand exchange allows retail customers to determine what they could spare and bid in a specific load and acceptable price The negawatt dispatch clearinghouse would develop a bid stack and make it available throughout the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC If a particular system needed more power it would contact the clearinghouse which would match the least cost set of bids that could be shipped keeping in mind additional transmission charges Once the bids were identified the clearinghouse would contact the customer and its local control area The customer would interrupt and the host utili ty would move the curtailed megawatts onto an export schedule One key to the programs success is that no one loses money The customer that gave up its designated electrons would continue to pay its retail supplier for what it didnt actually use and the customer would receive it s bid price times the megawatts curtailed minus its regular retail charges plus any payment to the transmission provider The key is it gets the incentives right at the margin said William Hogan a professor at Harvard Universitys John F Kennedy School of Government Another key to the Reliantchampioned negawatt program is that it is not seasonal it doesnt lock a potential megawattshedder into a longterm contract You can bid into the market every day said Stout It offers a tremendous advantage in that it allows distributive decisions to be made how much a customer is willing to take for an energy entitlement said Richard Tabors president of the Cambridge Massbased energy consulting firm Tabors Carmanis Associates As Tabors points out customers who sell back into the market obviously are doing so to play the margin to make money But their efforts also will hav e a serious impact on the spot market price Every megawatt not consumed is a megawatt which doesnt have to be produced Tabors reasoned That lowers the marginal cost the spot market cost It really comes down to what specific megawatts are worth to someon e and not worth to me Heavy users thrilled Heavy industrial users already are thrilled with the regional negawatt proposal We think it is a well thoughtout program We feel customers hav e the right to buy power they should have the right to sell power and ought to be compensated like the generators said John Anderson executive director of

choice sound familiarallowing it to determine when it shuts down or gives up its power This is voluntary You know when you will be shut down and thus you wont incur any damages said Anderson Many
