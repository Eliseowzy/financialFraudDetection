Ramona Betancourt AM To Linda TrevinoET NRON cc Lorraine LindbergET NRON Lindy DonohoET NRON Subject Re TWs LFT changes Linda Sorry it took longer than I thought to get back with you Marketing had several issues come up last week Here are the answers to your questions Item Is this a contract waiver I talked with Lorraine and here is what Marketing wants They would like the request form to be at a shipper level LE Level that applies to all their new current and future LFT contracts Since it will be a manual process can you keep an LFT waiver logbook that is at a LE level then place a copy of this signed overrun request form in each LFT contract file change the flag to Yes on each active LFT contract for that shipper Item Can they change their mind on the waiverif so would this require an amendment to the contract Answer Yes they can change so the field needs to be date effective but would like it to be an administrative amendment with new request form signed by the shipper not an amendment through the contract This would be a change for all their LFT contracts since marketing wants to keep it simple at an LE Shipper Level Item Can the waiver be date sensitive Answer Yes Susan Scott will review the request form and make any changes needed I will forward a copy of the draft I did to you and marketing and Susan to review Item Is the contracts group suppose to be the keeper of the waiver Answer Yes Marketing suggested that a LFT Waiver book be set up then also they would like a copy of the signed request form to be in each LFT contract file Item When is the shipper suppose to submit the waiver at request time Answer Yes at the time they are executing their first LFT contract When we have the system changes in production I will let marketing know they will advise the shippers of this new waiver Item Where will the waiver reside With the request on the Web under blank forms Answer Yes on the web under Contractsblank forms for TW Please let me know if you have any other issues Thanks Ramona Linda Trevino AM To Ramona BetancourtET NRON cc Subject Re TWs LFT changes Have you heard back from anyone of the below Ramona Betancourt PM To Lorraine LindbergET NRON Lindy DonohoET NRON cc Linda TrevinoET NRON David DuffET NRON Subject Re TWs LFT changes Lorraine I talked with Linda Trevino this morning about the LFT waiver from what I could remember we decided to send the form letter for the waiver with the LFT contract so it would be effective for the time frame of the LFT agreement The system should default to no waiver which means the LFT shipper would be scheduled to zero when we call an LFT day at their point If we have the waiver then the flag will be set to yes During scheduling we will schedule their LFT as overrun if capacity at the point was available I do not have a draft waiver form but I can get a copy of one that NNG uses You may want to address these issues from Linda See her questions below Thanks Ramona Forwarded by Ramona
