more excited about an emerging field that promises to smooth out some of the operational kinks Web services or what is sometimes called metaware may well describe the offering of many companies that attract venture financing next year The next stage in the evolution of software the solution would allow companies to transfer business functions to the Internet and off proprietary networks and

rally By Charles Payne founder CEO and principal analyst Wall Street Strategies With Thanksgiving smack dab in the middle of the week it was hard determining what the market wanted to do or where investors heads were at After all the market seemed to be running on empty until the holidayshortened Friday session when the market zoomed Of course sticking with the engine analogy naysayers will say that the market was just rolling downhill benefiting from an abbreviated session that saw lighterthannormal volume I would agree that Fridays session wasnt an applestoapples comparison with regular sessionsit was more like running a soapbox derby racer versus an openwheel Indytype car that the market typically runs during a full session According to those folks that dont believe in the current market rally Fridays results were amusing and even entertaining but of no enduring value It would be easy to write the session off as a dayrace that held little value in the grand scheme of things but that would be a big mistake In the soapbox derby gravity draws the homemade racers down a modest hill The same could have happened to stocks on Friday Instead stocks climbed up that same modest hill Stocks defied both gravity and the naysayers by trading higher and higher as the day went on There is a message in that achievement I think it tells us that when left to its own devices the market wants to rally higher Sure when there are earnings reports economic data brokerage downgrades wars unemployment fear and warnings from corporate America the race becomes akin to handling a highperformance race car and turning corners at miles an hour It isnt as easy as it looks Click here to read more articleaspdocidnd INVESTMENT IDEAS Models of success Surviving Internet players have

reports Investment ideas INVESTMENT IDEAS Its playing long in Peoria Media issues tend to anticipate a recovery but some stocks are already overbought By Charles Payne principal analyst Wall Street Strategies The media group is one that investors should watch very closely over the next several months These stocks are known as early cyclical issues because their share price usually improves long before the broad economy does However other cyclical sectors have actually seen their fortunes turn in anticipation of the economy while media stocks in general have been sluggish Last week the big names in the group were downgraded by Credit Suisse First Boston as much because of internal issues as because of macro conditions Ad sales on television are now estimated to be off by percent while only a few weeks ago most industry observers thought the sales number would be off by percent In fact for the next couple of months it is believed that prime time spots for the networks will decrease by percent Nevertheless if these stocks live up to their reputation and outperform up to nine months before the broad economy improves there could be reason to discount the current bad news and look

Consumers came to the rescue of retailers and individual investors will come to the rescue of the street by Charles Payne founder chief executive officer and principal analyst Wall Street Strategies Last week saw a marked contrast to the previous week as the Northern Alliance went from the Keystone Cops to a liberating rebel force pushing the Taliban back on their heels or on their toes as they scatter to caves and tunnels in the southern part of Afghanistan Wall Street mavens and the media suggested that stocks were pushed higher by the war victories and while I agree that the prospect of a short war is a positive element for the market I believe that the weeks success had some domestic ingredients as well In fact I think the most telling moment of the week came when retail sales figures were released last Wednesday once again beating expectations In the previous week many observers were surprised to see that consumer sentiment as monitored by the Michigan survey came in well above estimates and was quickly dismissed as some type of fluke After last week though I dont think anyone can question the resolve of the American consumer articleaspdocidnd WORD FROM OUR SPONSOR Determine
