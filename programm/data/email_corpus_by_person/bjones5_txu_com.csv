might offer you a little parable One day an enterprising young boy named Bubba decided to start a lemonade stand in front of his house so that he could afford to buy a GI Joe with the kung fu grip He set up a table painted a sign that read Lemonade cents and began to squeeze lemons Bubba discovered that he could squeeze enough lemons for about glasses of lemonade each hour Bubba had a bothersome little five year old brother named Scooter Although annoying to Bubba Scooter loved to do whatever Bubba was doing and decided to set up another lemonade stand right next to his brothers stand Scooter was not as strong as Bubba and could only squeeze enough lemonade for about glasses each hour Scooter also painted a sign that read Lemonade cents Initially the two boys could sell about glasses of lemonade each hour between the two of them but as the weather got hotter they attracted more and more thirsty customers Eventually they were selling about glasses of lemonade each hour As it got hotter and baseball season began the boys grew less interested in their stands and the GI Joe with the kung fu grip was not getting any closer Then Bubba got an idea if he raised his price to cents a glass he would make a lot more money The customers at first would buy their lemonade from Scooter but when he ran out they would buy it from Bubba This worked great for Bubba but Scooter did not like his brother making more money for the same lemonade Because he liked to do whatever his brother was doing and because he also had his mind set on buying a three foot plastic alligator with the remote action chompers and realistic sounds he too raised his price by cents Regardless of the new higher price the customers kept coming Hey this is great the two brothers thought to themselves But then the good times came to a halt Bubbas mom discovered that he was charging cents for a glass of lemonade and she ordered him to drop his price back to cents but not before she bored him about how lemonade had only cost a nickel in her day Interestingly she must have forgotten to tell Scooter to do the same Bubba always suspected that she liked Scooter better anyway So Bubba hatched a new plan If he could get Scooter to sell his lemonade for him he could still receive the higher price the customers were paying Thus Bubba began making lemonade for Scooters stand Bubba kept his stand open but he never had any lemonade to sell Soon a long line set up in front of Bubbas stand all eager to buy out his cheaper lemonade But some of the kids became frustrated and angry when Bubba was not selling any lemonade at his moms ordered price Buzzer the neighborhood snitch told Bubbas mother what he was doing and she was not pleased She told Bubba young man I want you to go out there and sell lemonade for cents to whoever asks for it or else Fearing for his young life and knowing that he could not possibly squeeze enough lemons to make all glasses Bubba made Scooter an offer he could not refuse He told Scooter that he was taking the unsold lemonade from Scooters stand and would pay him only cents Then Bubba could sell Scooters lemonade to the thirsty crowd and still meet the demand while staying out of moms dog house Unfortunately Scooter realized that this was more hassle than he had expected and went inside to play Nintendo leaving Bubba with the angry crowd and not enough lemonade to sell Bubba has now become a pivotal supplier of lemonade Bubbas mom has just intervened in his market with a price adjustment Bubba moves his supply to the unrestrained market Scooters lemonade has just been OOMed Whenever two markets are perfect substitutes for each other market forces will bring the prices into equilibrium through the execution of arbitrage opportunities Yet when the price in one of the two markets is artificially managed this equilibrium cannot exist It would be expected that the market that is price managed will attract more buyers but less suppliers If suppliers are not forced to participate in the price managed market then they will shift their supply to the market without price controls and buyers will have to follow This would mark the end of the price controlled market leaving only one market remaining On the other hand if the price controlled market also can force suppliers to deliver into its market then the buyers would not have to follow the supply In fact in this case more buyers would shift to the price controlled market if it was perceived to deliver lower prices than the free market In this case demand dries up in the free market and suppliers are forced into the price managed market Yet suppliers must be paid for this forced sale and a regulated price is developed to accomplish a fair compensation Thus relieving us all of the complexities of this thing called competition Brad
