our most important sources As you suggest the intent is to use this data along with other available date to generate a price for credit The price will be published externally likely for a fee and as a free service via the web or via automated processes Option appears to be the best solution for us given our desire for as up to date data as possible Stuart is working with the credit team to define additional data elements but the credit score and financial score are likely what we are looking for Alternatively if it is possible to obtain the actual data that is used to generate the score that would allow us to generate our own score in addition to DBs We will need the Global Failure Score as well Currently we are active in Europe as well as the US and expect to move towards Asia and Austrailia over time Hopefully this data is available via DB Connect Another consideration is the term of contract We would likely prefer a longer term contract so that if they decide they dont like what we are doing with the data we cannot be cut off Does it make sense from your perspective to approach DB to be our long term strategic providor of customer data This would likely make their deal

Bryan CT cc Philippe A CT Sally CT Stuart CT Subject Dun Bradstreet Info for Credit Trading I have received preliminary information from DB I think several issuesquestions have been raised that if explored could result in a better solution for the money Option The update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to monthly for a cost of USD through March Option I wasnt sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in If you are particularly interested in the Financial Stress Score and Credit Score for example there are multiple alternatives a Keep quartlery refresh of base data party name etc and refresh scores that are addedchanged on a monthly basis Cost USD per record Note that there are records in the file currently with financial and credit scores making this potentially a very expensive alternative X b Batch or FTP updates of the financial and stress scores can only be provided monthly DB is working on a solution that would provide a weekly update to their customers in a batch or FTP manner but has not committed to when this will be ready Therefore if more timely updates than monthly are desired it is also possible to transactionally access records one at a time using DBs software The cost for this is extremely high at USD per score Option DB Connect Product DB Connect is a tool set of matching software an externally validated reference file credit and marketing information and DB services that enables the most effective integration of customer information and thirdparty information with DB information Only this type of process and information integration capability can facilitate and ensure accurate identification linkage and maintenance of your customers complete relationship In addition DB Connect assures organizations of referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to DB so that the most recent DB information is always transmitted to your organization and updated within your local DB Connect Reference File DB Connect is scalable Cost Typically ranging from Customer Access Module CAM Batch CAM Online Full Information Integrator data With more specifics as to your needs this option should perhaps be pursued QuestionsIssues DB had questions regarding the use of their data and whether Enron customers would be offered this information for a fee or free I explained that I did not feel the data would be offered directly to Enron customers but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available externally via web site etc All pricing above is based upon this understanding If I have not portrayed the usage correctly it will be imperative to get a better understanding before final pricing can be negotiated Are there specific data elements that you are interested in Alternatives may vary by data element Financial Stress Score and Credit Score reference above were explored as an example What is timeframe for needing a solution Financial Stress Score and Credit Score are only available on US companies A comparable measure Global Failure Score the liklihood of default or bankruptcy is available for international companies This rating score however is NOT currently available via a batch or FTP manner This could result in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this score in a batch manner Pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes This is probably negotiable as the data is the same The thought process is that if the repository is used for

interested in Alternatives may vary by data element Financial Stress Score and Credit Score reference above were explored as an example What is timeframe for needing a solution Financial Stress Score and Credit Score are only available on US companies A comparable measure Global Failure Score the liklihood of default or bankruptcy is available for international companies This rating score however is NOT currently available via a batch or FTP manner This could result in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this score in a batch manner Pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes This is probably negotiable as the data is the same The thought process is that if the repository is used for credit or risk decisions DB will see decreased usage and revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments If you would like me to follow up further please give me a call at
