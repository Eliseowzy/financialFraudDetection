CPCFA updates CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKETS u u Friday October u u No u u Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash After a threemonth honeymoon the new California Power Authority is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature looking into its deals the California Energy Commission annoyed with its monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing its plan to sell its power through state contracts Other than skepticism from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan the Power Authority escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and fuel cells at Assembly to Investigate Power Authority from Is the California Power Authority a dangerously outofcontrol state agency or is it the best hope for getting back some state control over electricity supplies The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the Power Authoritys role thus far in carrying out the letter and spirit of SBx in a hearing set for November The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assemblymember Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek the chair of the joint committee and Assembly speaker Bob Hertzberg DVan Nuys Both members were principal authors of the Power Authoritys enabling legislation SBx Legislative staff are questioning the Energy Foundations unpaid role in developing the Power Authoritys requests for bids particularly the RFB for microturbines Only one company Capstone can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy Foundation and staff are looking into potential overlaps between Capstone and the Energy Foundation Political maneuvers are swirling around the Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority Not only elected officials are concerned the staff and heads of other agencies the Power Authority must work with are digging in their collective heels to oppose Power Authority overtures Tom Hannigan director of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed Power Authority board chair David Freemans proposal to have it buy peaker output California Energy Commission members said they are at policy odds with the Power Authoritys siting plans In an October letter to Freeman Hannigan said that the Power Authoritys powerwind and fossil peakersis likely too expensive overblown and not able to respond quickly enough to balancing power needs The letters of intent already approved by the Power Authority could far exceed DWRs ability to absorb that power given the outlook for netshort need Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority power will be via contract not the spot market Selling on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky said Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha The Power Authority is the only agency currently in the position of actually being able to acquire new energy as the states billion bond issue to underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in limbo and the California Independent System Operator is still not creditworthy Still the Power Authority cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic house in order and an Assembly investigation might jeopardize that JA Savage Power Authority RFB Drafts Too Narrow to Grow Market Say Respondents The Power Authority received a remarkably reserved response to its draft request for bids for microturbines fuel cells and photovoltaics but most say the parameters it sets are too restrictive The Power Authority planned to finalize the projects in its October meeting The microturbine maker Capstone is the only company that can comply with the draft RFB in the short term according to Jennifer Rice Capstone vice president of governmental affairs Others involved with the RFB also readily admit that Capstone a known entity in Los Angeles Department of Water Power territory is the only game in town Sempra Energy in its comments to the Power Authority said that it had filed a response simply because it wanted to keep a placeholder to make sure that larger microturbines would not be excluded in future RFBs Turbec which has experience in the European market also questioned the size restriction of microturbines in the RFB noting that its standard unit is KW The RFB as written calls for KW or smaller turbines In the photovoltaics bid process the Sacramento Municipal Utility District said it was dismayed that the Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority was stepping on its territory and that the authority was limiting bids to a turnkey system which SMUD maintains pads the cost Green Mountain also wanted to expand the bid to consider existing installations centralstation plants and power purchase contracts JA S MediaReleasePRpdf
