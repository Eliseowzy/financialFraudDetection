<5084116.1075846175861.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,rob.bradley@enron.com,2000-09-22 04:00:00,Energy Situation and PolicyYour angle is much better for the corporation and a lot of the below might be mastering the obvious but here it is Rob The petroleum natural gas and electricity price situations have a different set of facts but a common demoninatorvery tight infrastructure relative to energy demand Here is a general set of conclusions with a few sound bites The current energy price situation is all about economics It is economics supply and demand Demand has been rising faster than supply with a predictable response This is the bad news for consumers The good news is that there is reason to believe that prices for oil and natural gas are at the top of their commodity price cycle The NYMEX futures market shows a backwardation curve for bothlook in the daily Wall Street Journal in Section C under Futures Prices that usually is around page Look at the settle price for the different energy commodities and the prices after the prompt month October fall over the next months and years except for this winters natural gas price Big oil did not suddenly get big or greedy with petroleum prices any more than big gas has with natural gas Many of the same players were profitmaximizing during the previous price slump The constraint on energy markets is not the resource base but the infrastructure to produce refine and transport supplies Infrastructure constraints have had a cumulative effect of slowing the great engine of market supply reflected siting issues and also low profitability partly the result of rapid implementation of new environmental requirements The solution is to stop taking supply for granted and build more flexibility and incentives in the system to profitably meet everrising demand Energy investment must compete against many New Economy investment opportunities that have potentially high rates of return Oil This is a global market so declining US production is a very small part of the world supply but the real constraint is domestic refining capacity Since operable US refineries have declined from to when refineries closed and only new refineries entered the market National Petroleum Council US Petroleum Refining June p Other refineries have been able to expand to increase overall capacity but capacity utilization has risen rapidly in recent years and is above a tight situation EPA permits to allow further expansion is a major issue to making sure that domestic infrastructure keeps up with demand p A number of proposed requirements to further improve the environmental quality of gasoline has raised profitability questions as well pp The two actions the US can take in the short run to increase crude supplies are to lift the embargo on Iraq and withdraw oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve up to mmbd Liquidating the reserve could be part of a privatization program to get support from the free market community and the proceeds could be used to help low income energy users this winter The days dont get much more rainy than now given that without price controls price and not supply is in question in an emergency A longer run approach must be to encourage domestic and international drilling to make the supply response as elastic as possible to higher prices Alaska activity such as drilling at the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve ANWR would be a major contribution to world supplies On the gasoline side much has been written about boutique fuels where certain environmental requirements are required for certain regions that makes the supplydemand balance very sensitive to interruptions such as refinery downtime or a pipeline closure The key to prevent price spikes for consumers is to not let new environmental requirements outrace technology or infrastructure constraints This discontinuity happened earlier this summer in Chicago for example where gasoline prices rose well above per gallon Electricity This is an infrastructure problem that could be alleviated by a more efficient use of the transmission grid to get power to its highest valued uses California in particular has followed a soft energy path where conservation was substituted for permitting urgency for new power plants The digital age is driving demand growth although many traditional appliances such as refrigerators are using less power General economic growth also means many new appliances traditional and new are being produced and used adding to power demand Natural Gas Natural gas supplies and infrastructure to some degree must catch up to high demand after many years of slumping gas prices and reduced incentive Over Tcf of potential gas reserves is in areas that are off limits to drillingsomething that should be corrected given the advances in drilling technology that make exploration and production much less invasive to surface area than ever before Other public policy drivers should be a continued emphasis on expedited certification for new pipelines and avoiding new short run regulatory fixes Past this winter however gas prices are expected to decline so consumers can lock in long term prices that are below current prices Conclusion Energy supply and infrastructure have been taken for granted for too long It was assumed that low prices would continue despite increasing disincentives to increase supply and infrastructure to meet demand Demand has also increased faster than thought due to economic prosperity and the wealth effect Market forces can correct the imbalance over time without regulatory quick fixes and with reasonable incentives for industry performance Robert L Bradley Jr Director Public Policy Analysis Enron Corp PO Box Room a Smith Street

in recent years and is above a tight situation EPA permits to allow further expansion is a major issue to making sure that domestic infrastructure keeps up with demand p A number of proposed requirements to further improve the environmental quality of gasoline has raised profitability questions as well pp The two actions the US can take in the short run to increase crude supplies are to lift the embargo on Iraq and withdraw oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve up to mmbd Liquidating the reserve could be part of a privatization program to get support from the free market community and the proceeds could be used to help low income energy users this winter The days dont get much more rainy than now given that without price controls price and not supply is in question in an

gallon Electricity This is an infrastructure problem that could be alleviated by a more efficient use of the transmission grid to get power to its highest valued uses California in particular has followed a soft energy path where conservation was substituted for permitting urgency for new power plants The digital age is driving demand growth although many traditional appliances such as

infrastructure to produce refine and transport supplies Infrastructure constraints have had a cumulative effect of slowing the great engine of market supply reflected siting issues and also low profitability partly the result of rapid implementation of new environmental requirements The solution is to stop taking supply for granted and build more flexibility and incentives in the system to profitably meet everrising demand Energy investment must compete against many New Economy investment opportunities that have potentially high rates of return Oil This is a global market so declining

gallon Electricity This is an infrastructure problem that could be alleviated by a more efficient use of the transmission grid to get power to its highest valued uses California in particular has followed a soft energy path where conservation was substituted for permitting urgency for new power plants The digital age is driving demand growth although many traditional appliances such as

drivers should be a continued emphasis on expedited certification for new pipelines and avoiding new short run regulatory fixes Past this winter however gas prices are expected to decline so consumers can lock in long term prices that are below current prices Conclusion Energy supply and infrastructure have been taken for granted for too long It was assumed that low prices would continue despite increasing disincentives to increase supply and infrastructure to meet demand Demand has also increased faster than thought due to economic prosperity and the wealth effect Market forces can correct

care It is about words long tiinewsOpenLetterHealthCarehtml Here is my first draft of a letter to economists for power price caps It is words long so we have some room The tricky thing here is the interplay between retail and wholesale price regulation that is not present in other price control situations In other words the public utility nature of retail prices complicates things a bit so our letter will have to be careful about not losing support from economists who wonder if this is really about a natural monopoly situationat retail at least Maybe instead of price decontrol at retail we can just call for a move toward realtime pricing Comments appreciated Rob Thank you for your assistance Best regards David Lets just continue to use the k Can you email me the letter on health care so I can play off it a bit with my draft on energy price controls Rob Robert L Bradley Jr Director Public Policy Analysis Enron Corp PO Box Room D Smith Street Houston Texas P F Assistant Joan Stransky David Theroux ndepe To ndentorg cc Subject Re Economist Letter PM Dear Rob Thanks for your note At cents per page we would start out by using pages for the mailing to economists sheets per addressee When you add the copying of responses remailing email photocopies copies and much more it adds up pretty fast However if you wish we could allocate the funding in other ways such as for the costs of personalized wordprocessed letters to the economists on our inhouse and rented lists I look forward to speaking with you and your colleagues on Monday Thanks again Best regards David At cents per page this would be pages We have for labor help on this so I assume this is only machine cost When we talk about budget on Monday we can discuss this Rob David Theroux ndepe To ndentorg cc Subject Re Economist Letter AM Dear Rob The photocopying figure is for the thousands of letters and forms to be copied for the mailing as well as the records of those who agree as signatories It is important that we keep an accurate record of each and every piece of communications especially for the signatories In many cases we have found that we will have resend the letters because of bad addresses and from requests of other economists who hear about the Open Letter Hence the photocopying figure is a mixture which will continue throughout the project As for the sponsorship my suggestion is really twofold The funding come from a nonindustry entity not identifiable with Enron so that the project not even have the suggestion of impropriety As with all of our supporters we would also not identify the funder with the project but if asked we could state that no industry support was involved The Open Letter have listed as cosponsors various nonenergy industry related groups including possible consumer labor academic environmental health business and other groups The goal here is to reinforce the fact that the case against price controls is one that is supported by a wide range of people who indeed would suffer enormously from such harmful policies I would be delighted to discuss these and other matters in a conference call on Friday morning or Monday afternoon Please just let me know what might work for you Best regards David David I want to make sure I can defend the budget and had a question The photocopying expense really jumps out What does this entail and could we reduce it by using the equipment at our SF office How many pages are involved in the figure You make a good point on making the sponsorship as broad as possible which would also help us attract money for the media part which I thought was part of the We should try to get up a conference call with some of us from here and you to discuss this further Are you free early Friday afternoon or Monday Rob David Theroux ndepe To ndentorg cc Subject Re Economist Letter AM Dear Rob As promised here is the breakdown of the budget to assemble the Open Letter with signatories BUDGET Assembling snail mail lists of economists Assembling email list of economists Materials Photocopying Postage Mailing costs Telephone Secretarial Administrative Misc TOTAL Media promotional and advertising costs would be additional depending upon what media were selected for targeting In the past we have released the resulting Open Letter through a major media releaseblitz A press conference could be used in doing so with ads to follow where considered appropriate Advertising for past Open Letters has ranged from major newspapers to more targeted political and opinion publications Also with our most recent Open Letter on healthcare price controls we assembled a group of ten other organizations as cosponsors to broaden the credibility and impact of the Open Letter and to engage the support of the leadership and membership of such groups As a result thought should be made as to what diverse groups might be sympathetic In addition the possibility of enlisting the assistance of various industry groups energy etc who although not necessarily listed as cosponsors would enable the Open Letter to reach a significant number of people through their own internal communications systems in order to bolster public support for the Letter We also suggest that the source of the funding be one not identifiable with Enron Please advise me with any questions Best regards David David J Theroux Founder and President The Independent Institute Swan Way Oakland CA Phone Fax Dear David We are interested in proceeding with the open letter project but first need to get in writing the parameters of the project and cost estimates for the administrative part of the project and the publicity buy The latter part would seem to be more of a discretionary cost The two folks that will be working on this from our side are

Libertarian Vision FriendsWe are happy to bring you Issue of the Cato Institutes new technology and telecompolicy newsletter TechKnowledge These periodic commentarieswill featurethe insightsof Cato scholarsonhightech issues in the news While our first issue provides a general overview ofour general philosophical vision subsequent editions will apply this framework to a wide array of specific public policy mattersAn archive of all past editions will also be available on our web site at wwwcatoorgwithin the Telecom Technology subdirectoryWe hope you enjoy these commentaries but if for any reason you do not care to receive them inthe future just let us know Thanks Adam Thierer IMAGE Issue April The Libertarian Vision for Telecom and HighTechnology by Adam Thierer and Wayne Crews The technology and telecommunications sectors of the American economy are increasingly under assault by politicians and regulators at al l levels of government local state federal and international Althou gh the Telecommunications Act of reflected a growing consensus that competition and deregulation would bring tremendous benefits to consumers and entrepreneurs alike the Act not only fell well short of this goal bu t has actually resulted in increased micromanagement of the communications industry Worse yet policymakers show an increasing willingness to extend the misguided regulatory legacy of the past to cover the Internet and othe r emerging technologies within the information services marketplace Policymakers must resist the urge to treat existing and emergi ng markets and technologies as their political playthings Fresh thinking is needed and this thinking should be guided by three simple principles as policymakers consider how the Internet and the hightechnology sector shou ld be governed Principle First Do No Harm Just as this sound principle governs the medical profession so too should such a HighTech Hippocratic Oath guide public policymakers The pace of technological change in this sector makes it almost impossible to establish timely policies that wont be outdate d as soon as they are put into place While both entrepreneurs and industry giants can sometimes move at cyberspeed to avoid rapid technological obsolescence it is apparent that governments and legislatures cannot That s the contrast between Moores Law and Murphys Law Computer and communications firms have been forced to come to terms with t he reality of Moores Law which holds that the computing power do ubles roughly every months while its price falls by an equally dramatic margi n over the same period In other words they have to reinvent the wheel ever y yearandahalf if they want to stay on top of their game However lawmaking is often beset by Murphys Law anything that can go wrong will go wrong Moreover even the most wellintentioned efforts wil l likely take so long to move through the legislative sausage factory that most statutes or regulations will be obsolete or redundant by the time the y finally take effect Put simply Internet time and Washington time are measured by two very different clocks Policymakers must avoid quick fixes and supposedly simple political solutions to the complex problems posed by the realities of the new digital economy Principle Be Patient The second principle policymakers should hee d when considering hightech policies is to exercise patience and regulatory restraint to be willing to wait for the good results they allegedly seek to develop naturally This is not always easy in a town that believes ther e is a shortterm political solution to every problem Many politicians provi de lip service to the benefits of the market and selfregulation but then ac t to subvert the will of companies and consumers by imposing haphazard topdown regulatory solutions and protectionist regulation Policymakers must avoid activism and recognize their own ignorance They should not attempt to impose market structures or determine outcomes Instead they should respect the natural discovery process of the free market and the spontaneous ordering of our fastpaced technological societ y As these markets expand evolve and mature they will exceed any topdown creation of politicians Principle Embrace Change Finally policymakers must embrace technological change and its revolutionary nature Learning to live with change is never easy Firms technologies even entire industry sectors ca n rise and fall in a very short period of time One day CB radio and trac k tapes are the hottest technology in the land the next they are as dated as disco dancing and bellbottoms But sometimes such failure is a good thing Yesterdays industrial giant becomes todays alsoran Whether its IBM in the s or Microsoft in the s no firm or technology can expect to remain king of the hill for long In fact if theres one constant in the Internet wor ld its change The New Economy is characterized by extreme volatility th e ongoing stock market roller coaster techno fads rapid technological obsolescence etc In fact tomorrows Internet is not likely to be the Internet we know today Consequently policymakers must realize that the Internet and the hightech sector will challenge previous policies existing programs older institutions and wellestablished industries Legislators must be willing to change existing structures laws or political norms to accommodate or foster the ongoing expansion of the New Economy While some Old Economy interests may not like the emergence of these new industry sectors and technologies policymakers must not allow older companies to us e old or new laws and regulations as a tool against their new competitors Th e history of communications industry regulation is littered with lamentable tales of one industry sector using the club of regulation to beat their competitors into submission Policymakers must reject such Luddite proposals These simple principles should guide any telecommunications or technology policy debates that arise More specifically these principles can be translated into a more concrete set of commandments for policymakers to follow Any individual or entity should be free to create and offer to the public any technological good or communications service they want whenever they want however they want and on whatever terms they and their customer s find mutually agreeable No individual or entity has a natural inalienable right or entitlemen t to a specific technological good or telecommunications service Free speech rights and the First Amendment are of paramount importance to individual liberty and should be fully honored and protected against government interference Rather than impose administrative rules policymakers should respect private property rights unhindered freedom of contract voluntary negotiations and standardsetting private dispute resolution other common law standards such as the law of trespass and torts and the proper interpretation of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution as a guarantor o f the free flow of interstate commerce The Cato Institutes Tech Knowledge series of commentaries will seek to apply this libertarian framework to the exploding universe of hightechnology policy issues in a consistent and ongoing manner Adam Thierer is the Director of Telecommunications Studies and Wayne Crews the Director of Technology Studies at the Cato

care It is about words long tiinewsOpenLetterHealthCarehtml Here is my first draft of a letter to economists for power price caps It is words long so we have some room The tricky thing here is the interplay between retail and wholesale price regulation that is not present in other price control situations In other words the public utility nature of retail prices complicates things a bit so our letter will have to be careful about not losing support from economists who wonder if this is really about a natural monopoly situationat retail at least Maybe instead of price decontrol at retail we can just call for a move toward realtime pricing Comments appreciated Rob Thank you for your assistance Best regards David Lets just continue to use the k Can you email me the letter on health care so I can play off it a bit with my draft on energy price controls Rob Robert L Bradley Jr Director Public Policy Analysis Enron Corp PO Box Room D Smith Street Houston Texas P F Assistant Joan Stransky David Theroux ndepe To ndentorg cc Subject Re Economist Letter PM Dear Rob Thanks for your note At cents per page we would start out by using pages for the mailing to economists sheets per addressee When you add the copying of responses remailing email photocopies copies and much more it adds up pretty fast However if you wish we could allocate the funding in other ways such as for the costs of personalized wordprocessed letters to the economists on our inhouse and rented lists I look forward to speaking with you and your colleagues on Monday Thanks again Best regards David At cents per page this would be pages We have for labor help on this so I assume this is only machine cost When we talk about budget on Monday we can discuss this Rob David Theroux ndepe To ndentorg cc Subject Re Economist Letter AM Dear Rob The photocopying figure is for the thousands of letters and forms to be copied for the mailing as well as the records of those who agree as signatories It is important that we keep an accurate record of each and every piece of communications especially for the signatories In many cases we have found that we will have resend the letters because of bad addresses and from requests of other economists who hear about the Open Letter Hence the photocopying figure is a mixture which will continue throughout the project As for the sponsorship my suggestion is really twofold The funding come from a nonindustry entity not identifiable with Enron so that the project not even have the suggestion of impropriety As with all of our supporters we would also not identify the funder with the project but if asked we could state that no industry support was involved The Open Letter have listed as cosponsors various nonenergy industry related groups including possible consumer labor academic environmental health business and other groups The goal here is to reinforce the fact that the case against price controls is one that is supported by a wide range of people who indeed would suffer enormously from such harmful policies I would be delighted to discuss these and other matters in a conference call on Friday morning or Monday afternoon Please just let me know what might work for you Best regards David David I want to make sure I can defend the budget and had a question The photocopying expense really jumps out What does this entail and could we reduce it by using the equipment at our SF office How many pages are involved in the figure You make a good point on making the sponsorship as broad as possible which would also help us attract money for the media part which I thought was part of the We should try to get up a conference call with some of us from here and you to discuss this further Are you free early Friday afternoon or Monday Rob David Theroux ndepe To ndentorg cc Subject Re Economist Letter AM Dear Rob As promised here is the breakdown of the budget to assemble the Open Letter with signatories BUDGET Assembling snail mail lists of economists Assembling email list of economists Materials Photocopying Postage Mailing costs Telephone Secretarial Administrative Misc TOTAL Media promotional and advertising costs would be additional depending upon what media were selected for targeting In the past we have released the resulting Open Letter through a major media releaseblitz A press conference could be used in doing so with ads to follow where considered appropriate Advertising for past Open Letters has ranged from major newspapers to more targeted political and opinion publications Also with our most recent Open Letter on healthcare price controls we assembled a group of ten other organizations as cosponsors to broaden the credibility and impact of the Open Letter and to engage the support of the leadership and membership of such groups As a result thought should be made as to what diverse groups might be sympathetic In addition the possibility of enlisting the assistance of various industry groups energy etc who although not necessarily listed as cosponsors would enable the Open Letter to reach a significant number of people through their own internal communications systems in order to bolster public support for the Letter We also suggest that the source of the funding be one not identifiable with Enron Please advise me with any questions Best regards David David J Theroux Founder and President The Independent Institute Swan Way Oakland CA Phone Fax Dear David We are interested in proceeding with the open letter project but first need to get in writing the parameters of the project and cost estimates for the administrative part of the project and the publicity buy The latter part would seem to be more of a discretionary cost The two folks that will be working on this from our side are

Libertarian Vision FriendsWe are happy to bring you Issue of the Cato Institutes new technology and telecompolicy newsletter TechKnowledge These periodic commentarieswill featurethe insightsof Cato scholarsonhightech issues in the news While our first issue provides a general overview ofour general philosophical vision subsequent editions will apply this framework to a wide array of specific public policy mattersAn archive of all past editions will also be available on our web site at wwwcatoorgwithin the Telecom Technology subdirectoryWe hope you enjoy these commentaries but if for any reason you do not care to receive them inthe future just let us know Thanks Adam Thierer IMAGE Issue April The Libertarian Vision for Telecom and HighTechnology by Adam Thierer and Wayne Crews The technology and telecommunications sectors of the American economy are increasingly under assault by politicians and regulators at al l levels of government local state federal and international Althou gh the Telecommunications Act of reflected a growing consensus that competition and deregulation would bring tremendous benefits to consumers and entrepreneurs alike the Act not only fell well short of this goal bu t has actually resulted in increased micromanagement of the communications industry Worse yet policymakers show an increasing willingness to extend the misguided regulatory legacy of the past to cover the Internet and othe r emerging technologies within the information services marketplace Policymakers must resist the urge to treat existing and emergi ng markets and technologies as their political playthings Fresh thinking is needed and this thinking should be guided by three simple principles as policymakers consider how the Internet and the hightechnology sector shou ld be governed Principle First Do No Harm Just as this sound principle governs the medical profession so too should such a HighTech Hippocratic Oath guide public policymakers The pace of technological change in this sector makes it almost impossible to establish timely policies that wont be outdate d as soon as they are put into place While both entrepreneurs and industry giants can sometimes move at cyberspeed to avoid rapid technological obsolescence it is apparent that governments and legislatures cannot That s the contrast between Moores Law and Murphys Law Computer and communications firms have been forced to come to terms with t he reality of Moores Law which holds that the computing power do ubles roughly every months while its price falls by an equally dramatic margi n over the same period In other words they have to reinvent the wheel ever y yearandahalf if they want to stay on top of their game However lawmaking is often beset by Murphys Law anything that can go wrong will go wrong Moreover even the most wellintentioned efforts wil l likely take so long to move through the legislative sausage factory that most statutes or regulations will be obsolete or redundant by the time the y finally take effect Put simply Internet time and Washington time are measured by two very different clocks Policymakers must avoid quick fixes and supposedly simple political solutions to the complex problems posed by the realities of the new digital economy Principle Be Patient The second principle policymakers should hee d when considering hightech policies is to exercise patience and regulatory restraint to be willing to wait for the good results they allegedly seek to develop naturally This is not always easy in a town that believes ther e is a shortterm political solution to every problem Many politicians provi de lip service to the benefits of the market and selfregulation but then ac t to subvert the will of companies and consumers by imposing haphazard topdown regulatory solutions and protectionist regulation Policymakers must avoid activism and recognize their own ignorance They should not attempt to impose market structures or determine outcomes Instead they should respect the natural discovery process of the free market and the spontaneous ordering of our fastpaced technological societ y As these markets expand evolve and mature they will exceed any topdown creation of politicians Principle Embrace Change Finally policymakers must embrace technological change and its revolutionary nature Learning to live with change is never easy Firms technologies even entire industry sectors ca n rise and fall in a very short period of time One day CB radio and trac k tapes are the hottest technology in the land the next they are as dated as disco dancing and bellbottoms But sometimes such failure is a good thing Yesterdays industrial giant becomes todays alsoran Whether its IBM in the s or Microsoft in the s no firm or technology can expect to remain king of the hill for long In fact if theres one constant in the Internet wor ld its change The New Economy is characterized by extreme volatility th e ongoing stock market roller coaster techno fads rapid technological obsolescence etc In fact tomorrows Internet is not likely to be the Internet we know today Consequently policymakers must realize that the Internet and the hightech sector will challenge previous policies existing programs older institutions and wellestablished industries Legislators must be willing to change existing structures laws or political norms to accommodate or foster the ongoing expansion of the New Economy While some Old Economy interests may not like the emergence of these new industry sectors and technologies policymakers must not allow older companies to us e old or new laws and regulations as a tool against their new competitors Th e history of communications industry regulation is littered with lamentable tales of one industry sector using the club of regulation to beat their competitors into submission Policymakers must reject such Luddite proposals These simple principles should guide any telecommunications or technology policy debates that arise More specifically these principles can be translated into a more concrete set of commandments for policymakers to follow Any individual or entity should be free to create and offer to the public any technological good or communications service they want whenever they want however they want and on whatever terms they and their customer s find mutually agreeable No individual or entity has a natural inalienable right or entitlemen t to a specific technological good or telecommunications service Free speech rights and the First Amendment are of paramount importance to individual liberty and should be fully honored and protected against government interference Rather than impose administrative rules policymakers should respect private property rights unhindered freedom of contract voluntary negotiations and standardsetting private dispute resolution other common law standards such as the law of trespass and torts and the proper interpretation of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution as a guarantor o f the free flow of interstate commerce The Cato Institutes Tech Knowledge series of commentaries will seek to apply this libertarian framework to the exploding universe of hightechnology policy issues in a consistent and ongoing manner Adam Thierer is the Director of Telecommunications Studies and Wayne Crews the Director of Technology Studies at the Cato
