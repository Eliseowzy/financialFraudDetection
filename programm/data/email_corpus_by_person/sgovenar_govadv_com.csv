Committee hearing does not work Therefore I have cut and paste the document and attached it to my email INFORMATIONAL HEARING Proposed Rate Agreement Between The California Department Of Water Resources And The California Public Utilities Commission State Capitol Room August pm I Opening Comments Senator Debra Bowen Chairwoman Senate Energy Utilities Communications Committee Senator Bill Morrow ViceChairman Senate Energy Utilities Communications Committee II Panelists Stan Dirks California Department of Water Resources Chris Warner Pacific Gas Electric Gary Schoonyan Southern California Edison Jim Hay San Diego Gas Electric Mike Florio The Utility Reform Network Dave Morse Office of Ratepayer Advocates Dan Carroll California Industrial Users Douglas Heller Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights Bill Julian California Public Utilities Commission BACKGROUND At the peak of Californias electricity crisis two of Californias investorowned utilities were financially unable to purchase electricity on behalf of their customers AB x Keeley Chapter Statutes of authorized the California Department of Water Resources DWR to begin buying power on behalf of the customers of those two utilities and San Diego Gas Electric ratepayers as well as to issue bonds to finance such purchases DWR wasnt authorized to utilize the credit of the state to back those purchases Instead it was authorized to recover the money needed to pay for its electricity purchases through electric rates charged to consumers and to perform is own reasonableness review of those costs The California Public Utilities Commissions CPUC discretion to perform a reasonableness review is rarely abrogated an exception being the costs of collective bargaining agreements but AB x made an exception in this case for two basic reasons First if the CPUC decided to preclude certain power costs from being passed along to ratepayers the effect would be to simply shift those costs from ratepayers to taxpayers Second the goal of a reasonableness review which is to create an incentive to do the best possible job on behalf of the ratepayers could be accomplished through DWR s accountability to ratepayers The theory was the political process would provide the check on DWRs activities much in the same way customers provide a check on the activities of a municipal utility To fulfill its obligations under AB x DWR spent billion through May That money was originally loaned from the General Fund In addition the state obtained a shortterm bank loan of billion to help pay for ongoing electricity purchases That shortterm loan the outstanding debt owed to the General Fund and the difference between actual electricity costs and electricity rates paid to DWR will all be financed through a billion bond offering which was authorized by SB x Burton Chapter Statutes of and may take place as early as October DWR has stated that the bond offering is contingent upon the CPUC taking a number of actions on August one of which is to approve the DWRconstructed Rate Agreement Agreement between DWR and the CPUC The Agreement provides the irrevocable contractual and enforceable assurance that the CPUC will allow DWRs electricity power purchase costs to be recovered in a timely manner Specifically the Agreement Creates a Rate Covenant where the CPUC acknowledges DWRs right to recover its selfdetermined revenue requirement as specified Defines DWRs revenue requirement to include the repayment of the bonds the cost of DWRs electricity procurement including the longterm contracts administrative consulting and legal costs and the cost of demand management programs Requires the CPUC to establish rates to allow recovery of DWRs revenue requirement within days or days as determined by DWR Authorizes DWR to take the CPUC to court to enforcement its provisions DWR has stated the Agreement is an essential element to obtaining the bond financing JP Morgan the senior managing underwriter for the DWR bonds has similarly stated that without the Agreement the bonds wont be viewed as investment grade quality thereby jeopardizing the bond issuance The Agreement is currently being considered by the CPUC A number of parties including small and large consumer groups who will be responsible for paying the rates along with the investorowned utilities have commented on DWRs proposed Agreement and raised a number of concerns The Treasurer has offered some suggested amendments to the Agreement to try and answer some of the concerns without impairing his ability to sell the bonds Issues Questions The Committee May Wish To Consider Must an Agreement be Signed AB x permits the CPUC to enter into a rate agreement with DWR but such an agreement is not required by the statute Given the irrevocable nature of DWRs proposed Agreement is it necessary for the CPUC to approve the agreement or will some other less binding agreement suffice One alternate approach to the Agreement is SB xx Burton which provides a dedicated rate to pay for the bonds and specifies exactly what DWR may include as a part of its costs SB xx passed the Senate on July and is pending at the Assembly desk Public Review DWRs revenue requirement at least as it pertains to power purchase costs bond repayment and associated administrative costs clearly isnt subject to CPUC review or adjustment pursuant to AB x Rather than have an independent party like the CPUC review its efforts AB x envisioned that public review and accountability would motivate DWR to do the best possible job to get the best value possible for ratepayers However the Agreement neither contemplates nor provides for public review which has raised concerns from a number of parties about what costs beyond the cost of buying power DWR is attempting to pass along to ratepayers as a part of the Agreement Scope of Revenue Requirement AB x specifically permits DWR to cover the cost of the bonds power purchases and associated administrative costs The Agreement submitted by DWR to the CPUC for adoption allows DWR to recover much more than those costs including the cost of demand management programs and legal consulting and technical services By including such costs in the Agreement these costs are subject to neither legislative nor public review The demand management programs have historically been the purview of the CPUC The California Independent System Operator has attempted this year to create and administer some of these programs with mixed success However DWR has no background in demand management and no public process for considering and approving such programs Given the lack of a public process and DWRs lack of expertise on demand management programs is it appropriate to allow DWR to include the unknown costs of these programs in the Agreement and Day Review The Agreement requires the CPUC to review and implement rates which allow DWR to recover its revenue requirement within days or days if DWR finds that an expedited change is necessary This is an extremely short window of time for the CPUC to analyze any DWR request and provide for full public review and comment Auditing DWRs revenue requirement will be tens of billions of dollars which will be paid for exclusively by the ratepayers of the states investorowned utilities Despite the fact that billions of dollars will be changing hands the Agreement fails to include an auditing requirement to ensure that appropriate revenues are provided to DWR that surplus revenues are returned to ratepayers and that there is ongoing monitoring of DWRs accounts Court Challenges The purpose of the rate agreement is to facilitate the issuance of the bonds to repay the General Fund and the shortterm loan Its possible that some party may challenge this Agreement or any of the other related CPUC decisions ie establishing the DWR revenue requirement creating a servicing agreement between DWR and the utilities etc in either federal or state court How will such a challenge effect the issuance of the bonds Contract Renegotiation The DWR contracts negotiated at the height of the energy crisis are viewed by some as expensive The state and ratepayers would certainly be better off if those contracts can be renegotiated based upon current circumstances The Agreement binds the CPUC to set rates sufficient for DWR to recover its revenue requirement including the cost of the contracts it has already signed Does the signing of this Agreement diminish DWRs ability or incentive to renegotiate any of the contracts Does it eliminate any incentive DWR has to negotiate the best possible price on any future contracts that it may sign since the costs of those contracts wont be subject to review or adjustment

Senate Energy Committee hearing does not work Therefore I have cut and paste the document and attached it to my email INFORMATIONAL HEARING Proposed Rate Agreement Between The California Department Of Water Resources And The California Public Utilities Commission State Capitol Room August pm I Opening Comments Senator Debra Bowen Chairwoman Senate Energy Utilities Communications Committee Senator Bill Morrow ViceChairman Senate Energy Utilities Communications Committee II Panelists Stan Dirks California Department of Water Resources Chris Warner Pacific Gas Electric Gary Schoonyan Southern California Edison Jim Hay San Diego Gas Electric Mike Florio The Utility Reform Network Dave Morse Office of Ratepayer Advocates Dan Carroll California Industrial Users Douglas Heller Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights Bill Julian California Public Utilities Commission BACKGROUND At the peak of Californias electricity crisis two of Californias investorowned utilities were financially unable to purchase electricity on behalf of their customers AB x Keeley Chapter Statutes of authorized the California Department of Water Resources DWR to begin buying power on behalf of the customers of those two utilities and San Diego Gas Electric ratepayers as well as to issue bonds to finance such purchases DWR wasnt authorized to utilize the credit of the state to back those purchases Instead it was authorized to recover the money needed to pay for its electricity purchases through electric rates charged to consumers and to perform is own reasonableness review of those costs The California Public Utilities Commissions CPUC discretion to perform a reasonableness review is rarely abrogated an exception being the costs of collective bargaining agreements but AB x made an exception in this case for two basic reasons First if the CPUC decided to preclude certain power costs from being passed along to ratepayers the effect would be to simply shift those costs from ratepayers to taxpayers Second the goal of a reasonableness review which is to create an incentive to do the best possible job on behalf of the ratepayers could be accomplished through DWR s accountability to ratepayers The theory was the political process would provide the check on DWRs activities much in the same way customers provide a check on the activities of a municipal utility To fulfill its obligations under AB x DWR spent billion through May That money was originally loaned from the General Fund In addition the state obtained a shortterm bank loan of billion to help pay for ongoing electricity purchases That shortterm loan the outstanding debt owed to the General Fund and the difference between actual electricity costs and electricity rates paid to DWR will all be financed through a billion bond offering which was authorized by SB x Burton Chapter Statutes of and may take place as early as October DWR has stated that the bond offering is contingent upon the CPUC taking a number of actions on August one of which is to approve the DWRconstructed Rate Agreement Agreement between DWR and the CPUC The Agreement provides the irrevocable contractual and enforceable assurance that the CPUC will allow DWRs electricity power purchase costs to be recovered in a timely manner Specifically the Agreement Creates a Rate Covenant where the CPUC acknowledges DWRs right to recover its selfdetermined revenue requirement as specified Defines DWRs revenue requirement to include the repayment of the bonds the cost of DWRs electricity procurement including the longterm contracts administrative consulting and legal costs and the cost of demand management programs Requires the CPUC to establish rates to allow recovery of DWRs revenue requirement within days or days as determined by DWR Authorizes DWR to take the CPUC to court to enforcement its provisions DWR has stated the Agreement is an essential element to obtaining the bond financing JP Morgan the senior managing underwriter for the DWR bonds has similarly stated that without the Agreement the bonds wont be viewed as investment grade quality thereby jeopardizing the bond issuance The Agreement is currently being considered by the CPUC A number of parties including small and large consumer groups who will be responsible for paying the rates along with the investorowned utilities have commented on DWRs proposed Agreement and raised a number of concerns The Treasurer has offered some suggested amendments to the Agreement to try and answer some of the concerns without impairing his ability to sell the bonds Issues Questions The Committee May Wish To Consider Must an Agreement be Signed AB x permits the CPUC to enter into a rate agreement with DWR but such an agreement is not required by the statute Given the irrevocable nature of DWRs proposed Agreement is it necessary for the CPUC to approve the agreement or will some other less binding agreement suffice One alternate approach to the Agreement is SB xx Burton which provides a dedicated rate to pay for the bonds and specifies exactly what DWR may include as a part of its costs SB xx passed the Senate on July and is pending at the Assembly desk Public Review DWRs revenue requirement at least as it pertains to power purchase costs bond repayment and associated administrative costs clearly isnt subject to CPUC review or adjustment pursuant to AB x Rather than have an independent party like the CPUC review its efforts AB x envisioned that public review and accountability would motivate DWR to do the best possible job to get the best value possible for ratepayers However the Agreement neither contemplates nor provides for public review which has raised concerns from a number of parties about what costs beyond the cost of buying power DWR is attempting to pass along to ratepayers as a part of the Agreement Scope of Revenue Requirement AB x specifically permits DWR to cover the cost of the bonds power purchases and associated administrative costs The Agreement submitted by DWR to the CPUC for adoption allows DWR to recover much more than those costs including the cost of demand management programs and legal consulting and technical services By including such costs in the Agreement these costs are subject to neither legislative nor public review The demand management programs have historically been the purview of the CPUC The California Independent System Operator has attempted this year to create and administer some of these programs with mixed success However DWR has no background in demand management and no public process for considering and approving such programs Given the lack of a public process and DWRs lack of expertise on demand management programs is it appropriate to allow DWR to include the unknown costs of these programs in the Agreement and Day Review The Agreement requires the CPUC to review and implement rates which allow DWR to recover its revenue requirement within days or days if DWR finds that an expedited change is necessary This is an extremely short window of time for the CPUC to analyze any DWR request and provide for full public review and comment Auditing DWRs revenue requirement will be tens of billions of dollars which will be paid for exclusively by the ratepayers of the states investorowned utilities Despite the fact that billions of dollars will be changing hands the Agreement fails to include an auditing requirement to ensure that appropriate revenues are provided to DWR that surplus revenues are returned to ratepayers and that there is ongoing monitoring of DWRs accounts Court Challenges The purpose of the rate agreement is to facilitate the issuance of the bonds to repay the General Fund and the shortterm loan Its possible that some party may challenge this Agreement or any of the other related CPUC decisions ie establishing the DWR revenue requirement creating a servicing agreement between DWR and the utilities etc in either federal or state court How will such a challenge effect the issuance of the bonds Contract Renegotiation The DWR contracts negotiated at the height of the energy crisis are viewed by some as expensive The state and ratepayers would certainly be better off if those contracts can be renegotiated based upon current circumstances The Agreement binds the CPUC to set rates sufficient for DWR to recover its revenue requirement including the cost of the contracts it has already signed Does the signing of this Agreement diminish DWRs ability or incentive to renegotiate any of the contracts Does it eliminate any incentive DWR has to negotiate the best possible price on any future contracts that it may sign since the costs of those contracts wont be subject to review or adjustment
