<10053662.1075855781219.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ted.murphy@enron.com,2000-09-08 02:47:00,Four New GraphsWhile I think it makes sense for this type of information to be available that it should be done by Operations and that Eugenio has the skills and knowledge to articulate it well I have some concerns First and foremost the process of creating a standard risk metric belongs to RAC I believe To me this is no different than VAR or the Capital Pricing methodololgy or the RAROC process This has been published without even a review from our group which I think is inappropriate for two reasons we might disagree and as stated above I think we have the final say and we cant quality control it and all the reciepients think that I have Second this has been developed in isolation when in fact we have been doing similar things for the past years We report these to the Board and have published to the Desk heads on a monthly basis returns by trader Clearly there could have been some benefit in each direction if we were told that this was a goal of this group particularly when we fundamentally agree that this group should be doing these things Thirdly it is a little irritating when someone sets up a process in isolation for what may appear to be showtime when my group is spending hours and hours analyzing the output of existing process because the data integrity is so bad double mapping of portfolios books not officialized we have at least attempted to take both parts of the equation Eugenio has chosen to focus on the cool part Now I would be a little less concerned if on almost every day Eugenio wasnt in my morning meeting contributing virtually nothing ie this doesnt appear to be oversight on his part I would prefer to not make a big deal out of this but rather take it as an opportunity to clarify and shift some responsibilities In the big scheme of things it is a move in the right direction Penny for your thoughts Ted Forwarded by Ted MurphyHOUECT on AM Eugenio Perez PM To John J nron John CT Jeffrey A CT Ted CT Mark nron Rick CT Sally CT Shona nron cc Michael E CT Maria Teresa Aguilera nron Jennifer NRO Subject Four New Graphs We have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the DPR Return on VaR ROVAR Curve Shift PL Delta Gamma Sharpe Ratio Risk Return Large Risk Return Small All of these graphs deal with the concept of riskadjusted return The markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics Furthermore Enrons appetite for risk also differs in each market As a result it is difficult to compare returns in absolute terms Therefore the approach of these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk in effect restating return numbers into a standard base how many dollars we earn for every dollar we put at risk For each business unit or commodity group the ROVAR graph shows an average of daily total PL divided by an average of daily VaR Higher ROVARs indicate better performance relative to other business units For each business unit or commodity group there are two bars the dark blue on the left shows ROVAR on a week business day rolling basis and the light blue on the right shows ROVAR on a week business day rolling basis Because of the shorter term the week ROVAR is more sensitive it can be quite high or low and it changes frequently The Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept it shows an average of daily curve shift PL both delta and gamma divided by its standard deviation This Sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by nontrading PL like new deals reserves and so forth Furthermore whereas VaR is a forward looking statistic the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given probability standard deviation is backward looking the actual volatility of our returns over the period This graph also has two bars for every business unit or commodity group a dark brown on the left showing the Sharpe ratio on a week rolling basis and a light brown on the right showing the ratio on a week basis The Curve Shift PL Sharpe Ratio and the ROVAR graphs complement each other well They measure different things but if our PL is composed mostly of curve shift and if our VaR closely predicts curve shift volatility the two statistics should be very close Sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the PL relative to the risk We therefore put together the Risk Return graphs On the vertical axis they show week rolling average PL On the horizontal they show week rolling average VaR The various business units are plotted as points on the graphs These graphs are closely related to the week ROVARs in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is the business units ROVAR average PL average VaR Another way of looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin with the plotted point of a business unit is its ROVAR Books with small risks and returns million are plotted on the Small graph and the rest on the Large These graphs are based on the DPR Database that we built to standardize and capture the information that is reported in the DPR Most but not all of the information in the DPR currently flows from the database As a result we do not have ROVARs or Sharpe Ratios for every business unit As we continue to set up exports into the database we will fill in the missing numbers We will email you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the intranet Please remember to launch the file in Excel instead of using the Lotus Notes viewer The VaR Limit Usage graphs that we

recounted the tail of Barry threatening his bonus and employment for doing exactly what Jeff Skilling told him to do in the previous November Subsequently Richard was moved from his position and Barry promoted If that is dealing with the situation this actually reflects on your credibility If you think that an open communication independent back office message was sent to the back and middle office in Houston and London by virtue of your promotion of Barry twice in months then you are sorely mistaken On February the Arthur Andersen team including Tom Bauer John Sorrells and Jim Brown stated that Barry was an issue in satisfactorily completing the Audit tasks from London I am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here You have dismissed my advice and you need to do what you need to do If the goal is to get me to change my view you have a big hole to dig out of I obviously cant change your point of view I still feel a responsiblity to express the views that I have and others are afraid to surface It is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere Need I go on Let us stop the email wars now They serve no productive purpose Ted Fernley Dyson AM To Ted CT cc Rick CT Sally CT Richard NRON Subject Re Trading Support Operations London Ted We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followedup on specific instances you have mentioned I believe they date back to and prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout and the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has changed since then We are not so Barrydependent We have a team of quality risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary recruiting ground for the RAC team David Port Oliver Gaylard Barrys role is much less handson now and he is not our candidate for the Global Products position this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney The role I suggest for Barry is the high level coordination of the operations team his energy enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan combined with his considerable institutional knowledge making a superior candidate difficult to find Frankly I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth but to address the relationship issue that clearly exists I do not belittle this issue and while I dont think that anyone can point to any prosecutable offences that Barry may have committed in recent history his management style doesnt help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and objective I will say that he has always been open and frank very frank with me indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a different story to tell on Helsinki As an aside I have not been involved in or consulted on the World Tour although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks back I think it is great that Brent Price is involved but we would be happy to contribute staff to this too Regards Fernley To Fernley CT cc Rick Buy Sally CT Subject Re Trading Support Operations London Fernley As we discussed earlier this year I have serious concerns about Barry that I think are both wellfounded and reasonably well documented To be fair I will say that since Q of last year I have not seen any FURTHER prosecutable offenses and he has made some attempts at being more communicative However I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his transformation particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in charge of the office Probably more to the point it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team that is not so Barrydependent Evidence to this effect are the fact that he is your only candidate for the Global Products position that someone from Houston has to be part of the World Tour in Europe Brent Price that your candidates for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David Port or Richard Sage and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve Young Further for the record I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry has a credibility issue Arthur Andersen other Global Products personnell and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me I just happen to be the most vocal Ted Fernley Dyson PM To Richard NRON cc Rick CT John CT Ted CT Sally CT Subject Trading Support Operations London Rick Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support function particularly as it relates to our Global Products business we already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more permanent solution Well nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry understands this as well as anybody If we had a more suitable candidate we would give himher the job I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last months along with the team that we have built around him Im convinced that he can add significant value by drawing the Global Products support functions in to the fold However he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and whilst I do not share Teds views I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate known and trusted within Houston who can instill confidence there Steve Young head of RAC in London may be an interesting option although Im sure he would not be easy to replace In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will be monitoring the situation very closely Regards Fernley

by Operations and that Eugenio has the skills and knowledge to articulate it well I have some concerns First and foremost the process of creating a standard risk metric belongs to RAC I believe To me this is no different than VAR or the Capital Pricing methodololgy or the RAROC process This has been published without even a review from our group which I think is inappropriate for two reasons we might disagree and as stated above I think we have the final say and we cant quality control it and all the reciepients think that I have Second this has been developed in isolation when in fact we have been doing similar things for the past years We report these to the Board and have published to the Desk heads on a monthly basis returns by trader Clearly there could have been some benefit in each direction if we were told that this was a goal of this group particularly when we fundamentally agree that this group should be doing these things Thirdly it is a little irritating when someone sets up a process in isolation for what may appear to be showtime when my group is spending hours and hours analyzing the output of existing process because the data integrity is so bad double mapping of portfolios books not officialized we have at least attempted to take both parts of the equation Eugenio has chosen to focus on the cool part Now I would be a little less concerned if on almost every day Eugenio wasnt in my morning meeting contributing virtually nothing ie this doesnt appear to be oversight on his part I would prefer to not make a big deal out of this but rather take it as an opportunity to clarify and shift some responsibilities In the big scheme of things it is a move in the right direction Penny for your thoughts Ted Forwarded by Ted MurphyHOUECT on AM Eugenio Perez PM To John J nron John CT Jeffrey A CT Ted CT Mark nron Rick CT Sally CT Shona nron cc Michael E CT Maria Teresa Aguilera nron Jennifer NRO Subject Four New Graphs We have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the DPR Return on VaR ROVAR Curve Shift PL Delta Gamma Sharpe Ratio Risk Return Large Risk Return Small All of these graphs deal with the concept of riskadjusted return The markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics Furthermore Enrons appetite for risk also differs in each market As a result it is difficult to compare returns in absolute terms Therefore the approach of these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk in effect restating return numbers into a standard base how many dollars we earn for every dollar we put at risk For each business unit or commodity group the ROVAR graph shows an average of daily total PL divided by an average of daily VaR Higher ROVARs indicate better performance relative to other business units For each business unit or commodity group there are two bars the dark blue on the left shows ROVAR on a week business day rolling basis and the light blue on the right shows ROVAR on a week business day rolling basis Because of the shorter term the week ROVAR is more sensitive it can be quite high or low and it changes frequently The Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept it shows an average of daily curve shift PL both delta and gamma divided by its standard deviation This Sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by nontrading PL like new deals reserves and so forth Furthermore whereas VaR is a forward looking statistic the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given probability standard deviation is backward looking the actual volatility of our returns over the period This graph also has two bars for every business unit or commodity group a dark brown on the left showing the Sharpe ratio on a week rolling basis and a light brown on the right showing the ratio on a week basis The Curve Shift PL Sharpe Ratio and the ROVAR graphs complement each other well They measure different things but if our PL is composed mostly of curve shift and if our VaR closely predicts curve shift volatility the two statistics should be very close Sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the PL relative to the risk We therefore put together the Risk Return graphs On the vertical axis they show week rolling average PL On the horizontal they show week rolling average VaR The various business units are plotted as points on the graphs These graphs are closely related to the week ROVARs in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is the business units ROVAR average PL average VaR Another way of looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin with the plotted point of a business unit is its ROVAR Books with small risks and returns million are plotted on the Small graph and the rest on the Large These graphs are based on the DPR Database that we built to standardize and capture the information that is reported in the DPR Most but not all of the information in the DPR currently flows from the database As a result we do not have ROVARs or Sharpe Ratios for every business unit As we continue to set up exports into the database we will fill in the missing numbers We will email you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the intranet Please remember to launch the file in Excel instead of using the Lotus Notes viewer The VaR Limit Usage graphs that we created last week are already on the web We hope that you find all of these useful Regards Eugenio Perez

recounted the tail of Barry threatening his bonus and employment for doing exactly what Jeff Skilling told him to do in the previous November Subsequently Richard was moved from his position and Barry promoted If that is dealing with the situation this actually reflects on your credibility If you think that an open communication independent back office message was sent to the back and middle office in Houston and London by virtue of your promotion of Barry twice in months then you are sorely mistaken On February the Arthur Andersen team including Tom Bauer John Sorrells and Jim Brown stated that Barry was an issue in satisfactorily completing the Audit tasks from London I am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here You have dismissed my advice and you need to do what you need to do If the goal is to get me to change my view you have a big hole to dig out of I obviously cant change your point of view I still feel a responsiblity to express the views that I have and others are afraid to surface It is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere Need I go on Let us stop the email wars now They serve no productive purpose Ted Fernley Dyson AM To Ted CT cc Rick CT Sally CT Richard NRON Subject Re Trading Support Operations London Ted We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followedup on specific instances you have mentioned I believe they date back to and prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout and the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has changed since then We are not so Barrydependent We have a team of quality risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary recruiting ground for the RAC team David Port Oliver Gaylard Barrys role is much less handson now and he is not our candidate for the Global Products position this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney The role I suggest for Barry is the high level coordination of the operations team his energy enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan combined with his considerable institutional knowledge making a superior candidate difficult to find Frankly I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth but to address the relationship issue that clearly exists I do not belittle this issue and while I dont think that anyone can point to any prosecutable offences that Barry may have committed in recent history his management style doesnt help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and objective I will say that he has always been open and frank very frank with me indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a different story to tell on Helsinki As an aside I have not been involved in or consulted on the World Tour although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks back I think it is great that Brent Price is involved but we would be happy to contribute staff to this too Regards Fernley To Fernley CT cc Rick Buy Sally CT Subject Re Trading Support Operations London Fernley As we discussed earlier this year I have serious concerns about Barry that I think are both wellfounded and reasonably well documented To be fair I will say that since Q of last year I have not seen any FURTHER prosecutable offenses and he has made some attempts at being more communicative However I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his transformation particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in charge of the office Probably more to the point it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team that is not so Barrydependent Evidence to this effect are the fact that he is your only candidate for the Global Products position that someone from Houston has to be part of the World Tour in Europe Brent Price that your candidates for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David Port or Richard Sage and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve Young Further for the record I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry has a credibility issue Arthur Andersen other Global Products personnell and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me I just happen to be the most vocal Ted Fernley Dyson PM To Richard NRON cc Rick CT John CT Ted CT Sally CT Subject Trading Support Operations London Rick Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support function particularly as it relates to our Global Products business we already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more permanent solution Well nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry understands this as well as anybody If we had a more suitable candidate we would give himher the job I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last months along with the team that we have built around him Im convinced that he can add significant value by drawing the Global Products support functions in to the fold However he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and whilst I do not share Teds views I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded I suggest that we

recounted the tail of Barry threatening his bonus and employment for doing exactly what Jeff Skilling told him to do in the previous November Subsequently Richard was moved from his position and Barry promoted If that is dealing with the situation this actually reflects on your credibility If you think that an open communication independent back office message was sent to the back and middle office in Houston and London by virtue of your promotion of Barry twice in months then you are sorely mistaken On February the Arthur Andersen team including Tom Bauer John Sorrells and Jim Brown stated that Barry was an issue in satisfactorily completing the Audit tasks from London I am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here You have dismissed my advice and you need to do what you need to do If the goal is to get me to change my view you have a big hole to dig out of I obviously cant change your point of view I still feel a responsiblity to express the views that I have and others are afraid to surface It is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere Need I go on Let us stop the email wars now They serve no productive purpose Ted Fernley Dyson AM To Ted CT cc Rick CT Sally CT Richard NRON Subject Re Trading Support Operations London Ted We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followedup on specific instances you have mentioned I believe they date back to and prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout and the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has changed since then We are not so Barrydependent We have a team of quality risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary recruiting ground for the RAC team David Port Oliver Gaylard Barrys role is much less handson now and he is not our candidate for the Global Products position this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney The role I suggest for Barry is the high level coordination of the operations team his energy enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan combined with his considerable institutional knowledge making a superior candidate difficult to find Frankly I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth but to address the relationship issue that clearly exists I do not belittle this issue and while I dont think that anyone can point to any prosecutable offences that Barry may have committed in recent history his management style doesnt help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and objective I will say that he has always been open and frank very frank with me indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a different story to tell on Helsinki As an aside I have not been involved in or consulted on the World Tour although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks back I think it is great that Brent Price is involved but we would be happy to contribute staff to this too Regards Fernley To Fernley CT cc Rick Buy Sally CT Subject Re Trading Support Operations London Fernley As we discussed earlier this year I have serious concerns about Barry that I think are both wellfounded and reasonably well documented To be fair I will say that since Q of last year I have not seen any FURTHER prosecutable offenses and he has made some attempts at being more communicative However I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his transformation particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in charge of the office Probably more to the point it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team that is not so Barrydependent Evidence to this effect are the fact that he is your only candidate for the Global Products position that someone from Houston has to be part of the World Tour in Europe Brent Price that your candidates for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David Port or Richard Sage and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve Young Further for the record I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry has a credibility issue Arthur Andersen other Global Products personnell and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me I just happen to be the most vocal Ted Fernley Dyson PM To Richard NRON cc Rick CT John CT Ted CT Sally CT Subject Trading Support Operations London Rick Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support function particularly as it relates to our Global Products business we already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more permanent solution Well nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry understands this as well as anybody If we had a more suitable candidate we would give himher the job I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last months along with the team that we have built around him Im convinced that he can add significant value by drawing the Global Products support functions in to the fold However he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and whilst I do not share Teds views I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate known and trusted within Houston who can instill confidence there Steve Young head of RAC in London may be an interesting option although Im sure he would not be easy to replace In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will be monitoring the situation very closely Regards Fernley

PM To John J nron John CT Jeffrey A CT Ted CT Mark nron Rick CT Sally CT Shona nron cc Michael E CT Maria Teresa Aguilera nron Jennifer NRO Subject Four New Graphs We have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the DPR Return on VaR ROVAR Curve Shift PL Delta Gamma Sharpe Ratio Risk Return Large Risk Return Small All of these graphs deal with the concept of riskadjusted return The markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics Furthermore Enrons appetite for risk also differs in each market As a result it is difficult to compare returns in absolute terms Therefore the approach of these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk in effect restating return numbers into a standard base how many dollars we earn for every dollar we put at risk For each business unit or commodity group the ROVAR graph shows an average of daily total PL divided by an average of daily VaR Higher ROVARs indicate better performance relative to other business units For each business unit or commodity group there are two bars the dark blue on the left shows ROVAR on a week business day rolling basis and the light blue on the right shows ROVAR on a week business day rolling basis Because of the shorter term the week ROVAR is more sensitive it can be quite high or low and it changes frequently The Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept it shows an average of daily curve shift PL both delta and gamma divided by its standard deviation This Sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by nontrading PL like new deals reserves and so forth Furthermore whereas VaR is a forward looking statistic the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given probability standard deviation is backward looking the actual volatility of our returns over the period This graph also has two bars for every business unit or commodity group a dark brown on the left showing the Sharpe ratio on a week rolling basis and a light brown on the right showing the ratio on a week basis The Curve Shift PL Sharpe Ratio and the ROVAR graphs complement each other well They measure different things but if our PL is composed mostly of curve shift and if our VaR closely predicts curve shift volatility the two statistics should be very close Sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the PL relative to the risk We therefore put together the Risk Return graphs On the vertical axis they show week rolling average PL On the horizontal they show week rolling average VaR The various business units are plotted as points on the graphs These graphs are closely related to the week ROVARs in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is the business units ROVAR average PL average VaR Another way of looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin with the plotted point of a business unit is its ROVAR Books with small risks and returns million are plotted on the Small graph and the rest on the Large These graphs are based on the DPR Database that we built to standardize and capture the information that is reported in the DPR Most but not all of the information in the DPR currently flows from the database As a result we do not have ROVARs or Sharpe Ratios for every business unit As we continue to set up exports into the database we will fill in the missing numbers We will email you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the intranet Please remember to launch the file in Excel instead of using the Lotus Notes viewer The VaR Limit Usage graphs that we created last week are already on the web We hope that you find all of these useful Regards Eugenio Perez

player Enrons shipping freight team has signed a year time charter deal for a tonne capesize vessel with Lepta Shipping with a performance guara ntee from Mitsui Co Ltd Tokyo Japan The agreement has a notional val ue of USD million and a marktomarket value of USD million The new a greement gives Enron the option to buy the vessel in Japanese yen after the third year and the time charter period itself can be extended by us by up to an additional four years if required The agreement takes effect from the latter part of when the ship itself currently being manufactured in the Imabari shipyard in Japan or any similar substitute vessel becomes available We are already in the process of onselling the first three yea rs of our time charter above the curve announces Pierre Aury who heads up

Enron Credit Closes Deal with Enrons Shipping Desk On August Enrons shipping desk bought a Digital Bankruptcy Swap DBS from Enron Credit in order to buy protection against a Japanese indust rialtrading counterparty Under the terms of the deal the shipping desk w ill receive payout from Enron Credit when this counterparty becomes insolv ent under Japanese laws and therefore hedges the counterparty risk that th e desk holds when transacting with this Japanese counterparty When the le vel of the shipping desks mark to market profit rises above a certain amou nt the desk will also have the ability to buy additional DBS protection Similarly if the desks contract with the Japanese counterparty terminates earlier the desk can sell back any unused DBS cover to Enron Credit We needed to increase our credit capacity with this counterparty in order to do more deals and then realised that Enron Credit could help us said P ierre Aury who heads up the freight team Another driver was that we felt we needed to set a foot in the DBS market in order to go up the learning cu rve and develop shipping specific DBSs for the near future The hedge bet ween these two commercial groups is another milestone in Enrons internal r isk management With each commercial group having to optimise its capital at risk the services and tools Enron Credit has on offer are an excellent complement

and providin g good but not always heeded advice we need to have the extra firepower and credibility to convert the heathens I think that means more and mor e experienced people and some more

the nonRAC responsibilities will become selfevident as we pu t a greater spotlight on this business and the teams begin to jell Where you and I may disagree is that rather than suggest that we have

September ToBuy Rick Murphy Ted SubjectFW International Credit While I agree with most of your points I would like to stress that the bus iness units still lack the direction and skills necessary for building an i nternational business One of our biggest difficulties has been dealing wi th originators logistics managers and support staff who lack experience i n international trade To have a centralized international credit function we will need a centralized international support staff Trades within high risk countries with limited information is not where we or the market has historically had much risk appetite We have continued t o focus the commercial teams on risk syndication and have proactively appro ached banks on different mechanisms for laying off risks where possible W e need to think about what risk tolerance we are comfortable with accepting to help grow this business I agree we have had the foresight to focus on building the necessary skills to support the business growth but have not done a good job of proactively communicating the credit risks inherent in the international businesses Both Tom Moran and Ken Curry have decent experience in international trade and lcs but have not taken a proactive enough approach with the business teams I have addressed this issue with both of them in the PRC I think John Suttle has done a good job getting up the curve on issues and has take n an active approach on liasing with Sydney banks and hiring the necessary skills sets in Australia As Ted noted the hiring of John Collinette has b een a big plus for the London team Although it is not their day to day re sponsibility both Debbie Brackett and David Hardy have more international trade experience than most in the marketplace Effectively the International Credit Group is well structured with the cred it teams supporting the internatinoal businesses CollinetteNgoSuttle Metals CurryRohauerMaleyNelsonSuttle EIM
