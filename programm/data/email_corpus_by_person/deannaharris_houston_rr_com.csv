Schaudel Sent Friday January PM Subject JanuaryFebruary Calendar Hi Moms I hope everyone had a fun relaxing yeah right and safe holiday season Now its back to reality hee hee Below are the notes from the January meeting we had this past Tuesday Sorry theyre getting out a bit late trying to checkconfirm some items I may have missed some items so let me know if I did Anywho a couple of notes from the meeting Moms With New Babies Congratulations Weve had several new additions this past month and wanted to welcome all the wee little ones to the group Moms Night Out Change Of Venue Due to the circumstances surrounding the bill for the Moms Christmas party it was decided to change the method of payment for dinners We will now individually pay for our own dinnerdrinks including tax and tip Appetizers will be handled the same way you divvy up the cost with those who ate it We will no longer split the bill evenly among everyone We have had several instances where people have ordered lesser valued meals or shared meals with someone and end up paying more then their share We hope this helps out the bill situation so we can all enjoy the entire evening We will have a calculator handy hopefully so everyone can figure out tax and tip accordingly Moms Group Open House We are going to host another Open House inviting all Moms and future Moms to join our group This will be scheduled for Tuesday April nd I will reprint the newsletter article I have shown Dianna Hadley as our wonderful hostess so please give her a call as we plan on having several people bring appetizersdrinks to help It will be at the clubhouse and we ask for Moms to get there around or so to help beautify the place Moms Group Garage Sale We are planning a spring garage sale to coincide with the timing of the Winchester Trails biannual garage sale Im still trying to find out the date of theirs so if anyone knows let me know but were hoping to have it sometime in March or April Please stash your garage sale items in the meantime And if you desperately need the space its currently occuping let me know and I will try to find room for it We will also coordinate with a local charity to pick up the remaining items after the sale We will ask that the charity supply us with the necessary documentation for tax credit as well I will be writing a brief article for the newsletter informing
