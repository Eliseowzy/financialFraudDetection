the defence of Enron and Ken Lay Eric Thode has been very helpful to Peter and it has paid off Also I met with the Progressive Conservative Party Advisory Committee on Energy a committee of nonelected party activists and they are preparing a report endorsing a Fall opening Economics Peter Foster National Post Dumb ol Dubya President Bush and his administration have been taken to task this week by US liberal economists and media sophisticates for being so naive as to suggest that Californias problems wont be solved by price controls That sniffed last Sundays New York Times was just Econ What the President needed was a lesson in Econ presented by the Department of Sarah PolleySci The bad news for Californians is that the shift of power to the democrats in the federal Senate means that price controls become more likely and with them more blackouts Meanwhile the real causes of the California crisis a screwedup deregulation process exacerbated by environmentalist opposition to new state power plants are buried beneath screams about gouging and profiteering and calls for an anticorporate witch hunt The call for price caps has allegedly been boosted by the support of a gang of ten economists including Alfred Kahn the architect of airline deregulation under President Carter But price caps dont work As President Bush noted after meeting California Governor Gray Davis last week Price caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply However according to another liberal economist Princetons Paul Krugman we shouldnt worry about prices because this summer will see blackouts anyway and in the longer term new supplies are on the way via new plants whose arrival will somehow be magically impervious to the prospect of controls Apart from being terrible economics Mr Krugmans attitude is even more objectionable politics At least he is frank about the reasoning behind his support for price caps They are intended to keep money out of the hands of power suppliers Meanwhile he pursues the conceit disproven time and time again that prices can be finetuned by bureaucrats to a level that will be just enough to call forth the right amount of new power Nobody he writes has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power producers from making extraordinarily high profits why should this reduce the power supply Mr Krugman suggests that students who go beyond naive old Econ learn that strictly speaking the standard argument against price controls applies only to competitive industry A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need not cause a shortage indeed price controls on a monopolist can actually lead to higher output This happens when the guy in the top hat throws up his hands and says No point in me holding out for higher prices now that you clever wonks have capped them so just come in and take what you want And which way is it to the airport Professor Krugman does have the good grace to note that Thats not an argument you want to use too often In fact the argument is dangerous nonsense There is no monopoly supplier of energy to California although many state politicians have called for a government takeover of the commanding heights of electricity generation la Lenin Moreover both the economic and political arguments against price caps remain as valid as ever Price spikes require a buyer as well as a seller To hold down prices means that there will be excess demand and that constrained supply will have to be allocated among competing uses by politicians and bureaucrats as it was under the system of natural gas price and transportation controls that brought the United States to crisis back in Meanwhile the impact of such essentially arbitrary controls goes well beyond their immediate skewing of market signals They damage the entire investment climate by raising the spectre of further whimsical intervention and by establishing an effective ceiling to profitability without any corresponding limits to losses except for those with political pull Professor Krugman asserts that generating capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut If that happens we may be sure that Mr Krugman will not be calling for price supports Mr Krugman has been a leader among the baying pack that suggests that Californias problems are all due to market manipulation by big energy suppliers He concludes his display of economic obfuscation with the snide assertion that President Bushs kneejerk ideologue advisers may be so close personally to energy industry executives that they believe that whatever is good for Enron is good for America The presence in California of Enron the worlds largest energy trader has increased supplies to the state but according to Californias attorney general democrat Bill Lockyer Enrons head Kenneth Lay should be sent to jail After all he did raise campaign funds for George Bush And price caps and jail for business executives somehow go together nicely

time to communcicate to you At one point in the meeting Guolding stated that if one industrial or one muni is not ready the market will not open I lost my mind and told him that if that is the case I need to resign as this is a complete waste of time and the market will never open if our CEO is telling the marketplace that one rinkydink muni can hold the entire market opening hostage Without doubt it was the most frustratingdisappointing statement Ive seen GuoldingBaillie make Im sure Houghton was basking in all his glory after that I almost want to write a letter specific to guoulding and ccd to Baillie underlining who ridiculous a position this is for the CEO of the IMO to be taking Original Message From Dadson Aleck Sent Friday June AM To Milnthorp Rob Cc Devries Paul Hemstock Robert Subject Re IMO Meeting Highlights This message came back to me too big I am resending and will send garretts paper separately Rob thanks for the comments from the IMO Board meeting Three points a I am not sure what paper the IMO Board members may be referring to It could be the briefing note re Moving Forward to Market Opening the briefing note Satisfying the Governments Four Guiding Principles or the piece on resource adequacy and pricing that Garrett Tripp prepared and that he and I have been delivering to senior people in the government and elsewhere I attach those three papers in electronic format b The briefing notes above and the material we are preparing for Ken Lay and John Lavorato address the Pickering A point The suggestion that market opening is tied to Pickering A doesnt surprise me but is at odds with what Judy Hubert has been telling stakeholders recently In any event it is commonly thought that the government may think that Pickering A will improve reliability and stabilize prices There may in fact be another reason One of our contacts in the Premiers Office has indicated that Farlinger had told Harris that waiting until the return of Pickering was important from the perspective of OPGs financial position On reflection Garrett Tripp and I think that the concern likely relates to OPGs obligations under the MPMA the concern may be a that OPG may not be able to claim force majeure in respect of the Pickering A delay in order to reduce their rebate obligations definition of force majeure in sec c may not be broad enough or b that even if OPG can claim force majeure the predetermined force majeure replacement cost fixed at the time the MPMA was completed in may be too low to offset the cost to OPG of securing replacement power in In other words OPG is asking the government to intervene in market developmentmarket opening to protect OPG from the terms of the deal maybe from OPGs perspective now a bad deal that OPG made in We should discuss whether Lay and Lavorato can make this point to Harris without compromising our source c With respect to Foward Markets I think we have to distinguish between a binding hour ahead and day ahead market which we may want to have the IMO run assuming that this will facilitate and standardize trading among the Northeast ISOs which is a key objective in the East but anything beyond that they should stay away from I will speak to Rob Hemstock and to the folks in Houston who have been working so hard on the RTO development in the Northeast Did any material get circulated as to what they want to do re forward markets In any event I think we should have a demo of Enron Online in Toronto for the IMO Board and OEB File Market Opening Doc feb doc File Satisfying the Governments Four Guiding Principlesdoc Rob nronXgate PM To Aleck CT Paul CT cc Robert nronXgate Subject IMO Meeting Highlights Some Brief Highlights from the IMO Meeting Market opening without question is now tied to the bringing back of the st pickering unit Govt is clearly not thinking november but the good news is that they have made some statements locking them into may We should have our own intelligence re Pickering return but Boland told me that March was highly probable A number of positive comments re Alecks paper from board members Aleck Im not sure which paper they are referring to can i get a copy Forward Market development IMO wants to make this happen Assessing two candidates I told the IMO that this is not their mandate and that a conditional forward market exists currently and an unconditional forward market will exist when we have a unconditional market opening date I talked re Alberta and indicated that the Alberta sponsored forward market was a joke WattEx and that Enron and others had done s of forward market transactions and the Enron has a visible forward market ACTION We need to develop a position paper on why this should be left to the market place and not some regulated central agency The IMO should be concerned with creating the right environment to promote an efficient forward market ie information disclosure etc OPG would support this position we may want to coauthor the paper I believe HemstockDavies did some work on this already re Alberta Lets discuss further

DadsonTORECT on PM PM To cc Subject Re PACE presentation Aleck Thanks very much for going above and beyond the call of duty to respond to my questions I really appreciate you taking the time to bring me up the learning curve on the complexities of the new market place I will pass your comments on to the rest of the PACE members for their consideration and comment Our report to the Minister will be much better positioned as a result of your efforts Dave PM To cc Subject Re PACE presentation Dave Here is my response to the concerns raised in your email below regarding exports from Ontario to the connected US markets a Remember that the rules and policies under development at the IMO will ensure that load in Ontario will not be cut in order to support export transactions in other words Ontario like most US systems has adopted a native load preference b Remember also that the Ontario market clearing price will be set by the offers and bids within Ontario Scheduled external demand will move us up the bid stack but cannot for instance set the Ontario price by offering lets say MWh The price paid by all internal and external load leaving aside the issue of congestion will be set by the marginal bid in Ontario c Remember also that the scope for economic export transactions will be limited by the impact of the export and wheeling tariff MWh liability for uplift estimated at approximately MWh and the IMO administration fee estimated at MWh plus any wheelingadmin charges applied by the connected markets d Perhaps most importantly remember that congestion costs will be charged in respect of export transactions from the Ontario zone assume low cost to an external intertie zone assume high cost A buyer from the Ontario spot market in the external intertie zone will pay the aggregate of the Ontario market clearing price plus the applicable congestion costs Those congestion costs are calculated as the difference between the Ontario price low cost and the price in the external zone high cost Two featuresimplications of this regime are worth noting First the liability to pay congestion costs will by itself reduce the scope for export transactions of the scope and level you fear Though one can buy transmission rights TRs which will provide a complete hedge against congestion costs Second the congestion costs collected under this regime will after funding the hedge held by the holders of TRs be applied to reduce the revenue requirement of the transmission owners In other words the surplus flows back to reduce the transmission rates that Ontario consumers would otherwise pay Hope this helps you and your colleagues on the PACE Happy to answer any other questions that you may have bridgecom To cc PM Subject Re PACE presentation Aleck Thanks for getting back to me so quickly One point that I forgot to mention was the impact of external demand At the same time that Ontario generators would be trying to sell into higher priced US markets marketers serving US customers would be trying to buy lower cost power in Ontario to ship south As you pointed out both groups would need to take into account the costs of wheeling and exporting the power However if the price differential between the Ontario and US markets was sufficient to offset these costs electricity would flow to the US until the price differential for delivered power was eliminated If demand exceeded supply in the US market by an amount equal to or larger than the US intertie capacity and Ontario was the lowestcost supply alternative the total demand for Ontario power from native and foreign sources could exceed Ontario supply under extreme weather as shown in the table below Under these conditions the price in Ontario would be bid up by the US market imbalance Alberta would have had a similar problem with its BC intertie if it hadnt decoupled its market pricing so that the market clearing price for Albertans is set only by local demand A second and perhaps more critical issue is the technical capability of the Ontario market Despite the rosy reports from the IMO some market participants have experienced IMO failures during testing and most MEUs have indicated that they cannot be ready for a November opening Many people feel that the risk of system failure must be eliminated or reduced to a manageable insignificant level before the market can be opened I would appreciate any additional thoughts you care to share on these points Thanks Dave Potential Market Conditions MW Winter Peak Capacity Winter Peak Demand Surplus Supply in Ontario Intertie Capacity Out of Ontario NY Interface Michigan Interface Minnesota Into Ontario Quebec Manitoba SurplusShortfall Net SurplusShortfall Extreme Weather Forecast AleckDadson enroncom To cc Subject Re PACE presentation PM David here are some observations in response to your questions a You are correct that we would expect Ontariobased generators to pursue economic export opportunities in the connected US markets but we stress that the economics of such exports will be affected not only by the comparative generation costs but also the cost of Hydro Ones export and wheeling tariff the IMO uplift and related charges charged to all load including exports transmission costs in the connected market and any congestion costs arising in the event that the intertie between Ontario and the connected market is congested Everything else being equal this means that on average power will trade within Ontario at a discount to prices in the U S connected markets b With respect to volatility it has to be conceded that electricity is the most volatile of commodities Having said that the period of most serious volatility is the summer months Moreover we think it can be fairly said that volatility and price swings are moderating in the Eastern Interconnect largely as a consequence of the decrease in fuel costs ie natural gas prices and extensive new generation build PIRA estimates that in Summer the year to year increase in available generation resources in the Eastern Interconnect is about MW This all adds up to increased price stability Again my colleague Garrett Tripp and I would be ready to meet with your group at any time to go over these questions and our analysis in more detail Give me a call if you would like to meet to discuss these points Regards Aleck bridgecom To cc PM Subject Re PACE presentation Thanks for the report It helped to validate the PACE conclusion that there is sufficient supply to open the market without precipitating another California The report mentions that imports would not set the MCP in Ontario and that energy savings would be possible even if peak market demand was met by imports while in another section it concludes that Ontario could rely on higherpriced imports to meet demand The first two points seem to contradict the results from the IMO test runs which indicate that the US markets will set the clearing price in Ontario percent of the time putting upward pressure on electricity prices in our market If prices are higher in the adjacent markets Ontario generators can be expected to export power to the more lucrative markets rather than bidding into the Ontario market resulting in higher prices for Ontario since prices are determined on the margin Price volatility and extreme price swings were also identified as concerns by MEUs Were any of these concerns addressed in your presentation and are there any comments you can share

NRON cc Garrett NRON Paul NRON Subject Re Market Opening With respect to point in your memo my sense is that the counterparty would have to be either OPG or OEFC In my view the concept would notcould not go forward and be implemented unless it had the support of OPG The question we should talk through is how do we best try to get that support from OPG With respect to point I think we should be careful about being too encouraged by Wilsons Purchases comments to LayLavorato on June that if positive reports are delivered by the IMO and OEB in September the govt will be hard pressed not to move forward My concern is that Wilson and Purchase may feel comfortable saying this precisely because they are expecting a negative report from the OEB or at least one that they can interpret as being negative I agree with you that the likelihood of the IMO delivering a positive report is very good The likelihood of a positive report from the OEB is far less certain The key issues at the OEBretail level are EBT LDC access to the data they need from HydroOne completion of LDC CIS systems the govts interest in an industry resolution of customer duplications prior to market opening in order to avoid mass confusion in the initial period of the market the state of customer education and a contingency plan to accommodate those who are not ready with respect to EBT I think the best we can do is get onside quickly with our EBT hub of choice and work with them on perceived difficulties with LDCs etc Ellis Marryott and I are going to make a recommendation to Paul next week on our preferred EBT hub with respect to the info from HydroOne I have already raised this issue with the OEB and the IMO The OEB and the IMO subsequently met with HydroOne and the MEA in an effort to resolve this issue My understanding until yesterdays discussion with Conway was that the issue was resolved and the information was now flowing to the LDCs Paul Garrett and I are meeting senior HydroOne execs including Rod Taylor on Monday re resource adequacy issues and we can press this with them as well with respect to the CIS issue there is not much we can do since most LDCs already have a CIS vendor but my understanding is that at least one CIS vendor has backed out of its commitments to a number of LDCs recently per David MacFadden and perhaps we can get a vendor to move in quickly to fill that gap I will raise this with Marryott to see what may be feasible at this stage with respect to the customer duplication issue I have already met with the senior people at Direct last week to discuss this issue with them and to propose a resolution that would see the retailers involved retaining a third party such as EY to assess the degree of overlap and whether there was an acceptable solution to any problem Direct is convinced that the degree of duplication is not high Direct is talking to Onsource and Toronto about this I am checking with our staff in the UK about whether there was a similar issue when the UK market opened and if so how it was resolved with respect to customer education I and Dick Perdue Directs advisor have contacted TransAlta OPG HydroOne Onsource Enersource and Toronto about funding a Province wide consumer education initiative over the summer We are meeting next week to discuss this idea further This could require a financial commitment from Enron of up to with respect to the contingency plan to deal with those LDCs who are not ready the OEB is already on side in recognizing the need for a contingency plan it will likely be very simple the IMO would send a bill to the LDC each month and the LDC would bill customers at some fixed rate with a deferral account The key issue will be how many LDCs in terms of numbers and size are not ready and what is the minimum number of LDCs that the OEBgovt is looking for to be ready This is an issue we will have to talk to the MEST about as well as the OEB since ultimately the decision of whether enough LDCs are ready will be a political one These are the OEBretail focussed things we are doing On the larger political front I have several ideas about some things I would like to do that I can discuss with you and Paul Rob nronXgate AM To Paul CT Garrett CT cc Aleck CT Subject Market Opening GarrettPaul Can you guys work with the North East desk to price out a MW option at the New YorkOntario intertie as an insurance policy for the Ontario government re market opening You will recall that this was something we had suggested a while back and didnt receive much support However following Lavoratos meeting with Harris Lavo is adamant that we send a term sheet to Harris directly outlining both an call option structure and a swap structure Second it is quite apparant to me that everything hinges on the September readiness report If its favorable I think there is a good chance of a fall market opening With that said however we are in the hands of the IMO and the OEB Im comfortable that we can

nronXGate cc Subject FYI an article about California and Ken Lay by one of Peter Fosters colleagues June Priggish and piggish in California Mark Steyn National Post A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month It swept in May but no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the islands radio link to the outside world The storm blew sheep into the chilly South Atlantic killed many cattle damaged every single home on the island demolished the hospital and community centre blew the roof off the radio station and wrecked the Albatross the only pub in the only village Edinburgh of the Seven Seas For a week after the storm the entire island was without electricity And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it Not the islands colonial masters in London Not the Governor who doesnt actually reside there but prefers to live miles away on St Helena Tristan da Cunhas nearest neighbour St Helena is Manhattan to Tristans Weehawken New Jersey Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa Tristan da Cunha is the worlds most isolated human settlement Its contact with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British supply vessel plus the occasional cruise ship which anchors offshore when its safe to do so Now thats living off the grid The East India Company won a charter to settle Tristan in and its been a Crown colony since populated by a handful of families from the Scottish borders There are just seven surnames on the island Glass Green Hagan Lavarello Repetto Rogers and Swain All of them turned up in London years ago when the islands volcano erupted and they were evacuated to the Imperial capital In the roaring traffics boom midst the glitter of one of the worlds great cities the islanders voted to return home though even getting there was tricky as their landing dock was covered in lava Today the colony is virtually selfsufficient in food and has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists London has offered o to repair the communications equipment and pay for a new hospital You can build a hospital for under quid Amazing Otherwise the islanders are just doing what they usually do making the best of things While theyre waiting for the new hospital theyve arranged for a South African fishing vessel to ferry out a secondhand Xray machine when it sails next week Now consider by way of contrast the inhabitants of what George W Bush amusingly calls the great state of California Once upon a time California was like they say of Tristan da Cunha the furthest thing at least in terms of the North American continent Today with a population the size of Canadas its one of the worlds largest economies the home base of Americas biggest industry entertainment But inside many a studio vicepresident is a Tristan da Cunha islander trying to get out Deep in their hearts assuming for the purposes of discussion that studio vicepresidents have hearts they share the same rugged virtues as the Tristanians though they prefer something a little better than a hospital and theyve no desire to scrape a living from catching crawfish but if the pool boy wants to have a go up the deep end hes welcome to try And therein lies the contradiction Californias selfinflicted energy crisis has exposed the preposterousness of poseurconservationism in a booming economy Which state has the most rigorous conservation program California Which has the lowest per capita electricity consumption California And which state is panicking at the prospect of a summer of rolling blackouts By now impeccably progressive California should have learned the hard way that conservation is not a viable policy for a nonstagnant economy Instead a rolling blackout here a rolling blackout there and theyre running around like headless chickens Governor Gray Davis is lashing out at everyone in sight Bush and Cheney are irresponsible the power generators are unconscionable no wait theyre snakes and robber barons And how do you treat unconscionable robber snakes like Ken Lay CEO of Enron Corp I would love said Bill Lockyer Californias AttorneyGeneral to personally escort Lay to an x cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey As the states AttorneyGeneral Mr Lockyer cannot summarily sentence citizens to anal rape but no doubt once the guys convicted he can make some quiet recommendations as to appropriate cell mates Fortunately for Mr Lay as chief exec of the worlds largest energy trader he doesnt live in California he lives in Texas Indeed very few of the folks the State of California would like to sic Spike on are within their jurisdiction Doubtless the taxpayers of British Columbia whose BC Hydro has been living high off the hog on Californias woes could also use a little light buggery but I cant see a Canadian court approving extradition Nevertheless in a state thats overregulated bans new power plants and is addicted to price caps Mr Lockyer has ingeniously managed to come up with yet another disincentive for anybody in the energy business to relocate to Lalaland California bought into the softeco Sierra Club illusion that somehow one could be a conservationist with no consequences for ones economic wellbeing To put it in terms Californians can understand Suppose you build a house out in the desert But you dont want to buy a car because thats bad for the environment isnt it So instead every morning you call a taxicab in the city to drive out pick you up and take you into the office Not only does it have no environmental benefit but theres no point bitching and whining because the driver charges you a fare that bears no relation to the cost of gas Yet thats what Governor Davis and the Anal Attorney are demanding price caps Through its own incompetence California is wholly dependent on energy generators and distributors from other jurisdictions But it expects those companies to forgo the interests of their own stockholders and service California ie Hollywood and Silicon Valley as an act of public welfare A profit is swinelike piggish and totally unreasonable says Medea Benjamin of the California human rights group Global Exchange She may have a point but if Californias going to institute price caps they might like to start closer to home After all if Enrons board members dont really need those big salaries do Paramounts or Universals I mean sure Ken Lay has an easy job but how difficult is it for an exec honcho in Century City to sit at a desk and greenlight another John Travolta flop every couple of months I mean surely the guy could do the job on oh a year And thatd be good for conservation cause hed have to give up the Merc and the Cherokee and the LearJet and take the bus And how about Travolta Instead of million per picture maybe he could get by on just two or three and the remaining million could be put into those renewable energy projects hes so keen on I mean a million salary isnt just swinelike its piggish right Since its entry into the Union California has had what we thcentury imperialists call responsible government Tristan da Cunha doesnt Yet its community leaders are behaving far more maturely and responsibly than Californias Gray Davis is acting not like the elected Governor of an American state but the appointed Governor of a Crown colony feverishly cabling head office to send somebody out to rescue him Youre on your own man And if California conservationists find rolling blackouts too onerous they should try spending a week in the dark cut off from the outside world and knowing that even when the radio starts working again its going to take months for the secondhand Xray machine to arrive Back

ago I know that Foster spent some time on the phone with Steve and Mark before writing the article Forwarded by Aleck DadsonTORECT on AM Dan Dorland AM To Paul CT Jan CT Jeff CT Dave CT Aleck CT Garrett CT cc Subject Economics Economics Peter Foster National Post Dumb ol Dubya President Bush and his administration have been taken to task this week by US liberal economists and media sophisticates for being so naive as to suggest that Californias problems wont be solved by price controls That sniffed last Sundays New York Times was just Econ What the President needed was a lesson in Econ presented by the Department of Sarah PolleySci The bad news for Californians is that the shift of power to the democrats in the federal Senate means that price controls become more likely and with them more blackouts Meanwhile the real causes of the California crisis a screwedup deregulation process exacerbated by environmentalist opposition to new state power plants are buried beneath screams about gouging and profiteering and calls for an anticorporate witch hunt The call for price caps has allegedly been boosted by the support of a gang of ten economists including Alfred Kahn the architect of airline deregulation under President Carter But price caps dont work As President Bush noted after meeting California Governor Gray Davis last week Price caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply However according to another liberal economist Princetons Paul Krugman we shouldnt worry about prices because this summer will see blackouts anyway and in the longer term new supplies are on the way via new plants whose arrival will somehow be magically impervious to the prospect of controls Apart from being terrible economics Mr Krugmans attitude is even more objectionable politics At least he is frank about the reasoning behind his support for price caps They are intended to keep money out of the hands of power suppliers Meanwhile he pursues the conceit disproven time and time again that prices can be finetuned by bureaucrats to a level that will be just enough to call forth the right amount of new power Nobody he writes has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power producers from making extraordinarily high profits why should this reduce the power supply Mr Krugman suggests that students who go beyond naive old Econ learn that strictly speaking the standard argument against price controls applies only to competitive industry A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need not cause a shortage indeed price controls on a monopolist can actually lead to higher output This happens when the guy in the top hat throws up his hands and says No point in me holding out for higher prices now that you clever wonks have capped them so just come in and take what you want And which way is it to the airport Professor Krugman does have the good grace to note that Thats not an argument you want to use too often In fact the argument is dangerous nonsense There is no monopoly supplier of energy to California although many state politicians have called for a government takeover of the commanding heights of electricity generation la Lenin Moreover both the economic and political arguments against price caps remain as valid as ever Price spikes require a buyer as well as a seller To hold down prices means that there will be excess demand and that constrained supply will have to be allocated among competing uses by politicians and bureaucrats as it was under the system of natural gas price and transportation controls that brought the United States to crisis back in Meanwhile the impact of such essentially arbitrary controls goes well beyond their immediate skewing of market signals They damage the entire investment climate by raising the spectre of further whimsical intervention and by establishing an effective ceiling to profitability without any corresponding limits to losses except for those with political pull Professor Krugman asserts that generating capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut If that happens we may be sure that Mr Krugman will not be calling for price supports Mr Krugman has been a leader among the baying pack that suggests that Californias problems are all due to market manipulation by big energy suppliers He concludes his display of economic obfuscation with the snide assertion that President Bushs kneejerk ideologue advisers may be so close personally to energy industry executives that they believe that whatever is good for Enron is good for America The presence in California of Enron the worlds largest energy trader has increased supplies to the state but according to Californias attorney general democrat Bill Lockyer Enrons head Kenneth Lay should be sent to jail After all he did raise campaign funds for George Bush And price caps and jail for business executives somehow go together nicely

nronXGate cc Subject FYI an article about California and Ken Lay by one of Peter Fosters colleagues June Priggish and piggish in California Mark Steyn National Post A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month It swept in May but no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the islands radio link to the outside world The storm blew sheep into the chilly South Atlantic killed many cattle damaged every single home on the island demolished the hospital and community centre blew the roof off the radio station and wrecked the Albatross the only pub in the only village Edinburgh of the Seven Seas For a week after the storm the entire island was without electricity And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it Not the islands colonial masters in London Not the Governor who doesnt actually reside there but prefers to live miles away on St Helena Tristan da Cunhas nearest neighbour St Helena is Manhattan to Tristans Weehawken New Jersey Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa Tristan da Cunha is the worlds most isolated human settlement Its contact with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British supply vessel plus the occasional cruise ship which anchors offshore when its safe to do so Now thats living off the grid The East India Company won a charter to settle Tristan in and its been a Crown colony since populated by a handful of families from the Scottish borders There are just seven surnames on the island Glass Green Hagan Lavarello Repetto Rogers and Swain All of them turned up in London years ago when the islands volcano erupted and they were evacuated to the Imperial capital In the roaring traffics boom midst the glitter of one of the worlds great cities the islanders voted to return home though even getting there was tricky as their landing dock was covered in lava Today the colony is virtually selfsufficient in food and has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists London has offered o to repair the communications equipment and pay for a new hospital You can build a hospital for under quid Amazing Otherwise the islanders are just doing what they usually do making the best of things While theyre waiting for the new hospital theyve arranged for a South African fishing vessel to ferry out a secondhand Xray machine when it sails next week Now consider by way of contrast the inhabitants of what George W Bush amusingly calls the great state of California Once upon a time California was like they say of Tristan da Cunha the furthest thing at least in terms of the North American continent Today with a population the size of Canadas its one of the worlds largest economies the home base of Americas biggest industry entertainment But inside many a studio vicepresident is a Tristan da Cunha islander trying to get out Deep in their hearts assuming for the purposes of discussion that studio vicepresidents have hearts they share the same rugged virtues as the Tristanians though they prefer something a little better than a hospital and theyve no desire to scrape a living from catching crawfish but if the pool boy wants to have a go up the deep end hes welcome to try And therein lies the contradiction Californias selfinflicted energy crisis has exposed the preposterousness of poseurconservationism in a booming economy Which state has the most rigorous conservation program California Which has the lowest per capita electricity consumption California And which state is panicking at the prospect of a summer of rolling blackouts By now impeccably progressive California should have learned the hard way that conservation is not a viable policy for a nonstagnant economy Instead a rolling blackout here a rolling blackout there and theyre running around like headless chickens Governor Gray Davis is lashing out at everyone in sight Bush and Cheney are irresponsible the power generators are unconscionable no wait theyre snakes and robber barons And how do you treat unconscionable robber snakes like Ken Lay CEO of Enron Corp I would love said Bill Lockyer Californias AttorneyGeneral to personally escort Lay to an x cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey As the states AttorneyGeneral Mr Lockyer cannot summarily sentence citizens to anal rape but no doubt once the guys convicted he can make some quiet recommendations as to appropriate cell mates Fortunately for Mr Lay as chief exec of the worlds largest energy trader he doesnt live in California he lives in Texas Indeed very few of the folks the State of California would like to sic Spike on are within their jurisdiction Doubtless the taxpayers of British Columbia whose BC Hydro has been living high off the hog on Californias woes could also use a little light buggery but I cant see a Canadian court approving extradition Nevertheless in a state thats overregulated bans new power plants and is addicted to price caps Mr Lockyer has ingeniously managed to come up with yet another disincentive for anybody in the energy business to relocate to Lalaland California bought into the softeco Sierra Club illusion that somehow one could be a conservationist with no consequences for ones economic wellbeing To put it in terms Californians can understand Suppose you build a house out in the desert But you dont want to buy a car because thats bad for the environment isnt it So instead every morning you call a taxicab in the city to drive out pick you up and take you into the office Not only does it have no environmental benefit but theres no point bitching and whining because the driver charges you a fare that bears no relation to the cost of gas Yet thats what Governor Davis and the Anal Attorney are demanding price caps Through its own incompetence California is wholly dependent on energy generators and distributors from other jurisdictions But it expects those companies to forgo the interests of their own stockholders and service California ie Hollywood and Silicon Valley as an act of public welfare A profit is swinelike piggish and totally unreasonable says Medea Benjamin of the California human rights group Global Exchange She may have a point but if Californias going to institute price caps they might like to start closer to home After all if Enrons board members dont really need those big salaries do Paramounts or Universals I mean sure Ken Lay has an easy job but how difficult is it for an exec honcho in Century City to sit at a desk and greenlight another John Travolta flop every couple of months I mean surely the guy could do the job on oh a year And thatd be good for conservation cause hed have to give up the Merc and the Cherokee and the LearJet and take the bus And how about Travolta Instead of million per picture maybe he could get by on just two or three and the remaining million could be put into those renewable energy projects hes so keen on I mean a million salary isnt just swinelike its piggish right Since its entry into the Union California has had what we thcentury imperialists call responsible government Tristan da Cunha doesnt Yet its community leaders are behaving far more maturely and responsibly than Californias Gray Davis is acting not like the elected Governor of an American state but the appointed Governor of a Crown colony feverishly cabling head office to send somebody out to rescue him Youre on your own man And if California conservationists find rolling blackouts too onerous they should try spending a week in the dark cut off from the outside world and knowing that even when the radio starts working again its going to take months for the secondhand Xray machine to arrive Back

ago I know that Foster spent some time on the phone with Steve and Mark before writing the article Forwarded by Aleck DadsonTORECT on AM Dan Dorland AM To Paul CT Jan CT Jeff CT Dave CT Aleck CT Garrett CT cc Subject Economics Economics Peter Foster National Post Dumb ol Dubya President Bush and his administration have been taken to task this week by US liberal economists and media sophisticates for being so naive as to suggest that Californias problems wont be solved by price controls That sniffed last Sundays New York Times was just Econ What the President needed was a lesson in Econ presented by the Department of Sarah PolleySci The bad news for Californians is that the shift of power to the democrats in the federal Senate means that price controls become more likely and with them more blackouts Meanwhile the real causes of the California crisis a screwedup deregulation process exacerbated by environmentalist opposition to new state power plants are buried beneath screams about gouging and profiteering and calls for an anticorporate witch hunt The call for price caps has allegedly been boosted by the support of a gang of ten economists including Alfred Kahn the architect of airline deregulation under President Carter But price caps dont work As President Bush noted after meeting California Governor Gray Davis last week Price caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply However according to another liberal economist Princetons Paul Krugman we shouldnt worry about prices because this summer will see blackouts anyway and in the longer term new supplies are on the way via new plants whose arrival will somehow be magically impervious to the prospect of controls Apart from being terrible economics Mr Krugmans attitude is even more objectionable politics At least he is frank about the reasoning behind his support for price caps They are intended to keep money out of the hands of power suppliers Meanwhile he pursues the conceit disproven time and time again that prices can be finetuned by bureaucrats to a level that will be just enough to call forth the right amount of new power Nobody he writes has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power producers from making extraordinarily high profits why should this reduce the power supply Mr Krugman suggests that students who go beyond naive old Econ learn that strictly speaking the standard argument against price controls applies only to competitive industry A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need not cause a shortage indeed price controls on a monopolist can actually lead to higher output This happens when the guy in the top hat throws up his hands and says No point in me holding out for higher prices now that you clever wonks have capped them so just come in and take what you want And which way is it to the airport Professor Krugman does have the good grace to note that Thats not an argument you want to use too often In fact the argument is dangerous nonsense There is no monopoly supplier of energy to California although many state politicians have called for a government takeover of the commanding heights of electricity generation la Lenin Moreover both the economic and political arguments against price caps remain as valid as ever Price spikes require a buyer as well as a seller To hold down prices means that there will be excess demand and that constrained supply will have to be allocated among competing uses by politicians and bureaucrats as it was under the system of natural gas price and transportation controls that brought the United States to crisis back in Meanwhile the impact of such essentially arbitrary controls goes well beyond their immediate skewing of market signals They damage the entire investment climate by raising the spectre of further whimsical intervention and by establishing an effective ceiling to profitability without any corresponding limits to losses except for those with political pull Professor Krugman asserts that generating capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut If that happens we may be sure that Mr Krugman will not be calling for price supports Mr Krugman has been a leader among the baying pack that suggests that Californias problems are all due to market manipulation by big energy suppliers He concludes his display of economic obfuscation with the snide assertion that President Bushs kneejerk ideologue advisers may be so close personally to energy industry executives that they believe that whatever is good for Enron is good for America The presence in California of Enron the worlds largest energy trader has increased supplies to the state but according to Californias attorney general democrat Bill Lockyer Enrons head Kenneth Lay should be sent to jail After all he did raise campaign funds for George Bush And price caps and jail for business executives somehow go together nicely

NRON cc Garrett NRON Paul NRON Subject Re Market Opening With respect to point in your memo my sense is that the counterparty would have to be either OPG or OEFC In my view the concept would notcould not go forward and be implemented unless it had the support of OPG The question we should talk through is how do we best try to get that support from OPG With respect to point I think we should be careful about being too encouraged by Wilsons Purchases comments to LayLavorato on June that if positive reports are delivered by the IMO and OEB in September the govt will be hard pressed not to move forward My concern is that Wilson and Purchase may feel comfortable saying this precisely because they are expecting a negative report from the OEB or at least one that they can interpret as being negative I agree with you that the likelihood of the IMO delivering a positive report is very good The likelihood of a positive report from the OEB is far less certain The key issues at the OEBretail level are EBT LDC access to the data they need from HydroOne completion of LDC CIS systems the govts interest in an industry resolution of customer duplications prior to market opening in order to avoid mass confusion in the initial period of the market the state of customer education and a contingency plan to accommodate those who are not ready with respect to EBT I think the best we can do is get onside quickly with our EBT hub of choice and work with them on perceived difficulties with LDCs etc Ellis Marryott and I are going to make a recommendation to Paul next week on our preferred EBT hub with respect to the info from HydroOne I have already raised this issue with the OEB and the IMO The OEB and the IMO subsequently met with HydroOne and the MEA in an effort to resolve this issue My understanding until yesterdays discussion with Conway was that the issue was resolved and the information was now flowing to the LDCs Paul Garrett and I are meeting senior HydroOne execs including Rod Taylor on Monday re resource adequacy issues and we can press this with them as well with respect to the CIS issue there is not much we can do since most LDCs already have a CIS vendor but my understanding is that at least one CIS vendor has backed out of its commitments to a number of LDCs recently per David MacFadden and perhaps we can get a vendor to move in quickly to fill that gap I will raise this with Marryott to see what may be feasible at this stage with respect to the customer duplication issue I have already met with the senior people at Direct last week to discuss this issue with them and to propose a resolution that would see the retailers involved retaining a third party such as EY to assess the degree of overlap and whether there was an acceptable solution to any problem Direct is convinced that the degree of duplication is not high Direct is talking to Onsource and Toronto about this I am checking with our staff in the UK about whether there was a similar issue when the UK market opened and if so how it was resolved with respect to customer education I and Dick Perdue Directs advisor have contacted TransAlta OPG HydroOne Onsource Enersource and Toronto about funding a Province wide consumer education initiative over the summer We are meeting next week to discuss this idea further This could require a financial commitment from Enron of up to with respect to the contingency plan to deal with those LDCs who are not ready the OEB is already on side in recognizing the need for a contingency plan it will likely be very simple the IMO would send a bill to the LDC each month and the LDC would bill customers at some fixed rate with a deferral account The key issue will be how many LDCs in terms of numbers and size are not ready and what is the minimum number of LDCs that the OEBgovt is looking for to be ready This is an issue we will have to talk to the MEST about as well as the OEB since ultimately the decision of whether enough LDCs are ready will be a political one These are the OEBretail focussed things we are doing On the larger political front I have several ideas about some things I would like to do that I can discuss with you

DadsonTORECT on PM PM To cc Subject Re PACE presentation Aleck Thanks very much for going above and beyond the call of duty to respond to my questions I really appreciate you taking the time to bring me up the learning curve on the complexities of the new market place I will pass your comments on to the rest of the PACE members for their consideration and comment Our report to the Minister will be much better positioned as a result of your efforts Dave PM To cc Subject Re PACE presentation Dave Here is my response to the concerns raised in your email below regarding exports from Ontario to the connected US markets a Remember that the rules and policies under development at the IMO will ensure that load in Ontario will not be cut in order to support export transactions in other words Ontario like most US systems has adopted a native load preference b Remember also that the Ontario market clearing price will be set by the offers and bids within Ontario Scheduled external demand will move us up the bid stack but cannot for instance set the Ontario price by offering lets say MWh The price paid by all internal and external load leaving aside the issue of congestion will be set by the marginal bid in Ontario c Remember also that the scope for economic export transactions will be limited by the impact of the export and wheeling tariff MWh liability for uplift estimated at approximately MWh and the IMO administration fee estimated at MWh plus any wheelingadmin charges applied by the connected markets d Perhaps most importantly remember that congestion costs will be charged in respect of export transactions from the Ontario zone assume low cost to an external intertie zone assume high cost A buyer from the Ontario spot market in the external intertie zone will pay the aggregate of the Ontario market clearing price plus the applicable congestion costs Those congestion costs are calculated as the difference between the Ontario price low cost and the price in the external zone high cost Two featuresimplications of this regime are worth noting First the liability to pay congestion costs will by itself reduce the scope for export transactions of the scope and level you fear Though one can buy transmission rights TRs which will provide a complete hedge against congestion costs Second the congestion costs collected under this regime will after funding the hedge held by the holders of TRs be applied to reduce the revenue requirement of the transmission owners In other words the surplus flows back to reduce the transmission rates that Ontario consumers would otherwise pay Hope this helps you and your colleagues on the PACE Happy to answer any other questions that you may have bridgecom To cc PM Subject Re PACE presentation Aleck Thanks for getting back to me so quickly One point that I forgot to mention was the impact of external demand At the same time that Ontario generators would be trying to sell into higher priced US markets marketers serving US customers would be trying to buy lower cost power in Ontario to ship south As you pointed out both groups would need to take into account the costs of wheeling and exporting the power However if the price differential between the Ontario and US markets was sufficient to offset these costs electricity would flow to the US until the price differential for delivered power was eliminated If demand exceeded supply in the US market by an amount equal to or larger than the US intertie capacity and Ontario was the lowestcost supply alternative the total demand for Ontario power from native and foreign sources could exceed Ontario supply under extreme weather as shown in the table below Under these conditions the price in Ontario would be bid up by the US market imbalance Alberta would have had a similar problem with its BC intertie if it hadnt decoupled its market pricing so that the market clearing price for Albertans is set only by local demand A second and perhaps more critical issue is the technical capability of the Ontario market Despite the rosy reports from the IMO some market participants have experienced IMO failures during testing and most MEUs have indicated that they cannot be ready for a November opening Many people feel that the risk of system failure must be eliminated or reduced to a manageable insignificant level before the market can be opened I would appreciate any additional thoughts you care to share on these points Thanks Dave Potential Market Conditions MW Winter Peak Capacity Winter Peak Demand Surplus Supply in Ontario Intertie Capacity Out of Ontario NY Interface Michigan Interface Minnesota Into Ontario Quebec Manitoba SurplusShortfall Net SurplusShortfall Extreme Weather Forecast AleckDadson enroncom To cc Subject Re PACE presentation PM David here are some observations in response to your questions a You are correct that we would expect Ontariobased generators to pursue economic export opportunities in the connected US markets but we stress that the economics of such exports will be affected not only by the comparative generation costs but also the cost of Hydro Ones export and wheeling tariff the IMO uplift and related charges charged to all load including exports transmission costs in the connected market and any congestion costs arising in the event that the intertie between Ontario and the connected market is congested Everything else being equal this means that on average power will trade within Ontario at a discount to prices in the U S connected markets b With respect to volatility it has to be conceded that electricity is the most volatile of commodities Having said that the period of most serious volatility is the summer months Moreover we think it can be fairly said that volatility and price swings are moderating in the Eastern Interconnect largely as a consequence of the decrease in fuel costs ie natural gas prices and extensive new generation build PIRA estimates that in Summer the year to year increase in available generation resources in the Eastern Interconnect is about MW This all adds up to increased price stability Again my colleague Garrett Tripp and I would be ready to meet with your group at any time to go over these questions and our analysis in more detail Give me a call if you would like to meet to discuss these points Regards Aleck bridgecom To cc PM Subject Re PACE presentation Thanks for the report It helped to validate the PACE conclusion that there is sufficient supply to open the market without precipitating another California The report mentions that imports would not set the MCP in Ontario and that energy savings would be possible even if peak market demand was met by imports while in another section it concludes that Ontario could rely on higherpriced imports to meet demand The first two points seem to contradict the results from the IMO test runs which indicate that the US markets will set the clearing price in Ontario percent of the time putting upward pressure on electricity prices in our market If prices are higher in the adjacent markets Ontario generators can be expected to export power to the more lucrative markets rather than bidding into the Ontario market resulting in higher prices for Ontario since prices are determined on the margin Price volatility and extreme price swings were also identified as concerns by MEUs Were any of these concerns addressed in your presentation and are there any comments you can share

electricity file He is someone I have been trying to see for two months He was very impressed by Garretts presentation His comments were as follows a the mood in govt is changing b the political

cc to Paul Lavo is looking for our first draft TODAY you and Aleck need to agree on the speaking points I provided you with my comments already One further Item re the IMO Meeting that I didnt have time to communcicate to you At one point in the meeting Guolding stated that if one industrial or one muni is not ready the market will not open I lost my mind and told him that if that is the case I need to resign as this is a complete waste of time and the market will never open if our CEO is telling the marketplace that one rinkydink muni can hold the entire market opening hostage Without doubt it was the most frustratingdisappointing statement Ive seen GuoldingBaillie make Im sure Houghton was basking in all his glory after that I almost want to write a letter specific to guoulding and ccd to Baillie underlining who ridiculous a position this is for the CEO of the IMO to be taking Original Message From Dadson Aleck Sent Friday June AM To Milnthorp Rob Cc Devries Paul Hemstock Robert Subject Re IMO Meeting Highlights This message came back to me too big I am resending and will send garretts paper separately Rob thanks for the comments from the IMO Board meeting Three points a I am not sure what paper the IMO Board members may be referring to It could be the briefing note re Moving Forward to Market Opening the briefing note Satisfying the Governments Four Guiding Principles or the piece on resource adequacy and pricing that Garrett Tripp prepared and that he and I have been delivering to senior people in the government and elsewhere I attach those three papers in electronic format b The briefing notes above and the material we are preparing for Ken Lay and John Lavorato address the Pickering A point The suggestion that market opening is tied to Pickering A doesnt surprise me but is at odds with what Judy Hubert has been telling stakeholders recently In any event it is commonly thought that the government may think that Pickering A will improve reliability and stabilize prices There may in fact be another reason One of our contacts in the Premiers Office has indicated that Farlinger had told Harris that waiting until the return of Pickering was important from the perspective of OPGs financial position On reflection Garrett Tripp and I think that the concern likely relates to OPGs obligations under the MPMA the concern may be a that OPG may not be able to claim force majeure in respect of the Pickering A delay in order to reduce their rebate obligations definition of force majeure in sec c may not be broad enough or b that even if OPG can claim force majeure the predetermined force majeure replacement cost fixed at the time the MPMA was completed in may be too low to offset the cost to OPG of securing replacement power in In other words OPG is asking the government to intervene in market developmentmarket opening to protect OPG from the terms of the deal maybe from OPGs perspective now a bad deal that OPG made in We should discuss whether Lay and Lavorato can make this point to Harris without compromising our source c With respect to Foward Markets I think we have to distinguish between a binding hour ahead and day ahead market which we may want to have the IMO run assuming that this will facilitate and standardize trading among the Northeast ISOs which is a key objective in the East but anything beyond that they should stay away from I will speak to Rob Hemstock and to the folks in Houston who have been working so hard on the RTO development in the Northeast Did any material get circulated as to what they want to do re

<1161840.1075851983067.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,aleck.dadson@enron.com,2001-06-08 02:01:00,Re Ken LayJohn Lavorato Briefing Material column by Peter Foster of the National Post in todays paper Comes to the defence of Enron and Ken Lay Eric Thode has been very helpful to Peter and it has paid off Also I met with the Progressive Conservative Party Advisory Committee on Energy a committee of nonelected party activists and they are preparing a report endorsing a Fall opening Economics Peter Foster National Post Dumb ol Dubya President Bush and his administration have been taken to task this week by US liberal economists and media sophisticates for being so naive as to suggest that Californias problems wont be solved by price controls That sniffed last Sundays New York Times was just Econ What the President needed was a lesson in Econ presented by the Department of Sarah PolleySci The bad news for Californians is that the shift of power to the democrats in the federal Senate means that price controls become more likely and with them more blackouts Meanwhile the real causes of the California crisis a screwedup deregulation process exacerbated by environmentalist opposition to new state power plants are buried beneath screams about gouging and profiteering and calls for an anticorporate witch hunt The call for price caps has allegedly been boosted by the support of a gang of ten economists including Alfred Kahn the architect of airline deregulation under President Carter But price caps dont work As President Bush noted after meeting California Governor Gray Davis last week Price caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply However according to another liberal economist Princetons Paul Krugman we shouldnt worry about prices because this summer will see blackouts anyway and in the longer term new supplies are on the way via new plants whose arrival will somehow be magically impervious to the prospect of controls Apart from being terrible economics Mr Krugmans attitude is even more objectionable politics At least he is frank about the reasoning behind his support for price caps They are intended to keep money out of the hands of power suppliers Meanwhile he pursues the conceit disproven time and time again that prices can be finetuned by bureaucrats to a level that will be just enough to call forth the right amount of new power Nobody he writes has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power producers from making extraordinarily high profits why should this reduce the power supply Mr Krugman suggests that students who go beyond naive old Econ learn that strictly speaking the standard argument against price controls applies only to competitive industry A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need not cause a shortage indeed price controls on a monopolist can actually lead to higher output This happens when the guy in the top hat throws up his hands and says No point in me holding out for higher prices now that you clever wonks have capped them so just come in and take what you want And which way is it to the airport Professor Krugman does have the good grace to note that Thats not an argument you want to use too often In fact the argument is dangerous nonsense There is no monopoly supplier of energy to California although many state politicians have called for a government takeover of the commanding heights of electricity generation la Lenin Moreover both the economic and political arguments against price caps remain as valid as ever Price spikes require a buyer as well as a seller To hold down prices means that there will be excess demand and that constrained supply will have to be allocated among competing uses by politicians and bureaucrats as it was under the system of natural gas price and transportation controls that brought the United States to crisis back in Meanwhile the impact of such essentially arbitrary controls goes well beyond their immediate skewing of market signals They damage the entire investment climate by raising the spectre of further whimsical intervention and by establishing an effective ceiling to profitability without any corresponding limits to losses except for those with political pull Professor Krugman asserts that generating capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut If that happens we may be sure that Mr Krugman will not be calling for price supports Mr Krugman has been a leader among the baying pack that suggests that Californias problems are all due to market manipulation by big energy suppliers He concludes his display of economic obfuscation with the snide assertion that President Bushs kneejerk ideologue advisers may be so close personally to energy industry executives that they believe that whatever is good for Enron is good for America The presence in California of Enron the worlds largest energy trader has increased supplies to the state but according to Californias attorney general democrat Bill Lockyer Enrons head Kenneth Lay should be sent to jail After all he did raise campaign funds for George Bush And price caps and jail for business executives somehow go together nicely

Rob nronXgate ENRON cc Garrett NRON Paul NRON Subject Re Market Opening With respect to point in your memo my sense is that the counterparty wo uld have to be either OPG or OEFC In my view the concept would notcould not go forward and be implemented unless it had the support of OPG The question we should talk through is how do we best try to get that support from OPG With respect to point I think we should be careful about being too encouraged by Wilsons P urchases comments to LayLavorato on June that if positive reports are delivered by the IMO and OEB in September the govt will be hard pressed not to move forward My concern is that Wilson and Purchase may feel comf ortable saying this precisely because they are expecting a negative report from the OEB or at least one that they can interpret as being negative I agree with you that the likelihood of the IMO delivering a positive report is very good The likelihood of a positive report from the OEB is far less certain The key issues at the OEBretail level are EBT LDC access to th e data they need from HydroOne completion of LDC CIS systems the govts interest in an industry resolution of customer duplications prior to mark et opening in order to avoid mass confusion in the initial period of the ma rket the state of customer education and a contingency plan to accommoda te those who are not ready with respect to EBT I think the best we can do is get onside quickly with our EBT hub of choice and work with them on perceived difficulties with LDCs etc Ellis Marr yott and I are going to make a recommendation to Paul next week on our pref erred EBT hub with respect to the info from HydroOne I have already rai sed this issue with the OEB and the IMO The OEB and the IMO subsequently m et with HydroOne and the MEA in an effort to resolve this issue My understanding until yesterdays discussion with Conway was that the issue was resolved and the information was now flowing to the LDCs Paul Gar rett and I are meeting senior HydroOne execs including Rod Taylor on Mon day re resource adequacy issues and we can press this with them a s well with respect to the CIS issue there is not much we can do since most LDCs already have a CIS vendor but my understanding is that at least one CIS vendor has backed out of its commitments to a number of LDCs recently per David MacFadden and perhaps we can get a ve ndor to move in quickly to fill that gap I will raise this with Marr yott to see what may be feasible at this stage with respect to the cu stomer duplication issue I have already met with the senior people at Dire ct last week to discuss this issue with them and to propose a resolut ion that would see the retailers involved retaining a third party such as EY to assess the degree of overlap and whether there was an accep table solution to any problem Direct is convinced that the degree of dupli cation is not high Direct is talking to Onsource and Toronto about this I am checking with our staff in the UK about whether there was a s imilar issue when the UK market opened and if so how it was resolved with respect to customer education I and Dick Perdue Directs advisor have contacted TransAlta OPG HydroO ne Onsource Enersource and Toronto about funding a Province wide consumer education initiative over the summer We are meeting next week t o discuss this idea further This could require a financial commitm ent from Enron of up to with respect to the conti ngency plan to deal with those LDCs who are not ready the OEB is already o n side in recognizing the need for a contingency plan it will likely b e very simple the IMO would send a bill to the LDC each month and the LDC would bill customers at some fixed rate with a deferral account The key issue will be how many LDCs in terms of

Aleck DadsonTORECT on PM PM To cc Subject Re PACE presentation Aleck Thanks very much for going above and beyond the call of duty to respond to my questions I really appreciate you taking the time to bring me up the learning curve on the complexities of the new market place I will pass your comments on to the rest of the PACE members for their consideration and comment Our report to the Minister will be much better positioned as a result of your efforts Dave PM To cc Subject Re PACE presentation Dave Here is my response to the concerns raised in your email below regarding exports from Ontario to the connected US markets a Remember that the rules and policies under development at the IMO will ensure that load in Ontario will not be cut in order to support export transactions in other words Ontario like most US systems has adopted a native load preference b Remember also that the Ontario market clearing price will be set by the offers and bids within Ontario Scheduled external demand will move us up the bid stack but cannot for instance set the Ontario price by offering lets say MWh The price paid by all internal and external load leaving aside the issue of congestion will be set by the marginal bid in Ontario c Remember also that the scope for economic export transactions will be limited by the impact of the export and wheeling tariff MWh liability for uplift estimated at approximately MWh and the IMO administration fee estimated at MWh plus any wheelingadmin charges applied by the connected markets d Perhaps most importantly remember that congestion costs will be charged in respect of export transactions from the Ontario zone assume low cost to an external intertie zone assume high cost A buyer from the Ontario spot market in the external intertie zone will pay the aggregate of the Ontario market clearing price plus the applicable congestion costs Those congestion costs are calculated as the difference between the Ontario price low cost and the price in the external zone high cost Two featuresimplications of this regime are worth noting First the liability to pay congestion costs will by itself reduce the scope for export transactions of the scope and level you fear Though one can buy transmission rights TRs which will provide a complete hedge against congestion costs Second the congestion costs collected under this regime will after funding the hedge held by the holders of TRs be applied to reduce the revenue requirement of the transmission owners In other words the surplus flows back to reduce the transmission rates that Ontario consumers would otherwise pay Hope this helps you and your colleagues on the PACE Happy to answer any other questions that you may have bridgecom To cc PM Subject Re PACE presentation Aleck Thanks for getting back to me so quickly One point that I forgot to mention was the impact of external demand At the same time that Ontario generators would be trying to sell into higher priced US markets marketers serving US customers would be trying to buy lower cost power in Ontario to ship south As you pointed out both groups would need to take into account the costs of wheeling and exporting the power However if the price differential between the Ontario and US markets was sufficient to offset these costs electricity would flow to the US until the price differential for delivered power was eliminated If demand exceeded supply in the US market by an amount equal to or larger than the US intertie capacity and Ontario was the lowestcost supply alternative the total demand for Ontario power from native and foreign sources could exceed Ontario supply under extreme weather as shown in the table below Under these conditions the price in Ontario would be bid up by the US market imbalance Alberta would have had a similar problem with its BC intertie if it hadnt decoupled its market pricing so that the market clearing price for Albertans is set only by local demand A second and perhaps more critical issue is the technical capability of the Ontario market Despite the rosy reports from the IMO some market participants have experienced IMO failures during testing and most MEUs have indicated that they cannot be ready for a November opening Many people feel that the risk of system failure must be eliminated or reduced to a manageable insignificant level before the market can be opened I would appreciate any additional thoughts you care to share on these points Thanks Dave Potential Market Conditions MW Winter Peak Capacity Winter Peak Demand Surplus Supply in Ontario Intertie Capacity Out of Ontario NY Interface Michigan Interface Minnesota Into Ontario Quebec Manitoba SurplusShortfall Net SurplusShortfall Extreme Weather Forecast AleckDadson enroncom To cc Subject Re PACE presentation PM David here are some observations in response to your questions a You are correct that we would expect Ontariobased generators to pursue economic export opportunities in the connected US markets but we stress that the economics of such exports will be affected not only by the comparative generation costs but also the cost of Hydro Ones export and wheeling tariff the IMO uplift and related charges charged to all load including exports transmission costs in the connected market and any congestion costs arising in the event that the intertie between Ontario and the connected market is congested Everything else being equal this means that on average power will trade within Ontario at a discount to prices in the U S connected markets b With respect to volatility it has to be conceded that electricity is the most volatile of commodities Having said that the period of most serious volatility is the summer months Moreover we think it can be fairly said that volatility and price swings are moderating in the Eastern Interconnect largely as a consequence of the decrease in fuel costs ie natural gas prices and extensive new generation build PIRA estimates that in Summer the year to year increase in available generation resources in the Eastern Interconnect is about MW This all adds up to increased price stability Again my colleague Garrett Tripp and I would be ready to meet with your group at any time to go over these questions and our analysis in more detail Give me a call if you would like to meet to discuss these points Regards Aleck bridgecom To cc PM Subject Re PACE presentation Thanks for the report It helped to validate the PACE conclusion that there is sufficient supply to open the market without precipitating another California The report mentions that imports would not set the MCP in Ontario and that energy savings would be possible even if peak market demand was met by imports while in another section it concludes that Ontario could rely on higherpriced imports to meet demand The first two points seem to contradict the results from the IMO test runs which indicate that the US markets will set the clearing price in Ontario percent of the time putting upward pressure on electricity prices in our market If prices are higher in the adjacent markets Ontario generators can be expected to export power to the more lucrative markets rather than bidding into the Ontario market resulting in higher prices for Ontario since prices are determined on the margin Price volatility and extreme price swings were also identified as concerns by MEUs Were any of these concerns addressed in your presentation and are there any comments you can share

time to communcicate to you At one point in the meeting Guolding stated that if one industrial or one muni is not ready the market will not open I lost my mind and told him that if that is the case I need to resign as this is a complete waste of time and the market will never open if our CEO is telling the marketplace that one rinkydink muni can hold the entire market opening hostage Without doubt

to Baillie underlining who ridiculous a position this is for the CEO of the IMO to be taking Original Message From Dadson Aleck Sent Friday June AM To Milnthorp Rob Cc Devries Paul Hemstock Robert Subject Re IMO Meeting Highlights This message came back to me too big I am resending and will send garretts paper separately Rob thanks for the comments from the IMO Board meeting Three points a I am not sure what paper the IMO Board members may be referring to It could be the briefing note re Moving Forward to Market Opening the briefing note Satisfying the Governments Four Guiding Principles or the piece on resource adequacy and pricing that Garrett Tripp prepared and that he and I have been delivering to senior people in the government and elsewhere I attach those three papers in electronic format b The briefing notes above and the material we are preparing for Ken Lay and John Lavorato address the Pickering A point The suggestion that market opening is tied to Pickering A doesnt surprise me but is at odds with what Judy Hubert has been telling stakeholders recently In any event it is commonly thought that the government may think that Pickering A will improve reliability and stabilize prices There may in fact be another reason One of our contacts in the Premiers Office has indicated that Farlinger had told Harris that waiting until the return of Pickering was important from the perspective of OPGs financial position On reflection Garrett Tripp and I think that the concern likely relates to OPGs obligations under the MPMA the concern may be a that OPG may not be able to claim force majeure in respect of the Pickering A delay in order to reduce their rebate obligations definition of force majeure in sec c may not be broad enough or b that even if OPG can claim force majeure the predetermined force majeure replacement cost fixed at the time the MPMA was completed in may be too low to offset the cost to OPG of securing replacement power in In other words OPG is asking the government to intervene in market developmentmarket opening to protect OPG from the terms of the deal maybe from OPGs perspective now a bad deal that OPG made in We should discuss whether Lay and Lavorato can make this point to Harris without compromising our source c With respect to Foward Markets I think we have to distinguish between a binding hour ahead and day ahead market which we may want to have the IMO run assuming that this will facilitate and standardize trading among the Northeast ISOs which is a key objective in the East but anything beyond that they should stay away from I will speak to Rob Hemstock and to the folks in Houston who have been working so hard on the RTO development in the Northeast Did any material get circulated as to what they want to do re forward markets In any event I think we should have a demo of Enron Online in Toronto for the IMO Board and OEB File Market Opening Doc feb doc File Satisfying the Governments Four Guiding Principlesdoc Rob nronXgate PM To Aleck CT Paul CT cc Robert nronXgate Subject IMO Meeting Highlights Some Brief Highlights from the IMO Meeting Market opening without question is now tied to the bringing back of the st pickering unit Govt is clearly not thinking november but the good news is that they have made some statements locking them into may We should have our own intelligence re Pickering return but Boland told me that March was highly probable A number of positive comments re Alecks paper from board members Aleck Im not sure which paper they are referring to can i get a copy Forward Market development IMO wants to make this happen Assessing two candidates I told the IMO that this is not their mandate and that a conditional forward market exists currently and an unconditional forward market will exist when we have a unconditional market opening date I talked re Alberta and indicated that the Alberta sponsored forward market was a joke WattEx and that Enron and others had done s of forward market transactions and the Enron has a visible forward market ACTION We need to develop a position paper on why this should be left to the market place and not some regulated central agency The IMO should be concerned with creating the right environment to promote an efficient forward market ie information disclosure etc OPG would support this position we may want to coauthor the paper I believe HemstockDavies did some work on this already re Alberta Lets discuss further

DadsonTORECT on PM PM To cc Subject Re PACE presentation Aleck Thanks very much for going above and beyond the call of duty to respond to my questions I really appreciate you taking the time to bring me up the learning curve on the complexities of the new market place I will pass your comments on to the rest of the PACE members for their consideration and comment Our report to the Minister will be much better positioned as a result of your efforts Dave PM To cc Subject Re PACE presentation Dave Here is my response to the concerns raised in your email below regarding exports from Ontario to the connected US markets a Remember that the rules and policies under development at the IMO will ensure that load in Ontario will not be cut in order to support export transactions in other words Ontario like most US systems has adopted a native load preference b Remember also that the Ontario market clearing price will be set by the offers and bids within Ontario Scheduled external demand will move us up the bid stack but cannot for instance set the Ontario price by offering lets say MWh The price paid by all internal and external load leaving aside the issue of congestion will be set by the marginal bid in Ontario c Remember also that the scope for economic export transactions will be limited by the impact of the export and wheeling tariff MWh liability for uplift estimated at approximately MWh and the IMO administration fee estimated at MWh plus any wheelingadmin charges applied by the connected markets d Perhaps most importantly remember that congestion costs will be charged in respect of export transactions from the Ontario zone assume low cost to an external intertie zone assume high cost A buyer from the Ontario spot market in the external intertie zone will pay the aggregate of the Ontario market clearing price plus the applicable congestion costs Those congestion costs are calculated as the difference between the Ontario price low cost and the price in the external zone high cost Two featuresimplications of this regime are worth noting First the liability to pay congestion costs will by itself reduce the scope for export transactions of the scope and level you fear Though one can buy transmission rights TRs which will provide a complete hedge against congestion costs Second the congestion costs collected under this regime will after funding the hedge held by the holders of TRs be applied to reduce the revenue requirement of the transmission owners In other words the surplus flows back to reduce the transmission rates that Ontario consumers would otherwise pay Hope this helps you and your colleagues on the PACE Happy to answer any other questions that you may have bridgecom To cc PM Subject Re PACE presentation Aleck Thanks for getting back to me so quickly One point that I forgot to mention was the impact of external demand At the same time that Ontario generators would be trying to sell into higher priced US markets marketers serving US customers would be trying to buy lower cost power in Ontario to ship south As you pointed out both groups would need to take into account the costs of wheeling and exporting the power However if the price differential between the Ontario and US markets was sufficient to offset these costs electricity would flow to the US until the price differential for delivered power was eliminated If demand exceeded supply in the US market by an amount equal to or larger than the US intertie capacity and Ontario was the lowestcost supply alternative the total demand for Ontario power from native and foreign sources could exceed Ontario supply under extreme weather as shown in the table below Under these conditions the price in Ontario would be bid up by the US market imbalance Alberta would have had a similar problem with its BC intertie if it hadnt decoupled its market pricing so that the market clearing price for Albertans is set only by local demand A second and perhaps more critical issue is the technical capability of the Ontario market Despite the rosy reports from the IMO some market participants have experienced IMO failures during testing and most MEUs have indicated that they cannot be ready for a November opening Many people feel that the risk of system failure must be eliminated or reduced to a manageable insignificant level before the market can be opened I would appreciate any additional thoughts you care to share on these points Thanks Dave Potential Market Conditions MW Winter Peak Capacity Winter Peak Demand Surplus Supply in Ontario Intertie Capacity Out of Ontario NY Interface Michigan Interface Minnesota Into Ontario Quebec Manitoba SurplusShortfall Net SurplusShortfall Extreme Weather Forecast AleckDadson enroncom To cc Subject Re PACE presentation PM David here are some observations in response to your questions a You are correct that we would expect Ontariobased generators to pursue economic export opportunities in the connected US markets but we stress that the economics of such exports will be affected not only by the comparative generation costs but also the cost of Hydro Ones export and wheeling tariff the IMO uplift and related charges charged to all load including exports transmission costs in the connected market and any congestion costs arising in the event that the intertie between Ontario and the connected market is congested Everything else being equal this means that on average power will trade within Ontario at a discount to prices in the U S connected markets b With respect to volatility it has to be conceded that electricity is the most volatile of commodities Having said that the period of most serious volatility is the summer months Moreover we think it can be fairly said that volatility and price swings are moderating in the Eastern Interconnect largely as a consequence of the decrease in fuel costs ie natural gas prices and extensive new generation build PIRA estimates that in Summer the year to year increase in available generation resources in the Eastern Interconnect is about MW This all adds up to increased price stability Again my colleague Garrett Tripp and I would be ready to meet with your group at any time to go over these questions and our analysis in more detail Give me a call if you would like to meet to discuss these points Regards Aleck bridgecom To cc PM Subject Re PACE presentation Thanks for the report It helped to validate the PACE conclusion that there is sufficient supply to open the market without precipitating another California The report mentions that imports would not set the MCP in Ontario and that energy savings would be possible even if peak market demand was met by imports while in another section it concludes that Ontario could rely on higherpriced imports to meet demand The first two points seem to contradict the results from the IMO test runs which indicate that the US markets will set the clearing price in Ontario percent of the time putting upward pressure on electricity prices in our market If prices are higher in the adjacent markets Ontario generators can be expected to export power to the more lucrative markets rather than bidding into the Ontario market resulting in higher prices for Ontario since prices are determined on the margin Price volatility and extreme price swings were also identified as concerns by MEUs Were any of these concerns addressed in your presentation and are there any comments you can share

NRON cc Garrett NRON Paul NRON Subject Re Market Opening With respect to point in your memo my sense is that the counterparty would have to be either OPG or OEFC In my view the concept would notcould not go forward and be implemented unless it had the support of OPG The question we should talk through is how do we best try to get that support from OPG With respect to point I think we should be careful about being too encouraged by Wilsons Purchases comments to LayLavorato on June that if positive reports are delivered by the IMO and OEB in September the govt will be hard pressed not to move forward My concern is that Wilson and Purchase may feel comfortable saying this precisely because they are expecting a negative report from the OEB or at least one that they can interpret as being negative I agree with you that the likelihood of the IMO delivering a positive report is very good The likelihood of a positive report from the OEB is far less certain The key issues at the OEBretail level are EBT LDC access to the data they need from HydroOne completion of LDC CIS systems the govts interest in an industry resolution of customer duplications prior to market opening in order to avoid mass confusion in the initial period of the market the state of customer education and a contingency plan to accommodate those who are not ready with respect to EBT I think the best we can do is get onside quickly with our EBT hub of choice and work with them on perceived difficulties with LDCs etc Ellis Marryott and I are going to make a recommendation to Paul next week on our preferred EBT hub with respect to the info from HydroOne I have already raised this issue with the OEB and the IMO The OEB and the IMO subsequently met with HydroOne and the MEA in an effort to resolve this issue My understanding until yesterdays discussion with Conway was that the issue was resolved and the information was now flowing to the LDCs Paul Garrett and I are meeting senior HydroOne execs including Rod Taylor on Monday re resource adequacy issues and we can press this with them as well with respect to the CIS issue there is not much we can do since most LDCs already have a CIS vendor but my understanding is that at least one CIS vendor has backed out of its commitments to a number of LDCs recently per David MacFadden and perhaps we can get a vendor to move in quickly to fill that gap I will raise this with Marryott to see what may be feasible at this stage with respect to the customer duplication issue I have already met with the senior people at Direct last week to discuss this issue with them and to propose a resolution that would see the retailers involved retaining a third party such as EY to assess the degree of overlap and whether there was an acceptable solution to any problem Direct is convinced that the degree of duplication is not high Direct is talking to Onsource and Toronto about this I am checking with our staff in the UK about whether there was a similar issue when the UK market opened and if so how it was resolved with respect to customer education I and Dick Perdue Directs advisor have contacted TransAlta OPG HydroOne Onsource Enersource and Toronto about funding a Province wide consumer education initiative over the summer We are meeting next week to discuss this idea further This could require a financial commitment from Enron of up to with respect to the contingency plan to deal with those LDCs who are not ready the OEB is already on side in recognizing the need for a contingency plan it will likely be very simple the IMO would send a bill to the LDC each month and the LDC would bill customers at some fixed rate with a deferral account The key issue will be how many LDCs in terms of numbers and size are not ready and what is the minimum number of LDCs that the OEBgovt is looking for to be ready This is an issue we will have to talk to the MEST about as well as the OEB since ultimately the decision of whether enough LDCs are ready will be a political one These are the OEBretail focussed things we are doing On the larger political front I have several ideas about some things I would like to do that I can discuss with you and Paul Rob nronXgate AM To Paul CT Garrett CT cc Aleck CT Subject Market Opening GarrettPaul Can you guys work with the North East desk to price out a MW option at the New YorkOntario intertie as an insurance policy for the Ontario government re market opening You will recall that this was something we had suggested a while back and didnt receive much support However following Lavoratos meeting with Harris Lavo is adamant that we send a term sheet to Harris directly outlining both an call option structure and a swap structure Second it is quite apparant to me that everything hinges on the September readiness report If its favorable I think there is a good chance of a fall market opening With that said however we are in the hands of the IMO and the OEB Im comfortable that we can

nronXGate cc Subject FYI an article about California and Ken Lay by one of Peter Fosters colleagues June Priggish and piggish in California Mark Steyn National Post A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month It swept in May but no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the islands radio link to the outside world The storm blew sheep into the chilly South Atlantic killed many cattle damaged every single home on the island demolished the hospital and community centre blew the roof off the radio station and wrecked the Albatross the only pub in the only village Edinburgh of the Seven Seas For a week after the storm the entire island was without electricity And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it Not the islands colonial masters in London Not the Governor who doesnt actually reside there but prefers to live miles away on St Helena Tristan da Cunhas nearest neighbour St Helena is Manhattan to Tristans Weehawken New Jersey Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa Tristan da Cunha is the worlds most isolated human settlement Its contact with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British supply vessel plus the occasional cruise ship which anchors offshore when its safe to do so Now thats living off the grid The East India Company won a charter to settle Tristan in and its been a Crown colony since populated by a handful of families from the Scottish borders There are just seven surnames on the island Glass Green Hagan Lavarello Repetto Rogers and Swain All of them turned up in London years ago when the islands volcano erupted and they were evacuated to the Imperial capital In the roaring traffics boom midst the glitter of one of the worlds great cities the islanders voted to return home though even getting there was tricky as their landing dock was covered in lava Today the colony is virtually selfsufficient in food and has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists London has offered o to repair the communications equipment and pay for a new hospital You can build a hospital for under quid Amazing Otherwise the islanders are just doing what they usually do making the best of things While theyre waiting for the new hospital theyve arranged for a South African fishing vessel to ferry out a secondhand Xray machine when it sails next week Now consider by way of contrast the inhabitants of what George W Bush amusingly calls the great state of California Once upon a time California was like they say of Tristan da Cunha the furthest thing at least in terms of the North American continent Today with a population the size of Canadas its one of the worlds largest economies the home base of Americas biggest industry entertainment But inside many a studio vicepresident is a Tristan da Cunha islander trying to get out Deep in their hearts assuming for the purposes of discussion that studio vicepresidents have hearts they share the same rugged virtues as the Tristanians though they prefer something a little better than a hospital and theyve no desire to scrape a living from catching crawfish but if the pool boy wants to have a go up the deep end hes welcome to try And therein lies the contradiction Californias selfinflicted energy crisis has exposed the preposterousness of poseurconservationism in a booming economy Which state has the most rigorous conservation program California Which has the lowest per capita electricity consumption California And which state is panicking at the prospect of a summer of rolling blackouts By now impeccably progressive California should have learned the hard way that conservation is not a viable policy for a nonstagnant economy Instead a rolling blackout here a rolling blackout there and theyre running around like headless chickens Governor Gray Davis is lashing out at everyone in sight Bush and Cheney are irresponsible the power generators are unconscionable no wait theyre snakes and robber barons And how do you treat unconscionable robber snakes like Ken Lay CEO of Enron Corp I would love said Bill Lockyer Californias AttorneyGeneral to personally escort Lay to an x cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says Hi my name is Spike honey As the states AttorneyGeneral Mr Lockyer cannot summarily sentence citizens to anal rape but no doubt once the guys convicted he can make some quiet recommendations as to appropriate cell mates Fortunately for Mr Lay as chief exec of the worlds largest energy trader he doesnt live in California he lives in Texas Indeed very few of the folks the State of California would like to sic Spike on are within their jurisdiction Doubtless the taxpayers of British Columbia whose BC Hydro has been living high off the hog on Californias woes could also use a little light buggery but I cant see a Canadian court approving extradition Nevertheless in a state thats overregulated bans new power plants and is addicted to price caps Mr Lockyer has ingeniously managed to come up with yet another disincentive for anybody in the energy business to relocate to Lalaland California bought into the softeco Sierra Club illusion that somehow one could be a conservationist with no consequences for ones economic wellbeing To put it in terms Californians can understand Suppose you build a house out in the desert But you dont want to buy a car because thats bad for the environment isnt it So instead every morning you call a taxicab in the city to drive out pick you up and take you into the office Not only does it have no environmental benefit but theres no point bitching and whining because the driver charges you a fare that bears no relation to the cost of gas Yet thats what Governor Davis and the Anal Attorney are demanding price caps Through its own incompetence California is wholly dependent on energy generators and distributors from other jurisdictions But it expects those companies to forgo the interests of their own stockholders and service California ie Hollywood and Silicon Valley as an act of public welfare A profit is swinelike piggish and totally unreasonable says Medea Benjamin of the California human rights group Global Exchange She may have a point but if Californias going to institute price caps they might like to start closer to home After all if Enrons board members dont really need those big salaries do Paramounts or Universals I mean sure Ken Lay has an easy job but how difficult is it for an exec honcho in Century City to sit at a desk and greenlight another John Travolta flop every couple of months I mean surely the guy could do the job on oh a year And thatd be good for conservation cause hed have to give up the Merc and the Cherokee and the LearJet and take the bus And how about Travolta Instead of million per picture maybe he could get by on just two or three and the remaining million could be put into those renewable energy projects hes so keen on I mean a million salary isnt just swinelike its piggish right Since its entry into the Union California has had what we thcentury imperialists call responsible government Tristan da Cunha doesnt Yet its community leaders are behaving far more maturely and responsibly than Californias Gray Davis is acting not like the elected Governor of an American state but the appointed Governor of a Crown colony feverishly cabling head office to send somebody out to rescue him Youre on your own man And if California conservationists find rolling blackouts too onerous they should try spending a week in the dark cut off from the outside world and knowing that even when the radio starts working again its going to take months for the secondhand Xray machine to arrive Back

ago I know that Foster spent some time on the phone with Steve and Mark before writing the article Forwarded by Aleck DadsonTORECT on AM Dan Dorland AM To Paul CT Jan CT Jeff CT Dave CT Aleck CT Garrett CT cc Subject Economics Economics Peter Foster National Post Dumb ol Dubya President Bush and his administration have been taken to task this week by US liberal economists and media sophisticates for being so naive as to suggest that Californias problems wont be solved by price controls That sniffed last Sundays New York Times was just Econ What the President needed was a lesson in Econ presented by the Department of Sarah PolleySci The bad news for Californians is that the shift of power to the democrats in the federal Senate means that price controls become more likely and with them more blackouts Meanwhile the real causes of the California crisis a screwedup deregulation process exacerbated by environmentalist opposition to new state power plants are buried beneath screams about gouging and profiteering and calls for an anticorporate witch hunt The call for price caps has allegedly been boosted by the support of a gang of ten economists including Alfred Kahn the architect of airline deregulation under President Carter But price caps dont work As President Bush noted after meeting California Governor Gray Davis last week Price caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply However according to another liberal economist Princetons Paul Krugman we shouldnt worry about prices because this summer will see blackouts anyway and in the longer term new supplies are on the way via new plants whose arrival will somehow be magically impervious to the prospect of controls Apart from being terrible economics Mr Krugmans attitude is even more objectionable politics At least he is frank about the reasoning behind his support for price caps They are intended to keep money out of the hands of power suppliers Meanwhile he pursues the conceit disproven time and time again that prices can be finetuned by bureaucrats to a level that will be just enough to call forth the right amount of new power Nobody he writes has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power producers from making extraordinarily high profits why should this reduce the power supply Mr Krugman suggests that students who go beyond naive old Econ learn that strictly speaking the standard argument against price controls applies only to competitive industry A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need not cause a shortage indeed price controls on a monopolist can actually lead to higher output This happens when the guy in the top hat throws up his hands and says No point in me holding out for higher prices now that you clever wonks have capped them so just come in and take what you want And which way is it to the airport Professor Krugman does have the good grace to note that Thats not an argument you want to use too often In fact the argument is dangerous nonsense There is no monopoly supplier of energy to California although many state politicians have called for a government takeover of the commanding heights of electricity generation la Lenin Moreover both the economic and political arguments against price caps remain as valid as ever Price spikes require a buyer as well as a seller To hold down prices means that there will be excess demand and that constrained supply will have to be allocated among competing uses by politicians and bureaucrats as it was under the system of natural gas price and transportation controls that brought the United States to crisis back in Meanwhile the impact of such essentially arbitrary controls goes well beyond their immediate skewing of market signals They damage the entire investment climate by raising the spectre of further whimsical intervention and by establishing an effective ceiling to profitability without any corresponding limits to losses except for those with political pull Professor Krugman asserts that generating capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut If that happens we may be sure that Mr Krugman will not be calling for price supports Mr Krugman has been a leader among the baying pack that suggests that Californias problems are all due to market manipulation by big energy suppliers He concludes his display of economic obfuscation with the snide assertion that President Bushs kneejerk ideologue advisers may be so close personally to energy industry executives that they believe that whatever is good for Enron is good for America The presence in California of Enron the worlds largest energy trader has increased supplies to the state but according to Californias attorney general democrat Bill Lockyer Enrons head Kenneth Lay should be sent to jail After all he did raise campaign funds for George Bush And price caps and jail for business executives somehow go together nicely

Commission which is working on its final order to fix Californias broken electricity market isnt clear on how the new rules will price power from mustrun generators or how generators will be paid a return on their capital investments a FERC commissioner said Tuesday In its preliminary proposal Nov FERC said that Californias wholesale electricity market price could have a soft cap of a megawatthour but the state could purchase additional power at more than MWh if needed Suppliers would be paid the price at which they bid in their power would have to justify why their costs exceed MWh Further the FERC could lower the sales price upon review As reported Monday FERC commissioners likely will set the soft cap at MWh in the final ruling which is expected in the middle of December instead of the initially proposed MWh The FERC however still doesnt know how generators selling power above the cap will be reimbursed for investment in addition to marginal generating costs When generators are paid only their marginal costs they have no money left to pay off fixed costs and go broke Fixedcost recovery as a percentage of per megawatthour sales price varies widely based on how many hours a year a generator operates Inefficient peaking units that run only a couple hundred hours a year for example need to be paid very high prices per hour to cover fixed costs In addition the state has contracts with several independent power producers whose generators must run or at least be available to run all the time for system reliability Currently these resource mustrun units get paid the market clearing price but a clearing price of MWh wont cover the fixed costs of gasfired units at current prices for natural gas in California Were not clear on these issues and were seeking comments on them said the commissioner who spoke on the condition of anonymity Others in the industry are also skeptical about how the new soft cap will work I dont think the FERC knows what its getting itself into Maybe they will just take all these documents and sit on them for years and never change the prices Dynegy DYN Marketing Trade senior vice president Lynn Lednicky said Tuesday

Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesA panel of market economists assembled by the California Power Exchange debated Tuesday whether the CalPX should move from a singleprice auction for pricing electricity in the spot market to an asbid market which the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has proposed The consensus however was that moving purchases out of the spot market into a forward market is more important to solving Californias electricity crisis and that if a forward market develops the pricing mechanism of the CalPX spot market wont be that important Dynegy favors an asbid market but its not a matter of religion for us Dynegy DYN Marketing and Trade senior vice president Lynn Lednicky told the economists If I could wave a magic wand and create a forward market for California I wouldnt get all excited about whether the spot market is singleprice or asbid Lednicky said Under its current singleprice auction the CalPX pays all suppliers the price for the last most expensive megawatt taken for a given hour the next day In the FERC proposed asbid market suppliers whose energy is taken would get paid only the price at which they offered to sell their electricity to the states three main utilities The economists agreed that California legislators and regulators erred gravely in prohibiting utilities from entering into longterm forward contracts with suppliers when they began to deregulate the industry in What were they thinking Were they thinking at all asked University of Maryland professor Peter Crampton Even though California utilities are no longer prohibited from participating in the spot market in general the California Public Utilities Commission still hasnt approved any forward market contracts put before them by utilities that have reached agreements with suppliers Lednicky said Crampton nevertheless thinks that keeping the singleprice auction would help promote a forward market Singleprice auctions are more volatile than asbid markets Crampton said and forward markets are used more when spot markets are more volatile In addition the singleprice mechanism should be kept because an asbid market is a disadvantage to smaller generators who would have to spend a lot of resources relative to their size constantly figuring out how to bid in their power Crampton said When asked Lednicky agreed that the FERC proposal which was issued Nov and will result in a final order around the middle of December isnt really an asbid market anyway FERC said that the clearing price could be capped at a megawatthour and that the CalPX could purchase additional power at more than MWh asbid but suppliers would have to justify their prices by documenting costs and the FERC could lower the sales price after the fact As reported Monday by Dow Jones Newswires FERC likely will set the soft cap at MWh instead of MWh in the final ruling Also FERC would have to decide how more expensive generating plants would be reimbursed for investment in addition to marginal costs Investment recovery as a percentage of sales price varies widely based on how many hours a year a generator operates I dont think the FERC knows what its getting itself into Maybe they will just take all these documents and sit on them for years and never change the prices Lednicky said The panelists and other participants Tuesday seemed to agree that an asbid pricing mechanism probably wont lower prices that much over the long term but it may lower prices significantly in the short run They also agreed that the constant changing of market rules and the regulatory environment in California is a disincentive to investment in building new power plants in and around the state By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires GMTAPDJ GMT
