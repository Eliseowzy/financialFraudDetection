Affairs Committee Power Marketers Working Group FROM Joe Hartsoe Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley Power Marketers Working Group Chair Julie Simon Vice President of Policy Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Erin Perrigo Manager of Policy DATE March RE Commission Actions to Increase Supply and Decrease Consumption in the Western United StatesKey Points for EPSA Comments Due MARCH TH As we previously reported on March FERC announced certain actions to address the energy problems in California and other areas of the West in an Order Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas Supply in the Western United States and Requesting Comments on Further Actions to Increase Energy Supply and Decrease Energy Consumption The following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to immediately help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure The Commission also invited comments on certain proposals This memo includes a list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March th Overview of Order The Order reflects a thorough review of all of FERCs rate and facility certification authorities in the areas of electric energy natural gas hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy supply however the Commission noted that its authority is somewhat limited While the Commission believes state regulators must assume the lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission as well as demand reduction measures the Commission noted that the impact of Californias energy shortage on the Western Interconnection underscores the regional interstate nature of the energy marketplace Accordingly it encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for western markets EPSA appreciates the Commissions effort to exercise the full extent of its authority to help ease the Wests energy problems Taken together the Commissions proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational solutions to the difficult circumstances in the West Most importantly the Order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment including increased generation transmission and natural gas pipeline facilities The Commissions immediate actions which will expire on December include Requiring the California ISO and transmission owners within the WSCC to provide FERC with a list of shortterm grid enhancements Extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities QF Providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup and selfgeneration for businesses with prior notice waivers and marketbased rate authorization Allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale marketbased rates The Commission seeks comment on several other proposals including Rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs Increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term year depreciation for shortterm transmission projects and year depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service by November Use of the interconnection authority set forth in FPA od to help alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load EPSAs Comments In its conclusion the Commission stated that comments should be concise and focused Accordingly we suggest that EPSAs comments focus on the following areas Applaud the Commissions effort to increase supplies from QFs but encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing QFs to sell to creditworthy parties We understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the relative merits of an incremental versus a rolled in approach to interconnection and upgrade costs Therefore while we may lack a consensus on the question as a final policy position we believe that the extreme circumstances surrounding the Order and the urgent need to move power quickly into the Western system make it wise to endorse FERCs instant recommendation The Commissions proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher ROEs and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps The Commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in regional transmission organizations However given the current situation and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher ROE EPSA could support this proposal Constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on the energy supply system Therefore the Commissions proposed waivers of blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects are favorable developments We will discuss the Order and EPSAs comments during tomorrows Regulatory AffairsPower Marketers conference call In addition we have been asked to consider what type of shortterm relief could be included in federal legislation We will discuss this question as well To access the call dial and ask for the Julie SimonEPSA call In the meantime if you have any questions please

Affairs Committee Power Marketers Working Group FROM Joe Hartsoe Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley Power Marketers Working Group Chair Julie Simon Vice President of Policy Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Erin Perrigo Manager of Policy DATE March RE Commission Actions to Increase Supply and Decrease Consumption in the Western United StatesKey Points for EPSA Comments Due MARCH TH As we previously reported on March FERC announced certain actions to address the energy problems in California and other areas of the West in an Order Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas Supply in the Western United States and Requesting Comments on Further Actions to Increase Energy Supply and Decrease Energy Consumption The following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to immediately help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure The Commission also invited comments on certain proposals This memo includes a list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March th Overview of Order The Order reflects a thorough review of all of FERCs rate and facility certification authorities in the areas of electric energy natural gas hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy supply however the Commission noted that its authority is somewhat limited While the Commission believes state regulators must assume the lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission as well as demand reduction measures the Commission noted that the impact of Californias energy shortage on the Western Interconnection underscores the regional interstate nature of the energy marketplace Accordingly it encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for western markets EPSA appreciates the Commissions effort to exercise the full extent of its authority to help ease the Wests energy problems Taken together the Commissions proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational solutions to the difficult circumstances in the West Most importantly the Order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment including increased generation transmission and natural gas pipeline facilities The Commissions immediate actions which will expire on December include Requiring the California ISO and transmission owners within the WSCC to provide FERC with a list of shortterm grid enhancements Extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities QF Providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup and selfgeneration for businesses with prior notice waivers and marketbased rate authorization Allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale marketbased rates The Commission seeks comment on several other proposals including Rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs Increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term year depreciation for shortterm transmission projects and year depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service by November Use of the interconnection authority set forth in FPA od to help alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load EPSAs Comments In its conclusion the Commission stated that comments should be concise and focused Accordingly we suggest that EPSAs comments focus on the following areas Applaud the Commissions effort to increase supplies from QFs but encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing QFs to sell to creditworthy parties We understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the relative merits of an incremental versus a rolled in approach to interconnection and upgrade costs Therefore while we may lack a consensus on the question as a final policy position we believe that the extreme circumstances surrounding the Order and the urgent need to move power quickly into the Western system make it wise to endorse FERCs instant recommendation The Commissions proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher ROEs and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps The Commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in regional transmission organizations However given the current situation and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher ROE EPSA could support this proposal Constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on the energy supply system Therefore the Commissions proposed waivers of blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects are favorable developments We will discuss the Order and EPSAs comments during tomorrows Regulatory AffairsPower Marketers conference call In addition we have been asked to consider what type of shortterm relief could be included in federal legislation We will discuss this question as well To access the call dial and ask for the Julie SimonEPSA call In the meantime if you have any questions please

Working Group FROM Jim Steffes Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley Power Marketers Working Group Chair Julie Simon Vice President of Policy Erin Perrigo Manager of Policy DATE May RE FERCs April th Order Establishing Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for California Wholesale Electric Markets On April th FERC issued an Order Establishing Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for the California Wholesale Electric Markets EPSA has previously forwarded FERCs press release outlining the major features of the Order along with a brief email explaining one confusing aspect of the Order This memo provides a more indepth analysis of the Order In addition we need to consider whether EPSA should seek rehearing or clarification of any aspect of this Order Filings would be due at FERC no later than Tuesday May th Based on a review of the order there are issues on which EPSA might seek rehearing which are outlined below We will discuss these issues on an upcoming weekly conference call If you have additional issues you want EPSA to raise please forward them to Julie Simon at or at APRIL th ORDER In this Order the Commission puts into place a market monitoring and mitigation plan for realtime energy markets in California that is intended to replace the MWh breakpoint plan adopted in the December th Order The mitigation plan will go into effect May th with the current MWh breakpoint and refund approach continued for an additional month Except for the demandside bidding program the plan will terminate not later than one year from the date of the Order However the monitoring and mitigation requirements are contingent on the three California utilities and the CAISO making an RTO filing consistent with the requirements of Order No by June The Order also initiates a Section investigation into the rates terms and conditions of public utility sales for resale of electric energy in the WSCC other than through the CAISO markets for all sales in realtime spot markets defined as up to hours in advance and when contingency reserves for any control area fall below percent The Commission states that its goal was to address the need for mitigation in as marketoriented a manner as possible so as not to discourage needed infrastructure investment while allowing price signals to create demand response The Order includes the following requirements Coordination and Control of Outages To ensure adequate capacity the Order stresses the need for the CAISO and generators to work cooperatively to schedule unit maintenance and outages The Commission stresses that the CAISOs requirements for outage coordination need to foster cooperation rather than establish punitive provisions either penalizing generators or the ISO The Order requires the CAISO to make a tariff filing within days proposing a mechanism for the coordination and control of outages including periodic reports to the Commission Comments on the tariff filing will be due within days Selling Obligations In creating a mustoffer obligation the Commissions goal is to ensure that all generating units that are able to run but are not scheduled in realtime will in fact be made available to the CAISO in the realtime markets Therefore the Order requires that all generators with Participating Generator Agreements PGAs all sellers selling into the CAISO markets that own generation in California and all sellers using the CAISO tariffs that own generation in California offer the CAISO all of their capacity in realtime during all hours it is available and not already scheduled to run through bilateral agreements The scope of this requirement includes nonjurisdictional nonpublic utility generators Stressing that all generators need to participate in helping to solve the problems in California the Commission concludes that a generator that has capacity available in realtime would under competitive conditions be willing to sell that energy at a price that covers its marginal costs All generators are also subject to the price mitigation plan as well including the required filing of heat rate and emission data described below The Commission also clarifies certain issues First no generator will be required to run in violation of its certificate or applicable law However the Commission finds that environmental limitations are stateimposed and the question of whether units can run outside proscribed environmental limits and at what cost are within the control of the state Generators will be permitted to recover environmental mitigation costs presumably by justifying a bid above the proxy price Second because of its unique characteristics hydroelectric power is exempt from this requirement Finally the Commission rejects the concerns of generators that they need to withhold capacity to cover the risk of a generating unit tripping off line In that circumstance the generator will pay no more than the realtime market clearing price to replace that energy which is what it is being paid to make the energy available to the CAISO Thus it should be indifferent to selling all available capacity into the CAISO realtime market Demand Response Each public utility purchasing power in the CAISOs realtime market will be required by June to submit demandside bids indicating the price at which load will be curtailed and identify that load The bids are to include the maximum price that the purchaser is willing to pay for specific amounts of energy and the loads on its system that will be curtailed when the realtime energy price exceeds that bid This is the only aspect of the Commissions plan that will not expire within one year Price Mitigation in the Realtime Auction During Reserve Deficiencies During all periods when Stage or emergencies are in effect ie when reserves fall below percent certain price mitigation procedures will apply to the market clearing auction for the realtime market The following explains those as we understand them The language in the order is quite confusing and may be open to more than one interpretation First all gasfired generators are required to submit to the Commission and the CAISO on a confidential basis the heat rate and emission rate for each generator Second each day by am the CAISO will publish a daily gas price using an average of the daily prices published in the prior days Gas Daily for all California delivery points The CAISO will also publish an emission cost using data from Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services also for the prior day In establishing the market clearing price for its realtime market the CAISO will calculate the fuel and emission costs for the marginal unit using the previously supplied confidential data and the published gas and emission costs plus a addon for operating and maintenance expenses That calculated cost or proxy price for the marginal unit will be used to set the market clearing price for that hour Any generator that submits a bid higher than the proxy price calculated by the CAISO will be paid what it bids subject to refund and justification but that bid will not set the market clearing price Any generator that submits a bid lower than the proxy price will receive the market clearing price and not be subject to any refund liability Justification of higher prices must be submitted to the Commission within days of the end of the month and must include a detailed breakdown of all of the component costs Opportunity costs may not be included because of the Commissions belief that no opportunity costs exist in realtime markets Bids from resources outside California can elect the marketclearing price or submit their own bids Those bids will not be used to set the marketclearing price In addition marketers can elect the marketclearing price or submit their own bids Bids above the marketclearing price must be justified based on the prices paid for power Conditions on Marketbased Rate Authority The Order raises new concerns about certain bidding practices that may suggest anticompetitive behavior The Commission specifically identifies two types of prohibited bidding practices that will be subject to increased scrutiny refunds andor suspension of market based rate authority The first prohibited bidding practice occurs when bids vary with unit output in a manner that is unrelated to the known performance characteristics of the unit Known as hockey stick bids this involves bids where the last megawatts are bid at excessively high prices relative to the other capacity from the unit The other identified prohibited practice involves bids that vary over time in a manner that appears unrelated to changes in the units performance or changes in the supply environment that would induce additional risk This type of bidding increases prices only in response to increased demand or reduced reserve margins and it timed to public announcements of system conditions or outages in the bidders portfolio Monitoring The CAISO will be required to provide the Commission with weekly reports of CAISO schedule outage and bid data The CAISO is to identify any concerns it has about bidding practices in those weekly reports The Commission is maintaining the current six month time period for keeping bid information confidential On September th and quarterly thereafter the CAISO is required to file a report with the Commission analyzing how the mitigation plan is operating as well as the progress made in developing new generation and demand side response Comments on the CAISO reports will be due within days CAISO Market Stabilization Plan The Commission offered little comment on the CAISOs market stabilization plan but does note that the proposals for dayahead and hourahead energy markets go beyond the scope of this proceeding and should be filed under Section so that all parties can review the proposals The CAISO is specifically directed not to go forward with any plans such as the purchase of computer equipment or software until the Commission has reviewed and accepted the filing In an unrelated section the Commission notes that it will address allegations about the ISOs lack of independence and its governance procedures in a later order Escrow for Past Unpaid Bills The Commission invites comments within days on whether the CAISO should be required to institute on a prospective basis a surcharge on power sales that would be maintained in an escrow account to cover the three IOUs unpaid bills to generators The Commission specifically seeks comments on whether increased production would be tied to an increased likelihood that generators will be paid WestWide Investigation As noted above the Commission is instituting an investigation into the rates terms and conditions of public utility sales of electric energy in the WSCC other than through the CAISO markets The investigation is limited to energy sold in what the Commission terms realtime spot markets which is defined as hours in advance and under conditions when contingency reserves as defined by the WSCC for any control area fall below percent The Commission also invites comments on whether the mustoffer and price mitigation rules contained in this Order for California should be applied to the WSCC Comments are due May th and EPSA is preparing draft comments for members to review shortly POSSIBLE AREAS FOR REHEARING ANDOR CLARIFICATION There are several areas where EPSA may want to seek rehearing andor clarification of the Commissions Order Given the current makeup of the CAISO Board we have grave concerns about releasing confidential heat rate and emission data to the CAISO Since the Board is clearly working at the behest of the Governor that commercially sensitive data could easily end up with DWR which is actively negotiating contracts to purchase power from these units In addition we have concerns about the CAISOs ability to protect this data since similarly confidential information from the CAISOs market monitoring unit has appeared in the Los Angeles Times The Commission should ensure that only an independent entity not the CAISO have access to this data The actual operation of the price mitigation is confusing and amenable to several interpretations The Commission should clarify possibly with examples how the marketclearing price will be calculated and the effect of the marketclearing price on a variety of bids The discussion of second category of prohibited bids is unclear The Commission appears to be saying that bids that value scarcity are prohibited but this makes little economic or practical sense Do we agree with the Commissions conclusion that a generator is indifferent in realtime to receiving the market clearing price for its asavailable energy when it may need to energy to selfsupply reserves if a unit trips off Are there operational concerns that make this economic tradeoff unworkable We will need to educate the Commission if we want to raise this issue

Affairs Committee Power Marketers Working Group FROM Joe Hartsoe Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley Power Marketers Working Group Chair Julie Simon Vice President of Policy Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Erin Perrigo Manager of Policy DATE March RE Commission Actions to Increase Supply and Decrease Consumption in the Western United StatesKey Points for EPSA Comments Due MARCH TH As we previously reported on March FERC announced certain actions to address the energy problems in California and other areas of the West in an Order Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas Supply in the Western United States and Requesting Comments on Further Actions to Increase Energy Supply and Decrease Energy Consumption The following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to immediately help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure The Commission also invited comments on certain proposals This memo includes a list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March th Overview of Order The Order reflects a thorough review of all of FERCs rate and facility certification authorities in the areas of electric energy natural gas hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy supply however the Commission noted that its authority is somewhat limited While the Commission believes state regulators must assume the lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission as well as demand reduction measures the Commission noted that the impact of Californias energy shortage on the Western Interconnection underscores the regional interstate nature of the energy marketplace Accordingly it encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for western markets EPSA appreciates the Commissions effort to exercise the full extent of its authority to help ease the Wests energy problems Taken together the Commissions proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational solutions to the difficult circumstances in the West Most importantly the Order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment including increased generation transmission and natural gas pipeline facilities The Commissions immediate actions which will expire on December include Requiring the California ISO and transmission owners within the WSCC to provide FERC with a list of shortterm grid enhancements Extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities QF Providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup and selfgeneration for businesses with prior notice waivers and marketbased rate authorization Allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale marketbased rates The Commission seeks comment on several other proposals including Rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs Increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term year depreciation for shortterm transmission projects and year depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service by November Use of the interconnection authority set forth in FPA od to help alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load EPSAs Comments In its conclusion the Commission stated that comments should be concise and focused Accordingly we suggest that EPSAs comments focus on the following areas Applaud the Commissions effort to increase supplies from QFs but encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing QFs to sell to creditworthy parties We understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the relative merits of an incremental versus a rolled in approach to interconnection and upgrade costs Therefore while we may lack a consensus on the question as a final policy position we believe that the extreme circumstances surrounding the Order and the urgent need to move power quickly into the Western system make it wise to endorse FERCs instant recommendation The Commissions proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher ROEs and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps The Commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in regional transmission organizations However given the current situation and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher ROE EPSA could support this proposal Constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on the energy supply system Therefore the Commissions proposed waivers of blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects are favorable developments We will discuss the Order and EPSAs comments during tomorrows Regulatory AffairsPower Marketers conference call In addition we have been asked to consider what type of shortterm relief could be included in federal legislation We will discuss this question as well To access the call dial and ask for the Julie SimonEPSA call In the meantime if you have any questions please

Working Group FROM Jim Steffes Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley Power Marketers Working Group Chair Julie Simon Vice President of Policy Erin Perrigo Manager of Policy DATE May RE FERCs April th Order Establishing Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for California Wholesale Electric Markets On April th FERC issued an Order Establishing Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for the California Wholesale Electric Markets EPSA has previously forwarded FERCs press release outlining the major features of the Order along with a brief email explaining one confusing aspect of the Order This memo provides a more indepth analysis of the Order In addition we need to consider whether EPSA should seek rehearing or clarification of any aspect of this Order Filings would be due at FERC no later than Tuesday May th Based on a review of the order there are issues on which EPSA might seek rehearing which are outlined below We will discuss these issues on an upcoming weekly conference call If you have additional issues you want EPSA to raise please forward them to Julie Simon at or at APRIL th ORDER In this Order the Commission puts into place a market monitoring and mitigation plan for realtime energy markets in California that is intended to replace the MWh breakpoint plan adopted in the December th Order The mitigation plan will go into effect May th with the current MWh breakpoint and refund approach continued for an additional month Except for the demandside bidding program the plan will terminate not later than one year from the date of the Order However the monitoring and mitigation requirements are contingent on the three California utilities and the CAISO making an RTO filing consistent with the requirements of Order No by June The Order also initiates a Section investigation into the rates terms and conditions of public utility sales for resale of electric energy in the WSCC other than through the CAISO markets for all sales in realtime spot markets defined as up to hours in advance and when contingency reserves for any control area fall below percent The Commission states that its goal was to address the need for mitigation in as marketoriented a manner as possible so as not to discourage needed infrastructure investment while allowing price signals to create demand response The Order includes the following requirements Coordination and Control of Outages To ensure adequate capacity the Order stresses the need for the CAISO and generators to work cooperatively to schedule unit maintenance and outages The Commission stresses that the CAISOs requirements for outage coordination need to foster cooperation rather than establish punitive provisions either penalizing generators or the ISO The Order requires the CAISO to make a tariff filing within days proposing a mechanism for the coordination and control of outages including periodic reports to the Commission Comments on the tariff filing will be due within days Selling Obligations In creating a mustoffer obligation the Commissions goal is to ensure that all generating units that are able to run but are not scheduled in realtime will in fact be made available to the CAISO in the realtime markets Therefore the Order requires that all generators with Participating Generator Agreements PGAs all sellers selling into the CAISO markets that own generation in California and all sellers using the CAISO tariffs that own generation in California offer the CAISO all of their capacity in realtime during all hours it is available and not already scheduled to run through bilateral agreements The scope of this requirement includes nonjurisdictional nonpublic utility generators Stressing that all generators need to participate in helping to solve the problems in California the Commission concludes that a generator that has capacity available in realtime would under competitive conditions be willing to sell that energy at a price that covers its marginal costs All generators are also subject to the price mitigation plan as well including the required filing of heat rate and emission data described below The Commission also clarifies certain issues First no generator will be required to run in violation of its certificate or applicable law However the Commission finds that environmental limitations are stateimposed and the question of whether units can run outside proscribed environmental limits and at what cost are within the control of the state Generators will be permitted to recover environmental mitigation costs presumably by justifying a bid above the proxy price Second because of its unique characteristics hydroelectric power is exempt from this requirement Finally the Commission rejects the concerns of generators that they need to withhold capacity to cover the risk of a generating unit tripping off line In that circumstance the generator will pay no more than the realtime market clearing price to replace that energy which is what it is being paid to make the energy available to the CAISO Thus it should be indifferent to selling all available capacity into the CAISO realtime market Demand Response Each public utility purchasing power in the CAISOs realtime market will be required by June to submit demandside bids indicating the price at which load will be curtailed and identify that load The bids are to include the maximum price that the purchaser is willing to pay for specific amounts of energy and the loads on its system that will be curtailed when the realtime energy price exceeds that bid This is the only aspect of the Commissions plan that will not expire within one year Price Mitigation in the Realtime Auction During Reserve Deficiencies During all periods when Stage or emergencies are in effect ie when reserves fall below percent certain price mitigation procedures will apply to the market clearing auction for the realtime market The following explains those as we understand them The language in the order is quite confusing and may be open to more than one interpretation First all gasfired generators are required to submit to the Commission and the CAISO on a confidential basis the heat rate and emission rate for each generator Second each day by am the CAISO will publish a daily gas price using an average of the daily prices published in the prior days Gas Daily for all California delivery points The CAISO will also publish an emission cost using data from Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services also for the prior day In establishing the market clearing price for its realtime market the CAISO will calculate the fuel and emission costs for the marginal unit using the previously supplied confidential data and the published gas and emission costs plus a addon for operating and maintenance expenses That calculated cost or proxy price for the marginal unit will be used to set the market clearing price for that hour Any generator that submits a bid higher than the proxy price calculated by the CAISO will be paid what it bids subject to refund and justification but that bid will not set the market clearing price Any generator that submits a bid lower than the proxy price will receive the market clearing price and not be subject to any refund liability Justification of higher prices must be submitted to the Commission within days of the end of the month and must include a detailed breakdown of all of the component costs Opportunity costs may not be included because of the Commissions belief that no opportunity costs exist in realtime markets Bids from resources outside California can elect the marketclearing price or submit their own bids Those bids will not be used to set the marketclearing price In addition marketers can elect the marketclearing price or submit their own bids Bids above the marketclearing price must be justified based on the prices paid for power Conditions on Marketbased Rate Authority The Order raises new concerns about certain bidding practices that may suggest anticompetitive behavior The Commission specifically identifies two types of prohibited bidding practices that will be subject to increased scrutiny refunds andor suspension of market based rate authority The first prohibited bidding practice occurs when bids vary with unit output in a manner that is unrelated to the known performance characteristics of the unit Known as hockey stick bids this involves bids where the last megawatts are bid at excessively high prices relative to the other capacity from the unit The other identified prohibited practice involves bids that vary over time in a manner that appears unrelated to changes in the units performance or changes in the supply environment that would induce additional risk This type of bidding increases prices only in response to increased demand or reduced reserve margins and it timed to public announcements of system conditions or outages in the bidders portfolio Monitoring The CAISO will be required to provide the Commission with weekly reports of CAISO schedule outage and bid data The CAISO is to identify any concerns it has about bidding practices in those weekly reports The Commission is maintaining the current six month time period for keeping bid information confidential On September th and quarterly thereafter the CAISO is required to file a report with the Commission analyzing how the mitigation plan is operating as well as the progress made in developing new generation and demand side response Comments on the CAISO reports will be due within days CAISO Market Stabilization Plan The Commission offered little comment on the CAISOs market stabilization plan but does note that the proposals for dayahead and hourahead energy markets go beyond the scope of this proceeding and should be filed under Section so that all parties can review the proposals The CAISO is specifically directed not to go forward with any plans such as the purchase of computer equipment or software until the Commission has reviewed and accepted the filing In an unrelated section the Commission notes that it will address allegations about the ISOs lack of independence and its governance procedures in a later order Escrow for Past Unpaid Bills The Commission invites comments within days on whether the CAISO should be required to institute on a prospective basis a surcharge on power sales that would be maintained in an escrow account to cover the three IOUs unpaid bills to generators The Commission specifically seeks comments on whether increased production would be tied to an increased likelihood that generators will be paid WestWide Investigation As noted above the Commission is instituting an investigation into the rates terms and conditions of public utility sales of electric energy in the WSCC other than through the CAISO markets The investigation is limited to energy sold in what the Commission terms realtime spot markets which is defined as hours in advance and under conditions when contingency reserves as defined by the WSCC for any control area fall below percent The Commission also invites comments on whether the mustoffer and price mitigation rules contained in this Order for California should be applied to the WSCC Comments are due May th and EPSA is preparing draft comments for members to review shortly POSSIBLE AREAS FOR REHEARING ANDOR CLARIFICATION There are several areas where EPSA may want to seek rehearing andor clarification of the Commissions Order Given the current makeup of the CAISO Board we have grave concerns about releasing confidential heat rate and emission data to the CAISO Since the Board is clearly working at the behest of the Governor that commercially sensitive data could easily end up with DWR which is actively negotiating contracts to purchase power from these units In addition we have concerns about the CAISOs ability to protect this data since similarly confidential information from the CAISOs market monitoring unit has appeared in the Los Angeles Times The Commission should ensure that only an independent entity not the CAISO have access to this data The actual operation of the price mitigation is confusing and amenable to several interpretations The Commission should clarify possibly with examples how the marketclearing price will be calculated and the effect of the marketclearing price on a variety of bids The discussion of second category of prohibited bids is unclear The Commission appears to be saying that bids that value scarcity are prohibited but this makes little economic or practical sense Do we agree with the Commissions conclusion that a generator is indifferent in realtime to receiving the market clearing price for its asavailable energy when it may need to energy to selfsupply reserves if a unit trips off Are there operational concerns that make this economic tradeoff unworkable We will need to educate the Commission if we want to raise this issue

Committee Power Marketers Working Group FROM Joe Hartsoe Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley Power Marketers Working Group Chair Julie Simon Vice President of Policy Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Erin Perrigo Manager of Policy DATE March RE Commission Actions to Increase Supply and Decrease Consumption in the Western United StatesKey Points for EPSA Comments Due MARCH TH As we previously reported on March FERC announced certain actions to address the energy problems in California and other areas of the West in an Order Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas Supply in the Western United States and Requesting Comments on Further Actions to Increase Energy Supply and Decrease Energy Consumption The following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to immediately help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure The Commission also invited comments on certain proposals This memo includes a list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March th Overview of Order The Order reflects a thorough review of all of FERCs rate and facility certification authorities in the areas of electric energy natural gas hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy supply however the Commission noted that its authority is somewhat limited While the Commission believes state regulators must assume the lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission as well as demand reduction measures the Commission noted that the impact of Californias energy shortage on the Western Interconnection underscores the regional interstate nature of the energy marketplace Accordingly it encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for western markets EPSA appreciates the Commissions effort to exercise the full extent of its authority to help ease the Wests energy problems Taken together the Commissions proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational solutions to the difficult circumstances in the West Most importantly the Order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment including increased generation transmission and natural gas pipeline facilities The Commissions immediate actions which will expire on December include Requiring the California ISO and transmission owners within the WSCC to provide FERC with a list of shortterm grid enhancements Extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities QF Providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup and selfgeneration for businesses with prior notice waivers and marketbased rate authorization Allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale marketbased rates The Commission seeks comment on several other proposals including Rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs Increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term year depreciation for shortterm transmission projects and year depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service by November Use of the interconnection authority set forth in FPA od to help alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load EPSAs Comments In its conclusion the Commission stated that comments should be concise and focused Accordingly we suggest that EPSAs comments focus on the following areas Applaud the Commissions effort to increase supplies from QFs but encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing QFs to sell to creditworthy parties We understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the relative merits of an incremental versus a rolled in approach to interconnection and upgrade costs Therefore while we may lack a consensus on the question as a final policy position we believe that the extreme circumstances surrounding the Order and the urgent need to move power quickly into the Western system make it wise to endorse FERCs instant recommendation The Commissions proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher ROEs and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps The Commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in regional transmission organizations However given the current situation and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher ROE EPSA could support this proposal Constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on the energy supply system Therefore the Commissions proposed waivers of blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects are favorable developments We will discuss the Order and EPSAs comments during tomorrows Regulatory AffairsPower Marketers conference call In addition we have been asked to consider what type of shortterm relief could be included in federal legislation We will discuss this question as well To access the call dial and ask for the Julie SimonEPSA call In the meantime if you have any questions please

Legislative Affairs Committee EPSA Regulatory Affairs Committee EPSA Power Marketers Working Group EPSA NAERO Working Group FROM Scott A Weiner Legislative Affairs Committee Chair Jim Steffes Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Bob Reilley Power Marketers Working Group Chair Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Donn J Salvosa Manager of Government Affairs DATE August RE August th Joint LegislativeRegulatory Affairs Meeting on Reliability Legislation Summary of EPSA Position Exploration of Future Initiatives The August th Meeting On August th the EPSAs Legislative and Regulatory Affairs Committees met to review and discuss existing proposals on reliability legislation Dave Nevius of NERC explained the current draft of the socalled stakeholder consensus bill and Bobby Lamb presented the competing proposal being advanced by PJM After these presentations Nevius and Lamb responded to numerous questions Thereafter EPSA members discussed the relative merits of the two proposals concluding with a straw poll indicating support for exploring an alternative to NERCs bill Specifically EPSA members expressed general dissatisfaction with the new streamlined version of the NERC bill Additionally serious doubts exist regarding the possibility of revising the language in the NERC bill in any way that would make it acceptable General observations about the fundamental aspects of the NERC bill indicated that people are not comfortable shifting authority away form FERC to an overly complex prescriptive organization with uncertain delegations of enforcement authority to regional entities apparently successors to existing Regional Reliability Councils Regarding alternatives there was consensus that the general approach contained in the PJM proposal subject to additional work to resolve several weaknesses could become an acceptable vehicle for addressing reliability issues While EPSA members clearly are leaning toward the PJM bill the proposals raises serious questions concerning the states role regarding adequacy and their right to adopt more stringent standards based upon compelling need even if inconsistent with national standards and limited provision for coordination with Canada and Mexico The PJM Proposal PJMs proposal contains a number of positive aspects including Its simplicity it is only pages long Members and staff on Capitol Hill have repeatedly pleaded for a shorter version of reliability legislation The PJM proposal is at least pages shorter than the NERC bill FERC and the RTOs would have primary jurisdiction over development and enforcement of reliability standards The NERC language gives substantial deference to the ERO in all likelihood NERC reformed in ways that are not yet clear or certain and accompanying ARREs successors to the Regional Reliability Councils EISB With the expected approval of the formation of EISB at the upcoming meeting of the GISB Board on September th coupled with strong support from FERC Commissioners Wood Brownell and Massey the PJM proposal allows an opportunity to incorporate EISB The NERC bill is unclear how an EISB would be accommodated if at all Some issues raising concern which need to be addressed include State role the language contains a savings provision which would defer to each state to enforce standards within their boundaries Only through applications from affected parties can FERC review state actions and may delay such state action although it does not specifically state that it can prevent it International issues specifically interfaces with Canada and Mexico The language expresses the need to establish harmonious reliability standards with each country throughout the North American region While simply instructing FERC to do so PJMs proposal may need to more clearly explain how to this would be accomplished Variances The NERC language presently allows for interconnection wide variances The WSCC favors this approach and the Senate Energy Committee with the bulk of its membership from the west region may have something to say about the lack of ability for a region to request a variance Whether or not a compromise can be formulated is something we will need to explore Next Steps The game plan is to open a dialogue with proponents of the PJM bill in order to discuss how best to improve the language to remove potential obstacles to its attracting wider support While this memo summarizes several key issues there may be others which will need to be discussed Please bring these ideas up for discussion during the NAERO Working Group conference call scheduled for Tuesday September at pm EDT including any suggested language and changes to improve the PJM proposal To access the call dial and ask for the EPSAMark
