<10287311.1075845186841.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,soblander@carrfut.com,2001-06-04 14:22:54, Implementation of Amendments on Use of Letters of CreditFpst Notice June TO All NYMEX Division and COMEX Division Clearing Members FROM Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President RE Implementation of Amendments on Use of Letters of Credit Certain Securities and Deliverable Warehouse Receipts as Margin for NYMEX and COMEX Transactions DATE June Implementation of Rule Amendments As previously announced in Notice to Members May this Notice is to remind NYMEX and COMEX Clearing Members of rule amendments that become effective today June that expand the types of noncash assets that customers may deposit with their Clearing Members for margin purposes Exchange Form for PassThrough Letters of Credit Clearing Members are further advised that a form has been prepared by the Exchange that will serve as the authorized uniform form for irrevocable letters of credit for use on a passthrough basis at the Exchange This form may be obtained from the Exchanges Clearing Department Exchange Form for PassThrough Letters of Credit Specification of Joint Beneficiary The PassThrough Letter of Credit differs from the Standard Letter of Credit in that the PassThrough Letter of Credit provides for Joint Beneficiaries In this regard a PassThrough Letter of Credit to be used as margin on the NYMEX Division should specify NYMEX as one of the Joint Beneficiaries By comparison a PassThrough Letter of Credit to be used as margin on the COMEX Division should specify the COMEX Clearing Association as one of the Joint Beneficiaries Restriction on Issuers of Letters of Credit Please note that under applicable NYMEX and COMEX rules a Clearing Member that is a bank subsidiary or is an affiliate of a bank may not deposit with the applicable Clearing House a letter of credit issued or confirmed by such bank bank parent or affiliate bank As to the actual rule amendments which are attached below these rule changes permit the use of letters of credit certain securities and deliverable warehouse receipts by customers to meet their margin requirements The rule changes provide for consistent treatment in the use of such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX Divisions Letters of Credit As a result of the rule changes letters of credit LCs now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions Use of Letters of Credit on PassThrough Basis In addition the rule changes allow letters of credit to be used on a passthrough basis on both divisions In other words Clearing Members on both divisions will be able to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by customers It should be noted that while securities and deliverable warehouse receipts as detailed below may be used by customers for margin purposes such assets may not be used on a passthrough basis by a Clearing Member to meet its margin obligations with the clearinghouse Securities Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing Members certain types of securities as margin The types of acceptable securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some time on the COMEX Division Specifically the rule changes will permit customers to deposit the following types of securities as margin with Clearing Members on either division securities listed for trading on the New York Stock

COMEX MEMBERS FROM Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President DATE December RE Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading on NYMEX ACCESS The purpose of this Notice is to remind Members and Member Firms that an Executive Committee Resolution that was ratified by the Board of Directors and that concerns Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS Resolution remains in effect and will continue until February unless Members are notified otherwise by the Exchange As background on October the Exchange issued a Notice to Members advising Members and Member Firms that the CFTC had approved this Resolution The Resolution which became effective with the commencement of the NYMEX ACCESS session on Sunday October has amended on a temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS The Resolution is included below The Resolution was issued so as to ensure the successful reimplementation of the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESS By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to trading activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS the Resolution reduces the possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality The Resolution amends on a temporary basis Exchange price fluctuation limit rules but only with respect to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS Thus the new price limits that went into effect last week for Natural Gas are further expanded as provided by the terms of the Resolution The Resolution amends the Exchanges price fluctuation limit rules with regard to trading on NYMEX ACCESS in four ways The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits are expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months for energy contracts or to the first contract month with limits in effect for metals contracts of that futures contract under the applicable rule This expanded limit eg of the limits for the front two months for energy contracts is applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer trading on NYMEX ACCESS generally would be halted immediately rather than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes During the last minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS session the market would be halted only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits As a clarification the Resolution suspends use of certain haircuts narrowing price limits based on notional settlement prices Specifically NYMEX Rule Settlement Prices and Price Fluctuation Limits for NYMEX ACCESS establishes the use of notional settlement prices as the base point for price limits until the actual settlement prices from the RTH session can be input into the system NYMEX ACCESS will continue to use such notional settlement prices under the Resolution However Rule reduces applicable price limits by certain specified percentages during the period when notional settlement prices are used as the base point for establishing limits Such haircuts are not being used under the Resolution the Exchange will resume use of such haircuts following the expiration of the Resolution Finally the Resolution also clarifies one aspect of existing Exchange practice In the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to Regular Trading Hours RTH trading then the RTH session would open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule This practice will continue to be followed during the period when the Resolution is in effect even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYMEX ACCESS trading session because the market had not hit the expanded limits applicable only to NYMEX ACCESS As noted these temporary amendments to the Exchanges price limits shall expire on February unless Members are notified otherwise by the Exchange If you have any questions please contact Stu Homler Director NYMEX ACCESS Operations NYMEX ACCESS Department at Matt Morano NYMEX ACCESS Department at or Brian Regan Senior Associate General Counsel at APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that until further notice the price fluctuation limit rules for each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits shall be expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the applicable rule This expanded limit of the limits for the first two months with limits shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low price fluctuation limit trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately except as directed otherwise by the President or the Presidents designee Following resumption of trading the price limits in effect shall be of the limits applicable to RTH trading In the event that a limit is touched during the last minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session the market shall be halted briefly and price limits shall be expanded thereafter In addition in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded for five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS session at a price fluctuation limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session then the RTH session shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule even though no temporary cessation of
