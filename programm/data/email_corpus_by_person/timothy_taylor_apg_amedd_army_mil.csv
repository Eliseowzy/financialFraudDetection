them easily having to hunt for them is additional stress you WONT need at that point File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where it was stolen this proves to credit providers you were diligent and is a first step toward an investigation if there ever is one But heres what is perhaps most important Call the three national credit reporting organizations immediately to place a fraud
