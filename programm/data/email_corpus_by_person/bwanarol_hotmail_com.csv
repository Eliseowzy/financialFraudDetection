tickled the keyboard and thought about all yall for a spell and that is not how it ought to be so stop your grinnin and drop your linen not sure what that means but i dig it and let us repair to the chat room started a new job just last week and by all means it is a Godsend blasphemous would that i had found this school a couple of years back as it is wellrun and full of good folks by the latter i mean folks who are here for the long run or at least a good while and not fresh off the boat perhaps the best aspect of it is a hr workweek while the most abominable is twofold i gots to sport a nametag and a wristwatch and i reckon the former is the lesser evil even though it is as goofy as Bill Morris the only times i have voluntarily donned a watch were deb parties back in the day got a black running watch to go with the tux and showed it off something fierce back in the idolworship days of namu and ricardo and stevo at any rate that is the good news and i can feel yall waiting with bated breath for the bad stuff here goes last month had a weeklong hiking trip to the japanese alps a big ol hunk of honshu virtually unknown and unexplored by the japanese as they cordoned it off as an abode for their shinto psuedodeities planned and set off with a native lady friend guide on our first day of hiking she sees fit to slip off a log bridge and faceplant some two meters down onto a rock with nary a limb or digit to break the fall can you say ouch she couldnt knocked out cold with a visibly growing pool of blood about her noggin and limbs splayed in a most unnatural Deliverancetype manner enter the hero rolland you say well not really ran over there and did all the things one knows not to do to a potential headneck injury and checked her out skull was not in pieces and after cleaning up the mess we discovered a smashed face instead had to hike back several kilometers to a hut and thence to an ambulance hospital revealed a broken nose severely lacerated lips and two teeth knocked out poor girl hey but hey i was the one escorting leon spinks back to osaka on the train with alpine dreams in the rubbish bin what is the bottom line you ask as always better her than me that was probably more than yall wanted to know about that but it really spooked me even more than being privy to the intimate details of the condition of susans overworked nipple how is that nipple susan and that was a good move blowing off elizabeth for emily yall and concerning kudos how about our basque following in my very own ubersuccesful footsteps and putting her nose to the grindstone to become a teacher good on you just the thought of it makes us want to jump for joy get some oxygen and repeat oh happy day over and over and it brings us to take a moment and reflect about our various occupations and their contributions to society which could well be graded as follows John the Healer the guy actually saves lives a tough act to top Julie the Developer enables young people aka the future to form their little craniums and warns them against going to law school Doug the Facilitator helps doctors help patients Moi the Ambassador doing my part to further international understanding by means of instruction and exchanges of culture as well as bodily fluids Stevo the WheelerDealer not really sure what he does but a reliable and consistent contributor to the national GNP also sires chilluns easy on the eye so gets an honorable mention for that Danna Susan Jean Helen Yvonne the Mamas doing a guten job but for the purposes of this list yall represent neutrality Maury the Beltway Insider nuff said only your professed desire to escape and recover some semblence of sanity puts you above Richard the Suit doesnt chase ambulances but as Enron is a big mofo company you can bet that he is an integral part of the energyprocuring wing of the militaryindustrial complex and as such is one of Them probably knows who killed JFK and is rumored to be the Grand Poobah of the Masonic Lodge the list goes on but then we come to Camille the Investor Extraordinaire not exactly a negative contribution to society but still sold crystal and brazos riverfront property lost moi a whole heap of cashish so brings up the bottom on the whole a rather notable family more inclined to give than to take for the most part almost chokes us up to think about it truth be known i have been thinking about yall as of late and might be close to setting a date to come on back to hallowed soil no reason to set any dates as chisel is far from stone at this point but it shant be too long methinks john the eldest and danna the nappiest yall should have received letters by now let us know if that is not the case well i just scrolled up and found to my dismay this is not as funny as i had intended oh well it is better than nothing i think as nothing in regard to correspondence is something with which i am well acquainted exception stevo someone give a holler hope all yall are well and lording over all you survey in your pure unadulterated Aryan splendour i remain chillin never illin in my mouth i gots fillins the Ralai Lama Get Free Email and Do

<10705755.1075860517111.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bwanarol@hotmail.com,2000-02-12 11:46:00,morning evening or afternoon as the case may be tribal elders i beseech you cast down your buckets where you are and cease the drudgery in which you are surely engaged lend me your eyes and thoughts for a spell and you shall be rewarded with firsthand accounts of asian adventure and twofisted derringdo featuring He Who Bears the Sanders Banner in the land of rice eaters heed the clarion call o clansmen o mine as this note will attempt to be as joyous as it will triumphant the mood just now is flatout stellar much akin to that often encountered as one turns back onto the hardtop with the smell of wet retriever and dead duck wafting about cowboys pregame on the radio and the promise of a stop at Charlie and Georges on the way home to the ritual shit shower and shave before settling on down with Camille to watch the Boys wallop some hapless pretender so ridiculously that even Johnston starts getting carries Lord those were the salad days i can definitely sense Brother Steve waxing nostalgic now i must relate what happened last week as it continues to be a ginormous smile left my backpack on a crowded subway one morn last week which in and of itself caused no great consternation until i recalled that the George Clinton PFunk tickets were inside along with the supposedly great Kafka book i had been reading can you say ouch believe yall me my utterings were of a more expletive type and the next few days were filled with more Homer headslaps doh and chinese communiststyle written self criticisms than i care to remember but then it turned up at the Lost and Found with everything accounted for and the staff even apologized for having thrown out the rice and veggie box lunch i had prepared silly buggers even cleaned the tupperware there are times when one truly has to hand it to the nipponese that kind of thing is very much the standard and it is a wonder to behold and Georgeas the funky man himself said free your mind and your ass will follow run dont walk to see the PFunk have been meaning to give yall a holler for a while now but as Scarface would say i have had my head up my culo mea culpa and apologies especially to susan and doug peerless purveyors of holiday cheer would even submit to a spanking but only from the foxy sistersinlaw provided they abstained from the type of buttockmissing beltwielding corporal antics by which our Great She Elephant used to brutalize our upper thighs and lower backs all is well here and this boys life has even gotten a wee saucy as of late due to the attentions of one Xiao Zhou a chinese woman with whom i spend time on occasion she has an X and a Zed in her name how cool is that she can scrounge up some mean dumplings and dotes on me something fierce both of which help with the rationalizations employed during the two hour train trips to Kyoto to see her she does not know miss shoe in case anyone wondered but she has eaten chicken brain the trip on down to Yakushima proved to be a much needed and wholly positive one in many ways the island is as lovely as one would expect of a World Heritage Site and i have never seen a rain forest give way to snowy mountains exceeding treeline just bizarre juxtapositions to behold like mossy rocks in a snowfield and huge gnarled cedar trees that are older than the J man and even Buddha four days of hiking up and over the main peak saw heaps of rain and snow every day with bouts of sunshine mixed in and yall can imagine my shortswearing self did not dally too long at any point along the trail which on the ridge was kneedeep in snow just outstanding scenery and i had almost forgotten my conviction that hikers are probably the most generous pleasant group of folks anywhere but one must be wary of the nipponese when it comes to the traditional snack sharing lest one be forced by protocol to choke down the smoked squid eggs and dried clams fried in seaweed foisted upon one as i was probably the highlight of this trip was the pair of hot springs i visited after descending that cold ass mountain the first of these consisted of three natural pools formed in the rock shore and only available when the tide goes out most of the time being submerged hit these on an exceptionally starry night and it was something else the other was on kyushu and may not qualify as a hot spring as there was no water involved only a sand bath it was pretty freaky to get buried under a foot of hot sand by old ladies with shovels but well worth it i always used to make fun of the nipponese propensity to take holidays to hot spring resorts but now i understand they can really do you right that was about it for the trip seven days and eight ferry rides oh yeah went to Chiran the staging base for most of the Okinawa campaign kamikazes aka Floating Chrysanthemums they have a museum chock full of last pictures and last letters home to families and loved ones pretty powerful museum that was on a somewhat deeper note have been thinking a lot about the old man lately i know not how often he crosses your minds mine not too often for obvious reasons but what with asian travels and chinese sauciness i feel like he would actually have taken a keen interest in some things i have been doing you know not just the sort of obligatory parental interest but on a personal level Lord knows none of us quite understood his fascination with this corner of the world i used to think that he must have entertained a healthy appreciation for the wimmins over here much like myself but considering the buxom alpha female he married that does not hold much water it is not so important now of course but there sure are some things i would like to have a chinwag with him about all yall too for that matter and it is coming in a matter of weeks some details have yet to be reckoned but this much is known april to may will see my return stateside it may sound like a lot of time but it aint so let me run this by yall either the weekend of april or saturdays it would be a good and great thing to gather at the pedernales with just the familia would be strike that from the record it will be so make haste to clear your calendar and pencil that in danna do what you can ricardo if your job is truly so highfalutin you should not have any trouble getting off namuski could we drive down friday morn john of the taj mahal i know you need notice and now you have it dearest mama if some horrid Angela Landsbury rerun is on youll just have to miss it stevo am coming to see your ass in orlando but i implore yall do not let something keep you away from the pedernales in april it has been many a moon and i need to visit with yall yall need to visit with each other we all need to pay homage to the Great SheElephant take friday off and get there for an extra day for Petes sake i will let you know which weekend shortly probably the th but not positive yet and figure yall do not want to have easter there it would seem as if a whole lot is happening with everyone john is building the casa and keeping it together in spite of the odds jean helen is going to drop come springtime doug is going to begin estrogen injections ricardo is going to continue to make something out of nothing and nothing out of something and danna is going to get back to hallowed ground at long last what a smile what a big smile that is best news i have heard since dad bought the pedernales did yall go down there rich doug and john alrighty then this has been monstrously long okay bye
