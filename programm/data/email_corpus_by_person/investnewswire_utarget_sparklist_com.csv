ISSUE Company Highlight DXStormcom CDNX DXS News Links This Weeks SmallCap Highlights COMPANY SPOTLIGHT DXStormcom CDNX DXS In October and November of InvestNewswire sent you information on DXStormcom an upandcoming ecommerce Application Service Provider ASP This week DXStorms president Mr Gregory Lowes included a special message with their third quarter results We have attached it for your benefit I am pleased to report that the companys third quarter has yielded positive results Operating revenues for the quarter ended March decreased approximately over the prior quarter to as compared to for the quarter ended December Operating revenues are all revenues for ecommerce service packages and related revenues and other revenues from custom development collocation hosting and other service fees In the second quarterly report I stated that management expected a reduction in monthly operating expenses of to be achieved by the end of the quarter ended March I am pleased to report that the monthly target has been achieved and further that expenditures for the entire quarter decreased to a reduction of from the previous quarter The loss for the quarter of or per share reflects a reduction of the loss over the previous quarter The company has taken extensive measures to manage costs and expenditures without compromising its ability to operate or fulfill its obligations to its clients and partners DXStorm remains capable of attracting and is prepared to take on further major Brand Partners As reported previously DXStorm remains focused on its partners past and upcoming as the most predominant source of new subscribers and revenues The management of DXStorm was introduced to the management of Peachtree Network Inc in early April of this year Through the course of many discussions and meetings both management teams recognized what we believe to be strong synergies and opportunities between the companies On April Peachtree Network Inc announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of DXStorm Further through a secured convertible debenture Peachtree would provide in funds to DXStorm in installments until June The transaction to acquire the shares of DXStorm is subject to the completion of due diligence by both companies final board approvals and approval by regulatory authorities Peachtree is an ecommerce ASP similar in many ways to DXStorm Peachtree has focused on the grocery sector and specifically on the larger businesses out of reach of DXStorm Sobeys and Intermarche as examples Peachtree is now migrating their solutions to address the other large surface retail sectors By combining the strengths of both companies management believes the opportunities for growth far exceeds those of the two companies standing alone Specifically management has identified several driving factors for the proposed acquisition of DXStorm by Peachtree Wider product services base all retailers from very small through DXStorms Partners to very large multinational retailers with thousands of stores the products services personnel and strategy of each of DXStorm and Peachtree are expected to remain as the companies join their operations Collectively reduced costs in the short and long terms Increased global market access for DXStorm products through Peachtrees global network and relationships Increased collective marketing and sales capabilities More rapid deployment and development of services through technology and expertise exchange Stronger management to further increase sales and business development activities Synergies and opportunities through a number of mutual relationships The recent dotcom melt down has confirmed to management that the focus on serving bricks and mortar businesses is correct and is in fact critical to growth While the state of the public markets has contributed to removing many competitors from our sector the embrace of ecommerce and ASP delivered Information Technology services continues to expand rapidly The management of both companies believes that our growth opportunities are far greater as a joint force with merged strategy and execution in this growing market Our joint business plan anticipates profitability in less than months based on a conservative threeyear deployment of existing contracts only SympaticoLycos Sobeys Intermarche and others However continued sales and business development efforts driving factors in the union of the two companies are expected to shorten that path to profitability while dramatically increasing

THIS ISSUE Company Highlight Learncom IncOTCBB LRCM This Weeks Top News Links COMPANY SPOTLIGHT Learncom Inc Lloyd Singer President and CEO of Learncom OTCBB LRCM news in an open letter to shareholders provided the following recap of its strategy and progress since the company started its business in January Said Singer Our goal is to become the major supplier of soft skills training resources and related services in the highly fractionated billion training industry From humble beginnings with just twelve employees all shareholders or option holders housed in our warehouse in Bensenville Illinois weve been successful in acquiring four synergistic productcentric businesses with copyright or distribution rights to several thousand training videos CDROMs and elearning courses Two other acquisitions are anticipated for The same low overhead flat organization approach to the business that we started with has been a cornerstone of our corporate culture Build the salespower Encourage crossselling Reduce the redundant overheads inherent in an acquisition strategy Everybody an owner The first acquisition in January included the high quality video assets several hundred titles of WingsNet Inc and provided the foundation to get the business started By midyear we were cash neutral on just in sales and provided our backers with the confidence to fund further growth In August we acquired the stock of BNA Communications a year producerdistributor of high quality video courseware specializing in harassment prevention diversity and employment law The company had been a subsidiary of The Bureau of National Affairs the large Washington DC publisher and information provider to the legal and HR professions The business also included a startup consulting practice in the

A WINNING BALANCE II the sequel to the title of the same name which has generated revenues of over million and is believed to be the best selling diversity course in history These courses have been produced by ProGroup Inc a leading consulting company in the diversity area Another major change weve made with the BNAC business model is the sales approach For years BNAC had rejected the open sales model used in the training business In this model titles are sold by the producers own sales staff as well as through other distributors LearnCom has just signed a nonexclusive deal with a small but
