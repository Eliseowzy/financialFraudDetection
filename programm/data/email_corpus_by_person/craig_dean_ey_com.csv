HyzakSouthwestAUDITEYLLPUS on PM on PM To Randy A YNAmerica Internet cc Subject Related LA Times article LA TIMES HAS UT AND ON THE CUSP OF ANOTHER DYNASTY Big Talent and Soft Schedule Have Him Hooked on Horns CHRIS DUFRESNE Times Staff Writer AUSTIN Texas They havent cleared ground yet for the presidential helipad but its starting to feel a bit like the days when coach Darrell K Royal roamed the sidelines and Lyndon Baines Johnson literally dropped into Texas Memorial Stadium We always knew when he was coming because we could hear the helicopter Royal says of LBJ The Texas band would play Hail to the Chief He loved that At Royal cant shoot his age anymore but he still shoots a pretty good breeze He is standing next to his cart at the Barton Creek Golf Club regaling visitors with tall Texas tales When we were really jellyrolling it it was an exciting time Royal says Then like time Texas football slipped away It has been years since Royal retired and years since he coached the last of three national championship teams in Royal didnt figure to last long enough to see the revival let alone be a part of it But after a quartercentury of being a football plain state Texas has gone retro Royal has been summoned back from the pasture he had been put out to Texan George W Bush is electoral votes short of reclaiming the White House and Longhorn football may be on the cusp of another dynasty Pay no mind to the Associated Press preseason poll or the coaches annual weathervane tally Texas is No Yeah we knowTexas Coach Mack Brown cant believe it either Were in the top in most polls and we lost our last three games Brown says Dont bother us with details Mack its time to toot your Longhorns We say this knowing Texas may actually be a year away There are holes to fill at wide receiver and a quarterback controversy brewing between Major Applewhite and Chris Simms But cosmically this is the year Bush and Texas can go over the top together The Longhorns have starters returning from last years team and are still socksorting through three of the best recruiting loads in history In two years Brown has shaken Texas football to its core not to mention just about every hand in the state The schedule is softer than those box springs over in Sealy In a controversial move Texas backed out of a seasonopening game at muchimproved Hawaii and instead will play host to Louisiana Lafayette Texas also misses Kansas State and Nebraska in Big Conference play faces upstart Oklahoma in Dallas on Oct and gets archrival Texas AM on Nov in Austin If the Longhorns can sidestep a couple of potholesat Stanford on Sept at Colorado on Oct they could be headed into a potential Dec Big title game showdown against powerhouse Nebraska Brown faced a similar scenario three years ago at North Carolina when his Tar Heels needed only a home victory against Florida State to reach the title game We had everything there except we werent ready to win the game Brown says Florida State scorched the Tar Heels at Chapel Hill and North Carolina finished No in the final coaches poll The difference this time is that Texas may be the one team not intimidated by Nebraska The Longhorns handed the Cornhuskers their only loss last year and thumped Nebraska two years ago in Lincoln In the Big title game of course John Mackovics Texas team stunned No Nebraska in one of the decades greatest games Our kids like that game Brown says They respect them but are not intimidated They want to be in that game So what happened Bevo There is no good excuse for Texas football ever going sour Its like Napa Valley not being able to produce grapes Texas has been a football hotbed for years It is the states collegiate football program with unparalleled interest talent and funding Fred Akers who succeeded Royal had his moments but never seemed to get the right bounce A heartwrenching Cotton Bowl loss to Georgia in the seasonender cost Texas the national title Then came the Texas flustep Texas went from through under Akers and David McWilliams and in six years under Mackovic in the s Texas hasnt been ranked No in the AP since Oct Bill Little an athletic department publicity man since has witnessed firsthand the fall from grace Anger is one thing Little says but when it was apathy thats when I thought wed never get it back Some blame the decline on rampant cheating that pervaded the Southwest Conference in the s Texas emerged relatively unscathed We were in a world then when people played by a different set of rules DeLoss Dodds the schools athletic director since says We just werent getting the players And we let our facilities slip Though he turned out to be the wrong coach Mackovic at least deserves credit for spearheading a fiveyear million makeover that has left Texas with jawdropping facilities Something else was missing all those years though Someone actually Darrell Royal For reasons that remain clouded Texas pushed Royal aside in he was not even allowed on the search committee that led to Akers hiring What did Royal contribute In years his Texas teams won SWC titles and national championships in and In he and his staff developed the Wishbone offense a quadruplethreat run offense that propelled Texas to wins in a row and consecutive national titles It was Royal who one summer taught the Wishbone to Alabamas Bear Bryant But an old cowboy was allowed to fade into the sunset I really dont like to talk about what happened in between Royal says of the dark years Id rather stay current It might not come out right It didnt take Brown long to turn over tables One of his first acts after replacing Mackovic in was restoring Royal to the royal court During an early Texas practice in the Brown regime Royal asked the new coach if it was OK to talk to one of his players I said Yeah you can talk to him Brown says The stadiums named after you you can do whatever you want Brown in turn extracted from Royal the nuances and politics of Texas football When Brown asked Will you help me with the Texas tradition the old coachs face turned a Royal flush I knew we had something special then Royal says He knew where his priorities were Royal told Brown to keep his nose out of state politics He instructed Brown about dealing with Texas fans Whether you like it or not they need to think you like it He told Brown that Texas was like no other football creature The good news is people really care at Texas Royal told Brown The bad news is that people really care about Texas Royal wont forget Browns entrance on the Texas stage Before addressing the media at his introductory news conference Brown stopped in the hallway and called Eddie Joseph executive vice president of the states High School Coaches Assn In a sense that was more the nuts and bolts of the football program rather than the press conference Royal says Brown has since thrown up a recruiting wall around Texas He has either visited or written all of Texas prep coaches Hes absolutely the best PR guy Ive ever run across Royal says This year Brown turned down speaking engagements and transformed the schools football athletic complex into a monument to Texas football Instead of Muzak athletic department elevators chime The Eyes of Texas Are Upon You the schools fabled fight song Former Texas Heisman trophy winner Earl Campbell watches home games seated in one of six real saddles perched in the players private lounge in Texas Memorial Stadium Macks idea Texas has sold season tickets this year despite not playing Oklahoma Kansas State or Nebraska at home Its coming its around the corner DeLoss says of Texas return to glory And its the real thing Theres nothing like a quarterback controversy to screw up a potential dynasty In Austin its the talk of Sixth Streets rooftop eateries Applewhite or Simms Simms or Applewhite I was in a gas station Simms said And I go to pay the guy and he says Youre that Simms kid right You going to beat out Applewhite Hey what better place than a gas station to pump for information Simms the sophomore son of former New York Giant quarterback Phil Simms is Texas most heralded recruit since Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams The USA Today high school player of the year Simms reneged on a commitment to Tennessee and instead chose Texas Simms says Tennessee wanted to redshirt him he wanted to play right away But as a true freshman last year Simms could not displace the sophomore Applewhite who set singleseason school records while throwing for yards and touchdowns Simms threw passes in seven games Now what Applewhite tore the ligaments in his left knee during the Cotton Bowl an injury he guessed could be used for an excuse to usher in the Simms era The college game is a business Applewhite says But Applewhite made it his business to get his left knee back to which he say it is How does Brown have the race handicapped Both parents like their son better than they like the other parents son he says Brown says both quarterbacks will play He faced a similar quandary at North Carolina when he successfully platooned Chris Keldorf and Oscar Davenport But Simms a foot sophomore is already antsy knowing he probably would have been starting this year had he gone to Tennessee Yep Simms says Thats the choice I made and I live with it But Im happy here beyond belief Simms knows quarterback controversies hes still bitter about Scott Brunner beating his dad out for the Giants starting job in Bill Parcells chickened out Chris says of the Giants former coach Simms is guessing one man is going to end up with the job I cant see it going through the season he says of the platoon system I dont think it could work It creates too much turmoil for the team Simms and Applewhite appear to be good friends and both insist they will not let this become a wedge issue on a team There is not going to be any Chris camps because I wont let that happen Simms says Applewhite says the quarterbacks cant do it alone Itll take a lot more than Chris Simms and I to handle it right he says There are a lot of friends involved loyalties Brown says this story will be played out peacefully Im not going to let a pouting quarterback ruin our season he says Applewhite notes that no Texas quarterback since has started and finished the same season Darrell Royal hasnt taken sides on the quarterback issue but has offered Brown a bit of general advice Brown Darrell says that if you got it you make it If you dont got it you wont make it And if you dont know what it is you havent got a chance Our theme for this year is it Note The information contained in this message may be privileged and confidential and protected from disclosure If the reader of this message is not the intended recipient or an
