Reuters The New York Mercantile Exchange which this month converted to a forprofit company is aiming to sell shares to the public within nine months of a private placement to strategic investors NYMEX Chairman Daniel Rappaport said Monday But no part of the worlds largest physical commodity exchange will be up for sale until after the launch of its delayed eNYMEX electronic trading platform now targeted for early May Rappaport told Reuters in a telephone interview Id say three to nine months after the private placement depending on market conditions and eNYMEX traction Rappaport said referring to the initial public offering IPO NYMEX faces intense competitive challenges to overhaul itself and modernize for the st century The reorganizing London Metal Exchange LME voted in September to demutalize and is introducing screen trading while the London International Financial Futures Exchange LIFFE went wholly to electronic trading on Monday waving goodbye to the shouts and hand signals of traditional open outcry trade NYMEX demutualized days ago changing its notforprofit membership structure into that of a profitseeking corporation and renaming itself New York Mercantile Exchange Inc No IPO can occur until shareholders vote to decouple their stakes from the seats which give them rights to trade futures in crude oil natural gas electricity heating oil and gasoline on the floor Rappaport said that NYMEXs investment bankers advised a private placement first in part because of recent stock market jitters and to capitalize on the yearold exchanges unique story and build credibility for a market offering The NYMEX said no decisions have been made yet as to how much to sell privately But plenty of potential investors have queued up Among others NYMEX has open arms toward partners in Intercontinental Exchange an Internetbased trading competitor which NYMEX declined to join when Intercontinental was launched earlier this year deciding then on the solo route The deal that was offered was then and still today looking back on it was unacceptable he said That is not to say that some of partners in the Intercontinental Exchange would not also be attractive partners to us today We would very much like to have some of them join in and invest in the exchange And I will tell you that a lot of them have expressed very strong interest Intercontinental Exchange this summer started overthecounter trade in gold and silver and plans to open up Webbased dealing in energy products in the fourth quarter Backing it are some of the worlds top oil companies and banks including BP Amoco Plc Royal DutchShell Group Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG Rappaport said the unfriendly market environment for listing shares was a double edged sword for NYMEX The fact that dotcoms and ecommerce in general dont have the momentum that they had six months ago is not good for us in terms of doing an IPO that has ecommerce as a material part of its valuation he said But he said no competitor was better positioned than NYMEX NYMEX has linked up with Platts a division of publishers McGrawHill for pricing on eNYMEX contracts and with software applications company Kiodex Inc to provide a trade engine for the order matching system But these have no equity stakes Rappaport said any desire to team up with big market partners who might give eNYMEX some critical mass was balanced against NYMEXs condition that it maintain market neutrality We cannot be perceived as being dominated by any company or small group of companies he said Having market neutrality will be critical to any platforms longterm success Rappaport said delays in eNYMEX which was first to start in the third quarter this year was not now placing it at a disadvantage against upandrunning overthecounter platforms like Intercontinental which could yet be its main worry If Intercontinental launches and clears futures than were talking about a whole different competitive landscape he said The fact that Intercontinental has put together such a powerful group of industrial players really forces us to view them as a formidable competitive threat should they chose to go down that road NYMEX will begin etrade with energy futures leaving to a later date gold silver platinum palladium copper and aluminum in part because it has yet to iron out a dispute with members of NYMEXs COMEX metals division over the right to trade those electronically during New York hours We believe we can establish terms that are equitable to the individual COMEX members interests and to the exchanges interests he said But to the extent that we cant I dont view that has having any significant impact on either the private placement or the IPO or the valuation issue For now Rappaport does not envision his floor veterans herding dinosaurlike behind LIFFE traders out the door The challenge for the US exchanges those that have a history in open outcry is to wrap the open outcry market in technology in a way that permits them to compete with electronic marketplaces I see it almost an electronic trading system with human intervention at some point in the liquidity chain for certain products Weve already gone wholly electronic in electricity o Vector Gets Million Round Two Acquires Two Firms HOUSTON Vector esp Inc which provides managed technology services to

emissions PwC which has formed COecom in partnership with the Cantor Fitzgerald is expected to announce the portal tomorrow at the climate change conference in The Hague Trading in emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide CO is expected to play a key role in global efforts to combat global warming and climate change by reducing emissions overall There is fierce debate as to whether countries which cannot meet their emission targets under international protocols or do not wish to should be able to buy emission credits from countries which can In future individual companies may also have permits to emit greenhouse gases which they could trade like any other commodity According to Steve Drummond PwCs global head of Climate Change Financial Advisory Services trading in greenhouse gases may become one of the fastest growing commodity markets in the world Trading in emissions has been the subject of heated discussion since the Kyoto meeting on climate change COecom hopes to exploit the fact that under the Kyoto protocol which has yet to be signed off trading in emission reductions may be banked now by companies and used against emissions obligations which may be set by law in the future The emission reductions now can be offset against those which can be made in the future The risk could be that the protocol will not be signed but this really started at the Rio summit in and everything is on track so far Drummond said There is huge momentum behind this Drummond said COecom will act not just as an online marketplace but as a single point of entry for corporations which need to understand and cope with their duties in terms of climate change The aim of the portal is to help companies establish what their position is and what they need to do now or in future The site will also refer clients to consultants with a good track record in environmental and emissions issues Drummond said there are already sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission reduction markets in the US which have proved successful Everyone anticipates that this market will be huge People want to figure out what the issues are When the legislation and the various regimes are established reductions in emissions will have a real value he said Fred Krupp of Environmental Defence one of the leading environmental organisations in the US said It is

emissions PwC which has formed COecom in partnership with the Cantor Fitzgerald is expected to announce the portal tomorrow at the climate change conference in The Hague Trading in emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide CO is expected to play a key role in global efforts to combat global warming and climate change by reducing emissions overall There is fierce debate as to whether countries which cannot meet their emission targets under international protocols or do not wish to should be able to buy emission credits from countries which can In future individual companies may also have permits to emit greenhouse gases which they could trade like any other commodity According to Steve Drummond PwCs global head of Climate Change Financial Advisory Services trading in greenhouse gases may become one of the fastest growing commodity markets in the world Trading in emissions has been the subject of heated discussion since the Kyoto meeting on climate change COecom hopes to exploit the fact that under the Kyoto protocol which has yet to be signed off trading in emission reductions may be banked now by companies and used against emissions obligations which may be set by law in the future The emission reductions now can be offset against those which can be made in the future The risk could be that the protocol will not be signed but this really started at the Rio summit in and everything is on track so far Drummond said There is huge momentum behind this Drummond said COecom will act not just as an online marketplace but as a single point of entry for corporations which need to understand and cope with their duties in terms of climate change The aim of the portal is to help companies establish what their position is and what they need to do now or in future The site will also refer clients to consultants with a good track record in environmental and emissions issues Drummond said there are already sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission reduction markets in the US which have proved successful Everyone anticipates that this market will be huge People want to figure out what the issues are When the legislation and the various regimes are established reductions in emissions will have a real value he said Fred Krupp of Environmental Defence one of the leading environmental organisations in the US said It is

Reuters The New York Mercantile Exchange which this month converted to a forprofit company is aiming to sell shares to the public within nine months of a private placement to strategic investors NYMEX Chairman Daniel Rappaport said Monday But no part of the worlds largest physical commodity exchange will be up for sale until after the launch of its delayed eNYMEX electronic trading platform now targeted for early May Rappaport told Reuters in a telephone interview Id say three to nine months after the private placement depending on market conditions and eNYMEX traction Rappaport said referring to the initial public offering IPO NYMEX faces intense competitive challenges to overhaul itself and modernize for the st century The reorganizing London Metal Exchange LME voted in September to demutalize and is introducing screen trading while the London International Financial Futures Exchange LIFFE went wholly to electronic trading on Monday waving goodbye to the shouts and hand signals of traditional open outcry trade NYMEX demutualized days ago changing its notforprofit membership structure into that of a profitseeking corporation and renaming itself New York Mercantile Exchange Inc No IPO can occur until shareholders vote to decouple their stakes from the seats which give them rights to trade futures in crude oil natural gas electricity heating oil and gasoline on the floor Rappaport said that NYMEXs investment bankers advised a private placement first in part because of recent stock market jitters and to capitalize on the yearold exchanges unique story and build credibility for a market offering The NYMEX said no decisions have been made yet as to how much to sell privately But plenty of potential investors have queued up Among others NYMEX has open arms toward partners in Intercontinental Exchange an Internetbased trading competitor which NYMEX declined to join when Intercontinental was launched earlier this year deciding then on the solo route The deal that was offered was then and still today looking back on it was unacceptable he said That is not to say that some of partners in the Intercontinental Exchange would not also be attractive partners to us today We would very much like to have some of them join in and invest in the exchange And I will tell you that a lot of them have expressed very strong interest Intercontinental Exchange this summer started overthecounter trade in gold and silver and plans to open up Webbased dealing in energy products in the fourth quarter Backing it are some of the worlds top oil companies and banks including BP Amoco Plc Royal DutchShell Group Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG Rappaport said the unfriendly market environment for listing shares was a double edged sword for NYMEX The fact that dotcoms and ecommerce in general dont have the momentum that they had six months ago is not good for us in terms of doing an IPO that has ecommerce as a material part of its valuation he said But he said no competitor was better positioned than NYMEX NYMEX has linked up with Platts a division of publishers McGrawHill for pricing on eNYMEX contracts and with software applications company Kiodex Inc to provide a trade engine for the order matching system But these have no equity stakes Rappaport said any desire to team up with big market partners who might give eNYMEX some critical mass was balanced against NYMEXs condition that it maintain market neutrality We cannot be perceived as being dominated by any company or small group of companies he said Having market neutrality will be critical to any platforms longterm success Rappaport said delays in eNYMEX which was first to start in the third quarter this year was not now placing it at a disadvantage against upandrunning overthecounter platforms like Intercontinental which could yet be its main worry If Intercontinental launches and clears futures than were talking about a whole different competitive landscape he said The fact that Intercontinental has put together such a powerful group of industrial players really forces us to view them as a formidable competitive threat should they chose to go down that road NYMEX will begin etrade with energy futures leaving to a later date gold silver platinum palladium copper and aluminum in part because it has yet to iron out a dispute with members of NYMEXs COMEX metals division over the right to trade those electronically during New York hours We believe we can establish terms that are equitable to the individual COMEX members interests and to the exchanges interests he said But to the extent that we cant I dont view that has having any significant impact on either the private placement or the IPO or the valuation issue For now Rappaport does not envision his floor veterans herding dinosaurlike behind LIFFE traders out the door The challenge for the US exchanges those that have a history in open outcry is to wrap the open outcry market in technology in a way that permits them to compete with electronic marketplaces I see it almost an electronic trading system with human intervention at some point in the liquidity chain for certain products Weve already gone wholly electronic in electricity o Vector Gets Million Round Two Acquires Two Firms HOUSTON Vector esp Inc which provides managed technology services to

Chemdex and Promedix fell on deaf ears from potential suitors because the company could not overcome two big hurdles First potential buyers were turned off by the poor performance of the two marketplaces Second and more importantly Ventro was pushing unattractive sale terms sources say including a requirement that any marketplace buyer enter into a longterm services contract with Ventro estimated to be worth between million and million a year This was a big hurdle for buyers a source familiar with the Ventros sale efforts said No one wanted to pay for the marketplaces then be forced to hire Ventro to run them Ventro executives are holding a conference call later today to discuss this announcement it is expected that executives will push the positive of the shutdowns Ventro says that future cash outlays for operating activities will be reduced by percent after Chemdex and Promedix are shuttered which should put Ventro on a stronger financial footing as it struggles to survive

Reuters The New York Mercantile Exchange which this month converted to a forprofit company is aiming to sell shares to the public within nine months of a private placement to strategic investors NYMEX Chairman Daniel Rappaport said Monday But no part of the worlds largest physical commodity exchange will be up for sale until after the launch of its delayed eNYMEX electronic trading platform now targeted for early May Rappaport told Reuters in a telephone interview Id say three to nine months after the private placement depending on market conditions and eNYMEX traction Rappaport said referring to the initial public offering IPO NYMEX faces intense competitive challenges to overhaul itself and modernize for the st century The reorganizing London Metal Exchange LME voted in September to demutalize and is introducing screen trading while the London International Financial Futures Exchange LIFFE went wholly to electronic trading on Monday waving goodbye to the shouts and hand signals of traditional open outcry trade NYMEX demutualized days ago changing its notforprofit membership structure into that of a profitseeking corporation and renaming itself New York Mercantile Exchange Inc No IPO can occur until shareholders vote to decouple their stakes from the seats which give them rights to trade futures in crude oil natural gas electricity heating oil and gasoline on the floor Rappaport said that NYMEXs investment bankers advised a private placement first in part because of recent stock market jitters and to capitalize on the yearold exchanges unique story and build credibility for a market offering The NYMEX said no decisions have been made yet as to how much to sell privately But plenty of potential investors have queued up Among others NYMEX has open arms toward partners in Intercontinental Exchange an Internetbased trading competitor which NYMEX declined to join when Intercontinental was launched earlier this year deciding then on the solo route The deal that was offered was then and still today looking back on it was unacceptable he said That is not to say that some of partners in the Intercontinental Exchange would not also be attractive partners to us today We would very much like to have some of them join in and invest in the exchange And I will tell you that a lot of them have expressed very strong interest Intercontinental Exchange this summer started overthecounter trade in gold and silver and plans to open up Webbased dealing in energy products in the fourth quarter Backing it are some of the worlds top oil companies and banks including BP Amoco Plc Royal DutchShell Group Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG Rappaport said the unfriendly market environment for listing shares was a double edged sword for NYMEX The fact that dotcoms and ecommerce in general dont have the momentum that they had six months ago is not good for us in terms of doing an IPO that has ecommerce as a material part of its valuation he said But he said no competitor was better positioned than NYMEX NYMEX has linked up with Platts a division of publishers McGrawHill for pricing on eNYMEX contracts and with software applications company Kiodex Inc to provide a trade engine for the order matching system But these have no equity stakes Rappaport said any desire to team up with big market partners who might give eNYMEX some critical mass was balanced against NYMEXs condition that it maintain market neutrality We cannot be perceived as being dominated by any company or small group of companies he said Having market neutrality will be critical to any platforms longterm success Rappaport said delays in eNYMEX which was first to start in the third quarter this year was not now placing it at a disadvantage against upandrunning overthecounter platforms like Intercontinental which could yet be its main worry If Intercontinental launches and clears futures than were talking about a whole different competitive landscape he said The fact that Intercontinental has put together such a powerful group of industrial players really forces us to view them as a formidable competitive threat should they chose to go down that road NYMEX will begin etrade with energy futures leaving to a later date gold silver platinum palladium copper and aluminum in part because it has yet to iron out a dispute with members of NYMEXs COMEX metals division over the right to trade those electronically during New York hours We believe we can establish terms that are equitable to the individual COMEX members interests and to the exchanges interests he said But to the extent that we cant I dont view that has having any significant impact on either the private placement or the IPO or the valuation issue For now Rappaport does not envision his floor veterans herding dinosaurlike behind LIFFE traders out the door The challenge for the US exchanges those that have a history in open outcry is to wrap the open outcry market in technology in a way that permits them to compete with electronic marketplaces I see it almost an electronic trading system with human intervention at some point in the liquidity chain for certain products Weve already gone wholly electronic in electricity o Vector Gets Million Round Two Acquires Two Firms HOUSTON Vector esp Inc which provides managed technology services to

emissions PwC which has formed COecom in partnership with the Cantor Fitzgerald is expected to announce the portal tomorrow at the climate change conference in The Hague Trading in emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide CO is expected to play a key role in global efforts to combat global warming and climate change by reducing emissions overall There is fierce debate as to whether countries which cannot meet their emission targets under international protocols or do not wish to should be able to buy emission credits from countries which can In future individual companies may also have permits to emit greenhouse gases which they could trade like any other commodity According to Steve Drummond PwCs global head of Climate Change Financial Advisory Services trading in greenhouse gases may become one of the fastest growing commodity markets in the world Trading in emissions has been the subject of heated discussion since the Kyoto meeting on climate change COecom hopes to exploit the fact that under the Kyoto protocol which has yet to be signed off trading in emission reductions may be banked now by companies and used against emissions obligations which may be set by law in the future The emission reductions now can be offset against those which can be made in the future The risk could be that the protocol will not be signed but this really started at the Rio summit in and everything is on track so far Drummond said There is huge momentum behind this Drummond said COecom will act not just as an online marketplace but as a single point of entry for corporations which need to understand and cope with their duties in terms of climate change The aim of the portal is to help companies establish what their position is and what they need to do now or in future The site will also refer clients to consultants with a good track record in environmental and emissions issues Drummond said there are already sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission reduction markets in the US which have proved successful Everyone anticipates that this market will be huge People want to figure out what the issues are When the legislation and the various regimes are established reductions in emissions will have a real value he said Fred Krupp of Environmental Defence one of the leading environmental organisations in the US said It is encouraging to see the emergence of carbon commerce entrepreneurs like COecom who can build both the pathways and the incentive for marketbased solutions to global warming o Oil Gas ASP
