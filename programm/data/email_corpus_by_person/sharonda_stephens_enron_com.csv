Exit Indian Power Venture Over PastDue Payments Bloomberg Calif Senate Panel To Cite Reliant Enron For Contempt Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Wednesday LOS ANGELES Dow Jones A California Senate committee Wednesday voted to cite Reliant Energy REI with contempt because the company has refused to provide documents for an investigation into wholesale electricity prices in the state said committee Chairman Joe Dunn DSanta Ana The committee also voted to forward a contempt charge for Enron Corp ENE to the full Senate where it will be voted on If the charge is approved the Senate will vote on punishment which could include hefty fines or incarceration of executives Talks between Enron and committee attorneys Monday seemed to indicate the company would agree to committee demands but since then it has become clear the company doesnt plan to comply Dunn said If you had asked two days ago Id have said we are cautiously optimistic about Enron Now Im pessimistic about it We felt they were indicating to us a willingness to do what the other generators were willing to do but the bottom line is that they are not despite their cooperativesounding words We are no closer to them coming into compliance than we were a week ago Dunn said The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation is requesting that Reliant and Enron provide kinds of documents related to market behavior rent a depository for the documents and sign the committees version of a confidentiality agreement Both generators have refused to meet those demands Dunn said The committee will drop its contempt charges at any time before a full Senate vote if either generator agrees to its requests A report detailing Enrons contempt charge will be sent to the full Senate on Thursday for introduction but is expected to be referred to the Senate Rules Committee for review before a floor vote Dunn said he didnt know how long the report would be considered in the Rules Committee but he will certainly push them to do it as soon as possible Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company will continue to negotiate with the committee Legislators are scheduled to begin a monthlong break Friday but arent certain that will happen because they still need to pass a budget bill and are trying to approve a bill to rescue Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison before leaving Dunn said it would take a few days to prepare a report on Reliants contempt charge We may not be able to forward that report to the Senate floor until the day we get back from recess Dunn said No one at Reliant could be immediately reached for comment The committee originally was poised to cite seven other electricity generators for contempt but all eventually agreed to provide the requested information A Reliant spokesman said later that the companys main difference with the committee centered on the signing of the confidentiality agreement Reliant would rather the committee secure a protective order before the company turns over the requested documents said spokesman Richard Wheatley We respectfully decline to waive our objections because we have a lot of trade secrets and proprietary information at stake he said When asked if the company would take legal action against the committee Wheatley said Reliant was keeping all options open But really we hope to work this out on an informal basis Wheatley said We dont think this is that big of a stumbling block Enron filed suit against the committee

Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Davis administration tells consultants to sell energy stocks Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved SACRAMENTO AP The Davis administration on Wednesday told consultants buying energy for the state to sell their stock holdings in energy companies immediately or quit their jobs Nine consultants divested by a noon deadline but critics said the order by Gov Gray Davis came months too late to protect the publics interest The order issued at Davis direction was contained in a memo to Tom Hannigan director of the state Department of Water Resources Legal Affairs Secretary Barry Goode wrote that it was imperative that you give instruction immediately to those concerned We expect and have always expected the states consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards the memo states That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who hopes to challenge Democrat Davis for reelection next year the administration moved to obtain statements of economic interest from the energy consultants The consultants were hired earlier this year to advise the Department of Water Resources on electricity purchases for Californias financially strapped utilities The economic statements showed that several consultants held stock in energy generators including Calpine Corp and Enron One consultant

Himangshu Watts Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW DELHI July Reuters US energy firm AES Corp may walk out of a troubled distribution venture in eastern India due to a difficult regulatory enivironment the firms CEO said on Thursday Dennis Bakke told reporters AES will sell its percent stake in CESCO a distribution firm in the eastern province of Orissa unless the firm was paid its dues allowed to raise tariffs and given a better operating environment If satisfactory resolution of these matters is not expeditiously reached AES will be forced to abandon its commitment to the distribution company he said AES holds a percent stake in Orissa Power Generation Corporation OPGC which runs a MW plant in the state and sells power to staterun Gridco a staterun transmission firm Bakke said Gridco owed OPGC about million and the US firm had filed for arbitration in Orissa to recover the dues accumulated over two and a half years He said GRIDCO was not paying OPGC the generating company saying that CESCO the distribution firm owed it money These are standalone businesses and there is no basis for any such linkage or offset he said Bakke said the states regulatory commission had ordered CESCO to transfer all receivables collected into an escrow account but the company could not abide by the instruction as it needed money to pay its employees However it complied after the local government initiated criminal proceedings against the managing director of CESCO he said AES will deposit all revenues into the escrow account Hence funds will not be available to pay the CESCO employees salaries due July and thereafter He said the regulatory regime in Orissa fixed tariffs at levels which did not allow it to recover its costs Orissa officials were not immediately available for comment He said AES was considering selling its stake in CESCO but could enter into a management contract in the transition period However AES will look at other opportunities in India if it finds a better regulatory environment Bakke said AES had not made any proposal to take over Enron Corps troubled Dabhol project but it was a potential business in which it might be interested at some stage Apart from Enron which has threatened to walk out of its billion Indian venture US firm Cogentrix and Electricite de France have also packed their bags India whose MW generation capacity is

Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow Jones Federal energy regulators are scheduled to act next week on new rules affecting natural gas pipeline affiliate dealings Sources say the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is debating action at next Wednesdays open meeting to tighten up rules prohibiting pipelines from providing marketsensitive information to marketing affiliates FERC rules allow monopoly pipeline companies to market natural gas in competitive markets providing they adopt codes of conduct that prevent the passing of information that provides a competitive advantage to their gasmarketing affiliates Similar rules are in place on the electric side for vertically integrated utilities with marketing units competing in wholesale power markets The changes under consideration stem from the commissions investigation of El Paso Natural Gas Cos EPG controversial contract with a marketing affiliate for pipeline capacity into California according to sources The affiliate transaction has been blamed for Californias dramatic runup in natural gas prices over the past year which contributed to the states unprecedentedly high electricity costs last year The proposed codeofconduct changes also reflect the sweeping convergence between the natural gas and power sectors in the years since FERC deregulated the pipeline industry in the s FERCs rules prohibit pipelines from sharing marketsensitive information with their gasmarketing affiliates But the rules dont address the pipelines power marketing affiliates The commission is looking to expand the codeofconduct rules to address all marketing affiliates sources said These sources say the template for the pending change can be found in the conditions FERC imposed in a order authorizing the acquisition of Pittsburghbased Consolidated Natural Gas by Dominion Resources D The commission approved the electricitynatural gas convergence merger contingent on Dominion agreeing to adopt codes of conduct applying equally to its gas and power marketing affiliates The planned rule changes would apply to electric utilities with pipeline investments such as CMS Energy CMS Duke Energy DUK and American Electric Power Co AEP It is unclear how the changes would affect joint operating agreements such as the one between Entergy Corp ETR and privately held Koch Industries But the largest impact will be for large pipeline companies with extensive power marketing operations and investments in power plants For example El Paso Williams Cos WMB and Enron Corp ENE represent about of the interstate pipeline industry and are among the nations top power marketers and merchant power plant developers One FERC source described the order scheduled for commission vote

have always expected the states consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards the memo states That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies

Himangshu Watts Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW DELHI July Reuters US energy firm AES Corp may walk out of a troubled distribution venture in eastern India due to a difficult regulatory enivironment the firms CEO said on Thursday Dennis Bakke told reporters AES will sell its percent stake in CESCO a distribution firm in the eastern province of Orissa unless the firm was paid its dues allowed to raise tariffs and given a better operating environment If satisfactory resolution of these matters is not expeditiously reached AES will be forced to abandon its commitment to the distribution company he said AES holds a percent stake in Orissa Power Generation Corporation OPGC which runs a MW plant in the state and sells power to staterun Gridco a staterun transmission firm Bakke said Gridco owed OPGC about million and the US firm had filed for arbitration in Orissa to recover the dues accumulated over two and a half years He said GRIDCO was not paying OPGC the generating company saying that CESCO the distribution firm owed it money These are standalone businesses and there is no basis for any such linkage or offset he said Bakke said the states regulatory commission had ordered CESCO to transfer all receivables collected into an escrow account but the company could not abide by the instruction as it needed money to pay its employees However it complied after the local government initiated criminal proceedings against the managing director of CESCO he said AES will deposit all revenues into the escrow account Hence funds will not be available to pay the CESCO employees salaries due July and thereafter He said the regulatory regime in Orissa fixed tariffs at levels which did not allow it to recover its costs Orissa officials were not immediately available for comment He said AES was considering selling its stake in CESCO but could enter into a management contract in the transition period However AES will look at other opportunities in India if it finds a better regulatory environment Bakke said AES had not made any proposal to take over Enron Corps troubled Dabhol project but it was a potential business in which it might be interested at

Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow Jones Federal energy regulators are scheduled to act next week on new rules affecting natural gas pipeline affiliate dealings Sources say the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is debating action at next Wednesdays open meeting to tighten up rules prohibiting pipelines from providing marketsensitive information to marketing affiliates FERC rules allow monopoly pipeline companies to market natural gas in competitive markets providing they adopt codes of conduct that prevent the passing of information that provides a competitive advantage to their gasmarketing affiliates Similar rules are in place on the electric side for vertically integrated utilities with marketing units competing in wholesale power markets The changes under consideration stem from the commissions investigation of El Paso Natural Gas Cos EPG controversial contract with a marketing affiliate for pipeline capacity into California according to sources The affiliate transaction has been blamed for Californias dramatic runup in natural gas prices over the past year which contributed to the states unprecedentedly high electricity costs last year The proposed codeofconduct changes also reflect the sweeping convergence between the natural gas and power sectors in the years since FERC deregulated the pipeline industry in the s FERCs rules prohibit pipelines from sharing marketsensitive information with their gasmarketing affiliates But the rules dont address the pipelines power marketing affiliates The commission is looking to expand the codeofconduct rules to address all marketing affiliates sources said These sources say the template for the pending change can be found in the conditions FERC imposed in a order authorizing the acquisition of Pittsburghbased Consolidated Natural Gas by Dominion Resources D The commission approved the electricitynatural gas convergence merger contingent on Dominion agreeing to adopt codes of conduct applying equally to its gas and power marketing affiliates The planned rule changes would apply to electric utilities with pipeline investments such as CMS Energy CMS Duke Energy DUK and American Electric Power Co AEP It is unclear how the changes would affect joint operating agreements such as the one between Entergy Corp ETR and privately held Koch Industries But the largest impact will be for large pipeline companies with extensive power marketing operations and investments in power plants For example El Paso Williams Cos WMB and Enron Corp ENE represent about of the interstate pipeline industry and are among the nations top power marketers and merchant power plant developers One FERC source described the order scheduled for commission vote

Montedison chances of fighting off Fiat seen fading By Christian Plumb Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited MILAN July Reuters Montedison continued to battle a Fiatled consortiums billion euro hostile takeover on Friday but investors said its chances were fading Montedison clung to the hope that an Italian administrative court would rule in its favour against securities regulator Consob which earlier this week gave the goahead for the bid That court will issue a provisional ruling in the case on July the day before the Italenergia consortiums offer is due to begin a judicial source told Reuters Montedison and its longtime backer Mediobanca are also hoping that EU regulators will find that Italenergia should have notified it about the bid and punish the wouldbe predator by temporarily suspending its voting rights in Montedison Above all Montedison is looking for an opening that would let it launch a counterbid for Edison Italys secondlargest power company and Italenergias main target Italian press reports today said US power company Enron could be interested in such a counterbid That was the latest in a series of potential white knights for Edison that have so far not materialised The hope is to open a window that would allow them to launch a counteroffer for Edison said Massimo Aloi a fund manager at Antonveneta ABN Amro in Milan But the possibilities are low A suspension of the Consob ruling would also mean a suspension of the socalled passivity rule which bars takeover targets from taking evasive manoeuvres At this point we think the Fiat offer should get a lot of shares tendered Aloi added Other investors agreed the chances were remote for Mediobanca to hold onto its key industrial asset Gathering support for a counterbid seems like an unlikely hypothesis because they would not be able to reach a majority of the capital at a shareholder meeting said Luca Comi head of research at Eptasim in Milan Italenergia holds about percent of Montedison ordinary shares The Fiat bidding vehicle late on Thursday moved to blunt criticism about the role of Electricite de France cutting the French power giants preference shares to a two percent weight Italenergia had previously converted all but two percent of EdFs ordinary shares into preference shares Italenergia is doing its best to minimise the role of the French utility which has been accused of expanding into other energy markets while its home market remains mostly closed to competition In another potential setback to Mediobanca the merchant bank could even be forced to backtrack on one of the antitakeover moves it took as Italenergia was launching its offer the sale of percent of paper holding company Dieci to French raider Vincent Bollore Shareholders in

JENNIFER L RICH The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company SAO PAULO Brazil April Though nightly newscasts show cars floating down floodprone streets here residents are hoping for more rain at least percent more than normal for this time of year to be precise That is how much the operators of Brazils electricity grid say needs to fall to ensure that hydroelectric plants will continue to run at full capacity averting the need for energy rationing like the recent rolling blackouts in California in at least part of Brazil later in the year Here as elsewhere across the globe the struggle to deregulate has been coupled with soaring demand for power As the Brazilian government seeks other energy sources formulates a rationing plan and encourages consumers to voluntarily cut back energy use companies especially those in powerhungry industries are scrambling for ways to make sure their electricity needs will be met And independent local and foreign power developers like EnergyWorks based in Landover Md are hoping to be of service offering to construct minipower plants on the companies premises A lot of companies have been calling us in the last two weeks to see if it is possible to invest in this type of project said Nelson Cardoso de Oliveira business development manager for EnergyWorks a unit of the electric utility Iberdrola SA of Spain For the last few years experts have warned of an impending energy crisis in Brazil as increasing industrialization has caused the demand for energy to outpace supply by about percent The governments threeyearold effort to attract more investors through the privatization of most of the countrys power grid has had a slow start Local companies have been hindered by a lack of financing And uncertainties in the newly deregulated power market over such things as the pricing of electricity have stymied gridexpansion plans by the private enterprises including Enron that bought up the former stateowned companies Even the completion last year of a natural gas pipeline from Bolivia has been slow to stimulate investments in thermoelectric power a move that was meant to reduce the countrys neartotal dependence on hydroelectric power Only of the thermoelectric plants that the government focused on almost two years ago in its emergency power plan seem close to coming on line in the next year or so With rainfall missing major reservoirs and a shortage of transmission lines preventing excess power that does exist from moving among regions the government says that the power situation in Brazil will be touchandgo at least until So some of the countrys biggest powerintensive companies are taking matters into their own hands hoping to ensure a constant power supply with their own naturalgasfired generators Among those that have recently done so are Cia Siderurgica Nacional a steel maker and Globo Comunicacoes e Participacoes parent of the Rio de Janeiro daily newspaper O Globo So have two rival breweries Cia Cervejarias Kaiser owned by the CocaCola Company its Brazilian bottlers and Heineken and the maker of Brahma beer Cia de Bebidas das Americas known as AmBev Plants are planned for the Brazilian units of the Americanbased multinationals Corn Products International and International Paper Rudi Anvari director of Engineering and Technology at Corn Products Brazil said the companys decision was based on the need to count on a reliable and flexible source of energy In a study of power use in the state of Sao Paulo the states secretary of energy found that companies produced percent of the energy they consumed in up from percent in In some cases the excess power from these company plants can be sold to the national grid Jayme de Hollanda general director of the National Institute for Energy Efficiency a nonprofit advocacy group said that this socalled cogenerated power should account for about percent of the countrys electricity supply by The volumes that we are dealing with dont provide a complete solution for the country but they can certainly resolve localized problems said Ivan Marimon the sales manager at Guascor do Brasil a joint venture controlled by Grupo Guascor of Spain which builds smallscale power plants for hospitals Companies said that part of the appeal of small power projects was that they required less time to build than a public power project sometimes as little as six months And the cost at about million for a small megawatt plant could be just as cost effective for some companies as buying electricity from the national grid especially since electricity prices were expected to increase significantly in the next several years Some private power concerns including EnergyWorks even finance the projects outright But for a project to be viable for financiers and builders companies need to agree to buy the electricity for to years That is a daunting proposition for Brazilians who have been made shy of longterm commitments by years of economic turmoil Part of the doubt has been caused by exchange rate worries Unlike natural gas prices which are charged in dollars electricity prices are fixed by the government in local currency Indeed private power plants are clearly not for everyone For most companies said Pio Gavazzi director of infrastructure at the Federation of Industries of the State of Sao Paulo a trade group a solution could just be a matter of renegotiating existing electricity contracts or installing more energy efficient parts in the factory Photo Brazilian companies and some overseas concerns are searching for more energy sources to make sure their electricity needs will be met This EnergyWorks power plant was built for the Kaiser brewery in Pacatuba EnergyWorks do Brazil

rejected France Telecoms offer for the unbundling of the countrys socalled local loop and has ordered the company to submit a new proposal by Thursday Implementation of the localloop unbundling which came into force Jan has been delayed because of high prices set by France Telecom for access to local exchanges by rival telecommunications operators The regulator said some of the fees announced by

Chronicle Texas Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Enron Broadband Services has eliminated up to positions in recent weeks a reflection of changes in the hightech market and a consolidation of operations in the company Many of the employees have found work elsewhere with parent company Enron Corp said Chief Executive Officer Ken Rice but the move brings the number of Enron Broadband employees from as many as in recent months to about Many of the job cuts came when Enron Broadband a division of energy giant Enron Corp finished building out the mile fiber optic network that it uses to buy and sell Internet bandwidth Rice said We had a number of people working on that but now that its in place we needed to redeploy them elsewhere Rice said Consolidating operations from outlying Enron Broadband offices such as Portland Ore to Houston also accounts for some of the lost positions as well as slowing demand for a PCbased streaming media product the company developed Rice said Its not unusual for Enron to move several hundred employees to different locations and divisions around the country every year to account for changes in the market Rice said The company employs about people Its just a part of the way we do business he said Enron Broadband is still growing and has posted more than a dozen new broadbandrelated jobs on its Web site since March Enron officials have shied away from calling the eliminated jobs layoffs When word of the job cuts first surfaced at the end of March a company spokesman used the term redeployed to describe the action Many employees were offered the opportunity to find other jobs in Enron but those who did not find new jobs or accept other positions in the company had few other options than leaving That saved the company from actually firing workers which could have required it to report the actions to the Texas Workforce Commission Enron Broadband Services has attracted a lot of attention in the past year for pioneering a previously unheard of notion treating access to the biggest Internet data lines as a fluid commodity that could be bought and sold The group was created following Enrons acquisition of Portland General Electric a small Oregon utility company that was also in the process of building its own fiber optic network Enron used that as a starting point to build its network which now has access to dozens of other global networks The company buys time and access to those networks and sells it to endusers who want to send large amounts of data over the Internet for things such as broadcasts of concerts and meetings or more mundane tasks like exchanging business data between two different offices of a company The company uses pooling points about data switching hubs it owns around the world to open and close connections with other networks around the world to effect those trades The company is also building a platform to deliver broadband content to homes and businesses such as movies and games The cornerstone of that content was originally a year contract with Blockbuster Video that would have combined that companys movie industry clout with Enrons technology to bring videoondemand to homes Enron canceled that deal in March however when Blockbuster couldnt deliver the quantity or quality of movies Enron wanted Rice said Were working directly with the studios broadcasters and other producers to get content for that ourselves Rice said The company announced a deal with a gaming firm to let customers order and play a variety of video games through the Web shortly after the Blockbuster deal fell through but Wall Street quickly punished Enrons stock for the news Combined with word of the job shuffling on March the companys stock dropped more than percent in a single day and has continued to sag Since early March the stock lost more than percent of its value going from about to as low as but closed up on Thursday at Carol Coale a senior analyst with Prudential Securities said the market already made adjustments for the reshuffling of jobs at EBS and reacted to the dropping price of bandwidth The balance of the drop has been in reaction to the premium multiple they were getting for their technology in general Coale said What would make the stock go back up is if technology as a whole goes back up Chelmsford Mass Telecom Network Company Cuts Staff Earnings Forecast Peter J Howe KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News The Boston Globe Massachusetts Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Sycamore Networks the Chelmsford optical networking company that once dreamed of rivaling Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks yesterday said it will lay off workers It also slashed its earnings forecasts Facing the same imploding market for telecommunications gear that has battered Lucent Nortel and companies across the telecom industry Sycamore said its revenue for the quarter ending April is likely to come in at a stunning million below analyst forecasts or million to million That is only onethird of the last quarters sales Instead of earning cents a share as it did last quarter Sycamore forecast a loss of to cents per share heavily driven by up to million in onetime charges for firing workers writing off inventory and other expenses This percent reduction in staff is a difficult step to take but we believe it is a necessary one Sycamore president Daniel E Smith said in an analysts conference call last evening Sycamore said the layoffs will occur over the next three weeks and would not comment on severance packages Sycamore cited the same set of factors that have led Wall Street to punish telecom stocks it adored just a year ago Carriers are abruptly slowing down or abandoning spending on network upgrades as they struggle to make profits on their huge investments so far and try to determine how bad and how long the US economic slowdown will be Sycamore also said it has faced problems from an unnamed supplier in getting enough components to ship expected volumes of its highend SN optical switching device this quarter but hopes to have it worked out by May or June Sycamore chief financial officer Frances M Jewels said the company will not generate net cash from operations for the next several quarters but is in a fair position to ride out the slowdown Sycamore last month reported just under million in cash and shortterm securities plus another million in longterm liquid assets That should be ample to cover its typical payroll research and operating expenses of about million a month Jewels and Smith said that despite the collapse in revenue the company does not want to cut back so deeply on research and sales that it will hurt its chances of resuming sales growth The question is when not if service providers will return to investing in their infrastructure Smith said Sycamore recently bought a roughly acre parcel of land in Tyngsborough where it plans to build a new campus consolidating its farflung Chelmsford offices Those plans are still proceeding albeit at a much more modest pace Sycamore spokesman Richard Williams said last night Sycamore would not say which customers have cut back or dropped spending plans but noted that it is well known Williams Communications accounts for more than half of its revenue and that Williams has said it will slow down capital expenditures Sycamore said it recently turned down a sale to a customer who was demanding vendor financing or buying gear on credit It said two customers with which it had made such deals had drawn down only million of million in authorized credit Many analysts have said Sycamore sorely needs to branch out from its customer base of about a dozen emerging carriers like Williams Networks and Enron Broadband to land a marquee name like ATT SBC or Verizon Smith said Sycamore is getting positive feedback from trials at bigname US and foreign carriers of that ilk but gave no indication any sales deals are imminent Sycamore shares which have collapsed from highs of more than last year had risen to in Nasdaq Stock Market action

Depending on the metal enduse by the transport sector makes up a large proportion of overall demand for most of the base metals complex Only in tin does it appear to be less than ten percent of total

large OECD producers the US is likely to show a substantial decline Japan a small decline and Western Europe a small increase it said US production which was above the long term trend is expected to fall backwards because of production cut backs by the Big Three carmakers While other producers in North America are increasing production seemingly confident in winning market share this is swamped by cutbacks by GM Ford and Chrysler DE the report said Elsewhere Japanese output has been decreasing during the s Annual average output will show little change in and stay close to the trend line over

above the typical range of Wall Street estimates of million Indeed in each of the three months of the first quarter US sales have surpassed consensus estimates While we expect a deterioration of sales performance in coming months it is true that car sales have held up better than expected But car sales for the first two months of the year in Germany which accounts for around a quarter of the European market are down five percent yearonyear The rebound in German unemployment is one sign that consumer spending could disappoint in coming months and autos could be particularly at risk Declining demand from the auto sector poses a clear risk it added So although car sales have been better than expected in such markets as the US there is still concern the transport sector may not

here now to talk about his new position and the task ahead Congratulations on the ascension to the throne down there VINCENT VIOLA NYMEX CHAIRMAN Thank you Jack CAFFERTY Job one is VIOLA Making sure that the exchange is postured to fulfill its purpose as a magnificently liquid and efficient pricing mechanism and a stable global counterparty for mediation of credit and risk on the products that we pursue to trade on the exchange CAFFERTY And to do it with an eye on making a profit VIOLA Yes exactly CAFFERTY Which is a little bit different assignment than its been down there VIOLA Yes exactly the fact that our business model now by virtue of the fact that we seek to make and provide profit to our shareholders compels us to start to act and function like a business CAFFERTY Now last year you did incur losses down there of about almost million Tell me a little bit about why that happened and what youre doing thats going to prevent it from continuing to happen VIOLA Well simply put we had to make a decision as to enhancing the access of participants to our marketplace And we went and decided to create our own proprietary electronic platform CAFFERTY Animex ph is that way VIOLA Enymex CAFFERTY Enymex Im sorry VIOLA And that was capital decision capital spending decision that we made rightfully so And that caused the gap to close between revenues and expenses CAFFERTY All right this is because I would assume of pressures from companies like Intercontinental Exchange Enron Online and some of the foreign operations as well right I mean you to upgrade to stay competitive is that VIOLA I think the BB model hit everyone as a novel yet substantively interesting concept For our marketplace the most efficient source of liquidity right now and the culture around trading our major product oil is based in the physical execution of those trades through open auction outcry And the culture around oil trading is clearly much more comfortable persontoperson We like to say simply put the best price for oil in the world is found on the floor of the NYMEX The electronic umbrella around that execution in liquidity clearly will be best served by an electronic platform CAFFERTY Whos going to win this tugofwar eventually between the advent of electronic transactions and the old way of doing it by yelling out your bid VIOLA I think the source of liquidity that has the most continuous and consistent tightness between the bid and offer will in fact win out And I think that the support of electronic access to the marketplace can only enhance the individual trader on the floors ability to provide the best service CAFFERTY Is it a matter of time though until technology simply outstrips the ability of individuals to move with the speed and proficiency that these computers can do VIOLA Clearly technology as it improves in terms of reliability and consistency in terms of delivery of price is the trend that we will react to as business people on the mercantile exchange And we are preparing very very aggressively to continue to make our markets the most efficient It has to be stated that NYMEX is a doubleA credit and a global counterparty which mediates risk across a very very wide range of market participants looking for credit mediation for the exchange of energy products CAFFERTY Talk to me for a minute about commodities and about the areas of the commodity business that you see perhaps being the areas that will generate the best profits for you where the most action is likely to be Just give me an overview of the markets from where you sit VIOLA Well as a business model the exchange provides for revenue sourced valueadded functions Firstly its the only neutral model that can be conceived and executed currently and looking for in the future Secondly its banking and mediation and price management through its margin facility and clearing facility is a unique source of value Thirdly its information and data that it provides from the uniquely neutral and independent and uninfluenced prices that are physically identified on the floor is a unique source of basis and benchmark for oil trading throughout the world And lastly the professional and unique ability and experience of the best oil traders in the world both on the floor and the ring of individuals that deal with those people off the floor every day make the NYMEX a uniquely talented pool of business potential It has to be stated that the gentlemen who trade oil for major concerns institutional concerns while theyre communicating with the floor of the NYMEX every day for many years theres a very very close connection and cultural comfort and reliability on those prices and their efficiencies that have grown over the years And we think that thats going to be maintained So I think those four principal sources of revenue are the essence of our model CAFFERTY What scares you about the new job when you wake up in the middle of the night you go gee Im the chairman now what worries you VIOLA I think I get a sense of unbridled excitement Ive always enjoyed a real good fair fight And I think what concerns me and excites me at the same time is that Im responsible for almost plus members and their families and the marketplaces that we serve trying to bring very fair open properly banked markets CAFFERTY Good stuff VIOLA Yes CAFFERTY Appreciate your

John and Pete Hoffman will help members of the citys sevenmember Ad Hoc Energy Committee find out as much information as possible about the proposed plants Enron Corp and El Paso Corp want to build power plants in the citys industrial area John and Hoffman made a presentation to the committee on Thursday Many people who live in North Broward County have opposed those plans particularly in the

Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards FR Doc Filed am BILLING CODE P EDITORIAL APPROVE ENRON POWER PLANT PUT POLLUTION ISSUE IN PERSPECTIVE South Florida SunSentinel Broward Metro A Copyright by the SunSentinel In a perfect world there would be no automobiles with their internal combustion engines spewing pollutantladen exhaust into the air But how perfect would such a world be without the mobility and economic vitality those cars provide In a perfect world there would be no factories or refineries polluting air and water alike But how perfect would such a world be without the steel the textiles and the petroleum products those plants produce to meet the needs of consumers And in a perfect world there would be no power plants spewing pollutants into the air But how perfect would such a world be without the electricity those plants generate to light heat and cool our homes and businesses Modern life forces unpleasant choices on all of us from the average consumer to the highestranking public official Those choices should be made with an eye on the big picture and never on the basis of unrealistic notions of an idyllic world devoid of the sometimes unhealthy byproducts of human enterprise The Pompano Beach City Commission is faced with such a choice On Tuesday commissioners are to consider a proposal by Enron Corp a Houstonbased energy company to build a peaking power plant in the city That type of plant operates only when a public utility in this case Florida Power Light Co needs to purchase a backup source of power during periods of peak usage The commissioners are under tremendous pressure from other politicians as well as residents not only of Pompano Beach but of neighboring Margate and Coconut Creek who worry about the increased air pollution such a plant inevitably would create Opponents also are suspicious of Enrons longrange plans which they contend involve a hidden agenda to push for state deregulation of the electric industry which in turn would enable Enron to operate the plant hours a day and sell the excess power elsewhere There also are concerns about Enrons plans to use diesel fuel as a backup to its natural gas supply the primary fuel source for the plant Those worries are understandable and no one should be unsympathetic to the residents concerns But if commissioners keep their eye on the big picture they will have to conclude that the positives of this proposal greatly outweigh the negatives To begin with South Floridas burgeoning population requires foresight to avoid future power shortages like those California is now experiencing A region that expects to add million people during the next years should be preparing now for the additional energy needs such growth will create Moreover a plant using relatively cleanburning natural gas and built by Enron a company lauded as progressive by environmentalists for embracing alternative energy sources and for its commitment to tackling global warming should be seen as preferable to what the area might ultimately be stuck with if forced in desperation to seek new sources of electricity generation during a power crisis Already it has been determined that the proposed Enron plant would generate far far less nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide than FPLs oilpowered plant at Port Everglades To put things in further perspective the plant would emit less than percent of the amount of nitrogen oxide emitted by Broward County automobiles in a typical year Opponents of the plant should be asking themselves whether their concern for the environment extends to carpooling or even leaving their cars at home at times when they could walk or ride a bicycle to their destination Concerns about the possible burning of diesel fuel are valid but Enron has agreed to fixed limits on the amount of diesel it would use and to use relatively highquality lowsulfur diesel Moreover Enrons smokestacks are to be feet high meaning neighborhoods near the plant would likely experience no more pollution than other neighborhoods in the area It should also be noted that the state Department of Environmental Protection has given preliminary approval to a permit for the plant saying a lengthy review had found that it would have little impact on the regions air quality Little impact Compare that with the positive impact it would have on Pompano Beach by increasing its tax base providing jobs and developing a large piece of land that no one else has expressed any interest in and on all of South Florida by providing a source of relatively clean power for a region that will surely need it in the nottoodistant future by minimizing costs to consumers and by making rolling brownouts unnecessary during periods of peak electrical usage The plant cannot be built without a zoning change for the acre site from industrial to public utility The Pompano Beach Planning and Zoning Board has already approved the rezoning City commissioners should keep their eye on the big picture and ratify that decision for the good of Pompano Beach and all of South Florida Notices Haleywest LLC et al Electric Rate and Corporate Regulation Filings Federal Register

Copyright c Federal Information News Dispatch Inc All rights reserved April Take notice that on March Transwestern Pipeline Company PO Box Omaha Nebraska in Docket No CP filed an application pursuant to Sections b and c of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval for Transco to replace mainline compression facilities at four existing compressor stations in Arizona all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection This filing may be viewed on the web at onlinerimshtm call for assistance Specifically Transwestern proposes to abandon in place twelve existing drivers and compressors totaling horsepower at Stations and and install operate a ISOrated horsepower turbine centrifugal compressor at each of the four stations Transwestern also requests to ensure a smooth transition to the new compressor units to maintain the ability to operate the existing facilities up to six months after the installation of the new units It is stated that the new units will require less maintenance activity than the existing units as well as operate more efficiently in flowing more gas through its system Transwestern states that result of the project it will be able to provide incremental capacity of approximately Mcf per day on its mainline from Thoreau New Mexico to California increasing its total capacity to California to Mcf per day It is indicated that the proposed modification will enable it to meet the supply and demand imbalance in the California area Transwestern proposes to place the facilities into service by June Transwestern estimates the cost for the proposed construction to be approximately to be financed with internallygenerated funds Transwestern also states that it is not at this time requesting rolledin pricing for the new facilities and understands that it will be at risk for the recovery of costs associated with the proposed modifications Any questions regarding the application should be directed to Keith L Petersen at There are two ways to become involved in the Commissions review of this project First any person wishing to obtain legal status by becoming a party to the proceedings for this project should on or before April file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC a motion to intervene in accordance with the requirements of the Commissions Rules of Practice and Procedure CFR or and the Regulations under the NGA CFR A person obtaining party status will be placed on the service list maintained by the Secretary of the Commission and will receive copies of all documents filed by the applicant and by all other parties A party must submit copies of filings made with the Commission and must mail a copy to the applicant and to every other party in the proceeding Only parties to the proceeding can ask for court review of Commission orders in the proceeding However a person does not have to intervene in order to have comments considered The second way to participate is by filing with the Secretary of the Commission as soon as possible an original and two copies of comments in support of or in opposition to this project The Commission will consider these comments in determining the appropriate action to be taken but the filing of a comment alone will not serve to make the filer a party to the proceeding The Commissions rules require that persons filing comments in opposition to the project provide copies of their protests only to the party or parties directly involved in the protest Persons who wish to comment only on the environmental review of this project should submit an original and two copies of their comments to the Secretary of the Commission Environmental commenters will be placed on the Commissions environmental mailing list will receive copies of the environmental documents and will be notified of meetings associated with the Commissions environmental review process Environmental commenters will not be required to serve copies of filed documents on all other parties However the nonparty commenters will not receive copies of all documents filed by other parties or issued by the Commission except for the mailing of environmental documents issued by the Commission and will not have the right to seek court review of the Commissions final order Page Number The Commission may issue a preliminary determination of nonenvironmental issues prior to the completion of its review of the environmental aspects of the project This preliminary determination typically considers such issues as the need for the project and its economic effect on existing customers of the applicant on other pipelines in the area and on landowners and communities For example the Commission considers the extent to which the applicant may need to exercise eminent domain to obtain rightsofway for the proposed project and balances that against the nonenvironmental benefits to be provided by the project Therefore if a person has comments on community and landowner impacts from this proposal it is important either to file comments or to intervene as early in the process as possible Also comments protests and interventions may be filed electronically via the internet in lieu of paper See CFT aiii and the instructions on the Commissions web site at efidoorbellhtm If the Commission decides to set the application for a formal hearing before an Administrative Law Judge the Commission will issue another notice describing that process At the end of the Commissions review process a final

and Electric Company Files for Chapter Reorganization Business Wire Copyright c Business Wire SAN FRANCISCOBUSINESS WIREApril Pacific Gas and Electric Company the utility unit of PGE Corporation NYSE PCG today filed for reorganization under Chapter of the US Bankruptcy Code in San Francisco bankruptcy court The company said it is taking this action in light of its unreimbursed energy costs which are now increasing by more than million per month continuing CPUC decisions that economically disadvantage the company and the now unmistakable fact that negotiations with Governor Gray Davis and his representatives are going nowhere Neither PGE Corporation nor any of its other subsidiaries including its National Energy Group have filed for Chapter reorganization or are affected by the utilitys filing We chose to file for Chapter reorganization affirmatively because we expect the court will provide the venue needed to reach a solution which thus far the State and the States regulators have been unable to achieve said Robert D Glynn Jr Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company The regulatory and political processes have failed us and now we are turning to the court Glynn added Our objective is to move through the Chapter reorganization process as quickly as possible without disruption to our operations or inconvenience to our customers Throughout this crisis our employees have been and remain committed to providing safe and reliable service to the million Californians who depend on us to deliver their gas and electricity Pacific Gas and Electric Company decided to file for the protection of Chapter primarily due to Failure by the state to assume the full procurement responsibility for Pacific Gas and Electrics net open position as was provided under ABX This has the result of increasing financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy procurement costs which the utility estimates to be approximately million or more per month The impact of actions by the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC on March and April that created new payment obligations for the company and undermined its ability to return to financial viability Lack of progress in negotiations with the state to provide recovery of billion in wholesale power purchases made by the utility since June which have not been recoverable in frozen rates The adoption by the CPUC of an illegal and retroactive accounting change that would appear to eliminate our true uncollected wholesale costs In addition despite Pacific Gas Electrics best efforts to work with the State of California to reach a consensual responsible fair and comprehensive solution to Californias energy crisis no agreement has been reached with the Governor and the Governors representatives have dramatically slowed the pace and the progress of discussions over the past month Furthermore since last fall we have filed comprehensive plans for resolving this matter with the CPUC but they have not acted affirmatively on them said Glynn On October Pacific Gas and Electric sought emergency rate action by the CPUC In November we filed our rate stabilization plan which if adopted would have increased electric prices by an initial percent compared with the percent recently adopted by the CPUC Neither request was acted upon Had the state acted at that time Pacific Gas and Electric would have been kept creditworthy Pacific Gas and Electric would have been able to enter into longterm power purchase contracts at prices lower than those announced by the state The state would not have had

state has spent more than billion on power purchases and with the CPUC has arranged to be reimbursed for these expenses noted Glynn In contrast since June Pacific Gas and Electric Company has spent billion in excess of revenues to pay for power for its customers and exhausted its ability to continue borrowing but there has been no progress on a plan to reimburse it for those expenditures as

Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WARSAW Dow Jones Poland will limit its chances of developing a flexible and diversified gas market if the government goes ahead with a longawaited gas import deal with Norwegian and Danish companies said a participant at the Power in Poland conference in Warsaw this week Entering into longterm guaranteed takeorpay contracts with Norwegian and Danish partners would result in the incumbent contract holders having an incentive to delay domestic gas market liberalization at any cost said Jarek Astramowicz president of Enron Poland the Polish unit of the USs Enron Corp ENE The incumbent contract holder Polands gas monopoly Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo RPGN or PGNiG said recently it will sign a longterm guaranteed takeorpay contract with Norways state oil company Statoil AS YDNS and Danish stateowned oil and gas utility DONG in May The three parties are negotiating a trade deal that could see between five and eight billion cubic meters bcm a year exported from Norway and Denmark to Poland by According to Polish press reports Statoil reportedly wants financial guarantees from the Polish government before signing any sales agreement with PGNiG The Norwegians also said they need to sell at least eight bcm of gas a year to Poland to make the project financially viable while the Polish side has said it wants to import only bcm a year PGNiG president Andrzej Lipko said this week PGNiG and Statoil were negotiating intensively but didnt say when a deal might be signed Astramowicz said the deal would reduce the Polish sides room for maneuver in future gas importation and corner Poland into accepting gas at higher prices than it could find on EU markets when the Polish and EU grids are fully interconnected Enron like other traders operates best in markets where there is greater liquidity and the Norway deal would dry up considerable amounts of potential liquidity Astramowicz added that the Polish market would be oversupplied if the deal goes ahead pushing up enduser prices And its the projected increases in demand for gas in Poland over the next years that presents the major problem Barbara LitakZarebska Deputy Treasury Minister said this week gas demand projections were largely based on an expected rapid shift from coalpowered to gaspowered electricity generation in Poland Polands Economy Ministry estimates the countrys current annual gas consumption at bcm bcm and expects this total to reach bcm by including bcm to be consumed by the newly constructed gas fired power plants Astramowicz said this projection was too high claiming the power sector was likely to take only bcm bcm by Furthermore power generated from gas cannot compete with power generated by coalfired power plants in price terms Therefore this source of increase in gas demand will not materialize in the near future he said As an alternative to the Norway deal Astramowicz pointed to western European gas trading hubs already offering flexible gas supply contracts with terms of up to ten years For example competitively priced gas supplies based on the contracts executed in Zeebrugge Belgium or Emden Germany are already reaching customers in eastern Germany today and as Polish gas consumption grows could easily be used to source any additional gas supplies needed for customers in Poland said Astramowicz He also pointed to potential import price advantages from the EU He said gas imported from the EU would cost about cm against a price on the current Yamal contract of cm and a Norwegian gas price including the estimated transmission charge to the Polish border of cm of cm PGNiGs Lipko said that imported Russian gas prices would not be cheaper than Norwegian supplies once a pipeline

Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved BOMBAY India AP A top official of US energy giant Enron Corp was authorized to issue a termination notice to pull out of a controversial power project in western India the largest foreign investment in the country a newspaper reported Friday The board of the Dabhol Power Company the Indian subsidiary of Enron met in London on Wednesday and authorized the companys managing director to issue a preliminary notice to terminate the project billed as the worlds largest natural gas fired power plant The Times of India reported The board has given powers to the management to issue the pretermination notice But the meeting unanimously felt the need of the hour was not to terminate the project but to initiate a renegotiation process Vinay Bansal chairman of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board was quoted as saying by the newspaper Enron officials have refused comment The notice is the first of three steps that could end in the abandonment of the dlrs billion project A sixmonth reconciliation period would follow any move by the Dabhol Power Company to issue the termination notice Bansal said Indian lenders present at a meeting with foreign financial institutions in London earlier this week have said they favor renegotiation The project has been in trouble since December when the Maharashtra state government where the Dabhol project is located said the tariff was exorbitant and demanded a new price agreement The state power utility said it could not pay Dabhols monthly electricity dues which prompted the company to invoke a federal guarantee in February This was the first time in India that a federal guarantee was invoked As part of the agreement between the company and the state government the federal government has to pay in case of a state default But before the federal government stepped in the state government paid dlrs million in outstanding bills Since then the state power utility has confirmed that all pending bills have been paid But a dispute over payment of dlrs million for December and January bills is pending Several political parties had earlier demanded the project be scrapped since the costs had increased from rupees four cents per unit agreed six years ago for electricity generated by the megawatt naphtha plant to rupees cents

its stock if the companies are profiting at the expense of California consumers I assume their Enron and Reliant stock has done quite well in the last couple of years but it has done well at the expense of California consumers he said But Pat Macht a Calpers spokeswoman says if Calpers were to divest of every stock that had a critic it would be impossible to manage Senator Don Perata DOakland agreed with Macht We have been through this before and it is a very complicated thing he said But for us to divest of all the energy stocks I mean we would be using candles In the past Calpers has divested from South African and tobacco stocks Macht said the decision was a purely financial one and that Calpers is so large it has investments in every sector not just energy It is important to

taken by the Board at its meeting here yesterday by a vote of six to one after Maharastra government representatives were prevented from voting on ground of interested party Dubbed as unfortunate by

KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire NEW DELHI April THE Food Corporation of India FCI has identified locations for creation of lakh tonnes lt bulk storage capacity on buildownoperate BOO basis by the private sector These include establishing godownssilos of three lt capacity each in Nabha Barnala and Moga in Punjab and Sirsa and Kaithal in Haryana and one lt each in Hooghly Chennai Coimbatore Bangalore and Mumbai Besides FCI has invited expression of interest for the construction of conventional godowns of to tonnes capacity each through the BOO route In this case it is proposed to build nearly six lt of aggregate capacity in around locations all over the country Private parties investing in these facilities would store and maintain foodgrains procured by FCI for which they will be paid storage costs Under the National Policy on Handling Storage and Transportation of Foodgrain notified on July FCI will guarantee utilisation of these facilities up to per cent for the first years and per cent for the next years Further the Budget has granted a fiveyear tax holiday and per cent deduction of profits for the next five years to enterprises engaged in the integrated business of handling transportation and storage of foodgrains The policy also provides for deduction of per cent of profits derived by institutions financing these projects prompting the likes of ICICI and IDFC to enter the fray and offer their advisory and funding expertise in the area The move to involve the private sector in the creation as well as operation of storage facilities on FCIs behalf has been defended mainly on two counts Firstly it would tackle the Governments spiralling food subsidy problem through reduction in grain handling and operating costs something that FCI cannot achieve on its own Secondly there is a massive dearth of storage capacity with Government agencies which neither have the resources to make fresh investments To address the first point one needs to consider the real cost dimensions involved Conservative estimates are that private investors would incur a cost of roughly Rs per tonne for constructing bulk silos Thus creation of lt storage capacity entails investments of Rs crore Assuming a debtequity ratio the annual interest outgo on investment would come to at least Rs per tonne The investor also has to spend on labour fumigation storage interest on grain turnover of stocks etc all of which adds to another Rs per tonne Besides annual maintenance costs are reckoned at about Rs per tonne If over and above this investors are to be given a decent per cent return on equity FCI would have to fork out nothing less than Rs per tonne for subcontracting its storage operations to private parties And on lt capacity the annual outgo works out to about Rs crore Compare this to FCIs own current annual carrying cost of Rs per tonne for its grains In FCI held about lt of buffer stocks over and above the normative requirement on which it incurred carrying costs interest plus storage of nearly Rs crore In the proposed regime it would end up coughing over onesixth of these sums for a tenth of the capacity That raises the issue of inadequate storage capacity with Government agencies According to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and Public Distributions latest Annual Report storage capacity with FCI as on December stood at million tonnes of which covered godowns accounted for mt and CAP Cover and Plinth mt The Central Warehousing Corporation CWC had eight mt capacity of which covered godowns comprised seven mt The aggregate storage capacity of CWCs associate State Warehousing Corporations came to another mt including mt of covered godowns If one adds to this the estimated mt of capacities available with State Governments the public sector has almost mt of storage capacity which is more than sufficient to cater to the existing mt of foodgrain stocks in the Central pool And contrary to general belief the proportion of crude CAP structures which are ostensibly vulnerable to rodent attack and moisture ingress is hardly per cent That the pronouncements of public godowns bursting at their seams are somewhat exaggerated is also borne by the fact that CWC godowns today operate at around per cent of their capacity On the other hand the Government is committed to ensuring per cent capacity utilisation for bulk storage capacity built by private agencies including leading grain handling entities from Australia and Canada Whether this would lead to a miniEnron situation remains to be seen

probe is ordered on the lines of Srikrishna Commission Mr Deshmmukh has requested the group not to take any hasty decision Prof Gopal Dukhande spokesperson of the Janata Dal secular told this newspaper that the group had not given up its main demand to order a judicial probe into the way the Power Purchase Agreements PPAs were singed with Enron He said the group would meet on May to take into considerations all the developments taking place regarding the Enron power project The official coordination committee of the DF government is also scheduled to meet at the state guest house Sahyadri on the same day ND Patil of the PWP who is the convener of the DF coordination committee is also opposed to renegotiations and wants the government to appoint an inquiry commission We are opposed to the way the PPAs were signed with Enron ignoring the interests of the state The inquiry commission will bring out the truth a senior minister said Even if Enron now wants to withdraw from the project we should not let it go without investigating the matter he added Meanwhile union finance minister Yashwant Sinha has agreed to depute a highlevel representative of the Union government to represent finance power petroleum and other union government agencies on the renegotiation team These departments will set up their own internal coordination committee to review the situation from

MUMBAI The state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP finds itself politically isolated following the Maharashtra bandh on Wednesday The protest was jointly organised by the Shiv Sena an ally of the BJP the left parties and several trade union organisations Even a section of the Congress backed the bandh The bandh was specifically targeted at the BJP which heads the National Democratic Alliance NDA at the Centre Even though the Sena is a part of the NDA it seems to have cleverly sensed the mood of the people which is clearly against the economic policies of the Centre and joined hands with the left and democratic parties to organise the bandh A BJP officebearer said The Sena finds the ground slipping from under its feet and hence it is indulging in gimmicks like sponsoring bandhs However Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray said We have unambiguously demonstrated that we are on the side of the workers farmers and the middle class We have prioritised our commitments and our first priority is to the people and not to cabinet berths Sources in the Sena said the party does not want to be punished by the people during elections for the blunders made by the BJP The deleterious effects of globalisation are there for everyone to see Thousands of looms have fallen silent because of textile imports apples and chocolates from New Zealand and Switzerland and toys chemicals and dyes from China and Taiwan are edging out Indian products in local markets Not only workers even middleclass employees are being fired by their employers Are we to mutely watch the crushing of thousands of families under the wheels of the globalisation juggernaut asked a Sena leader Interestingly many in the BJP concur with this viewpoint but are afraid to speak out lest they are accused of violating the party discipline In private BJP activists are extremely critical of the Vajpayee governments nonresponse to the torture and killing of jawans of the Border Security Force by Bangladesh Rifles Our foreign minister Jaswant Singh personally escorts top Pakistani terrorist Maulana Masood Azhar from a jail to Afghanistan and sets him free Mr Vajpayee unilaterally declares a ceasefire in Kashmir And now he does nothing when our jawans are killed by a small nation like Bangladesh a senior BJP leader observed Senior leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad VHP Ashok Singhal who was in the city recently openly stated that the Vajpayee government has come to a standstill However party spokesperson Atul Bhatkhalkar said We do not want to do anything that will complicate the situation for Bangladeshi prime minister Hasina Wajed who is proIndia People should appreciate the ground realities Meanwhile the Enron issue is likely to emerge as a test of the recent unity between the Sena and parties of the left The controversial power project of the US MNC was endorsed by the Sena when it along with the BJP was in power in the state But the left parties want the project to be scrapped Sena chief Bal Thackeray has gone on record stating that his government was under pressure from the US to sign the accord with Enron With Enron in a confrontationist mode visavis the state and Central

World Reporter TM NEW DELHI Union power minister Suresh Prabhu on Thursday assured chief minister Sheila Dikshit that the Capital would be provided an additional MW of electricity starting first week of May Dikshit met Prabhu to apprise him of the power situation in the Capital She told Prabhu that the city was facing a power deficit of about MW and desperately needed an additional supply to meet the increasing demand The Centre promised that the additional power would be made available from the Eastern Grid Dikshit told Prabhu that the Delhi government was negotiating with the Chhatisgarh government to buy MW She said the Delhi government was facing severe problem in getting power from Himachal Pradesh Electricity Board due to reduction in the power generation in the state The government is now contemplating talks with West Bengal to purchase power Dikshit said her government was negotiating a deal with Enron but was reluctant to buy electricity due to the high tariff quoted by the company Dikshit said additional power was also expected from the three units at Dadri Badarpur and Raj Ghat power stations which would be become functional by May Besides Dikshit Delhi power minister Narendra Nath and principal secretary power Ashok Pradhan and Delhi Vidyut Board chairman Jagdish Sagar were also present Enron ready to pull out but lenders say wait Business Times Bureau The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI The Dabhol Power Company board which met on Wednesday in London authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board The company however may not pull out of the project yet considering its lenders who met on Monday opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations Sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported Enron on the termination issue domestic financial institutions led by the Industrial Development Bank of India prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move Enron needs the lenders consent to file a pretermination notice for pulling out from the project The decision to empower DPC chief Wade Cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single IDBI vote against such a move Another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of Phase II of the project will depend on the Government of India assuring payment mechanisms Institutions are yet to disburse about per cent of the sanctioned package which is crucial for completing the Phase II expansion project The board has given powers to Wade Cline to issue a pretermination notice But the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious renegotiation proceedings said MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal who attended the board meeting MSEB presented their views to the board members and it was understood by Enron which also included the Rs crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings We have also made it clear that the tariff structure of Enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable Bansal added They cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction said a top banker who was present during the lenders meet There is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the PPA should be kept in abeyance he added The global arrangers for the DPC include ANZ Investment Bank Credit Suisse First Boston ABNAMRO Citibank and the State Bank of India where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials However some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings Meanwhile in a clear reversal of roles Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the PPA We will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us including DPC Deshmukh said Deshmukh was echoing Union Power Minister Suresh Prabhus sentiments who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row He however added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the billion project would be a blow to Indias efforts to woo foreign investors The DPC has already slapped one conciliation notice on the Centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over nonpayment of dues amounting to Rs crore and interest towards the bills due for December and January Meanwhile MSEB officials said in Mumbai that the March bills amounting to Rs crore was paid on Thursday as protest payment despite the dispute over the amount When asked on the future course of action Bansal said it was up to the DPC The Enron issue was also raised in the Lok Sabha on Thursday when Prabhu said that scrapping of the agreement would cost Rs crore to the Centre whose liability in the project agreement was limited Centres liability in case of termination is one years electricity bill and a termination fee of million he said Indias single largest foreign investor threatens to pull out Madhu Nainan Agence FrancePresse Copyright BOMBAY April AFP The biggest

subsidiary Dabhol Power Co DPC is putting up a billiondollar power station in Indias industrial heartland Maharashtra state At a meeting in London on Wednesday the DPC board of directors authorised chief executive officer Neil McGregor and Enron India chief K Wade Cline to serve a preliminary termination notice for sale of power within the next four weeks to the Maharashtra electricity board The twopart power station is being erected at the port town of Dabhol some kilometres south of the state capital Bombay Payments for electricity have been guaranteed by the state and federal governments Part one began generating power in May but the project has been mired in controversy and acrimony with the state government arguing it could not afford the high electricity bills This is a drastic and unfortunate decision the board of directors has taken even though we made it clear that we want to find a solution to the impasse Maharashtra energy minister Padamsinh Patil told AFP Patil said a decision had been taken by the state and federal governments last week to set up a panel to renegotiate the power purchase agreement Enron knew about the decision We have no animosity towards Enron We have paid the February bill under duress and we told them we are ready to pay the other bills also under protest Vijay Kalantri president of the All India Association of Industries described the Enron move as unbusinesslike They have done this to build up the pressure on the state and federal governments Economic disputes are not resolved by threats but by sitting down to discuss and renegotiate contracts Kalantri agreed that if Enron carried out its threat the consequences would be bad for all parties Ashok Khinvasara director at the Ispat group said India could suffer as a foreign investment destination especially in the power sector The Ispat groups plans to put up a billiondollar power project in Maharashtra have been put on hold in the wake of the Enron controversy Since the state electricity board is not paying its dues Enron is within its rights to serve a termination notice Khinvasara said The board will not be hit initially as it buys very little power from DPC now but the size of Enrons claims and the speed with which it sets in motion a recovery process could turn out to be worrisome Enrons claims could be more than billion rupees million dollars Khinvasara said the Enron episode showed that future investors should take care to see that tariffs are affordable and should not take comfort merely in contracts and government guarantees The DPC board of directors decision is the second in a series of moves to increase the pressure on the government Early in April DPC served the state electricity board a notice of political force majeure which is a legal manoeuvre that enables a party to break a contract in the case of events beyond its control The Dabhol project has had a turbulent ride ever since it was signed in Allegations of corruption and high costs led to the scrapping of the contract in but it was renegotiated the same year In February a state government panel recommended fresh re negotiations to bring down the tariffs and charged

ATS continues to grow its client base by providing the customers with business solutions that best fit their requirements either through traditional software licenses ASP access or BFO services Traditional software licensing in the small business market continues to be strong with an additional new clients in North American subscribing to ATSs small business solutions ATSs plus junior and emerging producer clients in North America establishes the company as the dominant provider of information solutions to this market segment which is a foundation for future ASP and BFO growth During the first half of fiscal year ATS significantly invested in expanding its Dallas operations in order to effectively service its growing ASP BFO client base and further develop its product and service offerings This investment contributed to the percent increase in operating expenses for the first six months of fiscal to million from million for the same period in fiscal As an extraordinary item ATS expensed percent of the previously accrued expenditures See Extraordinary Items in the Financial Statements related to the Plan of Arrangement with Petroleum Place Inc ATS accrued those charges related to the transaction that would have been accounted for as transaction costs if the merger had been capable of proceeding As the Merger Agreement expired uncompleted a result of financial market conditions that prevented Petroleum Place from effecting a qualified Initial Public Offering events that were clearly out of the control of management effective March ATS has as per Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principals expensed all related Financial CDN Accounting CDN Legal CDN and Managerial Expenses CDN previously accrued This results in a total onetime extraordinary charge of CDN Effective October ATS changed from the deferral method of accounting for income tax to the liability method as pronounced by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants No adjustment was required to the consolidated financial statements for this change in policy RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT Prior to initiating new R D projects ATS investigates the marketplace and strives to have its new product development initiatives endorsed by industry representatives to ensure market viability The majority of ATSs new product R D initiatives are backed by customers either by customer cofunded development projects for example the Horizon project with the Bank of America and the TAAMS project with the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the ongoing maintenance revenue stream and User Group involvement through inkind contributions for example the TEAM project This approach allows ATS to continue to maintain its commitment to the expansion and improvement of its product and service offerings to its existing and new customers with leading edge technology that will have a positive impact on ATSs customers bottom line As part of ATSs growth plan ATS invested million in R D percent of revenues for the first half of fiscal as compared to million percent of gross revenues for the same period in New product R D initiatives include the TEAM product a webbased tracking system for oil and gas well administration which comprised percent of expensed R D for the half Enhancements to the Horizon product a financial accounting system originally created for the Bank of America which will be introduced into the broader petroleum marketplace later this year comprised percent of expensed R D for the half As announced one Texasbased producer has already contracted to have Horizon implemented a positive confirmation of ATSs investment in this highly awaited solution Additionally the Preview product an asset management system with successful installs currently in progress comprised percent of R D for the half It is noted that ATS has continued with its policy of fully expensing these longterm investments rather than capitalizing these investments for future amortization The balance of R D dollars approximately percent was invested in association with products that generate existing maintenance and enhancement revenue ensuring that these products remain current and continue to meet the needs of ATSs growing customer base ENRON MUTUAL MARKETING AGREEMENT On March ATS was pleased to announce its mutual marketing agreement partnership with Enron North America to provide outsourcing of accounting and administrative functions to Canadian and US producers The partnership combines Enrons commodity asset management and financial services with ATSs outsourcing capabilities for backoffice processing and information technology providing producers with the ability to source any service from wellhead to burnertip connection in one transaction Enron and ATS provide services to effectively aggregate market schedule and account for the producers supply stream while at the same time reduce their need for costly corporate infrastructure needs Within the Enron partnership ATS offers the trained personnel and facilities to perform administration and accounting duties such as joint venture revenue and production accounting transaction processing expenditure authorization tax payments royalty payments and regulatory filings The client benefits of outsourcing these backoffice responsibilities to ATS include higher productivity increased flexibility and lower administrative costs for the producers It is anticipated that the partnership will provide limited growth for ATS during Fiscal however the relationship positions ATS for significant revenue and earnings growth potential in fiscal and beyond SEGMENTED FINANCIAL SUMMARY The company has significant operations in two geographic locations Canada and the United States Comparative segmented financial information is summarized as follows Mnths Ended March It is noted that the Canadian Division is charged with one hundred percent of the amortization of historical Application Software and Goodwill investments Accordingly the bottom line for the Canadian division is reduced by one hundred percent of these noncash accounting charges Under the proposed Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants CICA Emerging Issues Committee Exposure Draft on Business Combinations Accounting for Goodwill the practice of the amortization of Application Software and Goodwill would be discontinued with these investment values maintained on the Balance Sheet subject to annual value impairment reviews Should the value be impaired then the company would write down the fixed asset value of the Purchased Application Software and Goodwill investments by the impairment reduction Once implemented this pronouncement will put Canadian Companies on par with United States Reporting Issuers When implemented this revised practice will enable ATS to more appropriately report Canadian and United States segmented financial results ATSs decline in the Canadian revenues and increase in US revenues coincides with studies conducted by major research firms such as Giga Forrester IDC and others The decrease in Canadian revenues is reflective of a mature marketplace for enterprise software and delayed customer expenditures associated with a recognized need for a new business model Conversely the increased US revenues are directly attributable to acceptance of the ASP and BFO as desired business models in the US marketplace Canadian companies have been slower to accept these business models and lag the United States marketplace by approximately months in most sectors according to the above referenced research firms This lag period is believed to be ending for most Canadian sectors and ATS is beginning to gain ASP and BFO ATS anticipated this trend and planned its investments accordingly Consequently we anticipate growth in ATSs Canadian operational reoccurring revenues as the Canadian industry adopts the ASP BFO business model similar to ATSs US operations CORPORATE ACTIVITIES March ATS appointed of Mr John A Brussa a partner with the firm of Burnet Duckworth Palmer to the Companys Board of Directors Mr Brussa received his LLB in from the

shareholders of ATS the Merger Agreement PPI was required complete an initial public offering As of March PPI did not complete an initial public offering and therefore the Merger Agreement between the

Bloomberg Corporate Bond Alert WorldCom RadioShack on Docket Update Bloomberg Six Western Power Providers Complete First Step to Form Independent Transmission Company Business Wire Copyright c Business Wire PORTLAND OreBUSINESS WIREMay In an effort to ensure reliability and maximize cost efficiencies six western utilities have been granted preliminary approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to form an independent high voltage electricity transmission company serving six Western states The independent forprofit company called TransConnect will be a member of a planned nonprofit regional transmission organization RTO West The framework for RTO West which will span eight Western states also was approved by FERC Under the proposal approved by FERC TransConnect could initially own or lease the high voltage transmission facilities currently held by Avista Corp Montana Power Company Portland General Electric Puget Sound Energy Nevada Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power Company Combining transmission resources into one independent company may create new opportunities to attract capital and improve the transmission infrastructure Among other things the FERC order approved TransConnects governance structure and found that TransConnect met the Commissions independence requirements The order also determined that TransConnect would qualify to file for innovative and incentive rates Additionally the order finds that the proposed structure for sharing planning and expansion functions is consistent with FERCs basic requirements but reserves final approval pending further clarification by TransConnect and RTO West regarding the details and decision process for such sharing The TransConnect companies are pleased with the FERC order on the TransConnect filing and gratified that the Commission supports a forprofit business model that has the potential to provide very significant benefits said Paul Mohler a representative for the six TransConnect companies There are a number of additional steps that must now be taken by the companies including among other things preparation of a rate filing and various state and federal approvals Ultimately the outcome of TransConnects proposal and the companies decisions to move forward with the formation of this transmission company will depend on the economics and conditions imposed during the regulatory approval process and approval by the individual company boards of directors TransConnect facilities are within the RTO West territory which will operate more than percent of the high

c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW DELHI Dow Jones A prolonged electricity payment dispute between USbased Enron Corps ENE Indian unit the Dabhol Power Co and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board could be resolved within a month the head of an independent energy think tank said Friday The dispute over the controversial megawatt billion DPC project in Indias western state of Maharashtra came to a head recently when the DPCs board authorized the management to proceed with a preliminary notice of termination the first of three steps that lead to the abandonment of the project Despite the move Rajendra K Pachauri director of the New Delhibased Tata Energy Research Institute said he is optimistic of a resolution Its in everybodys interest to come up with a reasonable settlement I think DPC will accept a renegotiated contract because they are in an impasse right now Pachauri told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Pachauri is also one of the nine members of the committee appointed by the Maharashtra state government to renegotiate the MSEBs controversial power purchase agreement with DPC I do hope that within a month the whole thing can be sorted out DPC wants the negotiations to be short and decisive and if all the parties are willing an agreement wont be difficult he added The project has been mired in financial disputes since its main customer the Maharashtra State Electricity Board has failed to pay several of its bills Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power Critics object to Dabhol charging rupees INR a kilowatthour for its power compared with INRKWh charged by other suppliers The state government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised agreement within a month The committees goal is to lower the power tariff and allow the sale of excess power to the federal government or its utilities A restructure of the DPCs stakeholding may also be on the agenda As reported the negotiating committees first meeting with the DPC management scheduled for Saturday has been postponed until GMT May at DPCs request DPC Must Run Plant At Full Capacity Pachauri Pachauri said that it is in DPCs interest to run its plant at full capacity and maximize sales Their sales wont be maximized unless the price is attractive They really need to bring down the cost to the consumer Our brief is very clear We have to sit down with them and identify a strategy by which the Dabhol project can be viable for everyone he said This will involve a complete financial engineering of the DPC Youd need to restructure the project debts and bring down the interest rates on debts to the current levels in the market he added The DPC project the largest single foreign investment in India has a debtequity ratio of Pachauri said Dabhol should agree to charging between INR and INRKWh This is a reasonable range and should be acceptable to everyone he said He said if Enron decided to pull out of Dabhol it wouldnt have a

Financial Post TransAlta sells power unit M deal Final step in retreat from regulated electricity industry Carol Howes Financial Post with files from The Canadian Press National Post National C Front c National Post All Rights Reserved CALGARY TransAlta Corp has struck an million deal to sell its power transmission business to a consortium of companies led by SNCLavalin Inc and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board The sale is the final step in TransAltas program to divest about billion in assets during the past two years as it retreated from the regulated power industry and focused on electrical generation and marketing It was challenging said Steve Snyder TransAltas president and chief executive yesterday This is it in terms of the core restructuring TransAlta expects to realize earnings from the sale of about million or cents per share which will be put toward the expansion of power generation plants in Canada and Mexico The Calgarybased electric company has plans to spend up to billion a year over the next five years to bulk up on its power generation nearly doubling its megawatts of capacity Mr Snyder said TransAlta will focus on ensuring its generation assets meet its target of a return on equity If they dont those assets could also come under review he said The sale comes as Enron Corp the biggest energy trader in North America has begun selling electricity and natural gas to consumers in Alberta The electricity industry opened to competition on Jan The move prompted ATCO Ltd to follow TransAlta and put its retail electricity and gas units up for sale The consortium buying the transmission assets known as AltaLink sees the potential to expand the system both inside and outside Alberta said Mr Snyder The group also includes TransElect Inc a new USbased independent power transmission company that is keen to add additional transmission capacity to the North American power grid and Macquarie North America Ltd an Australianowned investment bank Mr Snyder said TransAltas transmission assets attracted interest from US and international firms but he was always hopeful a Canadian buyer could be found Under the agreement the teachers pension fund will assume all the transmission businesss debt Infrastructure investments are attractive to us because they will give us stable real return said Ontario Teachers Pension Plan spokeswoman Lee Fullerton Theyre fairly lowvolatility because theyre regulated by government so they give us a very stable cash flow and theyre linked to inflation Teachers pensions are also indexed to inflation and this made the investment the pension plans first large infrastructure deal attractive Ms Fullerton said This acquisition is a milestone occasion for SNCLavalin since it is an important investment in Alberta said Pierre Anctil an executive vicepresident at the Montreal company By combining the strengths of the TransAlta team with our considerable financial and technical expertise we are wellplaced to deliver topquality transmission services to Albertans and meet current and future needs Mr Snyder said in May at the companys annual meeting that it was looking to sell its heavily regulated transmission business which accounts for about half of Albertas power grid and of the companys assets It has employees The company owns and operates more than kilometres of highvoltage lines in southern Alberta Under the deal SNC will own of the equity the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board about and Macquarie North America about TransElect will be brought in to operate the transmission lines and will own of the equity Karen Taylor an analyst at BMO Nesbitt Burns in Toronto said the value of the assets was in line with what analysts expected It is at present time a relatively lowreturn stable business she said Nick Majendie a Vancouver analyst with Canaccord Capital Corp said TransAlta has done a good job executing its plan to restructure and expects the latest sale to be well received by investors TransAlta started down the road to becoming a pure play when it sold its retail electricity business and local power lines to Kansas Citybased Utilicorp United Inc for million UtiliCorp subsequently sold the retail electricity business to Edmontons municipally owned Epcor Utilities Inc for million SNCLavalin is one of the worlds biggest engineering and construction companies with offices in countries The Montrealbased company also owns partly owns or manages infrastructure ranging from the toll highway north of Toronto to other projects The Ontario Teachers

CARIBBEAN Brazil plans for emergency energy supply By RAYMOND COLITT and GEOFF DYER Financial Times c Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved But the government will still face a delicate decision over when to suspend rationing and lifting restrictions early could backfire Geoff Dyer and Raymond Colitt report Brazil plans to have an emergency supply of around MW of energy in place by April next year from sources such as crushed sugar cane to reduce the risk of a new round of rationing next year according to energy officials The spectre of widespread blackouts has faded amid strong public response to the enforced rationing measures introduced last month by the government But attention is now turning to medium and longterm solutions to the energy crisis Pedro Parente the minister charged with resolving the energy crisis said the extra power would be in addition to around MW of new gasfired capacity expected to be online by next year and would reduce the pressure on the energy system if another drought occurred over the summer months Rationing next year cannot be completely ruled out but we are working to limit the risk as much as possible Mr Parente said in an interview Having seen its approval ratings plummet because of the energy crisis the government is desperate to avoid another round of rationing this time next year which would fall during the presidential election campaign The emergency supply measures will supplement the longerterm energy strategy to be outlined today by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso which will lean heavily on a rapid expansion in gasfired power stations Mr Parente said that by there would be sufficient new capacity in place so there would be no need for rationing by then The extra energy supply for next year will include alternative energy sources such as generators fuelled by crushed sugar cane and wind power Full details of the programme would be ready by early August he said Even with these measures and the new gas power stations however the outlook for next year will still hinge on the level of rainfall during the wet summer months from October to March Around per cent of Brazils energy comes from hydroelectric plants that are powered by water from reservoirs During the last summer rainfall was per cent of its historic average a level of rain that has been exceeded in all but of the last years The northeast the worst affected area had only received such little rain in three of the last years According to initial estimates Mr Parente said that with the expected increase in supply from gasfired plants there would probably be no need for rationing next year if rainfall reached per cent its historic average over the summer If rainfall was below that figure then the emergency supply measures would limit the extent of a new rationing programme Questions remain however over how many new gasfired plants will be in place by next year El Paso and Enron the US power companies could put a total of MW on line by but say they are waiting to find out more about the regulations they will face Regardless some experts say the need for compulsory rationing next year could be reduced as companies and consumers discover the potential for permanent energy savings thereby limiting the rebound in demand if restrictions are lifted But even if the government brings on the necessary new capacity and rainfall does not disappoint it will still face a delicate decision over when to suspend rationing Lifting restrictions prematurely could backfire politically and technically says Mauricio Tolmasquim

caller not fist caller but towards the end of our show our caller is for this segment the first caller That honor goes to Roseanne in New York Hi Roseanne MORRIS New Mexico I think KATAYAMA Oh in New Mexico thats right CALLER Good afternoon I would appreciate your near and long term comments on Enron URL CARTY OK Now see Enron is a classic example of what Ive been discussing Enron is a wonderful company its well diversified primarily in natural gas area and its a very well managed company Its high diversified geographically here in the United States and its a company that should benefit enormously by any improvement in the energy policy here in the United States And look at where that price is I mean were talking about the market giving that stock away at this point KATAYAMA Plus Enron had been in that deal with if I remember correctly Blockbuster URL to deliver video through its lines and that deal fell apart CARTY Thats right But it really didnt need it because quite frankly this is a diversified energy company that will benefit through any improvement in energy policy in this country any improvement MORRIS We have a caller from Louisiana joining us now Jim hi Whats your question CALLER Yes My question is pertaining to alternative energy and particularly fuel sale and if youre not real hot on that you might give us a couple of picks concerning any of the drillers or oil services Thank you CARTY OK First off I like the idea of alternative energy I came into this industry in out of school and that was a brutal time when we had our oil embargo and our energy crisis and alternative energy was a very big option at the time You could do it through win You could do it through sales I liked the idea of doing it through sales but remember plaices like Florida have about as much rain fall as Pennsylvania and therefor they have a lot of cloudy days and you could only use sales effectively in those states where you have an awful lot of sun such as the southwest So there are only of limited use So I think that our the true measure of our progress in coming up with an energy solution is ultimately to go that way but over the short term to do some drilling and those two cases I like KaraMagee ph and then Adorical ph Petroleum Theyre both well placed They both work in drilling area and I think that at these prices theyre this is a good entry point KATAYAMA Mike our guest in the last hour Jim Waggoner touched upon this stock as one of his favorites the storage stock EMC URL We have an email and our emailer wants to know your view on this stock CARTY As a matter of fact when Jim was here and was talking he was basically talking about the stocks that I love EMC despite he look of that chart is one of them EMC is very very big on storage technology In fact years ago it was probably one of the least sophisticated in that industry and it rapidly overcame storage tech and certainly IBM URL to the point where they had all of these installations They put them in they were replacing their own they were rebuilding equipment computers putting their equipment in substituting it for IBMs They have a lot of installations Theyre technology In doing that their technology grew and grew and grew and they finally became one of the most sophisticated and certainly the best placed in the industry and at these prices as soon as the market you know as the market turns around this is a stock thats really going to move MORRIS We have another caller Jeff from Illinois thanks for joining us Whats your question CALLER Good afternoon I wanted to know Mikes comments on Walgreen URL on the short and long term Thank you CARTY Wallgreen is first of all I always shop there I love the place And you know if I were going to listen to most analysts and portfolio managers they say if you like the place then you really should be investing in it It happens to be a reasonably well run company Its good in terms of consumer staples I mean theyll probably give despite the fact that it has dropped in price recently it will probably give you a much more stable investment than others and as a consequence if I were holding it Id continue to hold it If it drops any more Ill certainly consider buying it KATAYAMA And weve got an email question about Compaq URL the PC company as well as the storage company as well as the server manufacturer CARTY I know Were holding Compaq but Compaq is a very very difficult thing to love because of its performance as you see on the chart Also Compaq is kind of interesting because Dell sells directly to or sells desk tops directly to the investor the user the ultimate user Gateway URL was doing the same thing until now Gateway has stared to pen these retail stores so that people could go in and demonstrate the system Coimpaq of course was the leader in desk top sales simply because it was able to go into places like CompUSA and they had a massive distribution network Well the users have become much more sophisticated Now they like to go to places like Dell They like to go to places like Gateway As a consequence Compaq has suffered somewhat Also with respect to the servers its only now that its starting to look reasonably good in servers But if I wanted to do a server play you know instead of Cisco Id do Dell because Dell equipment is very good Dell makes a very good server So while I would continue to hold Compaq because I believe it does represent a significant portion of the industry I dont think that its something that I would just represent that sector with that one stock MORRIS Michael thank you so much for spending part of your th of July with us You handled a lot of calls and emails too CARTY Its been a pleasure MORRIS OK And the word is just be cautious Dont rush into the

the virtual UK natural gas pipeline entry capacity auction on its EnCap system because of the high level of interest Final bids are due by GMT Aug with the first start date for the services unchanged at Oct the company said The original deadline had been set for July EnCap enables Enron customers to reduce the risk associated with obtaining entry capacity from the pipeline operator the company

cheaper than govt stock sales By Jae Hur Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited TOKYO July Reuters South Korean demand for spot aluminium is expected to inch up this week as stock sales by the government agency became less attractive after recent declines in London metal prices traders said on Wednesday It might be the first time since the begining of this year that imported aluminium prices appear to be lower than those of the government stock sales said a trader with a leading trading house in Seoul This would drive domestic endusers to seek more imported metal held by trading houses rather than metal held by the Supply Administration SAROK alleviating domestic aluminium stocks he said Aluminium stocks in major South Korean ports excluding inventories held by SAROK were estimated at about tonnes against tonnes in midJune traders said SAROK said early this week its aluminium selling prices in July would remain unchanged from June at won per tonne On Tuesday traders said SAROK had bought tonnes of western primary aluminium ingots late last week from Samsung Corp and Enron Corp The government procurement body bought tonnes from Enron last Thursday at a tonne on a costinsurancefreight CIF basis for Pusan and another tonnes from Samsung at a tonne CIF Inchon said a trade source The purchase prices compared to the administrations purchase in late May SAROK had bought tonnes from LG International Corp at a tonne CIF Pusan and another tonnes from Mitsui Co Ltd at a tonne CIF Inchon another trade source said Q PREMIUMS AT T South Korean aluminium import premiums were settled last week at a tonne over the London Metal Exchange LME cash prices compared with around in the second quarter the traders said The fall in third quarter premiums were attributed to heavy domestic stocks an influx of cheaper metals from China and Russia and soft domestic demand they said Some domestic buyers were said to have settled the third quarter term premiums at about a tonne said another trading house trader in Seoul But it was hard to confirm the deals because there were only a few major buyers involved in the term deals with foreign suppliers this time he said The buyers were able to get the term premiums because spot premiums had further fallen to about a tonne after Japanese importers and foreign suppliers agreed on the third quarter premiums he said In Japan term premiums for the JulySeptember quarter were settled at around a tonne on a CIF basis over LME cash prices plunging from the second quarter premiums of That was the lowest level since the first quarter of when the premiums for the worlds secondlargest economy were settled at a tonne Slowing domestic demand and a supply glut has most domestic buyers preferring monthly contracts or spot deals

Indian lenders to the Enronprmoted Dabhol Power Company are looking at the prospects of splitting the assets of the company before sale While some generation companies including the US major AES and two others have approached Indian lenders for taking over the operations of the generation unit talks have also been initiated for taking over the liquefied natural gas LNG terminal of the DPC separately Some companies have sent feelers for taking over the LNG terminal in Ratnagiri a top executive with an Indian lender told Business Standard He however refused to divulge the companies names Indian lenders are apparently of the view that splitting the DPC assets will help in reduction of tariffs and the cost of taking over the company sources say The assets include the LNG terminal with a capacity of five million tonne per annum MTPA The construction of the terminal is nearly per cent complete Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI chairman S K Chakraborti had said here yesterday that this route will be considered only if talks with Enron to continue with the project fail to fructify The DPC was to shift to LNG fuel instead of naphtha being used at present from June The shift to LNG will considerably reduce power generation cost from the project Of the LNG projects total capacity about MTPA is to be used for electricity generation by the Dabhol Power Company and the remaining MTPA is to be sold commercially But as the entire cost of the LNG facility has been factored into the PPA for the Dabhol project this has pushed up the cost of power generation As LNG is fast emerging as a preferred fuel due to low cost and easy transferability there will be a lot of interest in the project sources said The Madhav Godbole committee which recommended renegotiation of tariffs has said that the Dabhol Power Company should renegotiate its LNG contract and set up a separate facility for LNG fuel which will help in reduction of costs As part of the Dabhol Power Companys financial restructuring the committee has suggested an increase in the maturity profile of its debt from five to years with a fiveyear moratorium It has also suggested an indicative interest rate of per cent on rupee loans or six per cent in dollar terms for the project NEWS Water treatment contract approved MARY FLOOD RACHEL GRAVES Staff Houston Chronicle STAR Copyright The Houston City Council approved a million contract for the Northeast Water Purification Plant with Montgomery Watson Constructors of California The contract for the Lake Houston plant needed council approval but will be between the construction and engineering firm and the Houston Area Water Corp known as the Hawk a citizen board appointed by the mayor The contract provides years to build the milliongallon aday plant that will treat raw lake water Montgomery Watson could also be required to construct a plant expansion The city of Houston is the initial customer for the water and would repay the Hawk the cost of treating the water The city hopes that the plant will eventually provide water to other area entities as well This plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could cost about billion to implement Councilmen Bruce Tatro and Chris Bell voted against the agreement after an unsuccessful attempt to delay the vote Tatro said he objected to the plan to issue debt to build the plant when it would be cheaper in the long run to pay cash for the first three years of the project Councilman John Castillo disagreed saying the point in issuing debt is to ensure that todays taxpayers are not paying for tomorrows water consumption Bell said the decision about awarding the contract should have been made by council not the Hawk The administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery Watsons chief competitor Azurix Corp an arm of local energy giant Enron Corp Three recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix Hawk board members said what mattered were Montgomery Watsons lower prices and that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America the body that would oversee the plant But Tuesday council also unanimously approved a million contract with Azurix North American Operations and Maintenance Inc to operate the existing Southeast Water Purification Plant for more than five years That contract underwent the normal bidding process whereas the Hawk board was designed to avoid the bidding process and allow the citizenrun corporation to make its own value choice among competitors About six weeks ago political pressure began to ease as City Council looked at what work the Hawk board had done Hawk chairman David Berg said NEWS ExHouston judge to be special counsel Andell to advise education secretary John WILLIAMS Houston Chronicle Political Writer Staff Houston Chronicle STAR Copyright Eric Andell a former Democratic state appellate judge in Houston who lost his reelection bid last year has accepted a position as special counsel to US Education Secretary Rod Paige Paige former Houston school superintendent announced Tuesday that Andell will provide recommendations and guidance on various legal matters The appointment in the Bush administration apparently removes the threat that Andell might mount a Democratic bid next year for Harris County judge Andell said he looks forward to working with Paige I have worked with Paige before on Houston Independent School District matters and I am excited about the opportunity of working with him again Andell said Andell was a juvenile court judge when thenGov Ann Richards appointed him to the st Court of Appeals in Known for broad community involvement Andell has been active in various youth and school issues He has served as chairman of the Texas Juvenile Probation Commission chairman of the Aspiring Youth of Houston and as a member of HISD committees Earlier this year Andell was mentioned as a possible HISD superintendent when Paige resigned to accept the cabinet appointment The HISD job eventually went to longtime district administrator Kaye Stripling Since his defeat for the judgeship Andell has served as a visiting judge He also has performed mediation and arbitration work for the Houston law firm Nathan Sommers Lippman Jacobs Gorman Andell said Tuesday that Paige asked him several months ago to consider the job Since then Andell has received support from a number of prominent local Republicans including former mayoral candidate Rob Mosbacher Enron Corp Chairman Ken Lay and attorney Pat Oxford He brings a good background in the education arena that has been gleaned from his experience on the bench and some good sound judgment said Mosbacher a member of a Greater Houston Partnership committee that deals with HISD issues Many Democrats had hoped Andell would seek the county judge position which has been held by Republicans since Andell said he had considered making a run if incumbent Robert Eckels did not seek a third term Eckels is expected to seek re election It was bandied about and when I discussed it openly and honestly I always said it was if Eckels chose not to run Andell said Despite receiving top endorsements and outspending his Republican opponent last fall Andell lost to former assistant county attorney Terry Jennings by a slim margin Jennings victory left Margaret C Mirabel as the only Democrat among the appellate judges in Houston Andell said he will move to Washington this month hopes to stay in the new position at least through the end of Bushs first four year term and has no political aspirations until then Front Gas rates plunging Dave Mabell Lethbridge Herald Metro All material Copyright c Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc and its licensors All rights reserved Its like a Going Out of Business sale After charging record high rates through the winter the natural gas company serving southern Alberta homes and businesses is cutting its prices up to per cent At the same time Atco Gas continues to look for another company to take over its retail gas business Approval of the companys request for rate reductions from per gigajoule to for most customers was announced Tuesday in Calgary The rate took effect July and is scheduled to remain in effect until next Jan Reduced rates reflect softening prices across most of North America for one of Albertas biggest exports and provincial tax revenue generators Jerome Engler the companys executive vicepresident said the dramatic price drop reflects the way the company buys its gas from Alberta producers Unlike newly arrived competitor Epcor Atco does not hedge its prices by buying forward contracts Customers will quickly get a lower natural gas price because of the methods Atco Gas employs to purchase gas that ensures customers pay the least cost for gas over the long term said Engler The market price for natural gas is sliding down and we can pass these lower costs on to our customers Although Alberta politicians blamed this provinces cost of electricity highest in Canada on last winters soaring natural gas prices theres so far been no sign homeowners and business people will see any dramatic cuts in those bills Atcos lower gas price however will still be marginally above the price offered Lethbridge householders when Epcor began offering term contracts last winter more recent Epcor offerings have been higher than for a one or threeyear term But Atcos rate will remain substantially higher than the cost of gas in southern Alberta just months ago In approving the rate reductions the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board once again ordered lower rates in northern Alberta than in the south vs In a recent board decision that surprised Atco it denied permission to sell the companys large gasfields near Viking southeast of Edmonton which have historically given a price advantage to consumers in the Edmonton area and north At last winters recordhigh prices the board said Atcos surcharges resulted in accumulated surpluses in both northern and southern Alberta The company is expected to repay those amounts by Jan for residential customers who opted not to shoulder the full impact of last winters price shock For larger gas customers using more than gigajoules per year the surcharge and now the repayment was expected to end this Oct For Atco these rate changes could be the last for which the company will apply for permission While retaining its pipeline network through Alberta Atco has announced plans to sell its retail gas business to another company Atco officials said at the end of April theyre looking for a world calibre company to take over service to homes and businesses across the province Because Atco has been a longtime supplier operating under the provinces regulatory authorities they said Atco is restricted from providing the full range of retail offerings Company president Craighton Twa said attracting a bigleague buyer will bring increased choice for the provinces consumers The sale will initiate the final stage for the fully deregulated environment envisioned by the Alberta government he said One of the leading contenders Enron Direct has refused to comment on whether its negotiating to buy the Atco business The American company has meanwhile announced plans to begin offering southern Alberta businesses their choice of contract prices for electricity Engler said Atco is facing further change whether it sells its retail arm or not At a separate series of energy board hearings he said the company was asked to respond to proposals to change how it buys gas on the spot market vs hedging through contracts and how long its prices should run before further review The boards decisions are expected to apply to Atcos successor if it sells We hope to see a sale completed this summer Engler said But whoever the buyer he adds Alberta consumers will still be offered a regulated price as an alternative to signing a fixed contract With Albertas penchant for deregulation however Engler isnt certain how long that option will continue With the lower prices he adds it may take longer before consumers whose bills still show credit balance as a result of the provincial governments subsidies start paying for their gas once again Consumers whod rather receive a cheque in the mail instead of debiting their credit balance Engler said can call Atco and ask for their refund Any comments or questions Contact the writer at Fimat USAs Kilduff Oil Prices OPEC and Stock Picks New York New York July Bloomberg John Kilduff right

Bloomberg Joydeep Mukherji associate director and India analyst for Standard Poors on the chance of a lower rating for the country We had signaled last year that reform was likely to move very slowly if at all and that is what has been happening So far nothing has happened to further lower the rating but we continue to watch the fiscal problem very closely as that is the most vulnerable area that could lead to a negative rating action Lower growth may mean lower tax revenue and increased pressure on governments to raise spending That could enlarge the combined deficits of the central and state governments beyond of GDP this year potentially weakening the rating SP changed the outlook on Indias BB rating to stable from positive in October At the time we said that the change was based on the inability of Indias political leadership cutting across all political parties to implement reform to the public sector in a timely manner The disappointment expressed by many commentators in recent days especially after the bad GDP growth figures were released is consistent with that earlier rating action India said last week that the economy grew percent from a year earlier in the quarter ended March down from percent in the previous quarter and the slowest pace in nearly three years On Indias plans to reduce the states role in the economy India has had about years worth of economic reform spread out over the last years Many wonderful measures are announced sometimes re announced and announced yet again but very little is ever implemented The country may well gradually calibrate its way down to the old Hindu rate of growth with GDP growth having slumped from percent a few years ago to barely percent this year unless it gets its economic act together soon After years of Independence and years of economic reform everyone looks to the rain gods to see if economic growth can pick up once again Can there be a more damning indictment of Indian economic policy failure than this A twoyear drought has depressed growth On the refusal of a state electricity board to pay for power supplied by the Indian unit of Enron Corp The Enron episode has been a bigger longterm disaster for India than most Indians including in the media realize It has sent a bad loud and clear signal to potential foreign investors The Indian private sector is used to bad politics and failed economic policies such as energy reform but the foreign private sector is not Indians compare India today with India in the past and content themselves with the small progress they have made Foreign investors look at things differently On future foreign investments in India India missed the boat on foreign investment in energy and telecommunications two very capital intensive sectors where the country needs lots of investment by foreign and domestic players Foreign firms have all but abandoned the energy sector and are not very interested in the telecom sector Foreign investment will continue to trickle into the country especially in sectors such as information technology services and other sectors that depend less on government regulation However the amounts are trivial India is getting less

associate broker said It is going to get a lot worse it is a bleak picture at the moment for next year A lot of people will have to ask Is it worth being in the business a manager at another broker said The LME said this week that total futures and options turnover during JanJune fell to million lots down from JanJune when volume rose percent to million Traded options turnover has virtually halved falling to million lots from million LME data showed that this halfyear was still the third highest on record only tailing by lots thisclearly illustrates the continuing health of the LME and the essential part it plays as a hedging medium to the global metal market despite the current economic environment the LME said on Thursday SWITCHED ON SCREENS BLUR THE PICTURE The major factor that emerged last year is electronic trading either webbased or specific screenbased platforms Competitors such as Enron Online and Spectron Metals have grabbed business while the LME has also sanctioned and launched its own system LME Select Many of these trade LME contracts so the turnovers are still being incorporated into the Exchanges volumes But the ethos of screentrading has implications for broker costs and revenues You are seeing more business going towards the screens and some platforms will offer a lessregulated OTC overthecounter market the manager said LME ringdealers and associate brokers now face even lower commissions Costs will fall when screens offer straightthrough processing embracing backoffice functions such as matching In an electronic market the cost of serving a client drops dramatically and if a customer has direct access to the market which could happen he gets direct control he said In Londons soft commodity markets which migrated away from trading floors to screens in commissions have fallen sharply he noted For the moment the LME retains a traditional openoutcry floor it and Londons International Petroleum Exchange IPE are the last bastions of this form of trading Business is also transacted in offices over telephones But this is also changing with the advent of screens In some ways the screens whoever they belong to may be the problem a senior trader said In the old days you used to talk to people more get a feel for the market and take a punt Not so much now the big boys still chat but not as much and with the screens it is almost a matched bargain situation he said METAL INDUSTRY SHYING AWAY The malaise affecting prices is not helping especially as there is little incentive for consumers to buy while a falling market always sees less speculative activity Most of this year has seen prices progressively weaker with copper at its lowest since July zinc and tin at levels last seen nearly eight years ago lead at a month lowpoint and nickel and aluminium at twomonth lows Although prices have been softer there have been occasions when tightness has prevailed When the market moves from contango when nearby prices are cheaper than forward into backwardation which is the opposite hedging dries up Although the LME derives much of its liquidity from speculators the bulk of its trade comes from the metals industry hedging and price protection There is routine hedging taking place but what one would call the strategic positioning is just not happening at the moment the manager said MARKET CONTRACTION LIKELY If volumes continue to fall and there is the pressure on commissions then further contraction and consolidation in the market appears likely There are now only ringdealing members of the LME those who alone are entitled to trade on the openoutcry floor down from nearly in the mids There is too much capacity in the market even now and these ongoing rumours do not help For months one RDM has supposedly been taking over another It is about time they got on with it the senior trader said A base metal trading operation may eventually come down to a few people sitting at the end of a treasury desk the associate broker director said USA UPDATE New Power adds customers with two deals Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW YORK July Reuters New Power Co a national energy provider partly

Lower Rating If Deficits Grow SP Says Update Adds ministers comment starting in th paragraph New York July Bloomberg India must cap its federal and state government budget deficits or risk having its credit rating lowered a Standard Poors analyst said Indias BB rating which is two notches below investment grade may be cut if the combined deficits widen to more than percent of gross domestic product from nine percent now Joydeep Mukherji SPs associate director and India analyst said in an interview We continue to watch the fiscal problem very closely as that is the most vulnerable area that could lead to a negative rating action Mukherji said The warning comes as the government plans to increase spending to bolster a slowing economy A lower rating would raise the cost of borrowing for the government and Indian companies already among the highest in Asia Indias benchmark year bond yield is percent higher than percent for comparable Chinese bonds and percent for South Korean bonds both of which have an investment grade rating SP lowered the outlook on Indias rating to stable from positive in October The agency cited Indias failure to meet deadlines for sales of stateowned companies The rating is among the lowest in the region Last week an analyst for Moodys Investors Service said India must step up sales of state assets and trim its budget deficit to avoid a reduction in the outlook on its debt Moodys Ba rating also two notches below investment grade has a positive outlook meaning it may be raised Growing Debt Fitch cut Indias longterm sovereign rating outlook to negative from stable on May Fitch which rates India BB one notch below investment grade cited concerns about fiscal policy privatization and a deterioration in the investment climate Any downward change in the countrys rating or outlook will adversely impact investments in India said Kalpana Morparia executive director of lender ICICI Ltd which borrowed about million in international markets last year Years of budget deficits have saddled India with trillion rupees billion of debt equal to about percent of GDP Servicing the debt leaves little money to invest in schools hospitals or other projects that could improve the wellbeing of Indians and raise the rate of economic growth in the worlds second mostpopulous country Slowdown The economy expanded percent in the quarter ended March from a year earlier down from percent growth the previous quarter and the slowest pace in nearly three years as a twoyear drought pruned rural incomes In response Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said last week he would step up government spending to stimulate the economy Lower growth may mean lower tax revenue and increased pressure on governments to raise spending that could enlarge the combined deficits of the central and state governments beyond percent of GDP this year potentially weakening the rating Mukherji said Investors too are getting concerned with the governments profligacy In the first two months of the fiscal year the central governments budget deficit has reached a quarter of the target for the year as a whole The growing deficit bothers me said Bharat Shah who manages billion rupees at Birla Sun Life Asset Management in Mumbai Theres a need for a sharp reduction in expenditure that will call for political consensus which I dont think is in place Without pruning deficits the government cant hope to lower interest rates Higher interest rates in India damp the governments plan of attracting more foreign companies to set up businesses locally Overseas Investment The most important thing to do is to get more foreign direct investment which is the mother of all solutions Shah said Last year India managed to attract billion in foreign investment a tenth of what China took in Indias program to sell state assets reduce tariffs and otherwise free the economy from government interference hasnt moved as fast as expected Mukherji said India has had about years worth of economic reforms spread out over the last years he said For example the government said it planned to raise billion rupees by selling stakes in more than staterun companies in the fiscal year that began April So far this year it hasnt sold a single stake Privatization Privatization minister Arun Shourie said delays in selling stakes in companies such as national carrier Air India Ltd and staterun hotel chain India Tourism Development Corp were not unusual and investors need to be patient We are proceeding methodically Shourie told reporters at a news conference late last night Have faith in the process SP isnt convinced If the governments economic program fails to gather speed the country may slip to its pres growth rate of percent a year from an average of more than percent in the s Mukherji said The dispute between the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and Enron Corp the countrys biggest foreign investor which has set up a billion power plant is a longterm disaster and a bad loud and clear signal to potential foreign investors Mukherji said The state electricity board has refused to pay billion rupees for power supplied by Enrons local unit Dabhol Power Co India hasnt delivered on guarantees to pay for the power The dispute is widely seen as a litmus test for foreign investment in India The Indian private sector is used to bad politics and failed economic policies such as energy reforms but the foreign private sector is not Mukherji said Gautam Chakravorthy in the Mumbai newsroom or at with reporting by Anindya Mukherjee Abhay Singh and Arijit Ghosh in New

the market took a further blow as LME stock movements were released Aluminum stocks rose tons Friday bringing total stocks to tons It the stock increase was fairly unexpected but it exposes the

Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire Convincing foreign investors that his country is a good place to do business is a tough sell But Delhis finance minister insists that despite a few highprofile setbacks his country offers the worlds best returns Indian finance minister Yashwant Sinha has had a rollercoaster year In February he delighted foreign investors with a reformist probusiness budget But days later confidence was rocked by a stock market crash and insider trading scandal Then New Delhis first major privatization of the BALCO aluminum plant sparked a crippling twomonth strike by workers Worse Indias biggest and once most trumpeted foreign investment Enron Corps billion Dabhol power project remains at a standstill following claims the Maharashtra state government defaulted on payments A USled billion power project near Madras is stalled over financing Recently during a road show to Hong Kong and Singapore Sinha spoke with Executive Editor Richard Hornik Managing Editor Zoher F Abdoolcarim and Senior Editor Cesar Bacani Extracts from their conversation Can India really compete for investment We have completely opened up the Indian market I know that China and other countries have been receiving large foreign direct investments but lets not forget that they started much earlier on the reform path The problem is one of perception We have the challenging task of explaining the new India to the world Dont you also have the task of explaining it to the Indian people Isnt there a resentment of foreign companies left over from the colonial era Every government has pursued the same reform path including welcoming foreign direct investment There has also been a very marked change from what you referred to as the colonial past The increasing realization is that it is not Western multinationals that are causing problems It is competition from other developing countries There seems to be disquiet among investors though about highprofile cases such as Enron and BALC BALCO had nothing to do with foreign investment It was a government company and we decided to sell along with management control There was some resistance but fortunately that has been resolved In the case of Enron I have clearly sent out a message to both the Maharashtra government and Enron that they had to sit down in the spirit of constructive cooperation and find a solution Lets not interpret a commercial dispute involving one company as being a major disincentive for foreign investment What are you doing to increase governance in the financial world I have told Parliament three things That we shall adopt international best practices so that the scope of mischief is reduced further that we must strengthen the market regulator and that we want to corporatize the stock exchanges which are run by the brokers so there can be no conflict of interest In India can what is manufactured by foreignowned firms be sold locally Absolutely And because of its sheer size Indias middle class of million consumers is almost like a middlesized developed country In terms of purchasing power parity India is considered to be the worlds third largest economy Another advantage for investors is that we have a judicial system that does justice to Indians and foreigners alike But its slow very slow When you say slow there are courts of appeal from primary courts to the High Court to the Supreme Court You cant do away with this You cant compare it with autocratic regimes where justice can be swift but at times misguided How is the privatization program faring In the case of Air India we decided wed retain would go to employees another would go to the market and would be made available to strategic buyers Only would go to foreign partners Similarly we have taken a decision to disinvest telco VSNL We will privatize the domestic airline Indian Airlines the largest automobile manufacturer Maruti and hotels owned by the Tourism Development Corp What are your main frustrations Foreign investors have all kinds of perceptions that India is not worth doing business with but studies by independent consultants AT Kearney and the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry show foreign direct investors have made more profits in India than anywhere else in the world and most are bullish about the future Now this is something that is not known India Dabhol delay RCF turns to BG Business Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire BANGALORE July FACED with delays in gas availability from Enrons Dabhol regassification plant the public sector Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers Ltd RCF has turned to British Gas BG for supply of liquefied natural gas LNG to meet its feed stock requirements Speaking to reporters here today the RCF Chairman and Managing Director Mr DK Verma said that RCFs requirement of LNG was about million tonnes per annum As per the agreement with Enron the LNG supply was expected to have begun from Dabhol to its Thal plant in Maharashtra Enrons requirement for power generation was only about million tonnes and the remaining was expected to be sold to third parties which included RCF However he said these supplies were faced with uncertainty in view of the standoff between the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and Enron Asked if this would lead to a termination of the agreement with Enron he said We still need LNG When supply from Dabhol is available we will pick it up In addition to this supply BG was also expected to supply another million from Gujarat to the Trombay plant of RCF This requirement was in view of the capacity expansion that has been proposed for the urea plant The capacity of the urea plant is to be raised to million tonnes from the current level of million tonnes This expansion is expected to cost at least Rs crore of which Rs crore would be funded from RCFs cash reserves The debt component is expected to be raised from ICICI We are a zerodebt company now and can afford to have a little debt on our balance sheet he said The company he said was also preparing to expand its DAP diammonium phosphate capacity in Rajasthan at a cost of Rs crore This fourlakh tonne per annum plant was being set up with per cent equity support each from Hindustan Zinc Ltd and Rajasthan Mines and Minerals Corporation Ltd The remaining per cent would be entirely held by RCF itself he added Mr Verma indicated that a final decision on the expansion of the urea plant would be taken by the companys board only after the interim fertiliser policy was announced by the Centre This policy is expected to provide for a pricing policy and prepare the industry for complete dismantling of the retention pricing mechanism He said that the industry was also looking forward to supplies of LNG from Iran Supply of gas through the pipeline route via Pakistan would be more costeffective than the submarine pipeline proposed Our Bureau Reduce government debt by Rs crore ET Interview Shalini Singh The Economic Times Copyright C The Economic Times Source World Reporter TM FOR an organisation that has done its best to boost sentiment by repeatedly announcing that it expects the economy to grow by to per cent this year the Confederation of Indian Industries finds the current official projections of per cent way down at the lower end of their own forecast I believe our projections were realistic considering that on the economic front all the macrofundamentals are in place The policies are in place It is just that the implementation of these policies is not happening And that is the only reason for a lower growth rate than was envisaged by industry No There is no way that can happen On the other hand with some hard decisions we could still move closer to a growth of per cent The most radical would be a dramatic reduction in government debt by Rs crore right away We need to examine what we need to do to achieve this level of reduction and the whole country needs to cooperate in the effort The whole nation needs to rally around the FM if he makes these moves We need to move ahead on disinvestment on reduction in expenditure What we are additionally prescribing is that issues and policies which have been committed should be implemented Implementation is going to be the key to success The CII is preparing to submit over the next fortnight a list of projects in housing power roads railways and civil aviation to the government to be monitored on a weekly basis to stimulate growth Growth can also be stimulated by increased government spending on creating world class capitals for the three new states Uttaranchal Jharkhand and Chhatisgarh With an expenditure of just Rs crore the government can stimulate demand in cement power roads and infrastructure The funds are there It is just that there is no thought or planning in this direction yet The third thing that we are prescribing is that interest rates must come down I disagree with the RBIs stand on interest rates Like in the US we too must respond quickly and proactively to the slowdown Fourthly we have an overvalued exchange rate and we believe it is time we moved to a realistic exchange rate We are just about to see the first effects of an overvalued rupee on the growth rate of exports and we need to arrest this declining rate of export growth On the contrary there is recognition and respect for the government that despite a global slowdown India is still the second fastest growing economy after China Any disappointment that is voiced is actually in the spirit of moving to better performance rather than a critique of the establishment I truly believe we are today at the threshold of a unique opportunity Different countries the US EU Malaysia and so on want to engage in trade with India in a manner that nobody has looked at before President Bush and the Bush administration want to engage in a substantial trade relationship with India which is based on mutually beneficial longterm relationships It offers India a unique window There is huge respect for Mr Vajpayee Mr Jaswant Singh and Mr Yashwant Sinha The world is recognising Indias potential Enron is an issue in the minds of the Americans that is stalling investment commitment despite this respect and this must be addressed

Fertilisers Ltd RCF is planning to sign an agreement with British Gas for supply of gas to meet its fleet stock needs RCF chairman and managing director D K Verma told newspersons that the companys requirement of LNG was about million tonne per annum As per its existing agreement with Enron LNG supply should have already began from Dabhol to its Thal plant in Maharashtra Enrons requirement for power generation was only about million tonne and the remaining was to be sold to third parties including RCF The RCF CMD said that these supplies now faced an uncertain future because of the standoff between MSEB and Enron Asked if it would lead to a termination of the agreement with Enron he said We still need LNG If supply is available from Dabhol we will pick it up he said in reaction to a question on whether it would lead to a termination of RCFs agreement with Enron In addition to this supply British Gas is also expected to supply another million tonne to the Trombay plant of RCF This requirement was in view of the capacity expansion that has been proposed for the urea plant of RCF The capacity of the urea plant is to be raised from million tonne from the production level of million tonne This expansion is expected to cost at least Rs crore of which Rs crore would be funded from RCFs cash reserves he said The debt component is expected to be raised from ICICI The company he said was also preparing to expand DAP in Rajasthan for Rs crore This lakh tonne per annum plant was being set up with per cent equity support each from Hindustan Zinc and the Rajasthan Mines and

the retention pricing mechanism Business Economics fuels power solution in California Price relief gains political support Robert Gibbons BridgeNews Chicago Tribune North Sports Final N Copyright by the Chicago Tribune Political pressure coming from the US Congress and politicians from Western states seems to have influenced the approach to the power crisis despite opposition to price caps in the Bush administration The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in June expanded price mitigation measures on wholesale electricity sales in California during periods when blackouts are possible The measures encourage generators to sell power into the state to prevent emergency alerts from being declared which trigger price caps The move came with support growing in Congress especially among representatives of Western states on both sides of the aisle for legislation that would have capped wholesale prices in the region The macroeconomic force may have been the difference between the billion cost of power for California in and its rise to approximately billion in The cost is estimated to reach between billion and billion in With that kind of money at stake suddenly the concern becomes less a question of who is responsible for the problem but rather how it can be solved quickly to prevent harsh political consequences California Atty Gen Bill Lockyer has conducted an investigation into the actions of power generators and offered multimillion dollar rewards to whistleblowers to provide evidence of price manipulation by independent power generators The state is seeking refunds of billion the amount it estimates independent power generators overcharged Californias troubled utilities The US General Accounting Office has released a report criticizing the FERC for not finding evidence of power generators using plant outages to drive up prices in California FERCs February study was not thorough enough to support its overall conclusion that audited companies were not physically withholding electricity supply to influence prices the GAO found Of the major independent power generators and marketers like Reliant Energy Dynegy Duke Energy and Enron only Williams and its CEO Keith Bailey came out in April in favor of some sort of short term price relief for California The political dynamic out there is much more Draconian than what were proposing Bailey told analysts in April defending Williams position supporting some limited shortterm price mitigation What he was worried about was California Gov Gray Davis using eminent domain powers to take

is at the core of the projects problems The largestever foreign investment in India Dabhol is mired in conflict Maharashtra Dabhols only customer has stopped purchasing power from the megawatt project saying its rates are too high Work has stopped on a nearly completed second phase of the project slated to generate megawatts Enron which controls of the project has tried unsuccessfully to scale back its stake and may be looking to exit entirely In an effort to get the electricity project back on track some of the projects foreign lenders including ABN Amro Bank of America Corp and Credit Suisse First Boston sent representatives to a recent meeting here with Maharashtras electricity board Dabhols difficulties are making lenders wary about funding other power projects in the country and could make states bolder about seeking new contract terms That has left other power companies increasingly nervous about Dabhol Some have signaled they could be interested in taking over the project if its contract problems can be settled Dabhol participants still arent sure if the interest is sincere or is an attempt by the other companies to prevent collateral damage to their own projects Indias Reliance Industries Ltd which in partnership with Southern Co of Atlanta is hoping to build a big plant in eastern India doesnt deny media speculation that it is interested in Dabhol Nor does Arlington Virginiabased AES Corp whose generating company has had disputes with Indias Orissa state Prakash Daryani managing director for Houstonbased El Paso Corps Indian power unit says that if the Dabhol contract isnt resolved in a way that makes both the utility and Maharashtra happy it will have an adverse impact on other investments and El Paso will not be an exception He denies reports that El Paso which helped build a megawatt plant in Southern India has expressed interest in buying Dabhol but adds We are keeping our eyes and ears open Some companies may be doing more than that Patrick Sonti a New Delhibased energy consultant said he had helped draft a plan outlining a way out of the Dabhol impasse with price concessions on both sides and financial separation of Enrons liquefiednatural gas terminal from the power plant Mr Sonti says he studied Dabhol for a client whose name he cant disclose Mr Sonti also chairs an American Chamber of Commerce committee on energy and he acknowledges discussing his Dabhol plan with some of the panels members He says the Chamber wouldnt intervene unless asked by Enron Last time the project ran into trouble with the state Enron executives saved it through an intensive lobbying campaign aided by American officials Next week the companys chairman Kenneth Lay is expected to fly to India though Enron wont comment on whom he intends to visit Even though Enron and Maharashtra officials have met regularly their dispute has fallen into a slowmotion stalemate with Enron saying it hasnt agreed to renegotiate the contract and the state insisting it has already rescinded the contract Despite warnings that construction delays will increase the projects cost by up to million Vinay Bansal chairman of the electricity board said Monday that getting the projects second phase running is not a priority for us since the state cant afford the power The Dabhol contract requires the state to pay for most of the plants generating capacity regardless of how much power it consumes Maharashtras consumption has been far below projections Mr Bansal wants Indias central government to help buy excess power from Dabhol but they keep saying no Other states would be willing to buy power if the rates could be lowered to rupees cents a unit but thats still well below Dabhol officials most optimistic projection Meanwhile Indias regulators and courts are throwing in new twists The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission set up as an independent body to regulate electricity rates is seeking jurisdiction over the Dabhol dispute even though the commission was created after the Dabhol contract was signed Enron wants an arbitration panel to decide instead A Bombay judge issued a ruling last week that is likely to send the jurisdiction battle to Indias Supreme Court If Enron loses that battle it is likely to lose more time Well make the process totally transparent the chairman of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission P Subramanyam promised in an interview earlier this year But if Dabhol construction doesnt resume by summers end Enrons suppliers of liquefied natural gas are likely to get nervous Dabhol has year contracts requiring it to buy liquefied natural gas from Abu Dhabi and Oman starting next year As for the lenders Indian banks have more to lose than foreign banks if Dabhol starved of revenue continues to miss payments That is because much of the foreign debt is guaranteed by the Indian banks led by statecontrolled Industrial Development Bank of India For the projects second phase foreign debt totals nearly billion and domestic debt about million Lenders havent yet agreed to inject more funds to allow construction to resume I dont think there is any division among lenders at the moment as to what should be done says an international lender involved in the talks But this is not an easy workout having so many parties involved in so many parts of the world Enron

Robusta coffee futures traded in London fell to another fresh year low Friday as the glut of coffee on world markets continued to weigh on the market And the market is set to continue even lower short

in a downward spiral and theres nothing out there to stop us going lower still said another broker Despite hovering above record low prices for some time producers arent being deterred from producing or selling And as the coffee continues to trickle onto the market the gradual erosion in prices is set to continue with a metric ton a possible target The benchmark September robusta coffee contract on Liffe ended at ton Friday having set a new low of ton Technically the market is oversold but such considerations appear to have little impact in the face of overwhelming supply of robusta coffee For this reason the chances of a meaningful recovery are slight and the talk of ton or ton on September becomes even louder one brokerage said in its daily report Apart from the fall in the level of the Brazilian real Liffe coffee is under pressure from constant origin selling with India Uganda Vietnam and India all noted current sellers and the lack of any frost in Brazilian coffee growing

recent fall has been a major part of the recent falls on Liffe coffee traders said encouraging producers to sell onto dollardenominated markets Brazil is reported to have around million million bags of robusta coffee to sell they said And the outlook for robusta coffee prices is no better long term traders and analysts said Some analysts had predicted that the low prices would cause producers to cut back or to move out of coffee production but with the vast increase in Vietnamese production in the past years little impact is expected if there are any cut backs said others There are plans to remove less productive trees in Vietnam but this is likely to be offset by younger trees in more productive areas reaching maturity said one analyst In the long term participants believe the low prices will see producers being less able to add inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides which may help to stabilize production but this is unlikely to cause the dramatic shift in supplies that is

Remedies to Feb Update Adds background on missed payments in fourth paragraph power alert in seventh paragraph auction in eighth paragraph For more on Californias electricity crisis see EXTRA GO Rosemead California Jan Bloomberg Southern California Edison Cos banks agreed to delay taking action against the utility until at least Feb for defaulting on lines of credit an executive of its parent company said The banks have agreed to forbear through that date Ted Craver Edison Internationals chief financial officer said in a conference call with investors The group of banks have the right to demand accelerated payments or seek other remedies after Southern California Edison Californias secondlargest utility failed to make million of payments on maturing notes last week That produced a cross default on its lines of credit Both the utility and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric defaulted last week on commercial paper a type of moneymarket security In addition Southern California Edison failed to pay million to power generators The two utilities have piled up more than billion in powerbuying debt because rising demand and short supplies have driven up the price they pay and the states deregulation law caps the rates they can charge customers For more than a week the California Independent System Operator has kept its highest alert in place The Stage Three alert is imposed by the ISO which runs threequarters of the states power grid when reserves fall to within percent of demand Bankruptcy Outlook The state is now running an auction to solicit bids for multiyear power contracts on behalf of the utilities Producers can submit offers in the auction which ends at noon California time to sell power for as long as years Meanwhile Southern California Edison and the banks are getting the final paperwork mopped up on the forbearance agreement Craver said in yesterdays conference call The utility doesnt intend to file for bankruptcy Craver said We do not believe that solves anything he said as it doesnt change the need for political and regulatory action to address the utilitys cash crunch Thats why we instituted this additional step of the temporary payment suspension Craver said We believe were in a position to operate the business without running out of cash for at least three weeks he said He described the utilitys net cash flow as at least breakeven after the payment suspensions Craver was asked during the teleconference about the chances that power generators or other creditors might force the utility into an involuntary bankruptcy Making Progress Generators are aware of the notsosubtle threats that bubble about regarding the state using eminent domain to take control of power plants or contracts Its in everybodys best interest to find a way out that avoids bankruptcy Craver said Thats the way everybodys operating California Governor Gray Davis and state lawmakers are working on potential solutions including locking in longterm power contracts to help keep the two utilities from bankruptcy The states Department of Water Resources has an initial stake of million to buy electricity for the utilities Were continuing to make progress and its encouraging thats being recognized said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Davis There is now a very great deal of urgency among state leaders to develop a comprehensive framework of solutions Robert Foster Edisons senior vice president of public affairs said during the conference call A framework may be in place by Feb Foster said I havent seen anything quite this intense in years in the state capital he added Paying the Bills Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg is working on a bill that calls for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric to give up hydroelectric plants In exchange the state would sell revenue bonds that repay past spending and finance power purchases on their behalf I dont think at this point were really able to respond to that proposal without more details Craver said In response to a question on the transfer of hydroelectric plants utility officials said the issues would include secured bondholders liens on Edisons assets Utility officials said they have also been asked about who will repay the million of initial state spending on power purchases Based on the legislative intent it is Edisons understanding that this power be paid for directly by the customers not the utilities Stephen Pickett vice president and general counsel of Southern California Edison said during the teleconference It is not completely clear that that is the case Pickett said Craver also stressed that Edison the parent of the utility hasnt gone into default on its obligations Were not having difficulty meeting our obligations he said and its

Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved DALLAS AP As Californias energy market continues to struggle a major electricity wholesaler said it will stop funneling power directly to dozens of corporate clients there instead shifting their needs to local utilities Houstonbased Enron Energy Services cited concern over losses by Californias power companies and the move to shut down the states electrical exchange company chief executive Marty Sunde said Thursday He said the switch wont affect the price paid by dozens of large customers including Kaiser Permanente though it may hurt the Enron Corp subsidiarys bottom line The company tries to help businesses cut their energy bills by among other things purchasing power wholesale and reselling it to clients at reduced rates Like Californias large utilities Enron has been hurt by the states soaring wholesale prices Enron will have to pay the local utilities at the going rate but cannot pass on any higher costs to its customers because their contracts guarantee a price We are resourcing choosing another sourcing alternative under an existing client relationship that we absolutely honor Sunde said It seems like a better strategy to serve our customers directly from the utility instead of canceling the contract There is a risk that our decision to honor our contracts will come with some cost The New York Times citing an unidentified source close to Enron reported Thursday that the energy service provider might lose billion if it fulfilled all its contracts Sunde called the figure absurd but acknowledged that financial concerns and the quickly changing energy market in California played heavily in the decision California has recently faced rolling blackouts because of a tight power supply that has been blamed on the states deregulation inadequate hydroelectric power high natural gas prices transmission glitches and power plant repairs The states two largest utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co say they are billion in debt because of soaring wholesale prices and the law which blocks them from recouping those losses from their customers On the Net Enron Energy Services Energy service provider switching customers power source back to utilities By JAY JORDEN Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved DALLAS AP A subsidiary of the largest seller of wholesale electricity in North America says concern over losses by Californias major power companies has prompted it to quit scheduling power to dozens of its customers switching that job to one of the states debtridden utilities The decision which would apparently affect companies like Cisco Systems Genentech and Clorox would not stop the flow of electricity But it would potentially raise the rates these big customers pay perhaps by as much as percent and could also increase the role of the state government as the major supplier of power in California The New York Times reported Thursday As a result of the decision the customers would be switched from the Houstonbased Enron Corp unit called Enron Energy Services to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company They would lose the discounts and low rates they had enjoyed The chief executive of Enron Energy Services said the unit was taking the step because of financial turmoil in the states power market but emphasized the company will honor current contracts with the dozens of corporations affected Many companies arranged fiveyear contracts with Enron in and We are resourcing choosing another sourcing alternative under an existing client relationship that we absolutely honor said Marty Sunde Enron Energy CEO A source close to Enron told The Times that the energy service provider might lose billion if it fulfilled all its contracts for the length of their terms Sunde called the figure absurd but said financial issues played heavily in the decision Market forces including legislation that is probably gone on in the last hours continues to change whatever the price or cost picture is going to be he said One person with knowledge of Enrons move told The Times that the customers being cut off use about megawatt hours equal roughly to the output of six major generating plants The state would become financially responsible for covering that potentially adding millions of dollars a day to its already heavy burden Financially strapped utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co forced by Californias deregulation law to sell their power plants say theyve been pushed billion in debt by soaring wholesale prices that deregulation blocks them from passing on to their customers The state Legislature has been forced to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to keep the lights on in California and is debating passage of a bill that would rescue the crippled utilities by floating up to billion in bonds to buy power In another move to shield itself from the power woes threatening California Enrons parent company on Wednesday sued the California Power Exchange a nonprofit market where electricity was auctioned The lawsuit was filed the same day trading was stopped on the exchange because of the deep debt of the states two biggest utilities The lawsuit seeks to prevent the market from using letters of credit that the company was required to file to trade on the exchange The suit is a move to ensure the market could not tap Enrons assets to pay off other debts Calif May Issue nd Request For Pwr Bids As Terms Expire Dow Jones

This report was first published late Wednesday By Pat Maio Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Capstone Turbine Corp CPST may have landed its biggest microturbine order to date from a consortium of public agency water suppliers in California valued at up to million according to sources The Association of California Water Agencies which is made up of members who supply water to of Californias farms and cities has signed a deal with an energy consulting firm that is working to secure up to microturbine unit orders for Capstone over the next two years ACWA uses up to of the states electricity on pumping stations needed to irrigate farms and many of its members have been hit hard financially by the energy crisis Under the agreement privately held Harza Energy LLC will buy the microturbines from Capstone based in Chatsworth Calif and install them for ACWAs member water agencies For Harza this will end up being our largest order ever Steve Chippas president of the Chicago engineering and energy consulting firm said in a phone interview Capstone marketing vice president Mark Kuntz confirmed that his company has had discussions with ACWA regarding the potential to sell up to microturbines The kilowatt units would cost up to each making the total deal worth up to million We have every expectation that this will result in a large order Kuntz said We have made this a high priority to secure a large number of orders with the ACWA agencies Representatives of about of those agencies will visit Capstone on Thursday to get a firsthand look at how a microturbine works he added Capstone said it had produced about microturbines through last November its last publicly disclosed production number Dan Smith director of regulatory affairs for ACWA said public water supply agencies are being devastated financially by Californias energy crisis Ive been here almost years and Ive seen droughts but Ive never seen so much aggravation and concern as this problem has caused Smith said He pointed to one San Diegoarea agency the Valley Center Municipal Water District that plans to increase its water rates on Feb and another on April The district mainly supplies water to avocado growers some of whom are saying them may be forced out of business because of the rate increases Smith said ACWA also is looking at reducing power costs to its members by picking a new wholesale supplier of electricity to replace AES Corp AES Finalists are said to include Enron Corp ENE and a joint consortium of Coral Energy a unit of Royal DutchShell RD and New West an energy service supplier owned by Salt River Project one of the nations largest publicly owned energy businesses Microturbines are primarily fueled by natural gas and can generate from kilowatts to kilowatts of electricity a day They also run on propane diesel fuel kerosene landfill gas and waste and water treatment gases Microturbines use just one moving part a shaft on which a compressor turbine and permanent magnet generator are seated Microturbines also use airfoil bearing technology which eliminates the need for oil bearings This is why microturbines cost less to maintain than other power sources and produce less pollution and noise Microturbines can be turned on during the middle of the day when power prices are most expensive or during blackouts caused by interruptible contracts with electric utilities Interruptible contracts give utilities the legal authority to turn off electricity when shortages are imminent In return customers get discounted power bills Shares of Capstone

George W Bushs experiments Teresa Calalay sent her son to a Texas church home last year hoping to break his pattern of legal behavioral and work problems He returned weeks later broken in other ways The yearolds feet were swollen from severely sprained ankles and his body was covered with hundreds of welts bruises and bug bites that led a doctor to file an abuse report with police The homes superintendent now awaits trial on a felony charge of unlawful restraint and Calalay has sued the church for what she says was a substitution of abuse for Christianity The home denies wrongdoing I dont know where in their Bible it says youve got to beat God into people Calalay said Bush as president is now promoting a plan to shift more federal social services to religious groups as he did as Texas governor The idea has early bipartisan support though supporters of the separation of church and state are pledging to fight it A review of similar state and federal initiatives shows that beyond the political debate these experiments have generated allegations of financial and physical abuse questions of lax oversight and lawsuits questioning whether the needy are being forcefed religion at public expense Supporters including Bush himself offer stories of churches freed from bureaucratic constraints that have helped turn lives around And they suggest religious groups are less

electricity in North America says concern over losses by Californias major power companies and the move to shut down that states electrical exchange has prompted it to quit scheduling power to dozens of its customers switching that job instead to the utilities The chief executive of Houstonbased Enron Energy Services says Thursday the move will not alter current contracts with dozens of corporations whose rates will not change under those agreements but likely will affect the power outsourcing companys bottom line It seems like a better strategy to serve our customers directly from the utility as opposed to turning them back the normal procedure said Marty Sunde Enron Energy CEO There is a risk that our decision to honor our contracts will come with some cost The subsidiary of Enron Corp a major supplier of power to Californians has gone to Kaiser Permanente and other major customers with the need to source power for delivery directly from utilities instead of scheduling itself in a state hit by rolling blackouts amid electricity shortages We are resourcing choosing another sourcing alternative under an existing client relationship that we absolutely honor Sunde said A measure of that is what Enron means when it says the contract remains in place our customers expenditures will remain the same A source close to Enron told The New York Times in Thursdays editions

utilities By JAY JORDEN Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved DALLAS AP One of the largest sellers of wholesale electricity in North America says concern over losses by Californias major power companies and the move to shut down that states electrical exchange has prompted it to quit scheduling power to dozens of its customers switching that job instead to the utilities The chief executive of Houstonbased Enron Energy Services says Thursday the move will not alter current contracts with dozens of corporations whose rates will not change under those agreements but likely will affect the power outsourcing companys bottom line It seems like a better strategy to serve our customers directly from the utility as opposed to turning them back the normal procedure said Marty Sunde Enron Energy CEO There is a risk that our decision to honor our contracts will come with some cost The subsidiary of Enron Corp a major supplier of power to Californians has gone to Kaiser Permanente and other major customers with the need to source power for delivery directly from utilities instead of scheduling itself in a state hit by rolling blackouts amid electricity shortages We are resourcing choosing another sourcing alternative under an existing client relationship that we absolutely honor Sunde said A measure of that is what Enron means when it says the contract remains in place our customers expenditures will remain the same A source close to Enron told The New York Times in Thursdays editions that the energy service provider might lose billion if it fulfilled all its contracts for the length of their terms Sunde called the figure absurd but added that financial issues played heavily in the companys risk management decision Market forces including legislation that is probably gone on in the last hours continues to change whatever the price or cost picture is going to be he said The driving force is that we started to connect the dots and saw a trend Financially strapped utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co forced by Californias deregulation law to sell their power plants say theyve been pushed billion in debt by soaring wholesale prices that the same law blocks them from recovering from their customers Meanwhile Enron Energy customers shouldnt notice a change

Copyright c Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc and its licensors All rights reserved CALGARY A legal battle between two major online natural gas trading companies could lead to a more comprehensive index for tracking natural gas prices Insiders said energy trading company Enron Canada Corp and online trading firm NGX Canada Inc along with energy newsletter publisher Canadian Enerdata Ltd are holding talks aimed at settling a million lawsuit Enron filed late last year against the other two companies Enron has alleged that it suffered irreparable harm when NGX operator of the online Natural Gas Exchange purchased the rights to Enerdatas natural gas price indexes last September and immediately changed the way the indexes are calculated Officials at NGX and Enerdata have countered that they struck their index deal for legitimate business purposes with no intent to harm Enrons business and that the new indexes are superior to the old calculations Sources said the talks could lead to the establishment of a socalled superindex combining trading data from several online trading systems to create a more reliable and representative measure of natural gas prices in the open market Calgarybased Enron like many participants in the Canadian natural gas market uses Enerdatas indexes as the price basis for its gas hedging contracts In its lawsuit Enron contends that the new method for calculating the indexes using only trades conducted though the Natural Gas Exchange isnt as neutral reliable or broadbased as Enerdatas old method of surveying a wide variety of market participants The dispute comes against a background of competition for market share in the fastgrowing and increasingly competitive online gas trading business Enron Canadas parent Enron Corp of Houston competes with NGX for customers through EnronOnline the dominant trading system in the online marketplace Ownership of a reliable price index is considered a surefire drawing card to attract customers NGX now controls and otherwise generates the gas price indexes based upon a far more restricted basis of compiling source data based only on those trades consummated on the NGX trading system Enron said in documents filed to the Alberta Court of Queens Bench The effect of the new methodology is to coerce industry participants to transact through the NGX trading system Participants in the natural gas market have generally applauded NGXs changes in calculating the gas price indexes arguing that the data are more timely transparent and accurate than under Enerdatas old survey method But there are indications Enron wanted to establish a benchmark price index on its own Web site In an affidavit Richard Zarzeczny the owner of Enerdata who is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit says Enron actually offered to buy Enerdata and its price indexes last October but Mr Zarzeczny refused the offer Enron declined comment Sources close to the lawsuit said the mood surrounding the dispute has thawed considerably in the past week opening the door for a possible settlement that could improve pricing information for the entire natural gas industry Enron has dropped its request for an injunction that would have forced Enerdata of Markham Ont to revert to its old method of calculating the indexes The injunction hearing had been set for Feb Enron is continuing its lawsuit but the parties are holding talks for an outofcourt solution We have dropped the injunction in order to pursue a settlement Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode said Were currently in some discussions to try to resolve this said Peter Krenkel president of Calgarybased NGX Sources close to the talks confirmed that the superindex is on the negotiating table Thats one of the possible solutions to this Mr Krenkel confirmed National Desk Section A Senators Spar On US Role In Resolving Energy Crisis By JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON Jan Senate Democrats and Republicans clashed today over whether the Bush administration had done enough to help California extricate itself from an electricity crisis suggesting that the politics of power are as volatile as energy prices The administration has an obligation to find a solution before the crisis worsens Senator Jeff Bingaman Democrat of New Mexico said in a Senate hearing on the problem Mr Bingaman criticized the administration for using the power shortages to promote its plan made public in last years presidential campaign to drill for oil in an Alaskan wildlife refuge All the oil in Alaska would do little to relieve electricity shortages he said But some Republicans firmly backed the new administrations relatively handsoff approach and its focus on what they called a longterm energy policy Senator Frank H Murkowski the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the Senate energy committee argued that a Clinton administration order forcing power producers and natural gas companies to sell supplies to California an order the Bush administration temporarily extended last week potentially made the federal government liable for billions of dollars in debt incurred by California utilities In the event California cannot repay generators for this power the federal government is going to have to meet that obligation because this was an order of the federal government Mr Murkowski said He has backed the Bush administrations decision to end the executive order next Wednesday a step that will increase the pressure on California politicians to solve the states problems quickly The split on the energy panel suggests that there is no groundswell of support in Congress for tackling Californias energy woes Numerous lawmakers plan to introduce legislation that will address both electricity shortages and the longterm search for domestic sources of energy But todays hearing gave no indication that the Republicancontrolled Congress plans to challenge the administrations position that the federal government should have a relatively limited role in correcting imbalances in electricity supply and demand The politics are more complex in the West where Republicans and Democrats alike have pushed for the federal government to impose price caps on electricity in the region Supporters of caps argue that the limits would curtail skyhigh prices and buy time for California and other states to line up longterm supplies Opponents say they would distort the market and remove an incentive for power companies to build more plants The power to regulate prices on interstate sales of electricity belongs to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a lowprofile independent agency The commission has shown little inclination to impose a regional price cap but critics have urged Congress to force it to take action Several Democrats including Californias two senators backed price caps at todays hearing Senator Dianne Feinstein of California cited a study predicting that her states power problems would only increase this summer and that caps were needed to keep the states two main utilities solvent and the lights on in the nations most populous state Ms Feinstein was joined in the call by California utility executives Fred John senior vice president for Sempra Energy the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric said his company had long opposed price caps But he said You reach a point where enough is enough But executives from companies that sell power to California including the Enron Corporation and the Williams Companies testified that price caps were harmful They said that the solutions to Californias problems were to allow consumer prices to reflect the markets supply and to make it easier for companies to build new power plants The Bush administration has tended to favor that position as have some Republican lawmakers Mr Murkowski said California had to devise a way to encourage companies to build new power generation plants and transmission lines You cant have the state take over the industry and try to run it he said Photo Senator Dianne Feinstein of California greeted Steve Frank chief executive of Southern California Edison as hearings began yesterday Associated Press Metro Desk Power Exchange to Live On in Lawsuits ROBIN FIELDS TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company The California Power Exchange may be passing from existence but its still a live target for litigation Enron Corp sued the market Wednesday to prevent it from using letters of credit that the company was required to file to trade on the exchange Though Enrons collateral exceeds its liabilities to the exchange the company moved preemptively to make sure the market could not tap its assets to pay off other debts an exchange spokesman said The Power Exchange has also sued Southern California Edison for failing to pay for million of power it bought in December asking to recoup the money by liquidating the utilitys longterm power contracts A Superior Court judge is scheduled to rule on the matter Friday Pacific Gas Electric fearing that the exchange would file a similar action if it defaults on its January purchases has sued to prevent the market from doing so In all three cases lawyers may still be arguing after the Power Exchange turns off its own lights On Tuesday the Power Exchange board voted to shut down its spot market saying decisions by federal regulators had diminished trading activity to the point of futility The exchange closed its day ahead market Tuesday and ended trading on its day of market at noon Wednesday It will stay open indefinitely with a skeleton staff to handle longterm contracts The Pasadenabased nonprofit was once a cornerstone of the states deregulation plan the principal market in which electricity was auctioned for delivery to Californians But the exchanges demise was sealed by continuing credit problems at Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric a federal ruling that the utilities could buy power elsewhere and changes in pricing policies that sent sellers to markets outside California Trading volume on Tuesday its last full day was megawatthours compared with a daily average of megawatthours last summer One megawatthour is enough electricity to supply typical homes for an hour The exchange dismissed of its

stop deliveries TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SAN FRANCISCO Moving to head off a doomsday scenario of widespread and prolonged natural gas outages in Northern and Central California state regulators on Wednesday granted cashstrapped Pacific Gas Electric Co permission to use money owed to the company by customers as collateral for future gas purchases from suppliers As the Public Utilities Commission took steps to ease Californias natural gas shortage PUC President Loretta M Lynch unloaded on suppliers that have threatened to stop delivering gas to PGE without advance payment or collateral Calling the situation egregious Lynch accused the industry of taking advantage of the states continuing energy crunch I believe PGE is the victim of predatory practices of the natural gas industry she said The commission did not act on an unusual request by PGE to force Southern California Gas to sell emergency gas supplies to the utility a step that the gas company feared would spread the crisis to its own million customers The matter was deferred to the commission meeting next week but Lynch said she views the two PGE proposals as an eitheror proposition It is incumbent on PGE to make this work she said after Wednesdays vote In addition to allowing PGE to use its unpaid gas customer accounts as collateral the commission allowed the company to pledge its core gas inventory to secure additional gas supplies However the PUC said that action could be taken only if PGE did not have enough accounts receivable to cover a particular gas purchase The authorization the PUC said will expire once PGEs financial condition improves That could come within days of any state bailout legislation or days after certain improvements in the companys credit rating occur This is good news said PGE spokeswoman Staci Homrig We hope we can take this authorization to gas suppliers and make them do business with us This decision keeps the gas flowing for at least the next month Homrig said explaining that it takes so long to collect gas money from customers that the day limit would cover only one billing cycle The company she said could file for an extension if necessary The company estimated in filings with the PUC that firms providing of its core gas supply either have terminated or have threatened to terminate gas shipments They are J Aron Co a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs Sempra Energy Trading Duke Energy and partner Coastal Merchant Energy and Western Gas Resources Alex Hemerick spokeswoman for Sempra Energy Trading of Stamford Conn declined to comment saying the firm is studying the plan Tom Williams of Duke Energy North America said We dont have any comment one way or the other We are following developments hour by hour day by day Other suppliers did not return calls late Wednesday PGE made a series of urgent requests starting two weeks ago after gas suppliers threatened to halt sales to the utility fearing it could not pay its bills The crisis recently took on added urgency because a federal order requiring gas suppliers to sell to California expires at midnight Tuesday Without emergency assistance PGE representatives said many of the companys million residential and business customersand entire cities from Sacramento to San Francisco and Fresnofaced potential shutoff of their gas And they said dwindling supplies would have a ripple effect on many of the companys million electricity customers because gasfired power plants are among the large noncore industrial customers that would lose gas supplies first The company also warned that noncore customers farthest from pipelines would suffer catastrophic effects Hospitals government agencies and industrial users would have reduced gas supply and would have to limit or cease operations The company appealed for help from the US Department of Energy gas suppliers Southern California Gas and Gov Gray Davis who sent letters to the White House to seek assistance The utility warned that without a solution to its supply problems it would have to start diverting gas from noncore customers by midFebruary with residential and smallbusiness customers to follow shortly thereafter On Jan PGE asked the PUC to declare a gas supply emergency and to order Southern California Gas to come to the rescue Four days later PGE asked the commission for permission to use unpaid customer accounts as collateral to help persuade its suppliers to keep gas coming The PUCs order prohibits PGE from providing collateral for any gas purchases from its own affiliates A company spokesman said PGE Energy Trading has provided the utility with gas but has not asked for any advance payments or security

OF INFOBOX INFOGRAPHIC Power Points Background The state Legislature approved electricity deregulation with a unanimous vote in The move was expected to lower power bills in California by opening up the energy market to competition Relatively few companies however entered that market to sell electricity giving each that did considerable influence over the price Meanwhile demand has increased in recent years while no major power plants have been built These factors combined last year to push up the wholesale cost of electricity But the states biggest utilitiesPacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edisonare barred from increasing consumer rates So the utilities have accumulated billions of dollars in debt and despite help from the state have struggled to buy enough electricity Daily Developments The state Senate put final touches on ABX which authorizes the state to enter longterm contracts for electricity and issues billion in bonds to pay for that power At a US Senate committee hearing in Washington senators complained that the power crunch is spreading throughout the West and that California brought its problems on itself by making it difficult for companies to build power

Bill Campbell RVilla Park Complete package and updates at wwwlatimescompower National Desk Section A Power Source Ends Direct Flow to California Businesses By JAMES STERNGOLD with MATT RICHTEL The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company LOS ANGELES Jan In a sign that problems are deepening in Californias overburdened energy market a division of the Enron Corporation that sells power directly to large industrial and commercial concerns has decided to halt such service to dozens of its clients because of the potential for mounting losses The decision which would apparently affect companies like Cisco Systems Genentech and Clorox would not stop the flow of electricity But it would potentially raise the rates these big customers pay perhaps percent or so and sharply increase the role of the state government as the major supplier of power in California Enron based in Houston is one of the largest companies if not the largest supplying lowcost energy to such big customers in California As a result of the decision the customers would be immediately switched from the Enron unit called Enron Energy Services to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company But they would lose the discounts and low rates they had enjoyed It was unclear whether Enron would compensate the customers most of whom arranged fiveyear contracts with it in and Marty Sunde chief executive of Enron Energy Services confirmed late today that his unit was taking the step because of the severe financial turmoil in the power market in the state But Mr Sunde emphasized repeatedly that the company would honor in some way its contractual obligations Enron Energy Services is a unit that seeks to help companies find ways to reduce their overall energy costs One way is by selling power at reduced rates To accomplish that it has sought to buy power on the wholesale market at competitive rates but just like Californias large utilities it has suffered from the rocketing wholesale costs Mr Sunde said two issues forced his companys hand One was the enormous losses suffered by Californias two major utilities Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison because of the soaring wholesale price of electricity The other was the recent decision by the California Power Exchange where Enron and other large energy companies buy and sell power at wholesale rates to shut down because of the crisis This actually threatened the financial mechanism of how electricity is supplied Mr Sunde said A person close to Enron said the company had determined that it could lose perhaps billion if it fulfilled all the contracts for the length of their terms But Mr Sunde denied that figure Perhaps the most important result of Enrons decision was that switching those big customers to the utilities would sharply increase the amount of power that the State of California would be forced to buy on an emergency basis With Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison saying they are on the verge of bankruptcy because of the soaring price of wholesale power the state government has stepped in buying huge amounts of power and selling it to the utilities One person with knowledge of Enrons move said that all told the customers being cut off several dozen large corporations use about megawatt hours equal roughly to the output of six major generating plants That means the state would become financially responsible for covering that potentially adding millions of dollars a day to its already heavy burden Mr Sunde said he could not confirm that total Generally the large customers that Enron supplies cannot have power service stopped as long as they pay their bills As a result of being dropped by Enron the companies would become clients of Pacific Gas and Electric which already operates the transmission lines to them While Enrons decision does not suggest that another crisis has developed it shows how quickly the private players in the oncethriving energy business here have been forced to pull out or curtail their involvement even if it means harming relations with customers It also suggests that though the state government is already playing a major role on an emergency basis it will probably have to continue that role for many years Some Enron customers contacted today said they had not received any notice from Enron and they expressed shock and dismay about the decision on withdrawal One was Kaiser Permanente the large managed care organization Rich A Seguin senior energy manager at Kaiser Permanente said late today that two weeks ago Enron had asked to modify its contract with Kaiser to allow for the switching of power sources He said Kaisers lawyers had reviewed the request and found no problem If they stand behind our contract which is what their stance is Mr Seguin said of Enron Kaiser would not be harmed But he said that if Enron was unable to supply power Kaiser might have to pay a month in extra costs because it would be more expensive to get electricity from utilities at regular rates Calvin Yee an executive at Pacific Gas and Electric who deals with large clients that would revert to his company said that if Enron withdrew the impact could be handled by the utility without disruptions It might mean a bubble of work Mr Yee said but it would not be extraordinary If it happens well be prepared At one time several large energy companies arranged these contracts directly with large industrial users and other big companies as part of Californias ambitious deregulation program The idea was that these large energy users could shop around among power companies and choose the best deal much as individuals can shop among longdistance telephone companies and pick the best plan Among Enrons other clients here are GTE Safeway IBM McDonalds and International Paper a person close to the company said WORLD DEMOCRATS UTILITIES URGE PRICE CONTROLS TO AID WEST H JOSEF HEBERT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Pittsburgh PostGazette REGION A Copyright Senate Democrats joined by Western utility companies urged federal price controls on wholesale power yesterday as fallout from Californias power problems appeared to spread across the West So far President Bush has opposed the idea At the same time one of Californias cashstrapped utilities came under criticism at a Senate hearing for diverting billion to its parent company when it now is unable to pay its own energy bill and faces possible bankruptcy and a state bailout It seems to me the shareholders came first Sen Ron Wyden D Ore told Southern California Edison chairman Steve Frank who defended the legal transfer to SoCal parent Edison International Frank rejected a suggestion by Wyden of money laundering and said the money was transferred over five years reflecting proceeds from the statemandated sale of the utilitys power plants The money simply went back to shareholders and investors Frank said a normal business practice SoCal and Pacific Gas Electric Californias two investorowned utilities owe about billion to power suppliers and face possible bankruptcy because they have been unable to pass on additional costs to retail customers During a fivehour hearing before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee senators heard repeated requests mostly from California and Northwest utilities for federal price controls on wholesale power Prices have soared not only in California but in many of the other states connected in the Western power grid Bush while conceding that Californias power problems are beginning to have widespread impact has not allowed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose price controls Power suppliers have been accused of price gouging and manipulating the California market although no clear evidence of such activities has surfaced Generating companies argued again yesterday that their prices simply reflect short energy supplies and market restrictions under Californias now widely criticized attempt at deregulation At one point during the hearing Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif asked some of the outofstate power generators who lined the witness table for a little cooperation in addressing her states electricity crisis All of you have made a lot of money off this she said scolding the executives for appearing not to care what happens not to care about the people that are being thrown out of jobs Among power producers represented by witnesses at the hearing were Calpine Corp Reliant Energy Wholesale Group Enron and the Williams Cos all major providers of power to Californias utilities Like many energy companies they have posted record profits during the past year Williams President Keith Bailey rejected suggestions of price gouging and said most of the power his company had sold was at a reasonable price very marginally above our actual costs Like other power producers Bailey said a federally imposed cap on wholesale prices makes no sense and would discourage production affect supplies and discourage consumers from conserving energy Price controls have not worked they dont get at the fundamental supply and demand problem maintained Steve Kean executive vice president of Enron the largest seller of wholesale electricity in North America As California tries to address its immediate power problems consumers in other Western states already were feeling the impact with dire predictions that the problem will get worse this spring and summer Mark Crisson of Tacoma Public Utilities in Tacoma Wash said his company recently boosted retail electricity rates by percent and may have to borrow million to keep up with wholesale price spurts We just cant raise our rates fast enough to keep up with what were seeing in these wholesale markets Crisson said Like others he urged temporary federal controls on prices across the West as a stopgap Sen Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico the panels ranking Democrat said the Bush administration has an obligation to find a solution before the crisis worsens Bingaman said the administrations only solution to the problem in California so far has been to recommend oil drilling in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge While there are many causes for Californias power shortage the ban on drilling in the refuge is not one of them Bingaman said Florida Energy Commission Recommends Deregulating Wholesale Electricity David Cox KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News The Orlando Sentinel Florida Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM TALLAHASSEE FlaFloridas political and business leaders moved cautiously toward deregulating the states electric industry Wednesday while vowing to avoid problems such as those in California where widespread blackouts and skyrocketing prices are wreaking havoc Floridas Energy Study Commission unanimously recommended that the Legislature consider deregulating wholesale electricity that is electricity sold to energy providers such as Florida Power Light from other producers The move could spark construction of a number of power plants including one proposed in New Smyrna Beach by Duke Energy of North Carolina The recommendation Wednesday was part of an effort to remove state regulations at all levels the eventual aim being a system in which consumers choose their power company much as they now choose their longdistance phone service Such a scenario though would take several years Wednesdays action if approved by the Legislature in its spring session would be a small step toward that goal The potential impact of the panels recommendations on residential and commercial electricity bills is unclear But an immediate effect would be to open Florida to independent power providers such as Duke Energy which wants to build socalled merchant plants that would generate electricity to be sold on the open market Michael Green general manager for Dukes operations in the southeastern United States said his company would immediately revive its plans to build a merchant plant near New Smyrna Beach The Florida Supreme Court killed the proposal last year ruling that such plants are prohibited under state law Several commission members and officials with the power companies say deregulation should lower customers rates over time because of the increased competition in the energy market And even if these proposals fail to lower rates they should at least keep electricity bills from going up as quickly as they would under the current system of regulated electric monopolies deregulation proponents say But consumer groups and municipal electrical providers disagree They say deregulating wholesale energy would lead to higher electricity bills because big utilities would be allowed to earn higher profits but not share the benefits with consumers Commission chairman Walter Revell rejected the idea that the panel is proposing anything that would favor power companies over consumers Were not doing this for the benefit of any company were doing it for the consumers Revell said He said Florida must build up its energy supply to avoid problems such as those in California That state is struggling with rolling blackouts and runaway utility costs stemming from a cold winter low reserves and heavy reliance on costly outofstate power California also failed to build new power plants or use effective conservation steps in the s Luckily Floridas plentiful reserves make it unlikely at least for the foreseeable future that it will experience shortages such as those in California Revell believes that deregulation will ensure that such a scenario never unfolds here But Barry Moline a spokesman for the Florida Municipal Electric Association said Revells concerns are bogus Florida law already requires power companies to hold percent of their power supplies in reserve so they can handle periods of extreme usage and utilities already are planning to provide additional capacity in the future he said The commission created by Gov Jeb Bush last May was under pressure from the governor and independent power providers to submit an initial deregulation proposal for this springs legislative session even though the panel will continue its work until December It is planning to recommend ways to deregulate the retail energy market electric power purchased by residents and businesses for the Legislature The movement toward deregulation troubled some of the commission members who were concerned that the Public Service Commissions and the state Cabinets reduced role over investorowned utilities would harm customers Duke and Enron Energy a Houstonbased energy giant that was among President Bushs top campaign contributors are among the outofstate firms charging to deregulate the industry and get a toehold on Floridas growing market But the states large investorowned monopolies Florida Power Light Tampa Electric Florida Power Corp and Gulf Power initially resisted the recommendations to let the independent suppliers enter the state Thats because they would lose their monopolies But the commission struck a deal with Floridas large companies allowing them the opportunity to cash in as well While the power sellers now in Florida could not keep their power plants the plan would allow them to transfer those plants which are often paid off to related companies Those companies in turn would be allowed to compete with the new merchant plants It was that concessions that created the most controversy among commission members including Sen Tom Lee who said he could not support the provision The Brandon Republican will be instrumental in passing any deregulation legislation this year Lee said there is simply no guarantee that the deregulation plan would benefit consumers But if lawmakers change the commissions concessions to the monopolies those companies may pull their support and jeopardize passage of anything this year Obviously the investorowned utilities are an extremely powerful political force in the state and theyll be looking out for their best interests in this said Duke Energys Green I hope theres enough in this proposal to keep them

Indeed he added there is a grave danger of drawing the wrong lessons Energy analysts and power generators warned the wholesale price caps urged by Feinstein would make the situation worse But utilities in Western states argued the situation will worsen without price caps They said they buy power on the same spot market that has driven Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison

Oregonians are being notified and many Washingtonians that their rates will be soon going up percent and in one Washington utility percent Now I dont think thats fair when Californias capped at percent I think that stinks Smith said he awoke yesterday morning to a newspaper cartoon showing the view of Oregon from California an outline of the state with two empty sockets in it He added that the drain on Northwest hydroelectric reservoirs means that salmon are getting flushed Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif insisted that environmental rules are not to blame for a decade of no power plant construction in California But the generators complained the states regulatory restrictions are insane The most heated disputes were over price caps on wholesale electricity sold in the daily spot market The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to impose them saying caps could make the situation worse by drying up power sales to California Energy analysts urged more longterm contracts for cheaper power which Gov Gray Davis is trying to negotiate now saying they accomplish the same thing as price caps but without creating shortages Feinstein said California will be short of power this summer when air conditioners are flipped on California will build new power plants she said and I agree the rates have to go up But in the meantime she said without price caps by summer jets will be grounded for lack of fuel businesses will close and communications will falter What do you suggest will get us through the summer short of somebody being able to make a decision as to how much profit and how much cost should be passed through and some control she asked The utilities can only pass through a megawatt hour to consumers and theyre buying at a megawatt hour Kit Konolige managing director at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter told Feinstein I would first suggest senator that the problem is the shortage of supply And standard economic theory would be that if you put a price cap on the supply youll get less of the supply not more The remedy he said is to sign all the longterm contracts that you can Utility executives pleaded for lifting price caps on their sales to consumers but imposing them on their wholesale purchases Mark Crisson of Tacoma Public Utilities in Tacoma Wash said the utility could run out of its million reserve by April even after a percent rate surcharge on consumers Scoffing at a warning that price caps would distort the market Crisson said In my view a distortion in this market would be an improvement But executives of the generating facilities including Houstons Enron and Reliant Energy Wholesale Group San Joses Calpine Corp and the Williams Companies of Tulsa Okla adamantly disagreed All said their costs were rising due to natural gas shortages increased demand and state delays in approving new power plants Feinstein resorted to a combination of veiled threats and pleas to generators reminding them as Californias senior senator Im going to be around here for six years Im going to be on this committee and Im going to watch this situation Gentlemen she said when spot power at am in the morning is times higher than it would be normally that to me is price gouging Deals Deal Makers Burning Issues Convertible Securities Are This Years Big Model By Suzanne McGee Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc When the ducks quack you feed em The Wall Street maxim is taking on new life in the convertiblesecurities market this year The climate for initial public offerings of stock remains sluggish there have been just three IPOs in the US this year and the appetite for followon stock issues by already public companies is also muted But investors are clamoring for new convertible securities and Wall Street investment bankers with visions of a steady stream of fees dancing in their heads are obliging them We can always use new paper in this market says Nick Calamos a Naperville Ill convertiblesecurities money manager for Calamos Asset Management We may buy only two out of of these deals but we really want as much as possible out there to choose from In the aftermath of last years stockmarket slide convertibles remained one of the healthiest products for Wall Street firms That is because these hybrid securities offer the safety of a bond with features like annual interest payments with the upside potential of a stock since the investor is able to swap his securities for common stock at a predetermined premium to current market prices providing exposure to any rise in stock prices That mix of traits helped push convertible issuance to a record last year when investment bankers used the securities to raise billion in deals according to Convertbondcom an industry Web site run by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co This year looks ready to at least match if not better last year Both investmentgrade and noninvestmentgrade convertible markets are on fire thanks to the interestrate cuts weve had says Phil Jones managing director and head of global equitylinked product development at Merrill Lynch Co Yesterday Federal Reserve policy makers again cut key lending rates dropping the federalfunds rate the interest rate charged by banks on overnight loans to each other to from As with the last rate cut earlier in January the latest reduction is expected to spur investor interest in investments that offer higher yields ranging from convertibles and corporate debt to junk bonds Reflecting investors enthusiasm the Miami cruise line Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd this week sold million of year convertible bonds through underwriter Merrill Lynch Originally the company had planned to sell only million of convertible securities together with an additional million of ordinary debt But demand for the investmentgrade deal surged and the deal was increased and priced several days ahead of schedule at the top end of the range expected That deal brought convertibles issuance for the month of January up to billion dwarfing IPOs which through yesterday had raised a mere million for three companies And although followon stock issues have raised billion for issuers in deals so far this year according to CommScan LLC that is dwarfed by the issuance in January when billion was raised in issues At least one other massive deal was priced ahead of schedule late Tuesday when Enron Corp raised billion in one of the convertible markets largest and most costly deals ever Underwriter Salomon Smith Barney a unit of Citigroup Inc priced the bonds at of par value meaning that they carry a yield to maturity of and have a conversion premium of That means that at the time they were sold the bonds were worth more than the value of the common shares into which they are convertible That is extraordinarily costly Typical deals conversion premiums currently range anywhere between and while Royal Caribbeans issue which like Enrons carried no annual dividend was priced at a premium The most expensive deal of this kind ever priced was last Junes sale of million of zerocoupon bonds issued by retailer Kohls Corp at a premium Thats not a deal well be participating in says Mr Calamos of the Enron deal Theres no way wed be a buyer on those terms In fact the pricing on the Enron transaction like other features of Januarys convertible market remind participants of last years early ebullience As was the case early last year and in contrast to the closing weeks of several of the companies now issuing convertible securities carry junkbond ratings Last year more than threequarters of new convertible issues were either unrated or carried a junkbond rating By late in the year that had stung investors as the stock prices of these issuers including many telecommunications companies and even some Internet firms plunged driving down the value of the convertible securities as well In reaction Novembers newissue calendar was composed largely of higherrated investmentgrade offerings But by January the market had become more receptive to unrated or junkbond issuers and companies like Adelphia Communications Corp Six Flags Inc and XO Communications Inc were once again able to tap the convertibles market Stilljittery investors remain loath to put money to work in IPOs or anything else that is perceived as volatile or risky But some see convertibles as a relative haven meaning that investment bankers stuck with a large list of IPO candidates waiting to go public can at least generate fees from convertibles issues Part of the demand is coming from traditional investors in convertible securities including managers of convertiblesecurities mutual funds and hedge funds But some investors including individuals who at this time last year were eager buyers of IPOs figure that convertibles can offer a combination of safety and exposure to growth stocks Thats really sending demand up and making the pricing aggressive says Jonathan Cunningham managing director of Jefferies Co who monitors the convertible securities market Other markets may be wobbling but ours is open wide for business The wideopen convertibles market is also making it possible for companies to complete concurrent deals simultaneous offerings of either debt or equity along with convertible securities That is what Royal Caribbean did with its billiondollar issue this week And today Aviron a biotech company plans to raise about million in a followon stock offering and at the same time bring in another million through the sale of convertible securities Next week another concurrent deal is expected to be priced with Ciena Corp seeking as much as million from a followon stock issue and million from convertible investors But investors warn bankers not to become too complacent about demand Some warn that they wont be there for the highpriced deals or if quality once again starts to slide Theres a lot of demand for new product but not at any price says Mr Calamos Weve got to keep our heads on straight Financial Hot Dark Summer Ahead for California Drought Worsens Power Crunch Senators Told Peter Behr and William Booth Washington Post Staff Writers The Washington Post FINAL E Copyright The Washington Post Co All Rights Reserved California faces a serious risk of greater electricity crisis this summer with bigger more frequent blackouts because of a severe drought in the Pacific Northwest that is draining hydroelectric power resources energy analysts and company officials told a Senate committee yesterday The power shortage will mean continued high electricity prices in states bordering California You have to scramble right now because we have a looming crisis again this summer consultant Larry Makovich of Cambridge Energy Research Associates told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Senators and witnesses at yesterdays hearing debated the possibility of federally imposed price caps or rate controls that Northwest governors have requested to rein in extraordinarily high wholesale electricity prices The proposals are expected to be a main focus of a meeting between western governors and Bush administration officials Friday But so far there is no indication that Congress would move rapidly on that front and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has resisted imposing wholesale price caps in California In the worst case if the regions drought continues and summer electricity demand is very high because of hot weather California could face more than hours of blackouts this year said Joe Bob Perkins president of wholesale operations for Reliant Energy a Houstonbased company that owns major power plants in California Essentially California will have to be incredibly fortunate to avoid blackouts this summer he said Members of the Senate committee agreed Were going to be in a crisis situation this summer as well said Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska the committee chairman Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said she believes that California will be short between and megawatts of power a day when heavy air conditioning use goes up in hot weather A megawatt of power provides electricity to homes In the summer Californias electricity demand rises to a peak of megawatts a day exceeding the states maximum generating capacity of around according to state officials Imports make up the rest Electricity from the Pacific Northwest most of it hydroelectric power contributes as much as percent of Californias power needs in a normal year Recent blackouts in the state were caused by shortages of megawatts affecting California households If the worstcase scenarios come true and shortages reach megawatts blackouts could last six hours at a time affecting more than million people Perkins said A drought in the Pacific Northwest is compounding Californias electricity shortages and the failure of its fouryearold deregulation program The Columbia River and Snake River regions are facing the fourth driest year on record said Sen Gordon H Smith ROre The reservoir behind the Grand Coulee Dam largest in the Northwest is at its lowest level in years and water power from Columbia River dams that normally would be used this summer is being tapped now to help California through its current shortage Smith noted The Northwest Power Planning Council recently warned that the Northwest faces a in chance of power shortages There is a very high probability that the West Coast will face blackouts said Judi Johansen executive vice president of PacifiCorp an electricity utility serving six western states Panelists at yesterdays Senate hearing agreed that California has few immediate options available to deal with continuing shortages this year Although six power plants are under construction most will not come on line until The state should consider paying big industrial users to close their plants and use electricity they have contracted to receive panelists said Conservation by companies and residents could save an additional megawatts a day by one estimate But the current prices paid by Californians capped at roughly levels dont give people an incentive to reduce electricity use panelists said Price caps wont prompt increased production from generators that are paying record prices for the natural gas used to make electricity generating companies executives said You can start turning the power off or pay the price it takes to get power to come said Steven J Kean Enron Corps chief of staff In Sacramento yesterday Gov Gray Davis D said officials are close to completing the first piece of legislation to allow the state government to enter into longterm contracts with power suppliers The state government has been buying power on an emergency basis but the pending legislation would make the state a major electricity buyer for years to come That would in effect end Californias failed experiment with deregulation The legislative action in Sacramento followed the release of a second stateordered audit of one of Californias struggling utility companies The review of Pacific Gas Electrics books showed that the company ignored warnings that its costs for wholesale electricity would soar under deregulation and that it failed to put cash aside to keep the company solvent PGE did not anticipate it would be constrained in its borrowings and did not develop a cash conservation program until December the audit report said The audit also confirmed that Pacific Gas Electric is deeply in debt and nearly broke just as an audit the day before concluded about Southern California Edison Like Southern California Edison Pacific Gas Electric had transferred about billion to its holding company PGE Corp since The money was in part from the sale of its power generating facilities and some of it was used to pay debt Such a transfer is not illegal or improper but it has outraged consumer advocates and some elected officials in CaliforniaBooth reported from Los Angeles Enron award should have been through competitive bidding says Sarma Our Economy Bureau New Delhi Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard Former economic affairs secretary EAS Sarma who quit the government last November said here today the Enron project should have been awarded through competitive bidding and should definitely not have been based on liquid fuels He said the country could not afford highcost electricity and the public sector power producers in India had set competitively low cost benchmarks NTPC and Bhel have been very cost competitive he said Sarma made these comments in his interview on India Talks programme of CNBC television network telecast today His comments are significant as he was involved with the countrys power sector as advisor power in the Planning Commission and subsequently as power secretary before moving to finance ministry as expenditure secretary Sarma however declined to elaborate on individual projects though he said the government should not give any further counter guarantees for power projects in the private sector He said he was in Planning Commission at the time when the guarantees were awarded but he had recommended that it cannot be a substitute for reforms in transmission networks and improvements in the working of state electricity boards He is slated to take over as principal of Administrative Staff College of India in Hyderabad on March Sarma refused to read any motive in his transfer but did say that he was denied the normal courtsey of being told that he was being transferred to department of coal He also said that there had been far too many transfers in last three years in the government Sarma resigned last November when he was suddenly transferred from the finance ministry in a large scale reshuffle of secretary level officers including finance secretary PG Mankad However he said that the current group of officers in North Block is competent enough to deliver the budget On the target of eight per cent growth set for the next fiscal the former economic affairs secretary said growth would be difficult

Supply US and Mexico Projects Would Cost Million to Million Each By Alexei Barrionuevo Staff Reporter The Asian Wall Street Journal M Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc In another sign that the US market for liquefied natural gas is heating up El Paso Energy Corp said it plans to spend at least billion over five years to build a handful of terminals for handling LNG for the US and Mexico markets El Paso Energy based in Houston said it is considering six projects in all three in the US two in Mexico and one in the Bahamas Five of the projects which would cost from million to million apiece would serve the US market where naturalgas prices are nearly three times higher than last year Last week Enron Corp another Houston energy concern said it plans to spend as much as million to feed gas from the Bahamas to the growing Florida market El Paso said it hopes to have its project running six months before Enrons The rival projects underscore surging US demand for LNG a process that allows natural gas to be shipped but that generally adds significantly to the cost While LNG has been a vital part of the gas supply in Asia particularly in Japan it has never enjoyed sustained success in the US mostly because it has been too costly to compete with low US natural gas prices But over the past two decades the cost of the process which cools natural gas into liquid form has come down and the price to construct LNG tankers has dropped by a third said Kathleen Eisbrenner El Pasos managing director for global LNG Still high US naturalgas prices are the key Tight gas supplies in the US drove average prices for natural gas to per thousand cubic feet last year up from a thousand cubic feet in To make El Pasos LNG bet worth the effort naturalgas prices have to stay above per thousand cubic feet over the next decade said Ralph Eads El Pasos president for merchant energy Assuming prices hold at that level we think the LNG business will grow at to a year for the next decade There is no other energy business growing at that pace Mr Eads said In response both El Paso and Williams Cos a Tulsa Oklahoma naturalgas company expect to revive mothballed terminals in the US states of Georgia and Maryland in the next two years El Pasos plans include a plant in a remote part of Mexicos Baja California that would feed gas markets in San Diego and Mexico where gas demand also is growing rapidly The company owns a site in Florida has options on land in the Bahamas is finalizing options on a site in the southern US and is evaluating sites in Baja San Diego and San Francisco In addition El Paso said it is building a terminal in Altamira Mexico to feed the Mexican market

generating capacity at rupees per kilowatt hour between May and October last year The cost could have been as low as rupees per megawatt hour if MSEB had drawn percent of the plants capacity There is a case for lowering the Enrons tariff a bit said Parikh Still thats no justification for the government to default Enron was one of the first major companies to enter India after the countrys economy

of Petrobras Pipeline Rio de Janeiro Feb Bloomberg Brazil gave BG Group Plc and Enron Corp expanded access to a BoliviaBrazil gas pipeline managed by Petroleo Brasileiro SA pressuring the state oil giant to sell more natural gas at lower prices Brazils petroleum regulator ANP is allowing UKbased BG to transport about million cubic meters of gas daily through the pipeline It also gave Enron permission to sell the million cubic meters a day it already pumps through the pipeline in Sao Paulo state locations We can probably provide gas to endusers for less than Petrobras said Francois Moreau corporate director for British Gas in Brazil Its a good sign the ANP is opening access Petrobras until recently Brazils monopoly oil and gas supplier faces mounting competition especially in Brazils most populated state of Sao Paulo The government has lagged in attracting companies to build gasfired power plants the intended buyers of the pipeline gas allowing other companies use of a nearempty pipeline Petrobras unit Gaspetro controls access to the billion pipeline with capacity of million cubic meters a day and partners like Enron and Royal DutchShell Group collect transport fees ANP requires Petrobras to forfeit pipeline space its not occupying Houstonbased Enron is proceeding with the construction of two gasfired power plants in Rio de Janeiro State but it also seeks to transport natural gas for vehicles kitchens and other destinations planning to boost its distribution to at least million cubic meters a day Petrobras hopes power plants will help quadruple demand for natural gas to million cubic meters a day by Still as the company waits for the government to attract power plant investors ANP says it will face more competition for other types of gas contracts Petrobras gas when its transported to power plants under contract cannot be used for purposes other than fueling the plants turbines the ANP said Power Plants Petrobras has contracts to buy about million cubic meters of natural gas daily from Bolivia this year while it transports about half that now The thermoelectric projects are far behind schedule said an ANP spokeswoman Still its ANPs directors stance that transport of gas must be a competitive market Demand for Petrobras Bolivian gas hasnt met company expectations as Brazil fails to attract investors to build about five dozen gasfired power plants it needs to avoid a shortage of electricity in coming years Companies and banks arent signing power plant contracts concerned that Brazils quarterly adjusted US dollar gas prices will leave them exposed to potential losses since the countrys electricity rates are adjusted only once a year They need to find a way of resolving issues for the lenders said Frank McGann an analyst with Merrill Lynch Co in New York The government is considering various options to ensure private companies build the power plants in order to meet the forecast percent annual growth in Brazils demand for electric power Government officials have said they may set up a stabilization fund that could reimburse companies for any losses incurred as they await adjustments in electricity rates Competition Permission to sell gas in Sao Paulo the countrys largest consuming state pits Enron against Petrobras BG also plans to boost its sales to Sao Paulos main gas distributor Comgas While Comgas largest supply contracts are with Petrobras BG owns a majority stake worth about billion in Comgas and wants the chance to boost sales to the distributor We dont expect our pipeline space to be interrupted for at least a few years as Petrobras tries to fill it up said Moreau In the meantime we can compete to transport the gas Petrobras earlier planned to sell the gas at a fixed rate along the kilometer mile pipeline about the distance from Boston to Albuquerque The plan would have helped Petrobras take advantage of its domination in markets distant from the Bolivian jungles the source of the gas ANP ruled that gas prices should vary according to transportation distance making it more expensive in Brazils southern regions the furthest reaches of the pipeline Anything to be done to spur demand for gas in Brazil is ultimately positive for Petrobras McGann said Its a cost to Petrobras until it builds up demand in Brazil but to break the logjam you need to pressure the market open a little Petrobras is beginning a fiveyear billion spending program centered around oil and gas production in an effort to make Brazil selfsufficient in its fuel consumption Joshua Schneyer in Rio de Janeiro

Business Standard Youre all Englishspeaking You are the opinionmakers of the country Wh y dont you spend some time understanding Indian realities His words fell on the audience like the staccato of an AK assault rifle They were dead on target some of Delhis bestheeled businessmen gathered together at the Ashoka Hotel convention hall S Gurumurthy Sangh Parivars swadeshi ideologue had been invited to deliver a lecture on a serious issu e Challenges and opportunities before the country But also sharing the dai s with him and speaking on the subject were film stars Amrish Puri and Pooj a Batra It was clear that he was not too happy about this I was in the audience waiting for the conference to end I had to take Gurumurthy to lunch His speech ended with muted but unmistakably snide remarks from the audience But he also walked away with maximum applause To me this illustrated the most striking element about his personality you c an love Gurumurthy or hate him but you cant ignore him We walked to the neighbouring Samrat Hotels Kamakshi restaurant because Gurumurthy likes simple south Indian vegetarian food Straightaway we ordered rasam and papad as starters Gurumurthy was still upset The organisers should have prepared the audience for such serious topics as this he said As the bowls of rasam and the papad arrived I prepared myself for a sessio n with the man considered to be an influential link between the RSS and the BJP He wields tremendous clout but avoids displaying it on his sleeve Were you always in the RSS I asked No I was closely associated with Kamrajjis Congress till his death he said to my surprise Kamrajji used to like me a lot and our approach was to deDravidianise Tamil Nadu politically he revealed This figured I know this is politically incorrect but it must be said Gurumurthy is a Brahmin and like most of his ilk he was ideologically at the receiving end of the virulent antiBrahmin movement which swept Tamil Nadu in the s That it has now waned and even leaders of Dravidian parties follow Brahminical rituals these days says a lot about the rethinking on the issue Are you a practitioner of Brahminism I asked This was a Did you beat your wife last night kind of question I wanted to provoke Gurumurthy wh o even his colleagues admit symbolises traditional Brahminism Gratifyingly he rose to the bait Call me Brahminist or retrograde it doesnt bother m e If Dravidianism is good then Brahminism is equally good Gurumurthy said a flash of belligerence flaring He explained his political theory of deDravidianisation of Tamil Nadu Dravidianism was political speculation which became political reality It Dravidianism was poison injected by th e British he said That Gurumurthy originally came from the Congress fold was news but more revelations were to follow He was most appreciative of Indira Gandhis efforts to deDravidianise Tamil Nadu by forging an alliance with the DMK i n the s This was indeed a positive contribution of Indira Gandhi he said Coming from a Sangh stalwart this was significant After Kamrajs death Gurumurthy found himself in the company of the legendary and irrepressible media baron Ram Nath Goenka From here began h is association with the RSS It was a political assignment he said recounting the past This was the time when Jayaprakash Narayan began his war against Indira Gandhi and Goenkas The Indian Express played a crucial role in the campaign Obviously in those circumstances my job was more than a financial advisers he said But how did you get attracted to the RSS I asked curiously It was the sincerity of people in the RSS that attracted me They are the gentlest people I have ever come across Had I not come into contact with the RSS I would have been a hundred times richer in terms of money but I would have been a thousand times poorer in other respects said the chartered accountant who virtually reveres his association with the Sangh Parivar But youre influential because you are associated with the RSS I said A t one or other time many in the party and government have felt and said th at Gurumurthy and his Swadeshi Jagran Manch hold a brief for only some Indian industrialists and use their closeness to the RSS to camouflage this Give me one example when Ive used my influence in the government he sai d flatly You have suggested to the Prime Minister indirectly that he should remove an officer from the PMO I said Indirectly No you are mistaken This was a direct suggestion Such officers are a blot on a great leader li ke Atal Bihari Vajpayee and I have never been circumspect on the issue he said adding that had he been influential his suggestions would have been accepted My opinion may be powerful but it does not mean I wield power he explained Gurumurthy asked for curdrice for the main course a dish all south Indian Brahmins swear by it is also P V Narasimha Raos favourite food He continued on the earlier theme It is unfortunate that in years the system has produced very few Bhure Lals an IAS officer who was one of V P Singhs favourite officers What did he think about the present government The problem is that an AngloSaxon class continues to rule the country Such people have serious limitations in understanding Indian realities They run the country like a Bishop runs the Church In the process elite India has become the real India he said Being a believer in cultural nationalism Gurumurthy hastened to add This divide is only perceptional What links them is even ts like the Kumbh Culture and religion are the interface where elites and subaltern meet This is why secular parties are oblivious to real India h e said You have been consistent in opposing the governments economic policies W hy is it that even Vajpayee who belongs to the Sangh is pursuing the same course I asked What I really wanted to know was his views on the speculation about strained relation between the government and the Sangh Parivar on economic issues The government is not the sole arbiter of economic issues This is determined outside the government Just as the atmosphere for socialism was determined by forces outside the government the atmosphere needed to pursu e policies of globalisation is being decided outside the government he said If this is such an obvious trap why are people like Vajpayee and Yashwant Sinha falling into it I demanded They cannot function in isolation Wha t we have is intellectual extremism of the Englishspeaking class he said Extremism I asked as we ordered coffee They the Englishspeaking class are the one who espoused Enrons cause They are the ones who suggested that billions of foreign exchange would pou r in once the insurance sector was opened up Did they prove to be correct Gurumurthy asked triumphantly Are these people including the financial newspapers ready to accept that they were wrong in their assessment he said If the people who supported Enron accept that it was a mistake the country would be per cent more intelligent He continued This class never accepts that the past was a mistake Forgetting the past is a typical characteristic whether it is the issue of the Ram Temple socialism or Enron Perhaps this was the closest Gurumurthy could come to admitting his growin g disenchantment with the present regime On reforms he said Policies are largely bureaucracyled and there is no political control over what is believed to be reforms he said Another intriguing statement We finished lunch and prepared to leave I mentally summed up all that Gurumurthy had said The one thing that came forcefully to mind was his complete contempt for anyone including those in his own party who belongs to what he calls the AngloSaxon class As I bid him goodbye I decided that to get to the bottom of that mystery will need many more lunches Gurumurthys subconscious needs to be explored It is a puzzle wrapped in an enigma NTPC should also absorb some part of DPC power Renni Abraham MUMBAI Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard Maharashtra finance and planning minister Jayant Rajaram Patil has said tha t invocation of the government of India counterguarantee by the Dabhol Power Company has set the stage for the resolution of the Enron crisis Talking t o Business Standard Patil spoke on the state governments future course of action and several other issues Excerpts Please comment on DPC invoking the Centres counterguarantee The move is aimed at resolving the crisis We have made it clear that the high DPC tariffs have become unaffordable for the Maharashtra State Electricity Board Also it is not financially prudent for the state government to bail out MSEB in respect of the DPC payments every month A logical solution has to be found within the MSEB itself which has to be abl e to absorb the DPC power With the GOI counterguarantee invoked the state is set for resolving the whole issue The solution has to involve the central government as it was the Centre that had invited the power major and solicited others like Cogentrix to invest Maharashtra with a favourable industrial climate became the testing ground for the setting up of first such power project What led to the present crisis and how is this being addressed to Even the setting up of review committee has been inordinately delayed Maharashtra economy cannot sustain payments to DPCs phase II which too ha s been sanctioned I do not want to rake up the politics behind this We have to look forward to resolving the problem on hand As far as Maharashtra is concerned the eightparty Democratic Front government has unanimously decided that the present high DPC tariff is not affordable and has to be rationalised The Centre has to actively look into it As far as the delay in the review committees constitution is concerned th e task would be completed soon We have shortlisted a number of experts and a re seeking to constitute an independent body of experts to look at the multifo ld aspect of the DPC project and suggest ways to resolve the present crisis T he panel would probably be asked to immediately submit a set of recommendation s to resolve the issues at hand while looking at the various other options before it and suggest multifold recommendations to the government What options does the government have There are several lines of thought with regard to resolving the DPC issue The state government is clear that the DPC will have to make available cheaper power Another option could be staggering phase II For instance block B and C of phase II could be staggered We know that once the jetty f or LNG is commissioned by DPC the tariffs would be reduced substantially Similarly we would be keen to look into the possibility of restructuring t he rupeedollar arrangement so that the risk of foreign exchange fluctuations are reduced The panel would look into this aspect as well MSEB has to be able to afford DPC power Along with cheaper tariffs it might also be necessary for the National Thermal Power Corporation to absorb some part of the power generated by DPC The Centre should take some component from Phas e I and II We have to resolve the present crisis as a nation and a state Why did DPC not invoke the Letter of Credit before the GOM and GOI guarantees The Rs crore LC was not invoked for obvious reasons By invoking the GO M and GOI guarantees a deadend has been reached as far as brokering pieceme al solutions are concerned Now the issue has to be resolve in totality We want to reach a new understanding with DPC on the project in which the Centre will have to get into the picture Union energy minister Suresh Prab hu has been stating that the Maharashtra government should forward a proposal for resolving the issue We are in the process of doing just that Metro Desk THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY CRISIS Deregulation Didnt Foster Competition NICHOLAS RICCARDI STEVE BERRY TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company The way people scrambled for a stake in Californias power market three yea rs ago youd have thought it was the second coming of the Gold Rush Politicians and free marketers boasted that they were freeing millions of customers from their monopolistic utilities so they could shop for cheaper electricity The state ordered an million publicity campaign promising a brave new energy world bustling with competition But those dreams of capitalism unleashed never materialized dashed by provisions in the deregulation law that effectively undermined competition and gave the utilities a substantial edge over newcomers In th e end only of the utilities residential users switched to other providers many opting to pay more for green energy Although the chaos swirling around Californias electricity crisis has chiefly focused on soaring wholesale prices the virtual absence of competition at the consumer level has played a key role in deregulations undoing Had competition among retailers flourished garnering the millions of customers deregulators expected prices might never have reached todays unprecedented peaks and the turmoil might have been tempered economists an d retailers say Retail competition would not have prevented a crisis but it would have toned it down said Richard Counihan spokesman for Green Mountain Energy which has returned most of its customers to the utilities ranks Now even the prospect of competition is gone A measure enacted by the Legislature last week which made state government the biggest electricity buyer in California suspended further retail competition preventing anyon e from underbidding the state That buries us said Tony Wayne president of UtiliSource of Brea which under the new law can keep its relatively small number of customers but is barred from entering into new contracts Few thought it would come to this High Hopes Collide With Reality Almost firms registered with the state to sell electricity to consumers Many of them quickbuck hucksters or smalltime operations were scared of f by background checks fingerprinting and the deposit required to enter the market But then there were the likes of giant Enron Corp which predicted that th e new market would pull customers from the utilities in the first few weeks Another firm deployed salespeople nabbing residential and business prospects by the thousands They quickly discovered that the structure of Californias landmark deregulation effort erected protective barriers preventing most retailers from beating the prices of the big three utilitiesSouthern California Edison Pacific Gas Electric and San Diego Gas Electric For example deregulation law allowed the utilities to keep their million customers until each took the initiative to switch Any ratepayer who used a moderate amount of energy and wanted to change companies had to pay fo r a new meterunless the retailer wanted to eat the cost itself In contrast Pennsylvania where deregulation has been more successful than in California requires most of its utilities to surrender some of their customers Last year customers of one utility were auctioned off t o the retailer who could promise them the most savings All together close t o million customers have switched from utilities to retailers with savings estimates ranging from a few dollars to per month In California the next barrier was expressly designed by deregulation architects to keep new retailers at bay at least temporarily Before throwing utilities into a freeforall lawmakers felt obligated to give them time to pay off debts that would hurt their ability to offer competitive prices The Legislature froze customer prices at levels well above what the utilities were then paying for electricity The difference would be used to pay their debts The hitch for prospective retailers was that their customerslike those remaining with utilitieswould be charged the extra amount too That seriously hurt the retailers ability to shave prices for their customers without taking a hit themselves Utility executives say the socalled competition transition charge accomplished its intent providing some protection against new players unti l the utilities could shed their debt and compete on an even field According to those executives the plan went awry when wholesale electricit y prices soared before the special debt charge was lifted and competition had a chance to flourish We havent had enough time for this market to work said Denise Grant director of the Edison division that works with retailers She said Edison expected to lose customers annuallya far cry from what has happened Retailers say they faced other obstacles that seemed designed to help the utilities keep as many of their customers as possible One of the biggest was a newly created energy marketplace called the Power Exchange Under the exchanges rules all buyerslittle guys with a few hundred customers and mammoth utilities with millionspaid the same price for electricity Once again retailers were stymied in their search for ways to cut their customers bills Retailers had no place else to shop for energy because suppliers could make more money selling in high volume to billiondollar utilities on the Power Exchange rather than cutting small deals with upstart companies Wayne the president of UtiliSource learned the hard way He was peddling electricity in California in early before the state created the Power Exchange After arranging a good but informal deal with a Washington generator he sent out hundreds of salespeople took to the road himself an d soon cornered customers But the birth of the exchange caused the death of his deal Wayne said The generators pulled out when they realized how much money they could make selling on the open market That was an ohmygod They said Why should we give you a discount when we can sell it to the Power Exchange ourselves he said Retailers say the state protects the utilities in subtler but no less damaging ways That includes billing customers who switch companies for certain overhead costs of their old utilities such as weather forecasters and accountants involved in procuring electricity In late a coalition of retailers filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission arguing that their customers should not be forced to p ay costs for utilities they had decided to leave Earlier this month the PUC finally reached a decision that favors the retailers argument but accepts the utilities calculations of the expenses borne by retailers an amount critics say is far too low In dissenting Commissioner Richard A Bilas called the decisions paltry award to retailers another strike against them We cannot keep stymieing retail competition if we are seeking rational markets he said Energy service providers retailers have left the stat e in droves They need all the encouragement we can give them Retailers Found Little Opportunity Be they multinational giants or kitchentable entrepreneurs retailers are dismayed by their experiences with deregulation Enron spent million trying to sell electricity in and the spring of But unable to offer enticing discounts the firm picked up only customers In a recent meeting with reporters and editors at The Times Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay suggested that the framers of deregulation kept marke t forces pinned down in the retail sector As a result there was little mone y to be made and little incentive to stick around The more customers you signed up Lay said the more money you lost Last week Enron returned a number of its remaining electricity contracts t o PGE In the end Lay said we couldnt change the rules and we pulled out On the other end of the spectrum Paul Oshideri is now a oneman operation since he laid off his seven employees during his unprofitable two years trying to entice customers to Cucamonga Energy You dont have that many options said Oshideri who is still holding on to his customers and vows not to quit What can you do You cant do anything right now Only when it came to businesses and big institutions such as universities were retailers able to make a dent in the market The small price reduction s they offered translated into huge savings for those large users of electricity The retailers also offered a variety of other services including aid to help businesses become more energy efficient Although fewer than of all residential customers have switched to new energy companies of industrial users have done so according to the Public Utilities Commission If theyd structured this differently they would have had households able to make big savings just like industrials said Cal State Fullerton economist Robert Michaels There is some dispute among deregulation critics over whether legislators designed the law to protect the utilities from an onslaught of competition or it just turned out that way Jesse Knight a former member of the Public Utilities Commission who dissented on the panels deregulation plan said the law is biased against retail competition But I dont think it was the legislations intent to protect the monopoly Knight said There is general agreement however that not enough attention was paid to the mechanics of the retail market Much of the deregulation legislation deals with generation transmission an d wholesale prices of electricity The only provisions on the retail end simp ly allow consumers to shop for deals Lay the Enron executive recalled that the utilities fought hard to mainta in their customer base The irony is that with wholesale prices skyrocketing over the last six months buying electricity for all those customers has driven the utilities to the brink of insolvency With hindsight I expect they wish theyd agreed to more choice at t he customer level Lay said Then maybe they wouldnt be in the circumstance s theyre in BusinessFinancial Desk Section C COMPANY NEWS DABHOL ENRON UNIT IN INDIA INVOKES

e Through a combination of business and political savvy the Houstonbased company Enron Corp has become a leading trader in the states little kno wn but increasingly important wholesale power market And while critics contend Enrons soaring fortunes suggest too much influen ce over a badly flawed system some analysts simply credit the company with skillfully operating in a world that barely existed a decade ago where electricity is traded like soy beans or oil The sellers have all the leverage and all the brains And the buyers have been slow and stupid said John White an environmental lobbyist who track s energy issues What I wish is that the buyers side of the California mark et had people as smart and clever and aggressive as Enron Even as California overhauls its market Enron will likely play a big part in the states energy future Partly as a result of state and federal policies that Enron has championed wholesale trading is now a crucial link in the process of delivering electricity to homes and businesses nationwide Those policies are unlikely to change under President George W Bush who counts Enron chairman Ken Lay as a friend campaign contributor and energy adviser Enron reported record operating profits of billion last year excludin g onetime adjustments Thats up percent from Most of its revenue came from wholesale operations While Enron doesnt provide financial results for each state company CEO Jeff Skilling said th is week that California accounted for about percent of the companys billion in sales Weve probably bought and sold more power than any other marketmaker in t he West said Enron executive vice president Steven Kean Originally a gas pipeline firm Enron now has many interests from building power plants in India to trading wood products and telecommunications bandwidth online It recently launched a venture with Blockbuster to deliv er videos over a fiber optic network But Enrons primary business involves acting as a middleman between energy producers and the companies that deliv er power to consumers At the companys story Houston headquarters Enron traders use sophisticated software to monitor supply and demand often based on such variables as weather plant breakdowns and availability of fuel Traders buy power from sources all over the region independent generator s local utilities public agencies or other traders and assume the risk of finding someone willing to pay a little more Or they will contract to sell electricity at a certain rate betting on their ability to obtain that powe r more cheaply Theyll take positions based on where they think prices are going to go said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum which has member firms This is a guessing game Enron does it better than most Enrons traders may buy from several sources to supply one customer Or the y might purchase a large volume and sell it off in slices either on the spot market or in longterm contracts They understand financial markets and they understand risk management sa id Jim Angel a finance professor at Georgetown University That gives them a big competitive advantage over the old dinosaurs of the industry Enron pioneered such trading he said building on skills it developed in t he natural gas business But today most power companies are involved in simil ar deals As a generator my production cost might be cents Ackerman said If someone else is offering the same commodity for cents just for this wee k Ill shut down my plant and buy their power and then turn around and resell it Some critics suggest a market based on such price changes is too risky for a commodity as essential as electricity Attorneys have filed two consumer lawsuits accusing generators and traders of manipulating supplies to drive up prices But traders deny those allegations Enrons Kean said they help find supply to meet demand while their longterm contracts protect buyers from price spikes Kean said Enron makes a profit buying and selling no matter if prices are high or low Those transactions are increasingly integral to the energy industry as it tries to balance out surpluses and shortages around the region Ackerman estimated the volume of electricity sold back and forth on a given day is often ten times the amount actually delivered to consumers Such trading will continue he said even though the state is now negotiati ng longterm contracts with energy providers The traders will still try to beat the costs of serving those contracts And traders may benefit from the demise of the states Power Exchange The central spot market is closing because its largest customers the utilities are insolvent Without the exchange to post an hourly rate said James Bushnell of the University of California Energy Institute there really isnt much in the way of meaningful price information any more And that does advantage marketers The cynical interpretation is that if buyers and sellers dont have the information the marketers can make money Enron was an outspoken opponent of the exchange when California first plann ed for deregulation Over the last decade Enron has joined forces with manufacturers and industrial interests in a number of states as they lobbied for permission to bypass local utilities and negotiate for better deals with competing suppliers In challenging the wellentrenched utilities Enron has built its own political clout The company and its employees gave million to federal campaigns in the last election cycle according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics Enron donated to California campaigns in including to Gov Gray Davis The company also has deployed its own army of lobbyists and consultants A few years ago it hired former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed for advice on building grassroots support In California it recruited former staffers from the Public Utilities Commission to help make its case During Californias early discussions state regulators embraced a utilitybacked plan for a single agency to run the states transmission gri d and operate a central exchange for wholesale energy transactions But Enron and its allies argued the agency would be dominated by the utilities which would discourage competition and make it harder to negotia te lower prices In the end California adopted a compromise It created the Power Exchange mandatory for utilities and voluntary for others and a separate agency the Independent System Operator to run the states transmission grid Critics suggest the complex decentralized structure has made it easier to abuse the market by withholding supplies or taking advantage of congestion on the transmission grid to drive up prices But no one has produced evidence tying any company to wrongdoing And Enron denies taking any unfair advantage The fact of the matter is its easy to blame people from out of state sa id Kean It tends to deflect attention from some of the real causes of the problem The real underlying cause was that you had rapid demand growth and you didnt have enough supply Enron has plans to increase Californias supply Though it currently has on ly has a windpower facility near Tehachapi its planning a megawatt gaspowered plant in Kern County and has three more up for licensing The company also has sought to build a retail business aimed at industrial and commercial clients It abandoned an earlier effort to sign up residenti al customers in after concluding that California utilities had succeeded in structuring deregulation to discourage competition for those customers But Enron has contracts with commercial clients to provide a range of services from advising on energy efficiency to supplying power at a guaranteed rate As Skilling recently told industry analysts Enrons business is packaging energy supplies for our customers It doesnt matter he explained if that energy comes from a plant that Enr on owns or from a contract with another supplier Its all part of

California Is a Surprise Bonanza By Chip Cummins Dow Jones Newswires The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Last quarter Anadarko Petroleum Corp a Houston oilandgas concern discovered an unexpected bonus from last years acquisition of rival Union Pacific Resources Group Inc The purchase it turns out included commitments to transport natural gas along a pipeline running from the Rocky Mountains into California For year s those contracts werent worth much But late last year naturalgas prices skyrocketed especially for gas delivered to California Thanks to its hold on precious space in one of a handful of pipelines into the state Anadarko booked about million in extra profit in the fourth quarter It may see more in the first quarter Call it a California bonanza for naturalgas companies While wholesale naturalgas prices have eased in some parts of the country such as in West Texas where prices are hovering around to per thousand cubic feet the gas can fetch twice as much if it is delivered in California Natural g as was recently changing hands at as much as to per thousand cubic fee t at Topock Ariz a pricing hub on the California border Regional gas prices often fluctuate because of unusual weather or pipeline disruptions But Californias gas premium has been remarkable for how wide it has grown and how long it has lingered Its a pretty major change in market dynamics says Art Gelber principal at Gelber Associates a Houston energyconsulting and assetresources fir m The simple explanation for the difference Naturalgas demand continues to outstrip the states own modest production and pipeline capacity for outofstate gas hasnt kept up According to the California Energy Commission the state produced just of the gas it consumed in the most recent year for which figures are available Of the nearly billion cubic feet of gas a day California imported almost half came from the Southwest an additional came from Canada and from the Rocky Mountain states To get that gas from the wel l to users gas marketers buy up capacity in a limited number of Californiabound pipelines With a shortage of pipeline capacity transportation costs have climbed and are passed along to end users Californias pain has turned into unexpected gain for a handful of companie s Occidental Petroleum Corp a big California gas producer is finding its g as is suddenly much more valuable than it was just a few months ago In a rece nt conference call with analysts the company noted that prices in California have been more than higher per thousand cubic feet of gas than elsewhere in the country which the company said will be reflected in the firstquart er earnings Both Occidental and Anadarko have spent time explaining the unusual California gains to Wall Street and any windfalls this quarter are likely already priced into their shares analysts say In pm composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Occidental rose cents to while Anadarko rose to Considering the companies diverse oilandgas portfolios Californias recent volatility wouldnt likely move stock prices much anyway But the experiences of Occidental and Anadarko in the state highlight what unforese en surprises can pop up in such an unbalanced commodity market California is serviced by four major pipelines Transwestern Pipeline Co a subsidiary of Enron Corp operates a line from West Texas into Southern California El Paso Corps El Paso Natural Gas Co runs another pipeline largely parallel to Transwestern PGE Corps PGE Gas Transmission Co brings gas down from Canada and Williams Cos Kern River pipeline brings gas in from the Rocky Mountains For years the contracts on the Kern River line and other pipelines that Anadarko inherited from Union Pacific were money losers as transportation rights into California traded at a discount There was plenty of gas going into California and California didnt need any more says David Larson Anadarkos manager of investor relations But by the end of last year the contracts were soaring in value With California gas consumption ballooning to meet soaring electricitygeneration demand the states pipelines filled up quickly Normally other suppliers would redirect gas to places where the price was highest and the situation would work itself out But capacity is so limite d that producers simply cant get more gas to California In its complicated contractual agreements involving a handful of gas marketers Anadarko was able to realize big gains in essence agreeing to transport other producers gas into California Anadarkos contracts lay ou t fixed rates for slots in the pipelines but the company can pocket gains if market rates for the transportation rise above the fixed rates Anadarko booked the fourthquarter gain by valuing its contracts at current market prices called marking to market The contracts stretch out over several years and with rates still volatile Anadarko could book more profit should the market price of the contracts continue to soar Mr Larson says the contracts could add million to million to the companys bottom line in the current quarter though their value could just as easily fall resulting in a charge Meanwhile Occidental based in Los Angeles produces and markets a little more than million cubic feet of natural gas a day in California The higher prices that gas is currently fetching there is likely to show up on its bottom line this quarter Occidentals Elk Hills field is producing at about above its stated capacity says John Allen general manager for the operation about

article Californias Power Crisis May Slow Asia Deregulation Update Adds comment from government in paragraph seven that sale of Korea Electric Power Corp will go ahead on schedule Sydney Feb Bloomberg Asian officials are backing away from deregulating their electricity industries after bungled reforms in California caused power blackouts and pushed the states two biggest utilities to the brink of bankruptcy Companies and consumers will have a longer wait for cheaper power as governments from Korea and Japan to Taiwan and Malaysia delay plans to break up or deregulate monopoly electricity companies Korea is reviewing plans to separate statecontrolled Korea Electric Power Corps coal and gasfired power plants into five companies The break up is scheduled for April Stable supply is our first priority Shin Kook Hwan Koreas commerce industry and energy minister said last week Thats more important than leaving electricity supply in the hands of market rules especially in light of Californias power crisis Malaysias biggest utility Tenaga Nasional Bhd last month asked the government to halt the opening of the power industry while Australian companies are complaining their countrys system similar to that of California needs an overhaul Asian governments are going to pause and take a deep breath before they dive into the next phase of deregulation said Rob Booth managing director of Bardak Group an Australian energy consultancy While Korea is looking at the implications of the California power crisis the government said this will not delay the sale of its stake in Korea Electric Power Corp starting The government has percent of Kepco which will be sold off in stages LA to KL Californias legislature last week voted to issue as much as billion in bonds to help rescue PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric and Edison Internationals Southern California Edison which ran out of money as the price they paid for power rose eight fold in less than a year PGE and Edison have run up more than billion in debt from buying power Pricecutting was the goal in California but it all went wrong PGE and Edison piled up debt because Californias electricity deregulation law set no limits on the price they pay for power but capped the rates they can bill consumers Producers and distributors of power were supposed to match their needs through a central pool where the price was set depending on supply and demand As demand rose and environmental restrictions discouraged building of new power stations supplies tightened and generators pushed the price above the rate the utilities could charge customers Power outages in California show the power pooling system hasnt benefited customers said Fuad Jaafar chief executive of Tenaga which is twothirds government owned and the biggest Southeast Asian power utility by sales Power Down Its in Australia though that the biggest parallels to California are being drawn Australia is the only country in Asia which has split up and deregulated its power industry and is one of only four places in the world which chose to use the pool pricesetting mechanism invented in the UK which has failed in California Australia is the last place in the world still trying to get one of these UKstyle markets to work said Booth All the others California the UK and Alberta province in Canada are abandoning the system because it gives electricity generators too much power to manipulate prices to boost their profits said Booth Bob Lim an adviser to the Energy Markets Reform Forum said its members large industrial power users in southeastern Australia dont want to be named because theyre negotiating power supply agreements and finding it difficult to agree reasonable prices Thats an early symptom of whats happening said Lim There is a lot of nervousness about the market because of the fundamentally flawed trading system While there is concern about pool trading analysts say Australias system is more resilient because unlike in California energy retailers have been able to use forward purchases and other agreements to fix prices for much of their future power needs Meantime a number of companies are benefiting from higher power prices Origin Energy Ltd a gas retailer and distributor is the best pick among Australianlisted companies which own generating plants said JB Were utilities analyst Gavin Rogers in a report It owns peak power generation plants has no current exposure to electricity retailing and controls neartomarket gas reserves hedging it from any future input cost increases Rogers said Most Australian generating plants are either stateowned or controlled by overseas companies Edison International owns Loy Yang B power station in Victoria state while NRG Energy Inc of the US has a one quarter stake in the adjacent A billion Loy Yang A station Other foreign investors include AES Corp of the US UK based International Power Plc and Powergen Plc and CLP Holdings Ltd of Hong Kong Elsewhere In Japan deregulation poses a different problem Increased competition could leave generators with too much capacity discouraging the construction of new cleaner and more efficient power stations Japanese electricity producers such as Tokyo Electric Power Co the largest will face a tougher market said Yoshinori Moda a utility analyst at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo Electricity companies will likely lose after deregulation because they dont have an alternative other than reducing prices or losing customers he said Japans government on March last year opened percent of the power market to competition allowing nonutilities to retail electricity directly to factories and other big users Deregulation has forced Tokyo Electric or Tepco and other power utilities to reduce charges and cut costs to deter potential market entrants Tepcos rate cuts in October last year will reduce the companys sales by billion yen during the six months to March the company said in November Some parts of the world such as Scandinavia and several northeastern US states have succeeded in deregulation by allowing generators and their customers to agree power sale contracts outside the pool said Booth Thats the way the UK and California are going as well he said But he warned that usually there are too few power generators in an individual market to create sufficient competition that would allow regulators to relax Even with conventional trading systems of the type that have been successful you still have to have enough competition to keep people honest said Booth Stephen

fingerpointing the shouting the machinations in the darkand many Californians agree The state desperately needs to build n ew power plants Over the last decade the population has climbed to million

environmentalists are now crying Dont look at uswed love to see some new plants built since they could replace some older dirtier ones Says Richard Ferguson head of the Sierra Clubs California Energy Committee We need new generation and the old plants are hogging our air space The bureaucrats havent helped While the California Energy Commission has recently greenlighted ten new plants it will be years before they come on line Applications take an achingly slow months to work their way throug h the permit process compared with days in Texas Texas has built nine large power plants since In California as many as assessments from historical significance to impact on fish and wildlifecan require changes to the blueprints Result Ancillary costs to developers in California run as high as million for one project compared with million in Texas The utilities deserve some blame for bad forecastingand for the financi al ruin that is being visited upon them says Peter Huber in his column see T he Kilowatt Casino They agreed to buy electricity at spot prices and to sell at fixed retail prices figuring they could clean up on the easy spread between the two prices For several years they did make some nice money thi s way Wholesale prices got as low as cents a kilowatthour while the reta il rate was close to cents Then the wholesale price spiked last summer to cents The two biggest California utilities PGE and Edison International lost billion between them since last summer and have wrecked their credit ratings Potential builders of generating stations dont want to sel l to such shaky customers Blame politicians too for preventing plant construction In October Governor Gray Davis put a ceiling on wholesale rates at cents a kilowatthour but in December he made it a soft cap allowing wholesaler s to sell above that if they could provide the state with a reason for charging more Still it had a chilling effect Right after the governors move Calpine a wholesale generator yanked six of seven applications to build socalled peaker plants These are tiny megawattorless dynamos that operate only to days a year when demand peaks and electricity should command a premium price Twentyfive cents does not go very far in this kind of plant With the spot price of natural gas at delivered th e fuel for a kilowatthour runs about a dime Now figure in construction cost s million for megawatts that have to be amortized over a relatively small number of kilowatthours and you have a formula for losses if the pla nt is in a state where the governor wants to put profiteers in jail Next on our list of plantstoppers the neighbors Sunlaws proposal to bui ld a megawatt million plant in southeast Los Angeles county hasnt h it any snags with the CEC or the South Coast Air Quality

Insurers seen more involved in credit derivatives By Tom Burroughes Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON Feb Reuters Insurance firms are expected to step deeper into the credit derivatives market as they wake up to rich pickings in this field and as splits between financial sectors blur further Insurers have provided clients with protection against credit problems for decades so dealing in credit derivatives is a logical next step according to George Sandars a partner at international law firm Denton Wilde Sapte There is a tendency for the regulation of markets to converge Being so analogous to insurance it credit derivatives is an obvious area for insurers to build business in said Sandars who is the author of a Denton Wilde Sapte report on alternative risk transfer Looking across all credit derivative contracts the British Bankers Association last year estimated insurers made up percent of protection sellers and seven percent of protection buyers Banks continue to dominate the market A NEW ASSET CLASS A senior trader for a US reinsurance firm in New York who declined to be named believes for the foreseeable future insurers will focus on selling credit derivatives to acquire assets rather than buying to them offset liability Insurers are taking on such risks for their asset portfolios he said However some insurers are starting to buy credit derivatives too We have seen enquiry from insurers to buy credit protection and that has grown in the last year Given the significant increase in defaults over the last few months that are out of line with historical experience the insurers who are comfortable with statistics and mortality are getting a bit concerned he said Reinsurance firms have tended to be more heavily involved in trading credit derivatives than insurers because the repackaging of existing insurance deals meant firms had to look harder at the kind of risks they faced he said As for insurers overall use of credit derivatives he said I wouldnt say they are significant but they are getting to be more important Most of the credit derivative market is being driven by the banks mostly for regulatory and capital reasons His firm estimates insurers take up to percent of total credit derivative business One type of derivative particularly attractive to insurers are bankruptcy swaps said Bryan Seyfried vice president of Enron Credit Enron Credit is energy firm Enrons credit risk management arm and provides data on bankruptcy swaps Bankruptcy is a less ambiguous event than default which is currently plagued by debate over documentation and definitions and insurers would not face uncertainty about payouts on contracts he said In default swaps insurers tended to prefer deals involving a basket of names rather than an individual one so they can spread risk Seyfried said INSURERS EXPERIENCE Insurers have long experience in offering protection against problems such as default or bankruptcy Companies like US bond insurer MBIA for example guarantee debt for firms such as US utility Southern Californian Edison which is currently facing a crisis due to soaring energy prices If an issuer defaults the insurer will pay the interest and principal amounts to creditors Traditionally they also provide surety bonds which are issued to vendors and which guarantee that a vendor who bids on a contract will carry out the obligation INDIA Indian state unable to pay Enronchief minister Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited BOMBAY Feb Reuters The western Indian state of Maharashtra

LONDON Feb Reuters Billionaire and former fugitive Marc Rich is in talks to sell his commodities trading business to Russianowned Crown Resources an aggressive trading house seeking to grow its energy unit and branch into metals industry sources said on Wednesday It is definitely being negotiated Whether it gets done is a different question an industry source who declined to be named said of the deal Crown is a very aggressive company and theyre looking to bring in whole new teams Crown based in Zug Switzerland as is Marc Rich Investments is part of Alfa Group a Russian industrial and financial conglomerate with activities in a wide spectrum of banking and commodities businesses Rumours have circulated for months that the company wants to buy Marc Rich Investments owned by the eponymous billionaire who fled to Switzerland almost years ago after being indicted on charges of wire fraud racketeering and income tax evasion Many industry insiders have speculated that Rich is ready to once again cash out of the market particularly after his pardon last month by Bill Clinton Having already developed two successful commodity trading companies the first one he sold years ago and is now Glencore International AG a powerhouse in the market the yearold Rich could be winding down industry sources say They note that his company has been in play for some time as talks with Lucernebased commodities trader Trafigura were said to have fallen through last year CROWN GAINS METALS FOOTHOLD As Rich appears set to ease out of the market Crown is storming in snapping up entire trading teams and anxious for a move into metals trade Our policy is not to comment on any type of discussion on acquisition I can only say we are a growing organisation said a spokesman for Crown Resources in London We are currently focused on energy trading We would like to diversify into other commodities as well including ferrous and nonferrous metals Theres no sense of urgency for us and it all depends on the right opportunities Once a member of the powerful triumverate that dominated the physical metals market together with Enron and Glencore Marc Richs metals operations have waned in recent years Following the closure of its ferroalloys trading unit the companys metals trading operations are now said to be about one third of the size of those of its leading rivals I think Marc Rich are fairly thin on the ground in metals now said one UK trader Last years Trafigura rumours coincided with a flurry of resignations from the companys metals trading staff But compared to the giant stature of the market leaders Marc Rich is one of the few bitesize acquisitions that could propel Crown into the midst of the metals trade business Crown would also gain access to Marc Richs wellregarded name in the industry and the companys contacts including close relationships in the Mediterranean crude oil market and recently developed ties in the realm of African oil products For a Russian company this gives them a big in on the West said one industry insider Crown now focuses largely on marketing some two million tonnes a month of crude from Tyumen Oil part owned by Alfa Group

Robusta coffee futures traded in London fell to another fresh year low Friday as the glut of coffee on world markets continued to weigh on the market And the market is set to continue even lower short term barring a frost in Brazil as further supplies come onto the market traders and analysts said The whole market is consumed with coffee wherever you look it is there a Liffe coffee broker said Were in a downward spiral and theres nothing out there to stop us going lower still said another broker Despite hovering above record low prices for some time producers arent being deterred from producing or selling And as the coffee continues to trickle onto the market the gradual erosion in prices is set to continue with a metric ton a possible target The benchmark September robusta coffee contract on Liffe ended at ton Friday having set a new low of ton Technically the market is oversold but such considerations appear to have little impact in the face of overwhelming supply of robusta coffee For this reason the chances of a meaningful recovery are slight and the talk of ton or ton on September becomes even louder one brokerage said in its daily report Apart from the fall in the level of the Brazilian real Liffe coffee is under pressure from constant origin selling with India Uganda Vietnam and India all noted current sellers and the lack of any frost in Brazilian coffee growing regions And Brazils coffee belt is seen safe from any crop damaging frost at least until July according to Sao Paulo weather forecasters Somar Meteorologia Temperatures may cool again from July but were not calling for any frost risk yet said one Somar meteorologist Friday Brazils frost season lasts into August but as time ticks by the risk of crop damage recedes traders said The Brazilian reals recent fall has been a major part of the recent falls on Liffe coffee traders said encouraging producers to sell onto dollardenominated markets Brazil is reported to have around million million bags of robusta coffee to sell they said And the outlook for robusta coffee prices is no better long term traders and analysts said Some analysts had predicted that the low prices would cause producers to cut back or to move out of coffee production but with the vast increase in Vietnamese production in the past years little impact is expected if there are any cut backs said others There are plans to remove less productive trees in Vietnam but this is likely to be offset by younger trees in more productive areas reaching maturity said one analyst In the long term participants believe the low prices will see producers being less able to add inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides which may help to stabilize production but this is unlikely to cause the dramatic shift in supplies that is needed to lift world prices LME Copper Hits TwoYear Low As Stocks Surge Elsewhere London Metal Exchange copper fell to a fresh twoyear low Friday as early weakness was compounded by another steep

Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire Convincing foreign investors that his country is a good place to do business is a tough sell But Delhis finance minister insists that despite a few highprofile setbacks his country offers the worlds best returns Indian finance minister Yashwant Sinha has had a rollercoaster year In February he delighted foreign investors with a reformist probusiness budget But days later confidence was rocked by a stock market crash and insider trading scandal Then New Delhis first major privatization of the BALCO aluminum plant sparked a crippling twomonth strike by workers Worse Indias biggest and once most trumpeted foreign investment Enron Corps billion Dabhol power project remains at a standstill following claims the Maharashtra state government defaulted on payments A USled billion power project near Madras is stalled over financing Recently during a road show to Hong Kong and Singapore Sinha spoke with Executive Editor Richard Hornik Managing Editor Zoher F Abdoolcarim and Senior Editor Cesar Bacani Extracts from their conversation Can India really compete for investment We have completely opened up the Indian market I know that China and other countries have been receiving large foreign direct investments but lets not forget that they started much earlier on the reform path The problem is one of perception We have the challenging task of explaining the new India to the world Dont you also have the task of explaining it to the Indian people Isnt there a resentment of foreign companies left over from the colonial era Every government has pursued the same reform path including welcoming foreign direct investment There has also been a very marked change from what you referred to as the colonial past The increasing realization is that it is not Western multinationals that are causing problems It is competition from other developing countries There seems to be disquiet among investors though about highprofile cases such as Enron and BALC BALCO had nothing to do with foreign investment It was a government company and we decided to sell along with management control There was some resistance but fortunately that has been resolved In the case of Enron I have clearly sent out a message to both the Maharashtra government and Enron that they had to sit down in the spirit of constructive cooperation and find a solution Lets not interpret a commercial dispute involving one company as being a major disincentive for foreign investment What are you doing to increase governance in the financial world I have told Parliament three things That we shall adopt international best practices so that the scope of mischief is reduced further that we must strengthen the market regulator and that we want to corporatize the stock exchanges which are run by the brokers so there can be no conflict of interest In India can what is manufactured by foreignowned firms be sold locally Absolutely And because of its sheer size Indias middle class of million consumers is almost like a middlesized developed country In terms of purchasing power parity India is considered to be the worlds third largest economy Another advantage for investors is that we have a judicial system that does justice to Indians and foreigners alike But its slow very slow When you say slow there are courts of appeal from primary courts to the High Court to the Supreme Court You cant do away with this You cant compare it with autocratic regimes where justice can be swift but at times misguided How is the privatization program faring In the case of Air India we decided wed retain would go to employees another would go to the market and would be made available to strategic buyers Only would go to foreign partners Similarly we have taken a decision to disinvest telco VSNL We will privatize the domestic airline Indian Airlines the largest automobile manufacturer Maruti and hotels owned by the Tourism Development Corp What are your main frustrations Foreign investors have all kinds of perceptions that India is not worth doing business with but studies by independent consultants AT Kearney and the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry show foreign direct investors have made more profits in India than anywhere else in the world and most are bullish about the future Now this is something that is not known India Dabhol delay RCF turns to BG Business Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire BANGALORE July FACED with delays in gas availability from Enrons Dabhol regassification plant the public sector Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers Ltd RCF has turned to British Gas BG for supply of liquefied natural gas LNG to meet its feed stock requirements Speaking to reporters here today the RCF Chairman and Managing Director Mr DK Verma said that RCFs requirement of LNG was about million tonnes per annum As per the agreement with Enron the LNG supply was expected to have begun from Dabhol to its Thal plant in Maharashtra Enrons requirement for power generation was only about million tonnes and the remaining was expected to be sold to third parties which included RCF However he said these supplies were faced with uncertainty in view of the standoff between the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and Enron Asked if this would lead to a termination of the agreement with Enron he said We still need LNG When supply from Dabhol is available we will pick it up In addition to this supply BG was also expected to supply another million from Gujarat to the Trombay plant of RCF This requirement was in view of the capacity expansion that has been proposed for the urea plant The capacity of the urea plant is to be raised to million tonnes from the current level of million tonnes This expansion is expected to cost at least Rs crore of which Rs crore would be funded from RCFs cash reserves The debt component is expected to be raised from ICICI We are a zerodebt company now and can afford to have a little debt on our balance sheet he said The company he said was also preparing to expand its DAP diammonium phosphate capacity in Rajasthan at a cost of Rs crore This fourlakh tonne per annum plant was being set up with per cent equity support each from Hindustan Zinc Ltd and Rajasthan Mines and Minerals Corporation Ltd The remaining per cent would be entirely held by RCF itself he added Mr Verma indicated that a final decision on the expansion of the urea plant would be taken by the companys board only after the interim fertiliser policy was announced by the Centre This policy is expected to provide for a pricing policy and prepare the industry for complete dismantling of the retention pricing mechanism He said that the industry was also looking forward to supplies of LNG from Iran Supply of gas through the pipeline route via Pakistan would be more costeffective than the submarine pipeline proposed Our Bureau Reduce government debt by Rs crore ET Interview Shalini Singh The Economic Times Copyright C The Economic Times Source World Reporter TM FOR an organisation that has done its best to boost sentiment by repeatedly announcing that it expects the economy to grow by to per cent this year the Confederation of Indian Industries finds the current official projections of per cent way down at the lower end of their own forecast I believe our projections were realistic considering that on the economic front all the macrofundamentals are in place The policies are in place It is just that the implementation of these policies is not happening And that is the only reason for a lower growth rate than was envisaged by industry No There is no way that can happen On the other hand with some hard decisions we could still move closer to a growth of per cent The most radical would be a dramatic reduction in government debt by Rs crore right away We need to examine what we need to do to achieve this level of reduction and the whole country needs to cooperate in the effort The whole nation needs to rally around the FM if he makes these moves We need to move ahead on disinvestment on reduction in expenditure What we are additionally prescribing is that issues and policies which have been committed should be implemented Implementation is going to be the key to success The CII is preparing to submit over the next fortnight a list of projects in housing power roads railways and civil aviation to the government to be monitored on a weekly basis to stimulate growth Growth can also be stimulated by increased government spending on creating world class capitals for the three new states Uttaranchal Jharkhand and Chhatisgarh With an expenditure of just Rs crore the government can stimulate demand in cement power roads and infrastructure The funds are there It is just that there is no thought or planning in this direction yet The third thing that we are prescribing is that interest rates must come down I disagree with the RBIs stand on interest rates Like in the US we too must respond quickly and proactively to the slowdown Fourthly we have an overvalued exchange rate and we believe it is time we moved to a realistic exchange rate We are just about to see the first effects of an overvalued rupee on the growth rate of exports and we need to arrest this declining rate of export growth On the contrary there is recognition and respect for the government that despite a global slowdown India is still the second fastest growing economy after China Any disappointment that is voiced is actually in the spirit of moving to better performance rather than a critique of the establishment I truly believe we are today at the threshold of a unique opportunity Different countries the US EU Malaysia and so on want to engage in trade with India in a manner that nobody has looked at before President Bush and the Bush administration want to engage in a substantial trade relationship with India which is based on mutually beneficial longterm relationships It offers India a unique window There is huge respect for Mr Vajpayee Mr Jaswant Singh and Mr Yashwant Sinha The world is recognising Indias potential Enron is an issue in the minds of the Americans that is stalling investment commitment despite this respect and this must be addressed

Fertilisers Ltd RCF is planning to sign an agreement with British Gas for supply of gas to meet its fleet stock needs RCF chairman and managing director D K Verma told newspersons that the companys requirement of LNG was about million tonne per annum As per its existing agreement with Enron LNG supply should have already began from Dabhol to its Thal plant in Maharashtra Enrons requirement for power generation was only about million tonne and the remaining was to be sold to third parties including RCF The RCF CMD said that these supplies now faced an uncertain future because of the standoff between MSEB and Enron Asked if it would lead to a termination of the agreement with Enron he said We still need LNG If supply is available from Dabhol we will pick it up he said in reaction to a question on whether it would lead to a termination of RCFs agreement with Enron In addition to this supply British Gas is also expected to supply another million tonne to the Trombay plant of RCF This requirement was in view of the capacity expansion that has been proposed for the urea plant of RCF The capacity of the urea plant is to be raised from million tonne from the production level of million tonne This expansion is expected to cost at least Rs crore of which Rs crore would be funded from RCFs cash reserves he said The debt component is expected to be raised from ICICI The company he said was also preparing to expand DAP in Rajasthan for Rs crore This lakh tonne per annum plant was being set up with per cent equity support each from Hindustan Zinc and the Rajasthan Mines and

the retention pricing mechanism Business Economics fuels power solution in California Price relief gains political support Robert Gibbons BridgeNews Chicago Tribune North Sports Final N Copyright by the Chicago Tribune Political pressure coming from the US Congress and politicians from Western states seems to have influenced the approach to the power crisis despite opposition to price caps in the Bush administration The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in June expanded price mitigation measures on wholesale electricity sales in California during periods when blackouts are possible The measures encourage generators to sell power into the state to prevent emergency alerts from being declared which trigger price caps The move came with support growing in Congress especially among representatives of Western states on both sides of the aisle for legislation that would have capped wholesale prices in the region The macroeconomic force may have been the difference between the billion cost of power for California in and its rise to approximately billion in The cost is estimated to reach between billion and billion in With that kind of money at stake suddenly the concern becomes less a question of who is responsible for the problem but rather how it can be solved quickly to prevent harsh political consequences California Atty Gen Bill Lockyer has conducted an investigation into the actions of power generators and offered multimillion dollar rewards to whistleblowers to provide evidence of price manipulation by independent power generators The state is seeking refunds of billion the amount it estimates independent power generators overcharged Californias troubled utilities The US General Accounting Office has released a report criticizing the FERC for not finding evidence of power generators using plant outages to drive up prices in California FERCs February study was not thorough enough to support its overall conclusion that audited companies were not physically withholding electricity supply to influence prices the GAO found Of the major independent power generators and marketers like Reliant Energy Dynegy Duke Energy and Enron only Williams and its CEO Keith Bailey came out in April in favor of some sort of short term price relief for California The political dynamic out there is much more Draconian than what were proposing Bailey told analysts in April defending Williams position supporting some limited shortterm price mitigation What he was worried about was California Gov Gray Davis using eminent domain powers to take

AsianPacific News Dabhol Project Vexes Foreign Firms If Enrons Dispute in India Isnt Resolved Other Investments Could Suffer Regulators and Courts Throw in a New Twist By Daniel Pearl Staff Reporter The Asian Wall Street Journal Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc BOMBAY Once touted as a beacon for attracting foreign investment to India Enron Corps billion Dabhol Power Co project has turned into a nuisance for some foreign companies doing business in the country Behind the scenes some of them are now maneuvering to help resolve a dispute between Dabhol and the Indian state of Maharashtra that is at the core of the projects problems The largestever foreign investment in India Dabhol is mired in conflict Maharashtra Dabhols only customer has stopped purchasing power from the megawatt project saying its rates are too high Work has stopped on a nearly completed second phase of the project slated to generate megawatts Enron which controls of the project has tried unsuccessfully to scale back its stake and may be looking to exit entirely In an effort to get the electricity project back on track some of the projects foreign lenders including ABN Amro Bank of America Corp and Credit Suisse First Boston sent representatives to a recent meeting here with Maharashtras electricity board Dabhols difficulties are making lenders wary about funding other power projects in the country and could make states bolder about seeking new contract terms That has left other power companies increasingly nervous about Dabhol Some have signaled they could be interested in taking over the project if its contract problems can be settled Dabhol participants still arent sure if the interest is sincere or is an attempt by the other companies to prevent collateral damage to their own projects Indias Reliance Industries Ltd which in partnership with Southern Co of Atlanta is hoping to build a big plant in eastern India doesnt deny media speculation that it is interested in Dabhol Nor does Arlington Virginiabased AES Corp whose generating company has had disputes with Indias Orissa state Prakash Daryani managing director for Houstonbased El Paso Corps Indian power unit says that if the Dabhol contract isnt resolved in a way that makes both the utility and Maharashtra happy it will have an adverse impact on other investments and El Paso will not be an exception He denies reports that El Paso which helped build a megawatt plant in Southern India has expressed interest in buying Dabhol but adds We are keeping our eyes and ears open Some companies may be doing more than that Patrick Sonti a New Delhibased energy consultant said he had helped draft a plan outlining a way out of the Dabhol impasse with price concessions on both sides and financial separation of Enrons liquefiednatural gas terminal from the power plant Mr Sonti says he studied Dabhol for a client whose name he cant disclose Mr Sonti also chairs an American Chamber of Commerce committee on energy and he acknowledges discussing his Dabhol plan with some of the panels members He says the Chamber wouldnt intervene unless asked by Enron Last time the project ran into trouble with the state Enron executives saved it through an intensive lobbying campaign aided by American officials Next week the companys chairman Kenneth Lay is expected to fly to India though Enron wont comment on whom he intends to visit Even though Enron and Maharashtra officials have met regularly their dispute has fallen into a slowmotion stalemate with Enron saying it hasnt agreed to renegotiate the contract and the state insisting it has already rescinded the contract Despite warnings that construction delays will increase the projects cost by up to million Vinay Bansal chairman of the electricity board said Monday that getting the projects second phase running is not a priority for us since the state cant afford the power The Dabhol contract requires the state to pay for most of the plants generating capacity regardless of how much power it consumes Maharashtras consumption has been far below projections Mr Bansal wants Indias central government to help buy excess power from Dabhol but they keep saying no Other states would be willing to buy power if the rates could be lowered to rupees cents a unit but thats still well below Dabhol officials most optimistic projection Meanwhile Indias regulators and courts are throwing in new twists The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission set up as an independent body to regulate electricity rates is seeking jurisdiction over the Dabhol dispute even though the commission was created after the Dabhol contract was signed Enron wants an arbitration panel to decide instead A Bombay judge issued a ruling last week that is likely to send the jurisdiction battle to Indias Supreme Court If Enron loses that battle it is likely to lose more time Well make the process totally transparent the chairman of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission P Subramanyam promised in an interview earlier this year But if Dabhol construction doesnt resume by summers end Enrons suppliers of liquefied natural gas are likely to get nervous Dabhol has year contracts requiring it to buy liquefied natural gas from Abu Dhabi and Oman starting next year As for the lenders Indian banks have more to lose than foreign banks if Dabhol starved of revenue continues to miss payments That is because much of the foreign debt is guaranteed by the Indian banks led by statecontrolled Industrial Development Bank of India For the projects second phase foreign debt totals nearly billion and domestic debt about million Lenders havent yet agreed to inject more funds to allow construction to resume I dont think there is any division among lenders at the moment as to what should be done says an international lender involved in the talks But this is not an easy workout having so many parties involved in so many parts of the world Enron

Contracts Update New York Davis Appeals Order to Release Calif Power Contracts Update Adds details on filing of governors appeal San Diego July Bloomberg California Governor Gray Davis has appealed a state judges order to release records of how much the state spent purchasing power on the spot market San Diego Superior Court Judge Linda Quinn ruled last week that the governor had to produce spot market invoices purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power supply contracts signed from January through June Quinn directed Davis to produce the documents by July but she temporarily suspended her order today to allow a state appeals court to consider the governors appeal which was filed Tuesday Several media organizations and Republican state legislators sued in March under Californias public records law to obtain the contracts arguing that the state used billions in taxpayer money to buy power Theres an obvious and manifest public interest in disclosure of these contracts said Alonzo Wickers a lawyer representing the media companies at a hearing last week Davis countered that disclosure would hurt the states bargaining position with generators and force it to pay higher prices Media companies had also sought disclosure of uncensored longterm contracts to buy billion in electricity State Controller Kathleen Connell released those contracts on Monday Connell a fellow Democrat has criticized the governor for keeping the contracts secret She also released terms of consulting contracts the state made with investment advisers and energy traders Power Purchases The state has spent about billion buying electricity for three investorowned utilities The states Department of Water Resources now buys about onethird of the power used by the states two largest utilities PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric and Edison Internationals Southern California Edison Pacific Gas declared bankruptcy in April Legislators and consumer groups have criticized Davis saying the

ANALYSISWhere have all the LME volumes gone By Martin Hayes Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON July Reuters Years of rising business on the London Metal Exchange LME could be over after volume dropped in the first half of and many in the worlds largest industrial metals market say the growth may never be recaptured Senior traders cite several factors behind the percent decline in business in the first six months prices are depressed rival electronic systems have sprung up global economies are weak The problem is the general conditions that are prevailing at the moment we are seeing recessionary signs that are dampening the market It is cyclical and that is the worry because the cycle is lasting some time one said Since volumes have risen from million lots to s record million There have previously been troughs in the business and price cycle but these did not markedly affect volumes the decline was some lots So the concern now is that this downturn is different That lower volume is horrible Some business is undoubtedly going off the market but a lot of people are not making proprietary positions anymore they are not making any money a director at an LME associate broker said It is going to get a lot worse it is a bleak picture at the moment for next year A lot of people will have to ask Is it worth being in the business a manager at another broker said The LME said this week that total futures and options turnover during JanJune fell to million lots down from JanJune when volume rose percent to million Traded options turnover has virtually halved falling to million lots from million LME data showed that this halfyear was still the third highest on record only tailing by lots thisclearly illustrates the continuing health of the LME and the essential part it plays as a hedging medium to the global metal market despite the current economic environment the LME said on Thursday SWITCHED ON SCREENS BLUR THE PICTURE The major factor that emerged last year is electronic trading either webbased or specific screenbased platforms Competitors such as Enron Online and Spectron Metals have grabbed business while the LME has also sanctioned and launched its own system LME Select Many of these trade LME contracts so the turnovers are still being incorporated into the Exchanges volumes But the ethos of screentrading has implications for broker costs and revenues You are seeing more business going towards the screens and some platforms will offer a lessregulated OTC overthecounter market the manager said LME ringdealers and associate brokers now face even lower commissions Costs will fall when screens offer straightthrough processing embracing backoffice functions such as matching In an electronic market the cost of serving a client drops dramatically and if a customer has direct access to the market which could happen he gets direct control he said In Londons soft commodity markets which migrated away from trading floors to screens in commissions have fallen sharply he noted For the moment the LME retains a traditional openoutcry floor it and Londons International Petroleum Exchange IPE are the last bastions of this form of trading Business is also transacted in offices over telephones But this is also changing with the advent of screens In some ways the screens whoever they belong to may be the problem a senior trader said In the old days you used to talk to people more get a feel for the market and take a punt Not so much now the big boys still chat but not as much and with the screens it is almost a matched bargain situation he said METAL INDUSTRY SHYING AWAY The malaise affecting prices is not helping especially as there is little incentive for consumers to buy while a falling market always sees less speculative activity Most of this year has seen prices progressively weaker with copper at its lowest since July zinc and tin at levels last seen nearly eight years ago lead at a month lowpoint and nickel and aluminium at twomonth lows Although prices have been softer there have been occasions when tightness has prevailed When the market moves from contango when nearby prices are cheaper than forward into backwardation which is the opposite hedging dries up Although the LME derives much of its liquidity from speculators the bulk of its trade comes from the metals industry hedging and price protection There is routine hedging taking place but what one would call the strategic positioning is just not happening at the moment the manager said MARKET CONTRACTION LIKELY If volumes continue to fall and there is the pressure on commissions then further contraction and consolidation in the market appears likely There are now only ringdealing members of the LME those who alone are entitled to trade on the openoutcry floor down from nearly in the mids There is too much capacity in the market even now and these ongoing rumours do not help For months one RDM has supposedly been taking over another It is about time they got on with it the senior trader said A base metal trading operation may eventually come down to a few people sitting at the end of a treasury desk the associate broker director said USA UPDATE New Power adds customers with two deals Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW YORK July Reuters New Power Co a national energy provider partly

Lower Rating If Deficits Grow SP Says Update Adds ministers comment starting in th paragraph New York July Bloomberg India must cap its federal and state government budget deficits or risk having its credit rating lowered a Standard Poors analyst said Indias BB rating which is two notches below investment grade may be cut if the combined deficits widen to more than percent of gross domestic product from nine percent now Joydeep Mukherji SPs associate director and India analyst said in an interview We continue to watch the fiscal problem very closely as that is the most vulnerable area that could lead to a negative rating action Mukherji said The warning comes as the government plans to increase spending to bolster a slowing economy A lower rating would raise the cost of borrowing for the government and Indian companies already among the highest in Asia Indias benchmark year bond yield is percent higher than percent for comparable Chinese bonds and percent for South Korean bonds both of which have an investment grade rating SP lowered the outlook on Indias rating to stable from positive in October The agency cited Indias failure to meet deadlines for sales of stateowned companies The rating is among the lowest in the region Last week an analyst for Moodys Investors Service said India must step up sales of state assets and trim its budget deficit to avoid a reduction in the outlook on its debt Moodys Ba rating also two notches below investment grade has a positive outlook meaning it may be raised Growing Debt Fitch cut Indias longterm sovereign rating outlook to negative from stable on May Fitch which rates India BB one notch below investment grade cited concerns about fiscal policy privatization and a deterioration in the investment climate Any downward change in the countrys rating or outlook will adversely impact investments in India said Kalpana Morparia executive director of lender ICICI Ltd which borrowed about million in international markets last year Years of budget deficits have saddled India with trillion rupees billion of debt equal to about percent of GDP Servicing the debt leaves little money to invest in schools hospitals or other projects that could improve the wellbeing of Indians and raise the rate of economic growth in the worlds second mostpopulous country Slowdown The economy expanded percent in the quarter ended March from a year earlier down from percent growth the previous quarter and the slowest pace in nearly three years as a twoyear drought pruned rural incomes In response Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said last week he would step up government spending to stimulate the economy Lower growth may mean lower tax revenue and increased pressure on governments to raise spending that could enlarge the combined deficits of the central and state governments beyond percent of GDP this year potentially weakening the rating Mukherji said Investors too are getting concerned with the governments profligacy In the first two months of the fiscal year the central governments budget deficit has reached a quarter of the target for the year as a whole The growing deficit bothers me said Bharat Shah who manages billion rupees at Birla Sun Life Asset Management in Mumbai Theres a need for a sharp reduction in expenditure that will call for political consensus which I dont think is in place Without pruning deficits the government cant hope to lower interest rates Higher interest rates in India damp the governments plan of attracting more foreign companies to set up businesses locally Overseas Investment The most important thing to do is to get more foreign direct investment which is the mother of all solutions Shah said Last year India managed to attract billion in foreign investment a tenth of what China took in Indias program to sell state assets reduce tariffs and otherwise free the economy from government interference hasnt moved as fast as expected Mukherji said India has had about years worth of economic reforms spread out over the last years he said For example the government said it planned to raise billion rupees by selling stakes in more than staterun companies in the fiscal year that began April So far this year it hasnt sold a single stake Privatization Privatization minister Arun Shourie said delays in selling stakes in companies such as national carrier Air India Ltd and staterun hotel chain India Tourism Development Corp were not unusual and investors need to be patient We are proceeding methodically Shourie told reporters at a news conference late last night Have faith in the process SP isnt convinced If the governments economic program fails to gather speed the country may slip to its pres growth rate of percent a year from an average of more than percent in the s Mukherji said The dispute between the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and Enron Corp the countrys biggest foreign investor which has set up a billion power plant is a longterm disaster and a bad loud and clear signal to potential foreign investors Mukherji said The state electricity board has refused to pay billion rupees for power supplied by Enrons local unit Dabhol Power Co India hasnt delivered on guarantees to pay for the power The dispute is widely seen as a litmus test for foreign investment in India The Indian private sector is used to bad politics and failed economic policies such as energy reforms but the foreign private sector is not Mukherji said Gautam Chakravorthy in the Mumbai newsroom or at with reporting by Anindya Mukherjee Abhay Singh and Arijit Ghosh in New

Scandinavian markets are lucrative although comparably small because their percapita power usage is three to five times higher than in the rest of Europe Flegel said This is partly due to ample supply

Financial Post TransAlta sells power unit M deal Final step in retreat from regulated electricity industry Carol Howes Financial Post with files from The Canadian Press National Post National C Front c National Post All Rights Reserved CALGARY TransAlta Corp has struck an million deal to sell its power transmission business to a consortium of companies led by SNCLavalin Inc and the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board The sale is the final step in TransAltas program to divest about billion in assets during the past two years as it retreated from the regulated power industry and focused on electrical generation and marketing It was challenging said Steve Snyder TransAltas president and chief executive yesterday This is it in terms of the core restructuring TransAlta expects to realize earnings from the sale of about million or cents per share which will be put toward the expansion of power generation plants in Canada and Mexico The Calgarybased electric company has plans to spend up to billion a year over the next five years to bulk up on its power generation nearly doubling its megawatts of capacity Mr Snyder said TransAlta will focus on ensuring its generation assets meet its target of a return on equity If they dont those assets could also come under review he said The sale comes as Enron Corp the biggest energy trader in North America has begun selling electricity and natural gas to consumers in Alberta The electricity industry opened to competition on Jan The move prompted ATCO Ltd to follow TransAlta and put its retail electricity and gas units up for sale The consortium buying the transmission assets known as AltaLink sees the potential to expand the system both inside and outside Alberta said Mr Snyder The group also includes TransElect Inc a new USbased independent power transmission company that is keen to add additional transmission capacity to the North American power grid and Macquarie North America Ltd an Australianowned investment bank Mr Snyder said TransAltas transmission assets attracted interest from US and international firms but he was always hopeful a Canadian buyer could be found Under the agreement the teachers pension fund will assume all the transmission businesss debt Infrastructure investments are attractive to us because they will give us stable real return said Ontario Teachers Pension Plan spokeswoman Lee Fullerton Theyre fairly lowvolatility because theyre regulated by government so they give us a very stable cash flow and theyre linked to inflation Teachers pensions are also indexed to inflation and this made the investment the pension plans first large infrastructure deal attractive Ms Fullerton said This acquisition is a milestone occasion for SNCLavalin since it is an important investment in Alberta said Pierre Anctil an executive vicepresident at the Montreal company By combining the strengths of the TransAlta team with our considerable financial and technical expertise we are wellplaced to deliver topquality transmission services to Albertans and meet current and future needs Mr Snyder said in May at the companys annual meeting that it was looking to sell its heavily regulated transmission business which accounts for about half of Albertas power grid and of the companys assets It has employees The company owns and operates more than kilometres of highvoltage lines in southern Alberta Under the deal SNC will own of the equity the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board about and Macquarie North America about TransElect will be brought in to operate the transmission lines and will own of the equity Karen Taylor an analyst at BMO Nesbitt Burns in Toronto said the value of the assets was in line with what analysts expected It is at present time a relatively lowreturn stable business she said Nick Majendie a Vancouver analyst with Canaccord Capital Corp said TransAlta has done a good job executing its plan to restructure and expects the latest sale to be well received by investors TransAlta started down the road to becoming a pure play when it sold its retail electricity business and local power lines to Kansas Citybased Utilicorp United Inc for million UtiliCorp subsequently sold the retail electricity business to Edmontons municipally owned Epcor Utilities Inc for million SNCLavalin is one of the worlds biggest engineering and construction companies with offices in countries The Montrealbased company also owns partly owns or manages infrastructure ranging from the toll highway north of Toronto to other projects The Ontario Teachers

CARIBBEAN Brazil plans for emergency energy supply By RAYMOND COLITT and GEOFF DYER Financial Times c Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved But the government will still face a delicate decision over when to suspend rationing and lifting restrictions early could backfire Geoff Dyer and Raymond Colitt report Brazil plans to have an emergency supply of around MW of energy in place by April next year from sources such as crushed sugar cane to reduce the risk of a new round of rationing next year according to energy officials The spectre of widespread blackouts has faded amid strong public response to the enforced rationing measures introduced last month by the government But attention is now turning to medium and longterm solutions to the energy crisis Pedro Parente the minister charged with resolving the energy crisis said the extra power would be in addition to around MW of new gasfired capacity expected to be online by next year and would reduce the pressure on the energy system if another drought occurred over the summer months Rationing next year cannot be completely ruled out but we are working to limit the risk as much as possible Mr Parente said in an interview Having seen its approval ratings plummet because of the energy crisis the government is desperate to avoid another round of rationing this time next year which would fall during the presidential election campaign The emergency supply measures will supplement the longerterm energy strategy to be outlined today by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso which will lean heavily on a rapid expansion in gasfired power stations Mr Parente said that by there would be sufficient new capacity in place so there would be no need for rationing by then The extra energy supply for next year will include alternative energy sources such as generators fuelled by crushed sugar cane and wind power Full details of the programme would be ready by early August he said Even with these measures and the new gas power stations however the outlook for next year will still hinge on the level of rainfall during the wet summer months from October to March Around per cent of Brazils energy comes from hydroelectric plants that are powered by water from reservoirs During the last summer rainfall was per cent of its historic average a level of rain that has been exceeded in all but of the last years The northeast the worst affected area had only received such little rain in three of the last years According to initial estimates Mr Parente said that with the expected increase in supply from gasfired plants there would probably be no need for rationing next year if rainfall reached per cent its historic average over the summer If rainfall was below that figure then the emergency supply measures would limit the extent of a new rationing programme Questions remain however over how many new gasfired plants will be in place by next year El Paso and Enron the US power companies could put a total of MW on line by but say they are waiting to find out more about the regulations they will face Regardless some experts say the need for compulsory rationing next year could be reduced as companies and consumers discover the potential for permanent energy savings thereby limiting the rebound in demand if restrictions are lifted But even if the government brings on the necessary new capacity and rainfall does not disappoint it will still face a delicate decision over when to suspend rationing Lifting restrictions prematurely could backfire politically and technically says Mauricio Tolmasquim

TALKING STOCKS And the person were speaking with is Michael Carty of New Millennium advisors You can call or email your question The phone number is fnet The email address is KATAYAMA And our first caller not fist caller but towards the end of our show our caller is for this segment the first caller That honor goes to Roseanne in New York Hi Roseanne MORRIS New Mexico I think KATAYAMA Oh in New Mexico thats right CALLER Good afternoon I would appreciate your near and long term comments on Enron URL CARTY OK Now see Enron is a classic example of what Ive been discussing Enron is a wonderful company its well diversified primarily in natural gas area and its a very well managed company Its high diversified geographically here in the United States and its a company that should benefit enormously by any improvement in the energy policy here in the United States And look at where that price is I mean were talking about the market giving that stock away at this point KATAYAMA Plus Enron had been in that deal with if I remember correctly Blockbuster URL to deliver video through its lines and that deal fell apart CARTY Thats right But it really didnt need it because quite frankly this is a diversified energy company that will benefit through any improvement in energy policy in this country any improvement MORRIS We have a caller from Louisiana joining us now Jim hi Whats your question CALLER Yes My question is pertaining to alternative energy and particularly fuel sale and if youre not real hot on that you might give us a couple of picks concerning any of the drillers or oil services Thank you CARTY OK First off I like the idea of alternative energy I came into this industry in out of school and that was a brutal time when we had our oil embargo and our energy crisis and alternative energy was a very big option at the time You could do it through win You could do it through sales I liked the idea of doing it through sales but remember plaices like Florida have about as much rain fall as Pennsylvania and therefor they have a lot of cloudy days and you could only use sales effectively in those states where you have an awful lot of sun such as the southwest So there are only of limited use So I think that our the true measure of our progress in coming up with an energy solution is ultimately to go that way but over the short term to do some drilling and those two cases I like KaraMagee ph and then Adorical ph Petroleum Theyre both well placed They both work in drilling area and I think that at these prices theyre this is a good entry point KATAYAMA Mike our guest in the last hour Jim Waggoner touched upon this stock as one of his favorites the storage stock EMC URL We have an email and our emailer wants to know your view on this stock CARTY As a matter of fact when Jim was here and was talking he was basically talking about the stocks that I love EMC despite he look of that chart is one of them EMC is very very big on storage technology In fact years ago it was probably one of the least sophisticated in that industry and it rapidly overcame storage tech and certainly IBM URL to the point where they had all of these installations They put them in they were replacing their own they were rebuilding equipment computers putting their equipment in substituting it for IBMs They have a lot of installations Theyre technology In doing that their technology grew and grew and grew and they finally became one of the most sophisticated and certainly the best placed in the industry and at these prices as soon as the market you know as the market turns around this is a stock thats really going to move MORRIS We have another caller Jeff from Illinois thanks for joining us Whats your question CALLER Good afternoon I wanted to know Mikes comments on Walgreen URL on the short and long term Thank you CARTY Wallgreen is first of all I always shop there I love the place And you know if I were going to listen to most analysts and portfolio managers they say if you like the place then you really should be investing in it It happens to be a reasonably well run company Its good in terms of consumer staples I mean theyll probably give despite the fact that it has dropped in price recently it will probably give you a much more stable investment than others and as a consequence if I were holding it Id continue to hold it If it drops any more Ill certainly consider buying it KATAYAMA And weve got an email question about Compaq URL the PC company as well as the storage company as well as the server manufacturer CARTY I know Were holding Compaq but Compaq is a very very difficult thing to love because of its performance as you see on the chart Also Compaq is kind of interesting because Dell sells directly to or sells desk tops directly to the investor the user the ultimate user Gateway URL was doing the same thing until now Gateway has stared to pen these retail stores so that people could go in and demonstrate the system Coimpaq of course was the leader in desk top sales simply because it was able to go into places like CompUSA and they had a massive distribution network Well the users have become much more sophisticated Now they like to go to places like Dell They like to go to places like Gateway As a consequence Compaq has suffered somewhat Also with respect to the servers its only now that its starting to look reasonably good in servers But if I wanted to do a server play you know instead of Cisco Id do Dell because Dell equipment is very good Dell makes a very good server So while I would continue to hold Compaq because I believe it does represent a significant portion of the industry I dont think that its something that I would just represent that sector with that one stock MORRIS Michael thank you so much for spending part of your th of July with us You handled a lot of calls and emails too CARTY Its been a pleasure MORRIS OK And the word is just be cautious Dont rush into the

government agency became less attractive after recent declines in London metal prices traders said on Wednesday It might be the first time since the begining of this year that imported aluminium prices appear to be lower than those of the government stock sales said a trader with a leading trading house in Seoul This would drive domestic endusers to seek more imported metal held by trading

Indian lenders to the Enronprmoted Dabhol Power Company are looking at the prospects of splitting the assets of the company before sale While some generation companies including the US major AES and two others have approached Indian lenders for taking over the operations of the generation unit talks have also been initiated for taking over the liquefied natural gas LNG terminal of the DPC separately Some companies have sent feelers for taking over the LNG terminal in Ratnagiri a top executive with an Indian lender told Business Standard He however refused to divulge the companies names Indian lenders are apparently of the view that splitting the DPC assets will help in reduction of tariffs and the cost of taking over the company sources say The assets include the LNG terminal with a capacity of five million tonne per annum MTPA The construction of the terminal is nearly per cent complete Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI chairman S K Chakraborti had said here yesterday that this route will be considered only if talks with Enron to continue with the project fail to fructify The DPC was to shift to LNG fuel instead of naphtha being used at present from June The shift to LNG will considerably reduce power generation cost from the project Of the LNG projects total capacity about MTPA is to be used for electricity generation by the Dabhol Power Company and the remaining MTPA is to be sold commercially But as the entire cost of the LNG facility has been factored into the PPA for the Dabhol project this has pushed up the cost of power generation As LNG is fast emerging as a preferred fuel due to low cost and easy transferability there will be a lot of interest in the project sources said The Madhav Godbole committee which recommended renegotiation of tariffs has said that the Dabhol Power Company should renegotiate its LNG contract and set up a separate facility for LNG fuel which will help in reduction of costs As part of the Dabhol Power Companys financial restructuring the committee has suggested an increase in the maturity profile of its debt from five to years with a fiveyear moratorium It has also suggested an indicative interest

will be between the construction and engineering firm and the Houston Area Water Corp known as the Hawk a citizen board appointed by the mayor The contract provides years to build the milliongallon aday plant that will treat raw lake water Montgomery Watson could also be required to construct a plant expansion The city of Houston is the initial customer for the water and would repay the Hawk the cost of treating the water The city hopes that the plant will eventually provide water to other area entities as well This plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could cost about billion to implement Councilmen Bruce Tatro and Chris Bell voted against the agreement after an unsuccessful attempt to delay the vote Tatro said he objected to the plan to issue debt to build the plant when it would be cheaper in the long run to pay cash for the first three years of the project Councilman John Castillo disagreed saying the point in issuing debt is to ensure that todays taxpayers are not paying for tomorrows water consumption Bell said the decision about awarding the contract should have been made by council not the Hawk The administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery Watsons chief competitor Azurix Corp an arm of local energy giant Enron Corp Three recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix Hawk board members said what mattered were Montgomery Watsons lower prices and that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America the body that would oversee the plant But Tuesday council also unanimously approved a million contract with Azurix North American Operations and Maintenance Inc to operate the existing Southeast Water Purification Plant for more than five years That contract underwent the normal bidding process whereas the Hawk board was designed to avoid the bidding process and allow the citizenrun corporation to make its own value choice among competitors About six weeks ago political pressure began to ease as City Council looked at what work the Hawk board had done Hawk chairman David Berg said NEWS ExHouston judge to be special counsel Andell to advise education secretary John WILLIAMS Houston Chronicle Political Writer Staff Houston Chronicle STAR Copyright Eric Andell a former Democratic state appellate judge in Houston who lost his reelection bid last year has accepted a position as special counsel to US Education Secretary Rod Paige Paige former Houston school superintendent announced Tuesday that Andell will provide recommendations and guidance on various legal matters The appointment in the Bush administration apparently removes the threat that Andell might mount a Democratic bid next year for Harris County judge Andell said he looks forward to working with Paige I have worked with Paige before on Houston Independent School District matters and I am excited about the opportunity of working with him again Andell said Andell was a juvenile court judge when thenGov Ann Richards appointed him to the st Court of Appeals in Known for broad community involvement Andell has been active in various youth and school issues He has served as chairman of the Texas Juvenile Probation Commission chairman of the Aspiring Youth of Houston and as a member of HISD committees Earlier this year Andell was mentioned as a possible HISD superintendent when Paige resigned to accept the cabinet appointment The HISD job eventually went to longtime district administrator Kaye Stripling Since his defeat for the judgeship Andell has served as a visiting judge He also has performed mediation and arbitration work for the Houston law firm Nathan Sommers Lippman Jacobs Gorman Andell said Tuesday that Paige asked him several months ago to consider the job Since then Andell has received support from a number of prominent local Republicans including former mayoral candidate Rob Mosbacher Enron Corp Chairman Ken Lay and attorney Pat Oxford He brings a good background in the education arena that has been gleaned from his experience on the bench and some good sound judgment said Mosbacher a member of a Greater Houston Partnership committee that deals with HISD issues Many Democrats had hoped Andell would seek the county judge position which has been held by Republicans since Andell said he had considered making a run if incumbent Robert Eckels did not seek a third term Eckels is expected to seek re election It was bandied about and when I discussed it openly and honestly I always said it was if Eckels chose not to run Andell said Despite receiving top endorsements and outspending his Republican opponent last fall Andell lost to former assistant county attorney Terry Jennings by a slim margin Jennings victory left Margaret C Mirabel as the only Democrat among the appellate judges in Houston Andell said he will move to Washington this month hopes to stay in the new position at least through the end of Bushs first four year term and has no political aspirations until then Front Gas rates plunging Dave Mabell Lethbridge Herald Metro All material Copyright c Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc and its licensors All rights reserved Its like a Going Out of Business sale After charging record high rates through the winter the natural gas company serving southern Alberta homes and businesses is cutting its prices up to per cent At the same time Atco Gas continues to look for another company to take over its retail gas business Approval of the companys request for rate reductions from per gigajoule to for most customers was announced Tuesday in Calgary The rate took effect July and is scheduled to remain in effect until next Jan Reduced rates reflect softening prices across most of North America for one of Albertas biggest exports and provincial tax revenue generators Jerome Engler the companys executive vicepresident said the dramatic price drop reflects the way the company buys its gas from Alberta producers Unlike newly arrived competitor Epcor Atco does not hedge its prices by buying forward contracts Customers will quickly get a lower natural gas price because of the methods Atco Gas employs to purchase gas that ensures customers pay the least cost for gas over the long term said Engler The market price for natural gas is sliding down and we can pass these lower costs on to our customers Although Alberta politicians blamed this provinces cost of electricity highest in Canada on last winters soaring natural gas prices theres so far been no sign homeowners and business people will see any dramatic cuts in those bills Atcos lower gas price however will still be marginally above the price offered Lethbridge householders when Epcor began offering term contracts last winter more recent Epcor offerings have been higher than for a one or threeyear term But Atcos rate will remain substantially higher than the cost of gas in southern Alberta just months ago In approving the rate reductions the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board once again ordered lower rates in northern Alberta than in the south vs In a recent board decision that surprised Atco it denied permission to sell the companys large gasfields near Viking southeast of Edmonton which have historically given a price advantage to consumers in the Edmonton area and north At last winters recordhigh prices the board said Atcos surcharges resulted in accumulated surpluses in both northern and southern Alberta The company is expected to repay those amounts by Jan for residential customers who opted not to shoulder the full impact of last winters price shock For larger gas customers using more than gigajoules per year the surcharge and now the repayment was expected to end this Oct For Atco these rate changes could be the last for which the company will apply for permission While retaining its pipeline network through Alberta Atco has announced plans to sell its retail gas business to another company Atco officials said at the end of April theyre looking for a world calibre company to take over service to homes and businesses across the province Because Atco has been a longtime supplier operating under the provinces regulatory authorities they said Atco is restricted from providing the full range of retail offerings Company president Craighton Twa said attracting a bigleague buyer will bring increased choice for the provinces consumers The sale will initiate the final stage for the fully deregulated environment envisioned by the Alberta government he said One of the leading contenders Enron Direct has refused to comment on whether its negotiating to buy the Atco business The American company has meanwhile announced plans to begin offering southern Alberta businesses their choice of contract prices for electricity Engler said Atco is facing further change whether it sells its retail arm or not At a separate series of energy board hearings he said the company was asked to respond to proposals to change how it buys gas on the spot market vs hedging through contracts and how long its prices should run before further review The boards decisions are expected to apply to Atcos successor if it sells We hope to see a sale completed this summer Engler said But whoever the buyer he adds Alberta consumers will still be offered a regulated price as an alternative to signing a fixed contract With Albertas penchant for deregulation however Engler isnt certain how long that option will continue With the lower prices he adds it may take longer before consumers whose bills still show credit balance as a result of the provincial governments subsidies start paying for their gas once again Consumers whod rather receive a cheque in the mail instead of debiting their credit balance Engler said can call Atco and ask for their refund Any comments or questions Contact the writer at Fimat USAs Kilduff Oil Prices OPEC and Stock Picks New York New York July Bloomberg John Kilduff right

Bloomberg Joydeep Mukherji associate director and India analyst for Standard Poors on the chance of a lower rating for the country We had signaled last year that reform was likely to move very slowly if at all and that is what has been happening So far nothing has happened to further lower the rating but we continue to watch the fiscal problem very closely as that is the most vulnerable area that could lead to a negative rating action Lower growth may mean lower tax revenue and increased pressure on governments to raise spending That could enlarge the combined deficits of the central and state governments beyond of GDP this year potentially weakening the rating SP changed the outlook on Indias BB rating to stable from positive in October At the time we said that the change was based on the inability of Indias political leadership cutting across all political parties to implement reform to the public sector in a timely manner The disappointment expressed by many commentators in recent days especially after the bad GDP growth figures were released is consistent with that earlier rating action India said last week that the economy grew percent from a year earlier in the quarter ended March down from percent in the previous quarter and the slowest pace in nearly three years On Indias plans to reduce the states role in the economy India has had about years worth of economic reform spread out over the last years Many wonderful measures are announced sometimes re announced and announced yet again but very little is ever implemented The country may well gradually calibrate its way down to the old Hindu rate of growth with GDP growth having slumped from percent a few years ago to barely percent this year unless it gets its economic act together soon After years of Independence and years of economic reform everyone looks to the rain gods to see if economic growth can pick up once again Can there be a more damning indictment of Indian economic policy failure than this A twoyear drought has depressed growth On the refusal of a state electricity board to pay for power supplied by the Indian unit of Enron Corp The Enron episode has been a bigger longterm disaster for India than most Indians including in the media realize It has sent a bad loud and clear signal to potential foreign investors The Indian private sector is used to bad politics and failed economic policies such as energy reform but the foreign private sector is not Indians compare India today with India in the past and content themselves with the small progress they have made Foreign investors look at things differently On future foreign investments in India India missed the boat on foreign investment in energy and telecommunications two very capital intensive sectors where the country needs lots of investment by foreign and domestic players Foreign firms have all but abandoned the energy sector and are not very interested in the telecom sector Foreign investment will continue to

Business Wire PORTLAND OreBUSINESS WIREMay In an effort to ensure reliability and maximize cost efficiencies six western utilities have been granted preliminary approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to form an independent high voltage electricity transmission company serving six Western states The independent forprofit company called TransConnect will be a member of a planned nonprofit regional transmission organization RTO West The framework for RTO West which will span eight Western states also was approved by FERC Under the proposal approved by FERC TransConnect could initially own or lease the high voltage transmission facilities currently held by Avista Corp Montana Power Company Portland General Electric Puget Sound Energy Nevada Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power Company Combining transmission resources into one independent company may create new opportunities to attract capital and improve the transmission infrastructure Among other things the FERC order approved TransConnects governance structure and found that TransConnect met the Commissions independence requirements The order also determined that TransConnect would qualify to file for innovative and incentive rates Additionally the order finds that the proposed structure for sharing planning and expansion functions is consistent with FERCs basic requirements but reserves final approval pending further clarification by TransConnect and RTO West regarding the details and decision process for such sharing The TransConnect companies are pleased with the FERC order on the TransConnect filing and gratified that the Commission supports a forprofit business model that has the potential to provide very significant benefits said Paul Mohler a representative for the six TransConnect companies There are a number of additional steps that must now be taken by the companies including among other things preparation of a rate filing and various state and federal approvals Ultimately the outcome of TransConnects proposal and the companies decisions to move forward with the formation of this transmission company will depend on the economics and conditions imposed during the regulatory approval process and approval by the individual company boards of directors TransConnect facilities are within the RTO West territory which will operate more than percent of the high

recently when the DPCs board authorized the management to proceed with a preliminary notice of termination the first of three steps that lead to the abandonment of the project Despite the move Rajendra K Pachauri director of the New Delhibased Tata Energy Research Institute said he is optimistic of a resolution Its in everybodys interest to come up with a reasonable settlement I think DPC will accept a renegotiated contract because they are in an impasse right now Pachauri told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Pachauri is also one of the nine members of the committee appointed by the Maharashtra state government to renegotiate the MSEBs controversial power purchase agreement with DPC I do hope that within a month the whole thing can be sorted out DPC wants the negotiations to be short and decisive and if all the parties are willing an agreement wont be difficult he added The project has been mired in financial disputes since its main customer the Maharashtra State

its plant at full capacity and maximize sales Their sales wont be maximized unless the price is attractive They really need to bring down the cost to the consumer Our brief is very clear We have to sit down with them and identify a strategy by which the Dabhol project can be viable for everyone he said This will involve a complete financial engineering of the DPC Youd need to restructure the project debts and bring down the interest rates on debts to the current levels in the market he added The DPC project the largest single foreign investment in India has a debtequity ratio of Pachauri

offerings This investment contributed to the percent increase in operating expenses for the first six months of fiscal to million from million for the same period in fiscal As an extraordinary item ATS expensed percent of the previously accrued expenditures See Extraordinary Items in the Financial Statements related to the Plan of Arrangement with Petroleum Place Inc ATS accrued those charges related to the transaction that would have been accounted for as transaction costs if the merger had been capable of proceeding As the Merger Agreement expired uncompleted a result of financial market conditions that prevented Petroleum Place from effecting a qualified Initial Public Offering events that were clearly out of the control of management effective March ATS has as per Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principals expensed all related Financial CDN Accounting CDN Legal CDN and Managerial Expenses CDN previously accrued This results in a total onetime extraordinary charge of CDN Effective October ATS changed from the deferral method of accounting for income tax to the liability method as pronounced by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants No adjustment was required to the consolidated financial statements for this change in policy RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT Prior to initiating new R D projects ATS investigates the marketplace and strives to have its new product development initiatives endorsed by industry representatives to ensure market viability The majority of ATSs new product R D initiatives are backed by customers either by customer cofunded development projects for example the Horizon project with the Bank of America and the TAAMS project with the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the ongoing maintenance revenue stream and User Group involvement through inkind contributions for example the TEAM project This approach allows ATS to continue to maintain its commitment to the expansion and improvement of its product and service offerings to its existing and new customers with leading edge technology that will have a positive impact on ATSs customers bottom line As part of ATSs growth plan ATS invested million in R D percent of revenues for the first half of fiscal as compared to million percent of gross revenues for the same period in New product R D initiatives include the TEAM product a webbased tracking system for oil and gas well administration which comprised percent of expensed R D for the half Enhancements to the Horizon product a financial accounting system originally created for the Bank of America which will be introduced into the broader petroleum marketplace later this year comprised percent of expensed R D for the half As announced one Texasbased producer has already contracted to have Horizon implemented a positive confirmation of ATSs investment in this highly awaited solution Additionally the Preview product an asset management system with successful installs currently in progress comprised percent of R D for the half It is noted that ATS has continued with its policy of fully expensing these longterm investments rather than capitalizing these investments for future amortization The balance of R D dollars approximately percent was invested in association with products that generate existing maintenance and enhancement revenue ensuring that these products remain current and continue to meet the needs of ATSs growing customer base ENRON MUTUAL MARKETING AGREEMENT On March ATS was pleased to announce its mutual marketing agreement partnership with Enron North America to provide outsourcing of accounting and administrative functions to Canadian and US producers The partnership combines Enrons commodity asset management and financial services with ATSs outsourcing capabilities for backoffice processing and information technology providing producers with the ability to source any service from wellhead to burnertip connection in one transaction Enron and ATS provide services to effectively aggregate market schedule and account for the producers supply stream while at the same time reduce their need for costly corporate infrastructure needs Within the Enron partnership ATS offers the trained personnel and facilities to perform administration and accounting duties such as joint venture revenue and production accounting transaction processing expenditure authorization tax payments royalty payments and regulatory filings The client benefits of outsourcing these backoffice responsibilities to ATS include higher productivity increased flexibility and lower administrative costs for the producers It is anticipated that the partnership will provide limited growth for ATS during Fiscal however the relationship positions ATS for significant revenue and earnings growth potential in fiscal and beyond SEGMENTED FINANCIAL SUMMARY The company has significant operations in two geographic locations Canada and the United States Comparative segmented financial information is summarized as follows Mnths Ended March It is noted that the Canadian Division is charged with one hundred percent of the amortization of historical Application Software and Goodwill investments Accordingly the bottom line for the Canadian division is reduced by one hundred percent of these noncash accounting charges Under the proposed Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants CICA Emerging Issues Committee Exposure Draft on Business Combinations Accounting for Goodwill the practice of the amortization of Application Software and Goodwill would be discontinued with these investment values maintained on the Balance Sheet subject to annual value impairment reviews Should the value be impaired then the company would write down the fixed asset value of the Purchased Application Software and Goodwill investments by the impairment reduction Once implemented this pronouncement will put Canadian Companies on par with United States Reporting Issuers When implemented this revised practice will enable ATS to more appropriately report Canadian and United States segmented financial results ATSs decline in the Canadian revenues and increase in US revenues coincides with studies conducted by major research firms such as Giga Forrester IDC and others The decrease in Canadian revenues is reflective of a mature marketplace for enterprise software and delayed customer expenditures associated with a recognized need for a new business model Conversely the increased US revenues are directly attributable to acceptance of the ASP and BFO as desired business models in the US marketplace Canadian companies have been slower to accept these business models and lag the United States marketplace by approximately months in most sectors according to the above referenced research firms This lag period is believed to be ending for most Canadian sectors and ATS is beginning to gain ASP and BFO ATS anticipated this trend and planned its investments accordingly Consequently we anticipate growth in ATSs Canadian operational reoccurring revenues as the Canadian industry adopts the ASP BFO business model similar to ATSs US operations CORPORATE ACTIVITIES March ATS appointed of Mr John A Brussa a partner with the firm of Burnet Duckworth Palmer to the Companys Board of Directors Mr Brussa received his LLB in from the

of March ATS announced that the plans to amalgamate ATS and The Petroleum Place Inc PPI were terminated Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Arrangement among ATS PPI and certain shareholders of ATS the Merger Agreement PPI was required complete an initial public offering As of March PPI did not complete an initial public offering and therefore the Merger Agreement between the

Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WARSAW Dow Jones Poland will limit its chances of developing a flexible and diversified gas market if the government goes ahead with a longawaited gas import deal with Norwegian and Danish companies said a participant at the Power in Poland conference in Warsaw this week Entering into longterm guaranteed takeorpay contracts with Norwegian and Danish partners would result in the incumbent contract holders having an incentive to delay domestic gas market liberalization at any cost said Jarek Astramowicz president of Enron Poland the Polish unit of the USs Enron Corp ENE The incumbent contract holder Polands gas monopoly Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo RPGN or PGNiG said recently it will sign a longterm guaranteed takeorpay contract with Norways state oil company Statoil AS YDNS and Danish stateowned oil and gas utility DONG in May The three parties are negotiating a trade deal that could see between five and eight billion cubic meters bcm a year exported from Norway and Denmark to Poland by According to Polish press reports Statoil reportedly wants financial guarantees from the Polish government before signing any sales agreement with PGNiG The Norwegians also said they need to sell at least eight bcm of gas a year to Poland to make the project financially viable while the Polish side has said it wants to import only bcm a year PGNiG president Andrzej Lipko said this week PGNiG and Statoil were negotiating intensively but didnt say when a deal might be signed Astramowicz said the deal would reduce the Polish sides room for maneuver in future gas importation and corner Poland into accepting gas at higher prices than it could find on EU markets when the Polish and EU grids are fully interconnected Enron like other traders operates best in markets where there is greater liquidity and the Norway deal would dry up considerable amounts of potential liquidity Astramowicz added that the Polish market would be oversupplied if the deal goes ahead pushing up enduser prices And its the projected increases in demand for gas in Poland over the next years that presents the major problem Barbara LitakZarebska Deputy Treasury Minister said this week gas demand projections were largely based on an expected rapid shift from coalpowered to gaspowered electricity generation in Poland Polands Economy Ministry estimates the countrys current annual gas consumption at bcm bcm and expects this total to reach bcm by including bcm to be consumed by the newly constructed gas fired power plants Astramowicz said this projection was too high claiming the power sector was likely to take only bcm bcm by Furthermore power generated from gas cannot compete with power generated by coalfired power plants in price terms Therefore this source of increase in gas demand will not materialize in the near future he said As an alternative to the Norway deal Astramowicz pointed to western European gas trading hubs already offering flexible gas supply contracts with terms of up to ten years For example competitively priced gas supplies based on the contracts executed in Zeebrugge Belgium or Emden Germany are already reaching customers in eastern Germany today and as Polish gas consumption grows could easily be used to source any additional gas supplies needed for customers in Poland said Astramowicz He also pointed to potential import price advantages from the EU He said gas imported from the EU would cost about cm against a price on the current Yamal contract of cm and a Norwegian gas price including the estimated transmission charge to the Polish border of cm of cm PGNiGs Lipko said that imported Russian gas prices would not be cheaper than Norwegian supplies once a pipeline

business segments Gas Distribution Operating income was million for the second quarter and million for the six month period as compared to million and million respectively in the prior year The

customer conservation resulting from higher gas costs in the current periods Power Generation Operating income and equity investment income grew to million and million for the current quarter and fiscal yeartodate periods compared with and million respectively in the previous fiscal year These increases of million and million respectively are primarily due to a gain on the liquidation of

the power sales contracts on the Phase I Elwood units were restructured as tolling agreements Midstream Services Operating income and equity investment income was million and million for the current quarter and six month periods compared to million and million respectively in the yearago comparable periods Results in the current periods were positively impacted by equity income from our enovate

construction project Retail Energy Services Operating income in the second quarter grew to million an increase of million over the yearago period Fiscal yeartodate results reflect an increase of

business segment operating results net income for the current periods reflect higher financing costs resulting from longterm debt issued to fund diversified growth and shortterm debt incurred for

Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved BOMBAY India AP A top official of US energy giant Enron Corp was authorized to issue a termination notice to pull out of a controversial power project in western India the largest foreign investment in the country a newspaper reported Friday The board of the Dabhol Power Company the Indian subsidiary of Enron met in London on Wednesday and authorized the companys managing director to issue a preliminary notice to terminate the project billed as the worlds largest natural gas fired power plant The Times of India reported The board has given powers to the management to issue the pretermination notice But the meeting unanimously felt the need of the hour was not to terminate the project but to initiate a renegotiation process Vinay Bansal chairman of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board was quoted as saying by the newspaper Enron officials have refused comment The notice is the first of three steps that could end in the abandonment of the dlrs billion project A sixmonth reconciliation period would follow any move by the Dabhol Power Company to issue the termination notice Bansal said Indian lenders present at a meeting with foreign financial institutions in London earlier this week have said they favor renegotiation The project has been in trouble since December when the Maharashtra state government where the Dabhol project is located said the tariff was exorbitant and demanded a new price agreement The state power utility said it could not pay Dabhols monthly electricity dues which prompted the company to invoke a federal guarantee in February This was the first time in India that a federal guarantee was invoked As part of the agreement between the company and the state government the federal government has to pay in case of a state default But before the federal government stepped in the state government paid dlrs million in outstanding bills Since then the state power utility has confirmed that all pending bills have been paid But a dispute over payment of dlrs million for December and January bills is pending Several political parties had earlier demanded the project be scrapped since the costs had increased from rupees four cents per unit agreed six years ago for electricity generated by the megawatt naphtha plant to rupees cents Enron has maintained that work will be completed by yearend on the megawatt liquified natural gas plant Houston Texasbased Enron has a percent stake in Dabhol Power and is the projects largest

holds more than million of Enron stock almost million of Duke Energy million of El Paso Energy and million in Reliant Energy The governor and other lawmakers have threatened to investigate power producers for gouging California consumers Many energy producers have been reporting record profits during the power crisis Jim Knox of California Common Cause said Calpers should look at divesting its stock if the companies are profiting at the expense of California consumers I assume their Enron and Reliant stock has done quite well in the last couple of years but it has done well at the expense of California consumers he said But Pat Macht a Calpers spokeswoman says if Calpers were to divest of every stock that had a critic it would be impossible to manage Senator Don Perata DOakland agreed with Macht We have been through this before and it is a very complicated thing he said But for us to divest of all the energy stocks I mean we would be using candles In the past Calpers has divested from South African and tobacco stocks Macht said the decision was a purely financial one and that Calpers is so large it has investments in every sector not just energy It is important to

taken by the Board at its meeting here yesterday by a vote of six to one after Maharastra government representatives were prevented from voting on ground of interested party Dubbed as unfortunate by

Economic Affairs meeting Prabhu said We are expecting cooperation from many Scandivian countries as well as European nations in the power sector On Tuesday the board of DPC in which Enron has a per cent stake decided to take the step after a bitter feud with the state government over a payment issue PTI India Starving oneself to stuff others Business Line The Hindu Copyright C Kasturi Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire NEW DELHI April THE Food Corporation of India FCI has identified locations for creation of lakh tonnes lt bulk storage capacity on buildownoperate BOO basis by the private sector These include establishing godownssilos of three lt capacity each in Nabha Barnala and Moga in Punjab and Sirsa and Kaithal in Haryana and one lt each in Hooghly Chennai Coimbatore Bangalore and Mumbai Besides FCI has invited expression of interest for the construction of conventional godowns of to tonnes capacity each through the BOO route In this case it is proposed to build nearly six lt of aggregate capacity in around locations all over the country Private parties investing in these facilities would store and maintain foodgrains procured by FCI for which they will be paid storage costs Under the National Policy on Handling Storage and Transportation of Foodgrain notified on July FCI will guarantee utilisation of these facilities up to per cent for the first years and per cent for the next years Further the Budget has granted a fiveyear tax holiday and per cent deduction of profits for the next five years to enterprises engaged in the integrated business of handling transportation and storage of foodgrains The policy also provides for deduction of per cent of profits derived by institutions financing these projects prompting the likes of ICICI and IDFC to enter the fray and offer their advisory and funding expertise in the area The move to involve the private sector in the creation as well as operation of storage facilities on FCIs behalf has been defended mainly on two counts Firstly it would tackle the Governments spiralling food subsidy problem through reduction in grain handling and operating costs something that FCI cannot achieve on its own Secondly there is a massive dearth of storage capacity with Government agencies which neither have the resources to make fresh investments To address the first point one needs to consider the real cost dimensions involved Conservative estimates are that private investors would incur a cost of roughly Rs per tonne for constructing bulk silos Thus creation of lt storage capacity entails investments of Rs crore Assuming a debtequity ratio the annual interest outgo on investment would come to at least Rs per tonne The investor also has to spend on labour fumigation storage interest on grain turnover of stocks etc all of which adds to another Rs per tonne Besides annual maintenance costs are reckoned at about Rs per tonne If over and above this investors are to be given a decent per cent return on equity FCI would have to fork out nothing less than Rs per tonne for subcontracting its storage operations to private parties And on lt capacity the annual outgo works out to about Rs crore Compare this to FCIs own current annual carrying cost of Rs per tonne for its grains In FCI held about lt of buffer stocks over and above the normative requirement on which it incurred carrying costs interest plus storage of nearly Rs crore In the proposed regime it would end up coughing over onesixth of these sums for a tenth of the capacity That raises the issue of inadequate storage capacity with Government agencies According to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and Public Distributions latest Annual Report storage capacity with FCI as on December stood at million tonnes of which covered godowns accounted for mt and CAP Cover and Plinth mt The Central Warehousing Corporation CWC had eight mt capacity of which covered godowns comprised seven mt The aggregate storage capacity of CWCs associate State Warehousing Corporations came to another mt including mt of covered godowns If one adds to this the estimated mt of capacities available with State Governments the public sector has almost mt of storage capacity which is more than sufficient to cater to the existing mt of foodgrain stocks in the Central pool And contrary to general belief the proportion of crude CAP structures which are ostensibly vulnerable to rodent attack and moisture ingress is hardly per cent That the pronouncements of public godowns bursting at their seams are somewhat exaggerated is also borne by the fact that CWC godowns today operate at around per cent of their capacity On the other hand the Government is committed to ensuring per cent capacity utilisation for bulk storage capacity built by private agencies including leading grain handling entities from Australia and Canada Whether this would lead to a miniEnron situation remains to be seen

heading the group demanding a judicial inquiry into the first and second phases of the Enron power project He is supported by the Peasants and Workers Party the Janata Dal secular the Samajwadi Party and the CPM This group of smaller parties of the Democratic Front have already told chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh that they would reconsider their support to the ruling front unless a judicial probe is ordered on the lines of Srikrishna Commission Mr Deshmmukh has requested the group not to take any hasty decision Prof Gopal Dukhande spokesperson of the Janata Dal secular told this newspaper that the group had not given up its main demand to order a judicial probe into the way the Power Purchase Agreements PPAs were singed with Enron He said the group would meet on May to take into considerations all the developments taking place regarding the Enron power project The official coordination committee of the DF government is also scheduled to meet at the state guest house Sahyadri on the same day ND Patil of the PWP who is the convener of the DF coordination committee is also opposed to renegotiations and wants the government to appoint an inquiry commission We are opposed to the way the PPAs were signed with Enron ignoring the interests of the state The inquiry commission will bring out the truth a senior minister said Even if Enron now wants to withdraw from the project we should not let it go without investigating the matter he added Meanwhile union finance minister Yashwant Sinha has agreed to depute a highlevel representative of the Union government to represent finance power petroleum and other union government agencies on the renegotiation team These departments will set up their own internal coordination committee to review the situation from time to time and guide the renegotiation team to be set up by the Maharashtra government Success of state bandh isolates BJP The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI The state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP finds itself politically isolated following the Maharashtra bandh on Wednesday The protest was jointly organised by the Shiv Sena an ally of the BJP the left parties and several trade union organisations Even a section of the Congress backed the bandh The bandh was specifically targeted at the BJP which heads the National Democratic Alliance NDA at the Centre Even though the Sena is a part of the NDA it seems to have cleverly sensed the mood of the people which is clearly against the economic policies of the Centre and joined hands with the left and democratic parties to organise the bandh A BJP officebearer said The Sena finds the ground slipping from under its feet and hence it is indulging in gimmicks like sponsoring bandhs However Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray said We have unambiguously demonstrated that we are on the side of the workers farmers and the middle class We have prioritised our commitments and our first priority is to the people and not to cabinet berths Sources in the Sena said the party does not want to be punished by the people during elections for the blunders made by the BJP The deleterious effects of globalisation are there for everyone to see Thousands of looms have fallen silent because of textile imports apples and chocolates from New Zealand and Switzerland and toys chemicals and dyes from China and Taiwan are edging out Indian products in local markets Not only workers even middleclass employees are being fired by their employers Are we to mutely watch the crushing of thousands of families under the wheels of the globalisation juggernaut asked a Sena leader Interestingly many in the BJP concur with this viewpoint but are afraid to speak out lest they are accused of violating the party discipline In private BJP activists are extremely critical of the Vajpayee governments nonresponse to the torture and killing of jawans of the Border Security Force by Bangladesh Rifles Our foreign minister Jaswant Singh personally escorts top Pakistani terrorist Maulana Masood Azhar from a jail to Afghanistan and sets him free Mr Vajpayee unilaterally declares a ceasefire in Kashmir And now he does nothing when our jawans are killed by a small nation like Bangladesh a senior BJP leader observed Senior leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad VHP Ashok Singhal who was in the city recently openly stated that the Vajpayee government has come to a standstill However party spokesperson Atul Bhatkhalkar said We do not want to do anything that will complicate the situation for Bangladeshi prime minister Hasina Wajed who is proIndia People should appreciate the ground realities Meanwhile the Enron issue is likely to emerge as a test of the recent unity between the Sena and parties of the left The controversial power project of the US MNC was endorsed by the Sena when it along with the BJP was in power in the state But the left parties want the project to be scrapped Sena chief Bal Thackeray has gone on record stating that his government was under pressure from the US to sign the accord with Enron With Enron in a confrontationist mode visavis the state and Central governments the Senas response is being keenly watched in political circles here Additional power for Delhi promises Prabhu A Staff Reporter The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM NEW DELHI Union power minister Suresh Prabhu on Thursday assured chief minister Sheila Dikshit that the Capital would be provided an additional MW of electricity starting first week of May Dikshit met Prabhu to apprise him of the power situation in the Capital She told Prabhu that the city was facing a power deficit of about MW and desperately needed an additional supply to meet the increasing demand The Centre promised that the additional power would be made available from the Eastern Grid Dikshit told Prabhu that the Delhi government was negotiating with the Chhatisgarh government to buy MW She said the Delhi government was facing severe problem in getting power from Himachal Pradesh Electricity Board due to reduction in the power generation in the state The government is now contemplating talks with West Bengal to purchase power Dikshit said her government was negotiating a deal with Enron but was reluctant to buy electricity due to the high tariff quoted by the company Dikshit said additional power was also expected from the three units at Dadri Badarpur and Raj Ghat power stations which would be become functional by May Besides Dikshit Delhi power minister Narendra Nath and principal secretary power Ashok Pradhan and Delhi Vidyut Board chairman Jagdish Sagar were also present Enron ready to pull out but lenders say wait Business Times Bureau The Times of India Copyright C The Times of India Source World Reporter TM MUMBAI The Dabhol Power Company board which met on Wednesday in London authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board The company however may not pull out of the project yet considering its lenders who met on Monday opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations Sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported Enron on the termination issue domestic financial institutions led by the Industrial Development Bank of India prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move Enron needs the lenders consent to file a pretermination notice for pulling out from the project The decision to empower DPC chief Wade Cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single IDBI vote against such a move Another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of Phase II of the project will depend on the Government of India assuring payment mechanisms Institutions are yet to disburse about per cent of the sanctioned package which is crucial for completing the Phase II expansion project The board has given powers to Wade Cline to issue a pretermination notice But the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious renegotiation proceedings said MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal who attended the board meeting MSEB presented their views to the board members and it was understood by Enron which also included the Rs crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings We have also made it clear that the tariff structure of Enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable Bansal added They cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction said a top banker who was present during the lenders meet There is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the PPA should be kept in abeyance he added The global arrangers for the DPC include ANZ Investment Bank Credit Suisse First Boston ABNAMRO Citibank and the State Bank of India where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials However some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings Meanwhile in a clear reversal of roles Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the PPA We will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us including DPC Deshmukh said Deshmukh was echoing Union Power Minister Suresh Prabhus sentiments who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row He however added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the billion project would be a blow to Indias efforts to woo foreign investors The DPC has already slapped one conciliation notice on the Centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over nonpayment of dues amounting to Rs crore and interest towards the bills due for December and January Meanwhile MSEB officials said in Mumbai that the March bills amounting to Rs crore was paid on Thursday as protest payment despite the dispute over the amount When asked on the future course of action Bansal said it was up to the DPC The Enron issue was also raised in the Lok Sabha on Thursday when Prabhu said that scrapping of the agreement would cost Rs crore to the Centre whose liability in the project agreement was limited Centres liability in case of termination is one years electricity bill and a termination fee of million he said Indias single largest foreign investor threatens to pull out Madhu Nainan Agence FrancePresse Copyright BOMBAY April AFP The biggest single foreign investor in India USbased Enron Power Corp is threatening to pack its bags in frustration a move that would cast doubts over the countrys investmentfriendly credentials Enrons Indian subsidiary Dabhol Power Co DPC is putting up a billiondollar power station in Indias industrial heartland Maharashtra state At a meeting in London on Wednesday the DPC board of directors authorised chief executive officer Neil McGregor and Enron India chief K Wade Cline to serve a preliminary termination notice for sale of power within the next four weeks to the Maharashtra electricity board The twopart power station is being erected at the port town of Dabhol some kilometres south of the state capital Bombay Payments for electricity have been guaranteed by the state and federal governments Part one began generating power in May but the project has been mired in controversy and acrimony with the state government arguing it could not afford the high electricity bills This is a drastic and unfortunate decision the board of directors has taken even though we made it clear that we want to find a solution to the impasse Maharashtra energy minister Padamsinh Patil told AFP Patil said a decision had been taken by the state and federal governments last week to set up a panel to renegotiate the power purchase agreement Enron knew about the decision We have no animosity towards Enron We have paid the February bill under duress and we told them we are ready to pay the other bills also under protest Vijay Kalantri president of the All India Association of Industries described the Enron move as unbusinesslike They have done this to build up the pressure on the state and federal governments Economic disputes are not resolved by threats but by sitting down to discuss and renegotiate contracts Kalantri agreed that if Enron carried out its threat the consequences would be bad for all parties Ashok Khinvasara director at the Ispat group said India could suffer as a foreign investment destination especially in the power sector The Ispat groups plans to put up a billiondollar power project in Maharashtra have been put on hold in the wake of the Enron controversy Since the state electricity board is not paying its dues Enron is within its rights to serve a termination notice Khinvasara said The board will not be hit initially as it buys very little power from DPC now but the size of Enrons claims and the speed with which it sets in motion a recovery process could turn out to be worrisome Enrons claims could be more than billion rupees million dollars Khinvasara said the Enron episode showed that future investors should take care to see that tariffs are affordable and should not take comfort merely in contracts and government guarantees The DPC board of directors decision is the second in a series of moves to increase the pressure on the government Early in April DPC served the state electricity board a notice of political force majeure which is a legal manoeuvre that enables a party to break a contract in the case of events beyond its control The Dabhol project has had a turbulent ride ever since it was signed in Allegations of corruption and high costs led to the scrapping of the contract in but it was renegotiated the same year In February a state government panel recommended fresh re negotiations to bring down the tariffs and charged Enron with inflating costs manghlh BusinessFinancial Desk Section C COMPANY NEWS INDIAN UTILITY PAYS MILLION MARCH BILL TO ENRON Reuters The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company The

FRANCISCOBUSINESS WIREApril Pacific Gas and Electric Company the utility unit of PGE Corporation NYSE PCG today filed for reorganization under Chapter of the US Bankruptcy Code in San Francisco bankruptcy court The company said it is taking this action in light of its unreimbursed energy costs which are now increasing by more than million per month continuing CPUC decisions that economically disadvantage the company and the now unmistakable fact that negotiations with Governor Gray Davis and his representatives are going nowhere Neither PGE Corporation nor any of its other subsidiaries including its National Energy Group have filed for Chapter reorganization or are affected by the utilitys filing We chose to file for Chapter reorganization affirmatively because we expect the court will provide the venue needed to reach a solution which thus far the State and the States regulators have been unable to achieve said Robert D Glynn Jr Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company The regulatory and political processes have failed us and now we are turning to the court Glynn added Our objective is to move through the Chapter reorganization process as quickly as possible without disruption to our operations or inconvenience to our customers Throughout this crisis our employees have been and remain committed to providing safe and reliable service to the million Californians who depend on us to deliver their gas and electricity Pacific Gas and Electric Company decided to file for the protection of Chapter primarily due to Failure by the state to assume the full procurement responsibility for Pacific Gas and Electrics net open position as was provided under ABX This has the result of increasing financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy procurement costs which the utility estimates to be approximately million or more per month The impact of actions by the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC on March and April that created new payment obligations for the company and undermined its ability to return to financial viability Lack of progress in negotiations with the state to provide recovery of billion in wholesale power purchases made by the utility since June which have not been recoverable in frozen rates The adoption by the CPUC of an illegal and retroactive accounting change that would appear to eliminate our true uncollected wholesale costs In addition despite Pacific Gas Electrics best efforts to work with the State of California to reach a consensual responsible fair and comprehensive solution to Californias energy crisis no agreement has been reached with the Governor and the Governors representatives have dramatically slowed the pace and the progress of discussions over the past month Furthermore since last fall we have filed comprehensive plans for resolving this matter with the CPUC but they have not acted affirmatively on them said Glynn On October Pacific Gas and Electric sought emergency rate action by the CPUC In November we filed our rate stabilization plan which if adopted would have increased electric prices by an initial percent compared with the percent recently adopted by the CPUC Neither request was acted upon Had the state acted at that time Pacific Gas and Electric would have been kept creditworthy Pacific Gas and Electric would have been able to enter into longterm power purchase contracts at prices lower than those announced by the state The state would not have had to almost exhaust the states budget surplus by spending billions of dollars to purchase power for the utilitys customers The state would not now need to issue billions of dollars in bonds to cover these power purchases and The state would not now be advancing a proposal to spend billions of dollars to purchase the states three investorowned utilitys electric transmission systems This year the state has spent more than billion on power purchases and with the CPUC has arranged to be reimbursed for these expenses noted Glynn In contrast since June Pacific Gas and Electric Company has spent billion in excess of revenues to pay for power for its customers and exhausted its ability to continue borrowing but there has been no progress on a plan to reimburse it for those expenditures as provided by law Statements by the Governor and other public officials since last September gave us reason to believe that a solution could be reached outside the context of Chapter that would restore the utilitys financial viability and enable it to meet its financial obligations equitably However these statements have not been followed up by constructive actions and a reorganization in Chapter is now the most feasible means of resolution The utility will utilize existing resources to continue operating its business during bankruptcy including paying vendors and suppliers in full for goods and services received after the filing The utility will pay electric commodity suppliers as provided by law The utility intends to continue normal electric and gas transmission and distribution functions during the Chapter process Employees will continue to be paid Health care plans and other benefits for employees and most retirees will continue The utilitys qualified retirement plans for retirees and vested employees are fully funded and protected by federal law Notice A media teleconference will be

centrifugal compressor at each of the four stations Transwestern also requests to ensure a smooth transition to the new compressor units to maintain the ability to operate the existing facilities up to six months after the installation of the new units It is stated that the new units will require less maintenance activity than the existing units as well as operate more efficiently in flowing more gas through its system Transwestern states that result of the project it will be able to provide incremental capacity of approximately Mcf per day on its mainline from Thoreau New Mexico to California increasing its total capacity to California to Mcf per day It is indicated that the proposed modification will enable it to meet the supply and demand imbalance in the California area Transwestern proposes to place the facilities into service by June Transwestern estimates the cost for the proposed construction to be approximately to be financed with internallygenerated funds Transwestern also states that it is not at this time requesting rolledin pricing for the new facilities and understands that it will be at risk for the recovery of costs associated with the proposed modifications Any questions regarding the application should be directed to Keith L Petersen at There are two ways to become involved in the Commissions review of this project First any person wishing to obtain legal status by becoming a party to the proceedings for this project should on or before April file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC a motion to intervene in accordance with the requirements of the Commissions Rules of Practice and Procedure CFR or and the Regulations under the NGA CFR A person obtaining party status will be placed on the service list maintained by the Secretary of the Commission and will receive copies of all documents filed by the applicant and by all other parties A party must submit copies of filings made with the Commission and must mail a copy to the applicant and to every other party in the proceeding Only parties to the proceeding can ask for court review of Commission orders in the proceeding However a person does not have to intervene in order to have comments considered The second way to participate is by filing with the Secretary of the Commission as soon as possible an original and two copies of comments in support of or in opposition to this project The Commission will consider these comments in determining the appropriate action to be taken but the filing of a comment alone will not serve to make the filer a party to the proceeding The Commissions rules require that persons filing comments in opposition to the project provide copies of their protests only to the party or parties directly involved in the protest Persons who wish to comment only on the environmental review of this project should submit an original and two copies of their comments to the Secretary of the Commission Environmental commenters will be placed on the Commissions environmental mailing list will receive copies of the environmental documents and will be notified of meetings associated with the Commissions environmental review process Environmental commenters will not be required to serve copies of filed documents on all other parties However the nonparty commenters will not receive copies of all documents filed by other parties or issued by the Commission except for the mailing of environmental documents issued by the Commission and will not have the right to seek court review of the Commissions final order Page Number The Commission may issue a preliminary determination of nonenvironmental issues prior to the completion of its review of the environmental aspects of the project This preliminary determination typically considers such issues as the need for the project and its economic effect on existing customers of the applicant on other pipelines in the area and on landowners and communities For example the Commission considers the extent to which the applicant may need to exercise eminent domain to obtain rightsofway for the proposed project and balances that against the nonenvironmental benefits to be provided by the project Therefore if a person has comments on community and landowner impacts from this proposal it is important either to file comments or to intervene as early in the process as possible Also comments protests and interventions may be filed electronically via the internet in lieu of paper See CFT aiii and the instructions on the Commissions web site at efidoorbellhtm If the Commission decides to set the application for a formal hearing before an Administrative Law Judge the Commission will issue another notice describing that

filing We chose to file for Chapter reorganization affirmatively because we expect the court will provide the venue needed to reach a solution which thus far the State and the States regulators have been unable to achieve said Robert D Glynn Jr Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company The regulatory and political processes have failed us and now we are turning to the court Glynn added Our objective is to move through the Chapter reorganization process as quickly as possible without disruption to our operations or inconvenience to our customers Throughout this crisis our employees have been and remain committed to providing safe and reliable service to the million Californians who depend on us to deliver their gas and electricity Pacific Gas and Electric Company decided to file for the protection of Chapter primarily due to Failure by the state to assume the full procurement responsibility for Pacific Gas and Electrics net open position as was provided under ABX This has the result of increasing financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy procurement costs which the utility estimates to be approximately million or more per month The impact of actions by the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC on March and April that created new payment obligations for the company and undermined its ability to return to financial viability Lack of progress in negotiations with the state to provide recovery of billion in wholesale power purchases made by the utility since June which have not been recoverable in frozen rates The adoption by the CPUC of an illegal and retroactive accounting change that would appear to eliminate our true uncollected wholesale costs In addition despite Pacific Gas Electrics best efforts to work with the State of California to reach a consensual responsible fair and comprehensive solution to Californias energy crisis no agreement has been reached with the Governor and the Governors representatives have dramatically slowed the pace and the progress of discussions over the past month Furthermore since last fall we have filed comprehensive plans for resolving this matter with the CPUC but they have not acted affirmatively on them said Glynn On October Pacific Gas and Electric sought emergency rate action by the CPUC In November we filed our rate stabilization plan which if adopted would have increased electric prices by an initial percent compared with the percent recently adopted by the CPUC Neither request was acted upon Had the state acted at that time Pacific Gas and Electric would have been kept creditworthy Pacific Gas and Electric would have been able to enter into longterm power purchase contracts at prices lower than those announced by the state The state would not have had to almost exhaust the states budget surplus by spending billions of dollars to purchase power for the utilitys customers The state would not now need to issue billions of dollars in bonds to cover these power purchases and The state would not now be advancing a proposal to spend billions of dollars to purchase the states three investorowned utilitys electric transmission systems This year the state has spent more than billion on power purchases and with the CPUC has arranged to be reimbursed for these expenses noted Glynn In contrast since June Pacific Gas and Electric Company has spent billion in excess of revenues to pay for power for its customers and exhausted its ability to continue borrowing but there has been no progress on a plan to reimburse it for those expenditures as provided by law Statements by the Governor and other public officials since last September gave us reason to believe that a solution could be reached outside the context of Chapter that would restore the utilitys financial viability and enable it to meet its financial obligations equitably However these statements have not been followed up by constructive actions and a reorganization in Chapter is now the most feasible means of resolution The utility will utilize existing resources to continue operating its business during bankruptcy including paying vendors and suppliers in full for goods and services received after the filing The utility will pay electric commodity suppliers as provided by law The utility intends to continue normal electric and gas transmission and distribution functions during the Chapter process Employees will continue to be paid Health care plans and other benefits for employees and most retirees will continue The utilitys qualified retirement plans for retirees and vested employees are fully funded and protected by federal law Notice A media teleconference will be held today at AM Pacific Daylight Time to discuss this announcement Pacific Gas and Electric

it will eliminate some or roughly percent of the jobs at its broadband telecommunications unit detailing a move which it has previously described as an internal redeployment of staff Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly said the company is cutting jobs at the unit which now employs people because it has completed the buildout of its mile km fiberoptic network and because of slow demand for streaming media products delivered to personal computers The network is substantially complete now so that means fewer people are required for technical positions she said The job cuts also reflect Enron Broadbands decision to play a less active role in the market for streaming media services such as video of corporate events delivered to personal computers where demand had been slower than expected she said However Kimberly said Enron Broadband will continue to pursue entertainmentondemand services actively Kimberly said employees whose jobs are being eliminated will be eligible for redeployment to other positions at Enron Broadband Services or other Enron units although there could be some involuntary terminations Previously Enron officials had dismissed rumors about job cuts at Enron Broadband Services and had spoken instead of an internal redeployment of staff within the unit without detailing its impact on overall employment there The companys stock which peaked at

CAFFERTY CNNfn ANCHOR BEFORE HOURS On March Vincent Viola was voted in as the new chairman of the New Mercantile Exchange He takes over during a time of change and challenge for the NYMEX Mr Viola is here now to talk about his new position and the task ahead Congratulations on the ascension to the throne down there VINCENT VIOLA NYMEX CHAIRMAN Thank you Jack CAFFERTY Job one is VIOLA Making sure that the exchange is postured to fulfill its purpose as a magnificently liquid and efficient pricing mechanism and a stable global counterparty for mediation of credit and risk on the products that we pursue to trade on the exchange CAFFERTY And to do it with an eye on making a profit VIOLA Yes exactly CAFFERTY Which is a little bit different assignment than its been down there VIOLA Yes exactly the fact that our business model now by virtue of the fact that we seek to make and provide profit to our shareholders compels us to start to act and function like a business CAFFERTY Now last year you did incur losses down there of about almost million Tell me a little bit about why that happened and what youre doing thats going to prevent it from continuing to happen VIOLA Well simply put we had to make a decision as to enhancing the access of participants to our marketplace And we went and decided to create our own proprietary electronic platform CAFFERTY Animex ph is that way VIOLA Enymex CAFFERTY Enymex Im sorry VIOLA And that was capital decision capital spending decision that we made rightfully so And that caused the gap to close between revenues and expenses CAFFERTY All right this is because I would assume of pressures from companies like Intercontinental Exchange Enron Online and some of the foreign operations as well right I mean you to upgrade to stay competitive is that VIOLA I think the BB model hit everyone as a novel yet substantively interesting concept For our marketplace the most efficient source of liquidity right now and the culture around trading our major product oil is based in the physical execution of those trades through open auction outcry And the culture around oil trading is clearly much more comfortable persontoperson We like to say simply put the best price for oil in the world is found on the floor of the NYMEX The electronic umbrella around that execution in liquidity clearly will be best served by an electronic platform CAFFERTY Whos going to win this tugofwar eventually between the advent of electronic transactions and the old way of doing it by yelling out your bid VIOLA I think the source of liquidity that has the most continuous and consistent tightness between the bid and offer will in fact win out And I think that the support of electronic access to the marketplace can only enhance the individual trader on the floors ability to provide the best service CAFFERTY Is it a matter of time though until technology simply outstrips the ability of individuals to move with the speed and proficiency that these computers can do VIOLA Clearly technology as it improves in terms of reliability and consistency in terms of delivery of price is the trend that we will react to as business people on the mercantile exchange And we are preparing very very aggressively to continue to make our markets the most efficient It has to be stated that NYMEX is a doubleA credit and a global counterparty which mediates risk across a very very wide range of market participants looking for credit mediation for the exchange of energy products CAFFERTY Talk to me for a minute about commodities and about the areas of the commodity business that you see perhaps being the areas that will generate the best profits for you where the most action is likely to be Just give me an overview of the markets from where you sit VIOLA Well as a business model the exchange provides for revenue sourced valueadded functions Firstly its the only neutral model that can be conceived and executed currently and looking for in the future Secondly its banking and mediation and price management through its margin facility and clearing facility is a unique source of value Thirdly its information and data that it provides from the uniquely neutral and independent and uninfluenced prices that are physically identified on the floor is a unique source of basis and benchmark for oil trading throughout the world And lastly the professional and unique ability and experience of the best oil traders in the world both on the floor and the ring of individuals that deal with those people off the floor every day make the NYMEX a uniquely talented pool of business potential It has to be stated that the gentlemen who trade oil for major concerns institutional concerns while theyre communicating with the floor of the NYMEX every day for many years theres a very very close connection and cultural comfort and reliability on those prices and their efficiencies that have grown over the years And we think that thats going to be maintained So I think those four principal sources of revenue are the essence of our model CAFFERTY What scares you about the new job when you wake up in the middle of the night you go gee Im the chairman now what worries you VIOLA I think I get a sense of unbridled excitement Ive always enjoyed a real good fair fight And I think what concerns me and excites me at the same time is that Im responsible for almost plus members and their families and the marketplaces that we serve trying to bring very fair open properly banked markets CAFFERTY Good stuff VIOLA Yes CAFFERTY Appreciate your coming in I wish you well I hope your very successful as the new chairman of the NYMEX VIOLA Youre very kind thank you CAFFERTY All right Vincent Viola thanks TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT

SunSentinel In a perfect world there would be no automobiles with their internal combustion engines spewing pollutantladen exhaust into the air But how perfect would such a world be without the mobility and economic vitality those cars provide In a perfect world there would be no factories or refineries polluting air and water alike But how perfect would such a world be without the steel the textiles and the petroleum products those plants produce to meet the needs of consumers And in a perfect world there would be no power plants spewing pollutants into the air But how perfect would such a world be without the electricity those plants generate to light heat and cool our homes and businesses Modern life forces unpleasant choices on all of us from the average consumer to the highestranking public official Those choices should be made with an eye on the big picture and never on the basis of unrealistic notions of an idyllic world devoid of the sometimes unhealthy byproducts of human enterprise The Pompano Beach City Commission is faced with such a choice On Tuesday commissioners are to consider a proposal by Enron Corp a Houstonbased energy company to build a peaking power plant in the city That type of plant operates only when a public utility in this case Florida Power Light Co needs to purchase a backup source of power during periods of peak usage The commissioners are under tremendous pressure from other politicians as well as residents not only of Pompano Beach but of neighboring Margate and Coconut Creek who worry about the increased air pollution such a plant inevitably would create Opponents also are suspicious of Enrons longrange plans which they contend involve a hidden agenda to push for state deregulation of the electric industry which in turn would enable Enron to operate the plant hours a day and sell the excess power elsewhere There also are concerns about Enrons plans to use diesel fuel as a backup to its natural gas supply the primary fuel source for the plant Those worries are understandable and no one should be unsympathetic to the residents concerns But if commissioners keep their eye on the big picture they will have to conclude that the positives of this proposal greatly outweigh the negatives To begin with South Floridas burgeoning population requires foresight to avoid future power shortages like those California is now experiencing A region that expects to add million people during the next years should be preparing now for the additional energy needs such growth will create Moreover a plant using relatively cleanburning natural gas and built by Enron a company lauded as progressive by environmentalists for embracing alternative energy sources and for its commitment to tackling global warming should be seen as preferable to what the area might ultimately be stuck with if forced in desperation to seek new sources of electricity generation during a power crisis Already it has been determined that the proposed Enron plant would generate far far less nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide than FPLs oilpowered plant at Port Everglades To put things in further perspective the plant would emit less than percent of the amount of nitrogen oxide emitted by Broward County automobiles in a typical year Opponents of the plant should be asking themselves whether their concern for the environment extends to carpooling or even leaving their cars at home at times when they could walk or ride a bicycle to their destination Concerns about the possible burning of diesel fuel are valid but Enron has agreed to fixed limits on the amount of diesel it would use and to use relatively highquality lowsulfur diesel Moreover Enrons smokestacks are to be feet high meaning neighborhoods near the plant would likely experience no more pollution than other neighborhoods in the area It should also be noted that the state Department of Environmental Protection has given preliminary approval to a permit for the plant saying a lengthy review had found that it would have little impact on the regions air quality Little impact Compare that with the positive impact it would have on Pompano Beach by increasing its tax base providing jobs and developing a large piece of land that no one else has expressed any interest in and on all of South Florida by providing a source of relatively clean power for a region that will surely need it in the nottoodistant future by minimizing costs to consumers and by making rolling brownouts unnecessary during periods of peak electrical usage The plant cannot be built without a zoning change for the acre site from industrial to public utility The Pompano Beach Planning and Zoning Board has already approved the rezoning City commissioners should keep their eye on the big picture and ratify that decision for the good of Pompano Beach and all of South Florida Notices Haleywest LLC et al Electric Rate and Corporate Regulation Filings Federal Register

Copyright c Federal Information News Dispatch Inc All rights reserved April Take notice that on March Transwestern Pipeline Company PO Box Omaha Nebraska in Docket No CP filed an application pursuant to Sections b and c of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval for Transco to replace mainline compression facilities at four existing compressor stations in Arizona all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection This filing may be viewed on the web at onlinerimshtm call for assistance Specifically Transwestern proposes to abandon in place twelve existing drivers and compressors totaling horsepower at Stations and and install operate a ISOrated horsepower turbine centrifugal compressor at each of the four stations Transwestern also requests to ensure a smooth transition to the new compressor units to maintain the ability to operate the existing facilities up to six months after the installation of the new units It is stated that the new units will require less maintenance activity than the existing units as well as operate more efficiently in flowing more gas through its system Transwestern states that result of the project it will be able to provide incremental capacity of approximately Mcf per day on its mainline from Thoreau New Mexico to California increasing its total capacity to California to Mcf per day It is indicated that the proposed modification will enable it to meet the supply and demand imbalance in the California area Transwestern proposes to place the facilities into service by June Transwestern estimates the cost for the proposed construction to be approximately to be financed with internallygenerated funds Transwestern also states that it is not at this time requesting rolledin pricing for the new facilities and understands that it will be at risk for the recovery of costs associated with the proposed modifications Any questions regarding the application should be directed to Keith L Petersen at There are two ways to become involved in the Commissions review of this project First any person wishing to obtain legal status by becoming a party to the proceedings for this project should on or before April file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Washington DC a motion to intervene in accordance with the requirements of the Commissions Rules of Practice and Procedure CFR or and the Regulations under the NGA CFR A person obtaining party status will be placed on the service list maintained by the Secretary of the Commission and will receive copies of all documents filed by the applicant and by all other parties A party must submit copies of filings made with the Commission and must mail a copy to the applicant and to every other party in the proceeding Only parties to the proceeding can ask for court review of Commission orders in the proceeding However a person does not have to intervene in order to have comments considered The second way to participate is by filing with the Secretary of the Commission as soon as possible an original and two copies of comments in support of or in opposition to this project The Commission will consider these comments in determining the appropriate action to be taken but the filing of a comment alone will not serve to make the filer a party to the proceeding The Commissions rules require that persons filing comments in opposition to the project provide copies of their protests only to the party or parties directly involved in the protest Persons who wish to comment only on the environmental review of this project should submit an original and two copies of their comments to the Secretary of the Commission Environmental commenters will be placed on the Commissions environmental mailing list will receive copies of the environmental documents and will be notified of meetings associated with the Commissions environmental review process Environmental commenters will not be required to serve copies of filed documents on all other parties However the nonparty commenters will not receive copies of all documents filed by other parties or issued by the Commission except for the mailing of environmental documents issued by the Commission and will not have the right to seek court review of the Commissions final order Page Number The Commission may issue a preliminary determination of nonenvironmental issues prior to the completion of its review of the environmental aspects of the project This preliminary determination typically considers such issues as the need for the project and its economic effect on existing customers of the applicant on other pipelines in the area and on landowners and communities For example the Commission considers the extent to which the applicant may need to exercise eminent domain to obtain rightsofway for the proposed project and balances that against the nonenvironmental benefits to be provided by the project Therefore if a person has comments on community and landowner impacts from this proposal it is important either to file comments or to intervene as early in the process as possible Also comments protests and interventions may be filed electronically via the internet in lieu of paper See CFT aiii and the instructions on the Commissions web site at efidoorbellhtm If the Commission decides to set the application for a formal hearing before an Administrative Law Judge the Commission will issue another notice describing that process At the end of the Commissions review process a final

the struggle to deregulate has been coupled with soaring demand for power As the Brazilian government seeks other energy sources formulates a rationing plan and encourages consumers to voluntarily cut

deregulated power market over such things as the pricing of electricity have stymied gridexpansion plans by the private enterprises including Enron that bought up the former stateowned companies Even the completion last year of a natural gas pipeline from Bolivia has been slow to stimulate investments in thermoelectric power a move that was meant to reduce the countrys neartotal dependence on hydroelectric power Only of the thermoelectric plants that the government focused on almost two years ago in its emergency power plan seem close to coming on line in the next year or so With rainfall missing major reservoirs and a shortage of transmission lines preventing excess power that does exist from moving among regions the government says that the power situation in Brazil will be touchandgo at least until So some of the countrys biggest powerintensive companies are taking matters into their own hands hoping to ensure a constant power supply with their own naturalgasfired generators Among those that have recently done so are Cia Siderurgica Nacional a steel maker and Globo Comunicacoes e Participacoes parent of the Rio de Janeiro daily newspaper O Globo So have two rival breweries Cia Cervejarias Kaiser owned by the CocaCola Company its Brazilian bottlers and Heineken and the maker of Brahma beer Cia de Bebidas das Americas known as AmBev Plants are planned for the Brazilian units of the Americanbased multinationals Corn Products International and International Paper Rudi Anvari director of Engineering and Technology at Corn Products Brazil said the companys decision was based on the need to count on a reliable and flexible source of energy In a study of power use in the state of Sao Paulo the states secretary of energy found that companies produced percent of the energy they consumed in up from percent in In some cases the excess power from these company plants can be sold to the national grid Jayme de Hollanda general director of the National Institute for Energy Efficiency a nonprofit advocacy group said that this socalled cogenerated power should account for about percent of the countrys electricity supply by The volumes that we are dealing with dont provide a complete solution for the country but they can certainly resolve localized problems said Ivan Marimon the sales manager at Guascor do Brasil a joint venture controlled by Grupo Guascor of Spain which builds smallscale power plants for hospitals Companies said that part of the appeal of small power projects was that they required less time to build than a public power project sometimes as little as six months And the cost at about million for a small megawatt plant could be just as cost effective for some companies as buying electricity from the national grid especially since electricity prices were expected to increase significantly in the next several years Some private power concerns including EnergyWorks even finance the projects outright But for a project to be viable for financiers and builders companies need to agree to buy the electricity for to years That is a daunting proposition for Brazilians who have been made shy of longterm commitments by years of economic turmoil Part of the doubt has been caused by exchange rate worries Unlike natural gas prices which are charged in dollars electricity prices are fixed by the government in local currency Indeed private power plants are clearly not for everyone For most companies said Pio Gavazzi director of infrastructure at the Federation of Industries of the State of Sao Paulo a trade group a solution could just be a matter of renegotiating existing electricity contracts or installing more energy efficient parts in the factory Photo Brazilian companies and some overseas concerns are searching for more energy sources to make sure their electricity needs will be met This EnergyWorks power plant was built for the Kaiser brewery in Pacatuba EnergyWorks do Brazil

rejected France Telecoms offer for the unbundling of the countrys socalled local loop and has ordered the company to submit a new proposal by Thursday Implementation of the localloop unbundling which came into force Jan has been delayed because of high prices set by France Telecom for access to local exchanges by rival telecommunications operators The regulator said some of the fees announced by

Chronicle Texas Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Enron Broadband Services has eliminated up to positions in recent weeks a reflection of changes in the hightech market and a consolidation of operations in the company Many of the employees have found work elsewhere with parent company Enron Corp said Chief Executive Officer Ken Rice but the move brings the number of Enron Broadband employees from as many as in recent months to about Many of the job cuts came when Enron Broadband a division of energy giant Enron Corp finished building out the mile fiber optic network that it uses to buy and sell Internet bandwidth Rice said We had a number of people working on that but now that its in place we needed to redeploy them elsewhere Rice said Consolidating operations from outlying Enron Broadband offices such as Portland Ore to Houston also accounts for some of the lost positions as well as slowing demand for a PCbased streaming media product the company developed Rice said Its not unusual for Enron to move several hundred employees to different locations and divisions around the country every year to account for changes in the market Rice said The company employs about people Its just a part of the way we do business he said Enron Broadband is still growing and has posted more than a dozen new broadbandrelated jobs on its Web site since March Enron officials have shied away from calling the eliminated jobs layoffs When word of the job cuts first surfaced at the end of March a company spokesman used the term redeployed to describe the action Many employees were offered the opportunity to find other jobs in Enron but those who did not find new jobs or accept other positions in the company had few other options than leaving That saved the company from actually firing workers which could have required it to report the actions to the Texas Workforce Commission Enron Broadband Services has attracted a lot of attention in the past year for pioneering a previously unheard of notion treating access to the biggest Internet data lines as a fluid commodity that could be bought and sold The group was created following Enrons acquisition of Portland General Electric a small Oregon utility company that was also in the process of building its own fiber optic network Enron used that as a starting point to build its network which now has access to dozens of other global networks The company buys time and access to those networks and sells it to endusers who want to send large amounts of data over the Internet for things such as broadcasts of concerts and meetings or more mundane tasks like exchanging business data between two different offices of a company The company uses pooling points about data switching hubs it owns around the world to open and close connections with other networks around the world to effect those trades The company is also building a platform to deliver broadband content to homes and businesses such as movies and games The cornerstone of that content was originally a year contract with Blockbuster Video that would have combined that companys movie industry clout with Enrons technology to bring videoondemand to homes Enron canceled that deal in March however when Blockbuster couldnt deliver the quantity or quality of movies Enron wanted Rice said Were working directly with the studios broadcasters and other producers to get content for that ourselves Rice said The company announced a deal with a gaming firm to let customers order and play a variety of video games through the Web shortly after the Blockbuster deal fell through but Wall Street quickly punished Enrons stock for the news Combined with word of the job shuffling on March the companys stock dropped more than percent in a single day and has continued to sag Since early March the stock lost more than percent of its value going from about to as low as but closed up on Thursday at Carol Coale a senior analyst with Prudential Securities said the market already made adjustments for the reshuffling of jobs at EBS and reacted to the dropping price of bandwidth The balance of the drop has been in reaction to the premium multiple they were getting for their technology in general Coale said What would make the stock go back up is if technology as a whole goes back up Chelmsford Mass Telecom Network Company Cuts Staff Earnings Forecast Peter J Howe KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News The Boston Globe Massachusetts Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Sycamore Networks the Chelmsford optical networking company that once dreamed of rivaling Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks yesterday said it will lay off workers It also slashed its earnings forecasts Facing the same imploding market for telecommunications gear that has battered Lucent Nortel and companies across the telecom industry Sycamore said its revenue for the quarter ending April is likely to come in at a stunning million below analyst forecasts or million to million That is only onethird of the last quarters sales Instead of earning cents a share as it did last quarter Sycamore forecast a loss of to cents per share heavily driven by up to million in onetime charges for firing workers writing off inventory and other expenses This percent reduction in staff is a difficult step to take but we believe it is a necessary one Sycamore president Daniel E Smith said in an analysts conference call last evening Sycamore said the layoffs will occur over the next three weeks and would not comment on severance packages Sycamore cited the same set of factors that have led Wall Street to punish telecom stocks it adored just a year ago Carriers are abruptly slowing down or abandoning spending on network upgrades as they struggle to make profits on their huge investments so far and try to determine how bad and how long the US economic slowdown will be Sycamore also said it has faced problems from an unnamed supplier in getting enough components to ship expected volumes of its highend SN optical switching device this quarter but hopes to have it worked out by May or June Sycamore chief financial officer Frances M Jewels said the company will not generate net cash from operations for the next several quarters but is in a fair position to ride out the slowdown Sycamore last month reported just under million in cash and shortterm securities plus another million in longterm liquid assets That should be ample to cover its typical payroll research and operating expenses of about million a month Jewels and Smith said that despite the collapse in revenue the company does not want to cut back so deeply on research and sales that it will hurt its chances of resuming sales growth The question is when not if service providers will return to investing in their infrastructure Smith said Sycamore recently bought a roughly acre parcel of land in Tyngsborough where it plans to build a new campus consolidating its farflung Chelmsford offices Those plans are still proceeding albeit at a much more modest pace Sycamore spokesman Richard Williams said last night Sycamore would not say which customers have cut back or dropped spending plans but noted that it is well known Williams Communications accounts for more than half of its revenue and that Williams has said it will slow down capital expenditures Sycamore said it recently turned down a sale to a customer who was demanding vendor financing or buying gear on credit It said two customers with which it had made such deals had drawn down only million of million in authorized credit Many analysts have said Sycamore sorely needs to branch out from its customer base of about a dozen emerging carriers like Williams Networks and Enron Broadband to land a marquee name like ATT SBC or Verizon Smith said Sycamore is getting positive feedback from trials at bigname US and foreign carriers of that ilk but gave no indication any sales deals are imminent Sycamore shares which have collapsed from highs of more than last year had risen to in Nasdaq Stock Market action

LONDON April Reuters Transport sector enduse is unlikely to provide a substantial boost to base metal demand in the coming year UBS WarburgEnron Metals said in their LME weekly metal report on Friday Depending on the metal enduse by the transport sector makes up a large proportion of overall demand for most of the base metals complex Only in tin does it appear to be less than ten percent of total demand it said The bulk of the transport demand is from the motor vehicles industry UBS Warburg economist Warren Oliver said in the report Aluminium is also used in the aerospace sector while nickel is utilised in a wide range of transport applications the report added North America Japan and Western Europe account for around percent of world auto production although developing economies are begining to play an important role USB Warburg auto equity research team estimates show despite five percent increases in global auto production for and reaching million units last year production is likely to stagnate or even decrease in UBS Warburg forecasts global production of million units a decline of percent from Wide variations in regional production for are expected the report said Of the large OECD producers the US is likely to show a substantial decline Japan a small decline and Western Europe a small increase it said US production which was above the long term trend is expected to fall backwards because of production cut backs by the Big Three carmakers While other producers in North America are increasing production seemingly confident in winning market share this is swamped by cutbacks by GM Ford and Chrysler DE the report said Elsewhere Japanese output has been decreasing during the s Annual average output will show little change in and stay close to the trend line over

above the typical range of Wall Street estimates of million Indeed in each of the three months of the first quarter US sales have surpassed consensus estimates While we expect a deterioration of sales performance in coming months it is true that car sales have held up better than expected But car sales for the first two months of the year in Germany which accounts for around a quarter of the European market are down five percent yearonyear The rebound in German unemployment is one sign that consumer spending could disappoint in coming months and autos could be particularly at risk Declining demand from the auto sector poses a clear risk it added So although car sales have been better than expected in such markets as the US there is still concern the transport sector may not

Insurers seen more involved in credit derivatives By Tom Burroughes Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON Feb Reuters Insurance firms are expected to step deeper into the credit derivatives market as they wake up to rich pickings in this field and as splits between financial sectors blur further Insurers have provided clients with protection against credit problems for decades so dealing in credit derivatives is a logical next step according to George Sandars a partner at international law firm Denton Wilde Sapte There is a tendency for the regulation of markets to converge Being so analogous to insurance it credit derivatives is an obvious area for insurers to build business in said Sandars who is the author of a Denton Wilde Sapte report on alternative risk transfer Looking across all credit derivative contracts the British Bankers Association last year estimated insurers made up percent of protection sellers and seven percent of protection buyers Banks continue to dominate the market A NEW ASSET CLASS A senior trader for a US reinsurance firm in New York who declined to be named believes for the foreseeable future insurers will focus on selling credit derivatives to acquire assets rather than buying to them offset liability Insurers are taking on such risks for their asset portfolios he said However some insurers are starting to buy credit derivatives too We have seen enquiry from insurers to buy credit protection and that has grown in the last year Given the significant increase in defaults over the last few months that are out of line with historical experience the insurers who are comfortable with statistics and mortality are getting a bit concerned he said Reinsurance firms have tended to be more heavily involved in trading credit derivatives than insurers because the repackaging of existing insurance deals meant firms had to look harder at the kind of risks they faced he said As for insurers overall use of credit derivatives he said I wouldnt say they are significant but they are getting to be more important Most of the credit derivative market is being driven by the banks mostly for regulatory and capital reasons His firm estimates insurers take up to percent of total credit derivative business One type of derivative particularly attractive to insurers are bankruptcy swaps said Bryan Seyfried vice president of Enron Credit Enron Credit is energy firm Enrons credit risk management arm and provides data on bankruptcy swaps Bankruptcy is a less ambiguous event than default which is currently plagued by debate over documentation and definitions and insurers would not face uncertainty about payouts on contracts he said In default swaps insurers tended to prefer deals involving a basket of names rather than an individual one so they can spread risk Seyfried said INSURERS EXPERIENCE Insurers have long experience in offering protection against problems such as default or bankruptcy Companies like US bond insurer MBIA for example guarantee debt for firms such as US utility Southern Californian Edison which is currently facing a crisis due to soaring energy prices If an issuer defaults the insurer will pay the interest and principal amounts to creditors Traditionally they also provide surety bonds which are issued to vendors and which guarantee that a vendor who bids on a contract will carry out the obligation INDIA Indian state unable to pay Enronchief minister Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited BOMBAY Feb Reuters The western Indian state of Maharashtra

deal Crown is a very aggressive company and theyre looking to bring in whole new teams Crown based in Zug Switzerland as is Marc Rich Investments is part of Alfa Group a Russian industrial and financial conglomerate with activities in a wide spectrum of banking and commodities businesses Rumours have circulated for months that the company wants to buy Marc Rich Investments owned by the eponymous billionaire who fled to Switzerland almost years ago after being indicted on charges of wire fraud racketeering and income tax evasion Many industry insiders have speculated that Rich is ready to once again cash out of the market particularly after his pardon last month by Bill Clinton Having already developed two successful commodity trading companies the first one he sold years ago

trading teams and anxious for a move into metals trade Our policy is not to comment on any type of discussion on acquisition I can only say we are a growing organisation said a spokesman for Crown Resources in London We are currently focused on energy trading We would like to diversify into other commodities as well including ferrous and nonferrous metals Theres no sense of urgency for us and it all depends on the right opportunities Once a member of the powerful triumverate that dominated the physical metals market together with Enron and Glencore Marc Richs metals operations have waned in recent years Following the closure of its ferroalloys trading unit the companys metals trading operations are now said to be about one third of the size of those of its leading rivals I think Marc Rich are fairly thin on the ground in metals now said one UK trader Last years Trafigura rumours coincided with a flurry of resignations from the companys metals trading staff But compared to the giant stature of the market leaders Marc Rich is one of the few bitesize acquisitions that could propel Crown into the midst of the metals trade business Crown would also gain access to Marc Richs wellregarded name in the industry and the companys contacts including close relationships in the Mediterranean crude oil market and recently developed ties in the realm of African oil products For a Russian company this gives them a big in on the West said one industry insider Crown now focuses largely on marketing some two million tonnes a month of crude from Tyumen Oil part owned by Alfa Group

Business Standard Youre all Englishspeaking You are the opinionmakers of the country Wh y dont you spend some time understanding Indian realities His words fell on the audience like the staccato of an AK assault rifle They were dead on target some of Delhis bestheeled businessmen gathered together at the Ashoka Hotel convention hall S Gurumurthy Sangh Parivars swadeshi ideologue had been invited to deliver a lecture on a serious issu e Challenges and opportunities before the country But also sharing the dai s with him and speaking on the subject were film stars Amrish Puri and Pooj a Batra It was clear that he was not too happy about this I was in the audience waiting for the conference to end I had to take Gurumurthy to lunch His speech ended with muted but unmistakably snide remarks from the audience But he also walked away with maximum applause To me this illustrated the most striking element about his personality you c an love Gurumurthy or hate him but you cant ignore him We walked to the neighbouring Samrat Hotels Kamakshi restaurant because Gurumurthy likes simple south Indian vegetarian food Straightaway we ordered rasam and papad as starters Gurumurthy was still upset The organisers should have prepared the audience for such serious topics as this he said As the bowls of rasam and the papad arrived I prepared myself for a sessio n with the man considered to be an influential link between the RSS and the BJP He wields tremendous clout but avoids displaying it on his sleeve Were you always in the RSS I asked No I was closely associated with Kamrajjis Congress till his death he said to my surprise Kamrajji used to like me a lot and our approach was to deDravidianise Tamil Nadu politically he revealed This figured I know this is politically incorrect but it must be said Gurumurthy is a Brahmin and like most of his ilk he was ideologically at the receiving end of the virulent antiBrahmin movement which swept Tamil Nadu in the s That it has now waned and even leaders of Dravidian parties follow Brahminical rituals these days says a lot about the rethinking on the issue Are you a practitioner of Brahminism I asked This was a Did you beat your wife last night kind of question I wanted to provoke Gurumurthy wh o even his colleagues admit symbolises traditional Brahminism Gratifyingly he rose to the bait Call me Brahminist or retrograde it doesnt bother m e If Dravidianism is good then Brahminism is equally good Gurumurthy said a flash of belligerence flaring He explained his political theory of deDravidianisation of Tamil Nadu Dravidianism was political speculation which became political reality It Dravidianism was poison injected by th e British he said That Gurumurthy originally came from the Congress fold was news but more revelations were to follow He was most appreciative of Indira Gandhis efforts to deDravidianise Tamil Nadu by forging an alliance with the DMK i n the s This was indeed a positive contribution of Indira Gandhi he said Coming from a Sangh stalwart this was significant After Kamrajs death Gurumurthy found himself in the company of the legendary and irrepressible media baron Ram Nath Goenka From here began h is association with the RSS It was a political assignment he said recounting the past This was the time when Jayaprakash Narayan began his war against Indira Gandhi and Goenkas The Indian Express played a crucial role in the campaign Obviously in those circumstances my job was more than a financial advisers he said But how did you get attracted to the RSS I asked curiously It was the sincerity of people in the RSS that attracted me They are the gentlest people I have ever come across Had I not come into contact with the RSS I would have been a hundred times richer in terms of money but I would have been a thousand times poorer in other respects said the chartered accountant who virtually reveres his association with the Sangh Parivar But youre influential because you are associated with the RSS I said A t one or other time many in the party and government have felt and said th at Gurumurthy and his Swadeshi Jagran Manch hold a brief for only some Indian industrialists and use their closeness to the RSS to camouflage this Give me one example when Ive used my influence in the government he sai d flatly You have suggested to the Prime Minister indirectly that he should remove an officer from the PMO I said Indirectly No you are mistaken This was a direct suggestion Such officers are a blot on a great leader li ke Atal Bihari Vajpayee and I have never been circumspect on the issue he said adding that had he been influential his suggestions would have been accepted My opinion may be powerful but it does not mean I wield power he explained Gurumurthy asked for curdrice for the main course a dish all south Indian Brahmins swear by it is also P V Narasimha Raos favourite food He continued on the earlier theme It is unfortunate that in years the system has produced very few Bhure Lals an IAS officer who was one of V P Singhs favourite officers What did he think about the present government The problem is that an AngloSaxon class continues to rule the country Such people have serious limitations in understanding Indian realities They run the country like a Bishop runs the Church In the process elite India has become the real India he said Being a believer in cultural nationalism Gurumurthy hastened to add This divide is only perceptional What links them is even ts like the Kumbh Culture and religion are the interface where elites and subaltern meet This is why secular parties are oblivious to real India h e said You have been consistent in opposing the governments economic policies W hy is it that even Vajpayee who belongs to the Sangh is pursuing the same course I asked What I really wanted to know was his views on the speculation about strained relation between the government and the Sangh Parivar on economic issues The government is not the sole arbiter of economic issues This is determined outside the government Just as the atmosphere for socialism was determined by forces outside the government the atmosphere needed to pursu e policies of globalisation is being decided outside the government he said If this is such an obvious trap why are people like Vajpayee and Yashwant Sinha falling into it I demanded They cannot function in isolation Wha t we have is intellectual extremism of the Englishspeaking class he said Extremism I asked as we ordered coffee They the Englishspeaking class are the one who espoused Enrons cause They are the ones who suggested that billions of foreign exchange would pou r in once the insurance sector was opened up Did they prove to be correct Gurumurthy asked triumphantly Are these people including the financial newspapers ready to accept that they were wrong in their assessment he said If the people who supported Enron accept that it was a mistake the country would be per cent more intelligent He continued This class never accepts that the past was a mistake Forgetting the past is a typical characteristic whether it is the issue of the Ram Temple socialism or Enron Perhaps this was the closest Gurumurthy could come to admitting his growin g disenchantment with the present regime On reforms he said Policies are largely bureaucracyled and there is no political control over what is believed to be reforms he said Another intriguing statement We finished lunch and prepared to leave I mentally summed up all that Gurumurthy had said The one thing that came forcefully to mind was his complete contempt for anyone including those in his own party who belongs to what he calls the AngloSaxon class As I bid him goodbye I decided that to get to the bottom of that mystery will need many more lunches Gurumurthys subconscious needs to be explored It is a puzzle wrapped in an enigma NTPC should also absorb some part of DPC power Renni Abraham MUMBAI Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard Maharashtra finance and planning minister Jayant Rajaram Patil has said tha t invocation of the government of India counterguarantee by the Dabhol Power Company has set the stage for the resolution of the Enron crisis Talking t o Business Standard Patil spoke on the state governments future course of action and several other issues Excerpts Please comment on DPC invoking the Centres counterguarantee The move is aimed at resolving the crisis We have made it clear that the high DPC tariffs have become unaffordable for the Maharashtra State Electricity Board Also it is not financially prudent for the state government to bail out MSEB in respect of the DPC payments every month A logical solution has to be found within the MSEB itself which has to be abl e to absorb the DPC power With the GOI counterguarantee invoked the state is set for resolving the whole issue The solution has to involve the central government as it was the Centre that had invited the power major and solicited others like Cogentrix to invest Maharashtra with a favourable industrial climate became the testing ground for the setting up of first such power project What led to the present crisis and how is this being addressed to Even the setting up of review committee has been inordinately delayed Maharashtra economy cannot sustain payments to DPCs phase II which too ha s been sanctioned I do not want to rake up the politics behind this We have to look forward to resolving the problem on hand As far as Maharashtra is concerned the eightparty Democratic Front government has unanimously decided that the present high DPC tariff is not affordable and has to be rationalised The Centre has to actively look into it As far as the delay in the review committees constitution is concerned th e task would be completed soon We have shortlisted a number of experts and a re seeking to constitute an independent body of experts to look at the multifo ld aspect of the DPC project and suggest ways to resolve the present crisis T he panel would probably be asked to immediately submit a set of recommendation s to resolve the issues at hand while looking at the various other options before it and suggest multifold recommendations to the government What options does the government have There are several lines of thought with regard to resolving the DPC issue The state government is clear that the DPC will have to make available cheaper power Another option could be staggering phase II For instance block B and C of phase II could be staggered We know that once the jetty f or LNG is commissioned by DPC the tariffs would be reduced substantially Similarly we would be keen to look into the possibility of restructuring t he rupeedollar arrangement so that the risk of foreign exchange fluctuations are reduced The panel would look into this aspect as well MSEB has to be able to afford DPC power Along with cheaper tariffs it might also be necessary for the National Thermal Power Corporation to absorb some part of the power generated by DPC The Centre should take some component from Phas e I and II We have to resolve the present crisis as a nation and a state Why did DPC not invoke the Letter of Credit before the GOM and GOI guarantees The Rs crore LC was not invoked for obvious reasons By invoking the GO M and GOI guarantees a deadend has been reached as far as brokering pieceme al solutions are concerned Now the issue has to be resolve in totality We want to reach a new understanding with DPC on the project in which the Centre will have to get into the picture Union energy minister Suresh Prab hu has been stating that the Maharashtra government should forward a proposal for resolving the issue We are in the process of doing just that Metro Desk THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY CRISIS Deregulation Didnt Foster Competition NICHOLAS RICCARDI STEVE BERRY TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company The way people scrambled for a stake in Californias power market three yea rs ago youd have thought it was the second coming of the Gold Rush Politicians and free marketers boasted that they were freeing millions of customers from their monopolistic utilities so they could shop for cheaper electricity The state ordered an million publicity campaign promising a brave new energy world bustling with competition But those dreams of capitalism unleashed never materialized dashed by provisions in the deregulation law that effectively undermined competition and gave the utilities a substantial edge over newcomers In th e end only of the utilities residential users switched to other providers many opting to pay more for green energy Although the chaos swirling around Californias electricity crisis has chiefly focused on soaring wholesale prices the virtual absence of competition at the consumer level has played a key role in deregulations undoing Had competition among retailers flourished garnering the millions of customers deregulators expected prices might never have reached todays unprecedented peaks and the turmoil might have been tempered economists an d retailers say Retail competition would not have prevented a crisis but it would have toned it down said Richard Counihan spokesman for Green Mountain Energy which has returned most of its customers to the utilities ranks Now even the prospect of competition is gone A measure enacted by the Legislature last week which made state government the biggest electricity buyer in California suspended further retail competition preventing anyon e from underbidding the state That buries us said Tony Wayne president of UtiliSource of Brea which under the new law can keep its relatively small number of customers but is barred from entering into new contracts Few thought it would come to this High Hopes Collide With Reality Almost firms registered with the state to sell electricity to consumers Many of them quickbuck hucksters or smalltime operations were scared of f by background checks fingerprinting and the deposit required to enter the market But then there were the likes of giant Enron Corp which predicted that th e new market would pull customers from the utilities in the first few weeks Another firm deployed salespeople nabbing residential and business prospects by the thousands They quickly discovered that the structure of Californias landmark deregulation effort erected protective barriers preventing most retailers from beating the prices of the big three utilitiesSouthern California Edison Pacific Gas Electric and San Diego Gas Electric For example deregulation law allowed the utilities to keep their million customers until each took the initiative to switch Any ratepayer who used a moderate amount of energy and wanted to change companies had to pay fo r a new meterunless the retailer wanted to eat the cost itself In contrast Pennsylvania where deregulation has been more successful than in California requires most of its utilities to surrender some of their customers Last year customers of one utility were auctioned off t o the retailer who could promise them the most savings All together close t o million customers have switched from utilities to retailers with savings estimates ranging from a few dollars to per month In California the next barrier was expressly designed by deregulation architects to keep new retailers at bay at least temporarily Before throwing utilities into a freeforall lawmakers felt obligated to give them time to pay off debts that would hurt their ability to offer competitive prices The Legislature froze customer prices at levels well above what the utilities were then paying for electricity The difference would be used to pay their debts The hitch for prospective retailers was that their customerslike those remaining with utilitieswould be charged the extra amount too That seriously hurt the retailers ability to shave prices for their customers without taking a hit themselves Utility executives say the socalled competition transition charge accomplished its intent providing some protection against new players unti l the utilities could shed their debt and compete on an even field According to those executives the plan went awry when wholesale electricit y prices soared before the special debt charge was lifted and competition had a chance to flourish We havent had enough time for this market to work said Denise Grant director of the Edison division that works with retailers She said Edison expected to lose customers annuallya far cry from what has happened Retailers say they faced other obstacles that seemed designed to help the utilities keep as many of their customers as possible One of the biggest was a newly created energy marketplace called the Power Exchange Under the exchanges rules all buyerslittle guys with a few hundred customers and mammoth utilities with millionspaid the same price for electricity Once again retailers were stymied in their search for ways to cut their customers bills Retailers had no place else to shop for energy because suppliers could make more money selling in high volume to billiondollar utilities on the Power Exchange rather than cutting small deals with upstart companies Wayne the president of UtiliSource learned the hard way He was peddling electricity in California in early before the state created the Power Exchange After arranging a good but informal deal with a Washington generator he sent out hundreds of salespeople took to the road himself an d soon cornered customers But the birth of the exchange caused the death of his deal Wayne said The generators pulled out when they realized how much money they could make selling on the open market That was an ohmygod They said Why should we give you a discount when we can sell it to the Power Exchange ourselves he said Retailers say the state protects the utilities in subtler but no less damaging ways That includes billing customers who switch companies for certain overhead costs of their old utilities such as weather forecasters and accountants involved in procuring electricity In late a coalition of retailers filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission arguing that their customers should not be forced to p ay costs for utilities they had decided to leave Earlier this month the PUC finally reached a decision that favors the retailers argument but accepts the utilities calculations of the expenses borne by retailers an amount critics say is far too low In dissenting Commissioner Richard A Bilas called the decisions paltry award to retailers another strike against them We cannot keep stymieing retail competition if we are seeking rational markets he said Energy service providers retailers have left the stat e in droves They need all the encouragement we can give them Retailers Found Little Opportunity Be they multinational giants or kitchentable entrepreneurs retailers are dismayed by their experiences with deregulation Enron spent million trying to sell electricity in and the spring of But unable to offer enticing discounts the firm picked up only customers In a recent meeting with reporters and editors at The Times Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay suggested that the framers of deregulation kept marke t forces pinned down in the retail sector As a result there was little mone y to be made and little incentive to stick around The more customers you signed up Lay said the more money you lost Last week Enron returned a number of its remaining electricity contracts t o PGE In the end Lay said we couldnt change the rules and we pulled out On the other end of the spectrum Paul Oshideri is now a oneman operation since he laid off his seven employees during his unprofitable two years trying to entice customers to Cucamonga Energy You dont have that many options said Oshideri who is still holding on to his customers and vows not to quit What can you do You cant do anything right now Only when it came to businesses and big institutions such as universities were retailers able to make a dent in the market The small price reduction s they offered translated into huge savings for those large users of electricity The retailers also offered a variety of other services including aid to help businesses become more energy efficient Although fewer than of all residential customers have switched to new energy companies of industrial users have done so according to the Public Utilities Commission If theyd structured this differently they would have had households able to make big savings just like industrials said Cal State Fullerton economist Robert Michaels There is some dispute among deregulation critics over whether legislators designed the law to protect the utilities from an onslaught of competition or it just turned out that way Jesse Knight a former member of the Public Utilities Commission who dissented on the panels deregulation plan said the law is biased against retail competition But I dont think it was the legislations intent to protect the monopoly Knight said There is general agreement however that not enough attention was paid to the mechanics of the retail market Much of the deregulation legislation deals with generation transmission an d wholesale prices of electricity The only provisions on the retail end simp ly allow consumers to shop for deals Lay the Enron executive recalled that the utilities fought hard to mainta in their customer base The irony is that with wholesale prices skyrocketing over the last six months buying electricity for all those customers has driven the utilities to the brink of insolvency With hindsight I expect they wish theyd agreed to more choice at t he customer level Lay said Then maybe they wouldnt be in the circumstance s theyre in BusinessFinancial Desk Section C COMPANY NEWS DABHOL ENRON UNIT IN INDIA INVOKES

Anthony Texas Energy Company Thrives in Californias Deregulated Atmosphere Brandon Bailey KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News San Jose Mercury News Californ ia Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM Though it produces hardly any power for California consumers a Texas energ y company is thriving in a deregulated energy marketplace that it helped shap e Through a combination of business and political savvy the Houstonbased company Enron Corp has become a leading trader in the states little kno wn but increasingly important wholesale power market And while critics contend Enrons soaring fortunes suggest too much influen ce over a badly flawed system some analysts simply credit the company with skillfully operating in a world that barely existed a decade ago where electricity is traded like soy beans or oil The sellers have all the leverage and all the brains And the buyers have been slow and stupid said John White an environmental lobbyist who track s energy issues What I wish is that the buyers side of the California mark et had people as smart and clever and aggressive as Enron Even as California overhauls its market Enron will likely play a big part in the states energy future Partly as a result of state and federal policies that Enron has championed wholesale trading is now a crucial link in the process of delivering electricity to homes and businesses nationwide Those policies are unlikely to change under President George W Bush who counts Enron chairman Ken Lay as a friend campaign contributor and energy adviser Enron reported record operating profits of billion last year excludin g onetime adjustments Thats up percent from Most of its revenue came from wholesale operations While Enron doesnt provide financial results for each state company CEO Jeff Skilling said th is week that California accounted for about percent of the companys billion in sales Weve probably bought and sold more power than any other marketmaker in t he West said Enron executive vice president Steven Kean Originally a gas pipeline firm Enron now has many interests from building power plants in India to trading wood products and telecommunications bandwidth online It recently launched a venture with Blockbuster to deliv er videos over a fiber optic network But Enrons primary business involves acting as a middleman between energy producers and the companies that deliv er power to consumers At the companys story Houston headquarters Enron traders use sophisticated software to monitor supply and demand often based on such variables as weather plant breakdowns and availability of fuel Traders buy power from sources all over the region independent generator s local utilities public agencies or other traders and assume the risk of finding someone willing to pay a little more Or they will contract to sell electricity at a certain rate betting on their ability to obtain that powe r more cheaply Theyll take positions based on where they think prices are going to go said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum which has member firms This is a guessing game Enron does it better than most Enrons traders may buy from several sources to supply one customer Or the y might purchase a large volume and sell it off in slices either on the spot market or in longterm contracts They understand financial markets and they understand risk management sa id Jim Angel a finance professor at Georgetown University That gives them a big competitive advantage over the old dinosaurs of the industry Enron pioneered such trading he said building on skills it developed in t he natural gas business But today most power companies are involved in simil ar deals As a generator my production cost might be cents Ackerman said If someone else is offering the same commodity for cents just for this wee k Ill shut down my plant and buy their power and then turn around and resell it Some critics suggest a market based on such price changes is too risky for a commodity as essential as electricity Attorneys have filed two consumer lawsuits accusing generators and traders of manipulating supplies to drive up prices But traders deny those allegations Enrons Kean said they help find supply to meet demand while their longterm contracts protect buyers from price spikes Kean said Enron makes a profit buying and selling no matter if prices are high or low Those transactions are increasingly integral to the energy industry as it tries to balance out surpluses and shortages around the region Ackerman estimated the volume of electricity sold back and forth on a given day is often ten times the amount actually delivered to consumers Such trading will continue he said even though the state is now negotiati ng longterm contracts with energy providers The traders will still try to beat the costs of serving those contracts And traders may benefit from the demise of the states Power Exchange The central spot market is closing because its largest customers the utilities are insolvent Without the exchange to post an hourly rate said James Bushnell of the University of California Energy Institute there really isnt much in the way of meaningful price information any more And that does advantage marketers The cynical interpretation is that if buyers and sellers dont have the information the marketers can make money Enron was an outspoken opponent of the exchange when California first plann ed for deregulation Over the last decade Enron has joined forces with manufacturers and industrial interests in a number of states as they lobbied for permission to bypass local utilities and negotiate for better deals with competing suppliers In challenging the wellentrenched utilities Enron has built its own political clout The company and its employees gave million to federal campaigns in the last election cycle according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics Enron donated to California campaigns in including to Gov Gray Davis The company also has deployed its own army of lobbyists and consultants A few years ago it hired former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed for advice on building grassroots support In California it recruited former staffers from the Public Utilities Commission to help make its case During Californias early discussions state regulators embraced a utilitybacked plan for a single agency to run the states transmission gri d and operate a central exchange for wholesale energy transactions But Enron and its allies argued the agency would be dominated by the utilities which would discourage competition and make it harder to negotia te lower prices In the end California adopted a compromise It created the Power Exchange mandatory for utilities and voluntary for others and a separate agency the Independent System Operator to run the states transmission grid Critics suggest the complex decentralized structure has made it easier to abuse the market by withholding supplies or taking advantage of congestion on the transmission grid to drive up prices But no one has produced evidence tying any company to wrongdoing And Enron denies taking any unfair advantage The fact of the matter is its easy to blame people from out of state sa id Kean It tends to deflect attention from some of the real causes of the problem The real underlying cause was that you had rapid demand growth and you didnt have enough supply Enron has plans to increase Californias supply Though it currently has on ly has a windpower facility near Tehachapi its planning a megawatt gaspowered plant in Kern County and has three more up for licensing The company also has sought to build a retail business aimed at industrial and commercial clients It abandoned an earlier effort to sign up residenti al customers in after concluding that California utilities had succeeded in structuring deregulation to discourage competition for those customers But Enron has contracts with commercial clients to provide a range of services from advising on energy efficiency to supplying power at a guaranteed rate As Skilling recently told industry analysts Enrons business is packaging energy supplies for our customers It doesnt matter he explained if that energy comes from a plant that Enr on owns or from a contract with another supplier Its all part of

California Is a Surprise Bonanza By Chip Cummins Dow Jones Newswires The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Last quarter Anadarko Petroleum Corp a Houston oilandgas concern discovered an unexpected bonus from last years acquisition of rival Union Pacific Resources Group Inc The purchase it turns out included commitments to transport natural gas along a pipeline running from the Rocky Mountains into California For year s those contracts werent worth much But late last year naturalgas prices skyrocketed especially for gas delivered to California Thanks to its hold on precious space in one of a handful of pipelines into the state Anadarko booked about million in extra profit in the fourth quarter It may see more in the first quarter Call it a California bonanza for naturalgas companies While wholesale naturalgas prices have eased in some parts of the country such as in West Texas where prices are hovering around to per thousand cubic feet the gas can fetch twice as much if it is delivered in California Natural g as was recently changing hands at as much as to per thousand cubic fee t at Topock Ariz a pricing hub on the California border Regional gas prices often fluctuate because of unusual weather or pipeline disruptions But Californias gas premium has been remarkable for how wide it has grown and how long it has lingered Its a pretty major change in market dynamics says Art Gelber principal at Gelber Associates a Houston energyconsulting and assetresources fir m The simple explanation for the difference Naturalgas demand continues to outstrip the states own modest production and pipeline capacity for outofstate gas hasnt kept up According to the California Energy Commission the state produced just of the gas it consumed in the most recent year for which figures are available Of the nearly billion cubic feet of gas a day California imported almost half came from the Southwest an additional came from Canada and from the Rocky Mountain states To get that gas from the wel l to users gas marketers buy up capacity in a limited number of Californiabound pipelines With a shortage of pipeline capacity transportation costs have climbed and are passed along to end users Californias pain has turned into unexpected gain for a handful of companie s Occidental Petroleum Corp a big California gas producer is finding its g as is suddenly much more valuable than it was just a few months ago In a rece nt conference call with analysts the company noted that prices in California have been more than higher per thousand cubic feet of gas than elsewhere in the country which the company said will be reflected in the firstquart er earnings Both Occidental and Anadarko have spent time explaining the unusual California gains to Wall Street and any windfalls this quarter are likely already priced into their shares analysts say In pm composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Occidental rose cents to while Anadarko rose to Considering the companies diverse oilandgas portfolios Californias recent volatility wouldnt likely move stock prices much anyway But the experiences of Occidental and Anadarko in the state highlight what unforese en surprises can pop up in such an unbalanced commodity market California is serviced by four major pipelines Transwestern Pipeline Co a subsidiary of Enron Corp operates a line from West Texas into Southern California El Paso Corps El Paso Natural Gas Co runs another pipeline largely parallel to Transwestern PGE Corps PGE Gas Transmission Co brings gas down from Canada and Williams Cos Kern River pipeline brings gas in from the Rocky Mountains For years the contracts on the Kern River line and other pipelines that Anadarko inherited from Union Pacific were money losers as transportation rights into California traded at a discount There was plenty of gas going into California and California didnt need any more says David Larson Anadarkos manager of investor relations But by the end of last year the contracts were soaring in value With California gas consumption ballooning to meet soaring electricitygeneration demand the states pipelines filled up quickly Normally other suppliers would redirect gas to places where the price was highest and the situation would work itself out But capacity is so limite d that producers simply cant get more gas to California In its complicated contractual agreements involving a handful of gas marketers Anadarko was able to realize big gains in essence agreeing to transport other producers gas into California Anadarkos contracts lay ou t fixed rates for slots in the pipelines but the company can pocket gains if market rates for the transportation rise above the fixed rates Anadarko booked the fourthquarter gain by valuing its contracts at current market prices called marking to market The contracts stretch out over several years and with rates still volatile Anadarko could book more profit should the market price of the contracts continue to soar Mr Larson says the contracts could add million to million to the companys bottom line in the current quarter though their value could just as easily fall resulting in a charge Meanwhile Occidental based in Los Angeles produces and markets a little more than million cubic feet of natural gas a day in California The higher prices that gas is currently fetching there is likely to show up on its bottom line this quarter Occidentals Elk Hills field is producing at about above its stated capacity says John Allen general manager for the operation about

article Californias Power Crisis May Slow Asia Deregulation Update Adds comment from government in paragraph seven that sale of Korea Electric Power Corp will go ahead on schedule Sydney Feb Bloomberg Asian officials are backing away from deregulating their electricity industries after bungled reforms in California caused power blackouts and pushed the states two biggest utilities to the brink of bankruptcy Companies and consumers will have a longer wait for cheaper power as governments from Korea and Japan to Taiwan and Malaysia delay plans to break up or deregulate monopoly electricity companies Korea is reviewing plans to separate statecontrolled Korea Electric Power Corps coal and gasfired power plants into five companies The break up is scheduled for April Stable supply is our first priority Shin Kook Hwan Koreas commerce industry and energy minister said last week Thats more important than leaving electricity supply in the hands of market rules especially in light of Californias power crisis Malaysias biggest utility Tenaga Nasional Bhd last month asked the government to halt the opening of the power industry while Australian companies are complaining their countrys system similar to that of California needs an overhaul Asian governments are going to pause and take a deep breath before they dive into the next phase of deregulation said Rob Booth managing director of Bardak Group an Australian energy consultancy While Korea is looking at the implications of the California power crisis the government said this will not delay the sale of its stake in Korea Electric Power Corp starting The government has percent of Kepco which will be sold off in stages LA to KL Californias legislature last week voted to issue as much as billion in bonds to help rescue PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric and Edison Internationals Southern California Edison which ran out of money as the price they paid for power rose eight fold in less than a year PGE and Edison have run up more than billion in debt from buying power Pricecutting was the goal in California but it all went wrong PGE and Edison piled up debt because Californias electricity deregulation law set no limits on the price they pay for power but capped the rates they can bill consumers Producers and distributors of power were supposed to match their needs through a central pool where the price was set depending on supply and demand As demand rose and environmental restrictions discouraged building of new power stations supplies tightened and generators pushed the price above the rate the utilities could charge customers Power outages in California show the power pooling system hasnt benefited customers said Fuad Jaafar chief executive of Tenaga which is twothirds government owned and the biggest Southeast Asian power utility by sales Power Down Its in Australia though that the biggest parallels to California are being drawn Australia is the only country in Asia which has split up and deregulated its power industry and is one of only four places in the world which chose to use the pool pricesetting mechanism invented in the UK which has failed in California Australia is the last place in the world still trying to get one of these UKstyle markets to work said Booth All the others California the UK and Alberta province in Canada are abandoning the system because it gives electricity generators too much power to manipulate prices to boost their profits said Booth Bob Lim an adviser to the Energy Markets Reform Forum said its members large industrial power users in southeastern Australia dont want to be named because theyre negotiating power supply agreements and finding it difficult to agree reasonable prices Thats an early symptom of whats happening said Lim There is a lot of nervousness about the market because of the fundamentally flawed trading system While there is concern about pool trading analysts say Australias system is more resilient because unlike in California energy retailers have been able to use forward purchases and other agreements to fix prices for much of their future power needs Meantime a number of companies are benefiting from higher power prices Origin Energy Ltd a gas retailer and distributor is the best pick among Australianlisted companies which own generating plants said JB Were utilities analyst Gavin Rogers in a report It owns peak power generation plants has no current exposure to electricity retailing and controls neartomarket gas reserves hedging it from any future input cost increases Rogers said Most Australian generating plants are either stateowned or controlled by overseas companies Edison International owns Loy Yang B power station in Victoria state while NRG Energy Inc of the US has a one quarter stake in the adjacent A billion Loy Yang A station Other foreign investors include AES Corp of the US UK based International Power Plc and Powergen Plc and CLP Holdings Ltd of Hong Kong Elsewhere In Japan deregulation poses a different problem Increased competition could leave generators with too much capacity discouraging the construction of new cleaner and more efficient power stations Japanese electricity producers such as Tokyo Electric Power Co the largest will face a tougher market said Yoshinori Moda a utility analyst at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo Electricity companies will likely lose after deregulation because they dont have an alternative other than reducing prices or losing customers he said Japans government on March last year opened percent of the power market to competition allowing nonutilities to retail electricity directly to factories and other big users Deregulation has forced Tokyo Electric or Tepco and other power utilities to reduce charges and cut costs to deter potential market entrants Tepcos rate cuts in October last year will reduce the companys sales by billion yen during the six months to March the company said in November Some parts of the world such as Scandinavia and several northeastern US states have succeeded in deregulation by allowing generators and their customers to agree power sale contracts outside the pool said Booth Thats the way the UK and California are going as well he said But he warned that usually there are too few power generators in an individual market to create sufficient competition that would allow regulators to relax Even with conventional trading systems of the type that have been successful you still have to have enough competition to keep people honest said Booth Stephen

fingerpointing the shouting the machinations in the darkand many Californians agree The state desperately needs to build n ew power plants Over the last decade the population has climbed to million The peak demand for electricity on a hot day in July has climbed to megawatts The number of big power plants built in the state since zero Whos to blame Even though theyve driven out industry environmentalists are now crying Dont look at uswed love to see some new plants built since they could replace some older dirtier ones Says Richard Ferguson head of the Sierra Clubs California Energy Committee We need new generation and the old plants are hogging our air space The bureaucrats havent helped While the California Energy Commission has recently greenlighted ten new plants it will be years before they come on line Applications take an achingly slow months to work their way throug h the permit process compared with days in Texas Texas has built nine large power plants since In California as many as assessments from historical significance to impact on fish and wildlifecan require changes to the blueprints Result Ancillary costs to developers in California run as high as million for one project compared with million in Texas The utilities deserve some blame for bad forecastingand for the financi al ruin that is being visited upon them says Peter Huber in his column see T he Kilowatt Casino They agreed to buy electricity at spot prices and to sell at fixed retail prices figuring they could clean up on the easy spread between the two prices For several years they did make some nice money thi s way Wholesale prices got as low as cents a kilowatthour while the reta il rate was close to cents Then the wholesale price spiked last summer to cents The two biggest California utilities PGE and Edison International lost billion between them since last summer and have wrecked their credit ratings Potential builders of generating stations dont want to sel l to such shaky customers Blame politicians too for preventing plant construction In October Governor Gray Davis put a ceiling on wholesale rates at cents a kilowatthour but in December he made it a soft cap allowing wholesaler s to sell above that if they could provide the state with a reason for charging more Still it had a chilling effect Right after the governors move Calpine a wholesale generator yanked six of seven applications to build socalled peaker plants These are tiny megawattorless dynamos that operate only to days a year when demand peaks and electricity should command a premium price Twentyfive cents does not go very far in this kind of plant With the spot price of natural gas at delivered th e fuel for a kilowatthour runs about a dime Now figure in construction cost s million for megawatts that have to be amortized over a relatively small number of kilowatthours and you have a formula for losses if the pla nt is in a state where the governor wants to put profiteers in jail Next on our list of plantstoppers the neighbors Sunlaws proposal to bui ld a megawatt million plant in southeast Los Angeles county hasnt h it any snags with the CEC or the South Coast Air Quality

Electricity Board The government of Maharashtra a western Indian state where Dabhol Powers plant is located failed to honor its guarantee the company said in a statement We are disappointed that this decision had to be taken Neil McGregor president at Dabhol said in the statement We have little choice but to invoke the guarantee because the power bills for November and December were overdue Dabhol is percent owned by Enron the worlds No energy trader Dabhol has invested billion in the megawattsayear project making it the biggest foreign direct investor in the country Its prospects could influence further overseas investment in the industry The government must recognize the serious domestic and international implications of contractual agreements not being honoured McGregor said India has percent less electricity than it needs according to the Ministry of Power and needs about billion in investments to meet demand over the next years Power outages in northern India affected about million people last month The default hopefully will be the impetus to carry out the muchneeded reform in the power sector said Kirit Parikh an economist with the Mumbaibased thinktank the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research Indias staterun power generation companies such as National Thermal Power Corp are owed as much as billion rupees in unpaid bills by staterun electricity boards Even New Delhi where theres no agricultural land has a socalled transmission and distribution loss of over percent Thats pilferage Parikh said India has no hope of solving its power problem if people keep stealing electricity Dabhol said the state electricity board its only customer had so far paid million rupees of the million bill for November The December bill of billion rupees is yet to be paid it said Expensive The Maharashtra government in December said it would renegotiate the power project on grounds that it charged MSEB too high a price for its power Dabhols power charges averaged about rupees per kilowatt hour over the last two years MSEB generates megawatts itself and buys another from staterun National Thermal Power Corp at an average cost of about rupees Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Authority requires us to buy the cheapest power and thats the reason why often we cant buy the maximum percent from Dabhol MSEBs Krishna Rao said in an interview last month Under the agreement MSEB has to pay a fixed cost of million rupees a month to Dabhol whether it draws any power or not Its cost of power from Dabhol per kilowatthour rose briefly to as high as rupees in July when it drew a small quantity of power but had to pay the minimum million rupees pushing up unit costs According to Dabhol MSEB drew an average percent of the plants megawatt generating capacity at rupees per kilowatt hour between May and October last year The cost could have been as low as rupees per megawatt hour if MSEB had drawn percent of the plants capacity There is a case for lowering the Enrons tariff a bit said Parikh Still thats no justification for the government to default Enron was one of the first major companies to enter India after the countrys economy

giant to sell more natural gas at lower prices Brazils petroleum regulator ANP is allowing UKbased BG to transport about million cubic meters of gas daily through the pipeline It also gave Enron permission to sell the million cubic meters a day it already pumps through the pipeline in Sao Paulo state locations We can probably provide gas to endusers for less than Petrobras said Francois Moreau corporate director for British Gas in Brazil Its a good sign the ANP is opening access Petrobras until recently Brazils monopoly oil and gas supplier faces mounting competition especially in Brazils most populated state of Sao Paulo The government has lagged in attracting companies to build gasfired power plants the intended buyers of the pipeline gas allowing other companies use of a nearempty pipeline Petrobras unit Gaspetro controls access to the billion pipeline with capacity of million cubic meters a day and partners like Enron and Royal DutchShell Group collect transport fees ANP requires Petrobras to forfeit pipeline space its not occupying Houstonbased Enron is proceeding with the construction of two gasfired power plants in Rio de Janeiro State but it also seeks to transport natural gas for vehicles kitchens and other destinations planning to boost its distribution to at least million cubic meters a day Petrobras hopes power plants will help quadruple demand for natural gas to million cubic meters a day by Still as the company waits for the government to attract power plant investors ANP says it will face more competition for other types of gas contracts Petrobras gas when its transported to power plants under contract cannot be used for purposes other than fueling the plants turbines the ANP said Power Plants Petrobras has contracts to buy about million cubic meters of natural gas daily from Bolivia this year while it transports about half that now The thermoelectric projects are far behind schedule said an ANP spokeswoman Still its ANPs directors stance that transport of gas must be a competitive market Demand for Petrobras Bolivian gas hasnt met company expectations as Brazil fails to attract investors to build about five dozen gasfired power plants it needs to avoid a shortage of electricity in coming years Companies and banks arent signing power plant contracts concerned that Brazils quarterly adjusted US dollar gas prices will leave them exposed to potential losses since the countrys electricity rates are adjusted only once a year They need to find a way of resolving issues for the lenders said Frank McGann an analyst with Merrill Lynch Co in New York The government is considering various options to ensure private companies build the power plants in order to meet the forecast percent annual growth in Brazils demand for electric power Government officials have said they may set up a stabilization fund that could reimburse companies for any losses incurred as they await adjustments in electricity rates Competition Permission to sell gas in Sao Paulo the countrys largest consuming state pits Enron against Petrobras BG also plans to boost its sales to Sao Paulos main gas distributor Comgas While Comgas largest supply contracts are with Petrobras BG owns a majority stake worth about billion in Comgas and wants the chance to boost sales to the distributor We dont expect our pipeline space to be interrupted for at least a few years as Petrobras tries to fill it up said Moreau In the meantime we can compete to transport the gas Petrobras earlier planned to sell the gas at a fixed rate along the kilometer mile pipeline about the distance from Boston to Albuquerque The plan would have helped Petrobras take advantage of its domination in markets distant from the Bolivian jungles the source of the gas ANP ruled that gas prices should vary according to transportation distance making it more expensive in Brazils southern regions the furthest reaches of the pipeline Anything to be done to spur demand for gas in Brazil is ultimately positive for Petrobras McGann said Its a cost to Petrobras until it builds up demand in Brazil but to break the logjam you need to pressure the market open a little Petrobras is beginning a fiveyear billion spending program centered around oil and gas production in an effort to make Brazil selfsufficient in its fuel consumption Joshua Schneyer in Rio de Janeiro

market for liquefied natural gas is heating up El Paso Energy Corp said it plans to spend at least billion over five years to build a handful of terminals for handling LNG for the US and Mexico markets El Paso Energy based in Houston said it is considering six projects in all three in the US two in Mexico and one in the Bahamas Five of the projects which would cost from million to million apiece would serve the US market where naturalgas prices are nearly three times higher than last year Last week Enron Corp another Houston energy concern said it plans to spend as much as million to feed gas from the Bahamas to the growing Florida market El Paso said it hopes to have its project running six months before Enrons The rival projects underscore surging US demand for LNG a process that allows natural gas to be shipped but that generally adds significantly to the cost While LNG has been a vital part of the gas supply in Asia particularly in Japan it has never enjoyed sustained success in the US mostly because it has been too costly to compete with low US natural gas prices But over the past two decades the cost of the process which cools natural gas into liquid form has come down and the price to construct LNG tankers has dropped by a third said Kathleen Eisbrenner El Pasos managing director for global LNG Still high US naturalgas prices are the key Tight gas supplies in the US drove average prices for natural gas to per thousand cubic feet last year up from a thousand cubic feet in To make El Pasos LNG bet worth the effort naturalgas prices have to stay above per thousand cubic feet over the next decade said Ralph Eads El Pasos president for merchant energy Assuming prices hold at that level we think the LNG business will grow at to a year for the next decade There is no other energy business growing at that pace Mr Eads said In response both El Paso and Williams Cos a Tulsa Oklahoma naturalgas company expect to revive mothballed terminals in the US states of Georgia and Maryland in the next two years El Pasos plans include a plant in a remote part of Mexicos Baja California that would feed gas markets in San Diego and Mexico where gas demand also is growing rapidly The company owns a site in Florida has options on land in the Bahamas is finalizing options on a site in the southern US and is evaluating sites in Baja San Diego and San Francisco In addition El Paso said it is building a terminal in Altamira Mexico to feed the Mexican market

Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved DALLAS AP As Californias energy market continues to struggle a major electricity wholesaler said it will stop funneling power directly to dozens of corporate clients there instead shifting their needs to local utilities Houstonbased Enron Energy Services cited concern over losses by Californias power companies and the move to shut down the states electrical exchange company chief executive Marty Sunde said Thursday He said the switch wont affect the price paid by dozens of large customers including Kaiser Permanente though it may hurt the Enron Corp subsidiarys bottom line The company tries to help businesses cut their energy bills by among other things purchasing power wholesale and reselling it to clients at reduced rates Like Californias large utilities Enron has been hurt by the states soaring wholesale prices Enron will have to pay the local utilities at the going rate but cannot pass on any higher costs to its customers because their contracts guarantee a price We are resourcing choosing another sourcing alternative under an existing client relationship that we absolutely honor Sunde said It seems like a better strategy to serve our customers directly from the utility instead of canceling the contract There is a risk that our decision to honor our contracts will come with some cost The New York Times citing an unidentified source close to Enron reported Thursday that the energy service provider might lose billion if it fulfilled all its contracts Sunde called the figure absurd but acknowledged that financial concerns and the quickly changing energy market in California played heavily in the decision California has recently faced rolling blackouts because of a tight power supply that has been blamed on the states deregulation inadequate hydroelectric power high natural gas prices transmission glitches and power plant repairs The states two largest utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co say they are billion in debt because of soaring wholesale prices and the law which blocks them from recouping those losses from their customers On the Net Enron Energy Services Energy service provider switching customers power source back to utilities By JAY JORDEN Associated Press Writer Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved DALLAS AP A subsidiary of the largest seller of wholesale electricity in North America says concern over losses by Californias major power companies has prompted it to quit scheduling power to dozens of its customers switching that job to one of the states debtridden utilities The decision which would apparently affect companies like Cisco Systems Genentech and Clorox would not stop the flow of electricity But it would potentially raise the rates these big customers pay perhaps by as much as percent and could also increase the role of the state government as the major supplier of power in California The New York Times reported Thursday As a result of the decision the customers would be switched from the Houstonbased Enron Corp unit called Enron Energy Services to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company They would lose the discounts and low rates they had enjoyed The chief executive of Enron Energy Services said the unit was taking the step because of financial turmoil in the states power market but emphasized the company will honor current contracts with the dozens of corporations affected Many companies arranged fiveyear contracts with Enron in and We are resourcing choosing another sourcing alternative under an existing client relationship that we absolutely honor said Marty Sunde Enron Energy CEO A source close to Enron told The Times that the energy service provider might lose billion if it fulfilled all its contracts for the length of their terms Sunde called the figure absurd but said financial issues played heavily in the decision Market forces including legislation that is probably gone on in the last hours continues to change whatever the price or cost picture is going to be he said One person with knowledge of Enrons move told The Times that the customers being cut off use about megawatt hours equal roughly to the output of six major generating plants The state would become financially responsible for covering that potentially adding millions of dollars a day to its already heavy burden Financially strapped utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co forced by Californias deregulation law to sell their power plants say theyve been pushed billion in debt by soaring wholesale prices that deregulation blocks them from passing on to their customers The state Legislature has been forced to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to keep the lights on in California and is debating passage of a bill that would rescue the crippled utilities by floating up to billion in bonds to buy power In another move to shield itself from the power woes threatening California Enrons parent company on Wednesday sued the California Power Exchange a nonprofit market where electricity was auctioned The lawsuit was filed the same day trading was stopped on the exchange because of the deep debt of the states two biggest utilities The lawsuit seeks to prevent the market from using letters of credit that the company was

This report was first published late Wednesday By Pat Maio Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow Jones Capstone Turbine Corp CPST may have landed its biggest microturbine order to date from a consortium of public agency water suppliers in California valued at up to million according to sources The Association of California Water Agencies which is made up of members who supply water to of Californias farms and cities has signed a deal with an energy consulting firm that is working to secure up to microturbine unit orders for Capstone over the next two years ACWA uses up to of the states electricity on pumping stations needed to irrigate farms and many of its members have been hit hard financially by the energy crisis Under the agreement privately held Harza Energy LLC will buy the microturbines from Capstone based in Chatsworth Calif and install them for ACWAs member water agencies For Harza this will end up being our largest order ever Steve Chippas president of the Chicago engineering and energy consulting firm said in a phone interview Capstone marketing vice president Mark Kuntz confirmed that his company has had discussions with ACWA regarding the potential to sell up to microturbines The kilowatt units would cost up to each making the total deal worth up to million We have every expectation that this will result in a large order Kuntz said We have made this a high priority to secure a large number of orders with the ACWA agencies Representatives of about of those agencies will visit Capstone on Thursday to get a firsthand look at how a microturbine works he added Capstone said it had produced about microturbines through last November its last publicly disclosed production number Dan Smith director of regulatory affairs for ACWA said public water supply agencies are being devastated financially by Californias energy crisis Ive been here almost years and Ive seen droughts but Ive never seen so much aggravation and concern as this problem has caused Smith said He pointed to one San Diegoarea agency the Valley Center Municipal Water District that plans to increase its water rates on Feb and another on April The district mainly supplies water to avocado growers some of whom are saying them may be forced out of business because of the rate increases Smith said ACWA also is looking at reducing power costs to its members by picking a new wholesale supplier of electricity to replace AES Corp AES Finalists are said to include Enron Corp ENE and a joint consortium of Coral Energy a unit of Royal DutchShell RD and New West an energy service supplier owned by Salt River Project one of the nations largest publicly owned energy businesses Microturbines are primarily fueled by natural gas and can generate from kilowatts to kilowatts of electricity a day They also run on propane diesel fuel kerosene landfill gas and waste and water treatment gases Microturbines use just one moving part a shaft on which a compressor turbine and permanent magnet generator are seated Microturbines also use airfoil bearing technology which eliminates the need for oil bearings This is why microturbines cost less to maintain than other power sources and produce less pollution and noise Microturbines can be turned on during the middle of the day when power prices are most expensive or during blackouts caused by interruptible contracts with

George W Bushs experiments Teresa Calalay sent her son to a Texas church home last year hoping to break his pattern of legal behavioral and work problems He returned weeks later broken in other ways The yearolds feet were swollen from severely sprained ankles and his body was covered with hundreds of welts bruises and bug bites that led a doctor to file an abuse report with police The homes superintendent now awaits trial on a felony charge of unlawful restraint and Calalay has sued the church for what she says was a substitution of abuse for Christianity The home denies wrongdoing I dont know where in their Bible it says youve got to beat God into people Calalay said Bush as president is now promoting a plan to shift more federal social services to religious groups as he did as Texas governor The idea has early bipartisan support though supporters of the separation of church and state are pledging to fight it A review of similar state and federal initiatives shows that beyond the political debate these experiments have generated allegations of financial and physical abuse questions of lax oversight and lawsuits questioning whether the needy are being forcefed

Copyright c Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc and its licensors All rights reserved CALGARY A legal battle between two major online natural gas trading companies could lead to a more comprehensive index for tracking natural gas prices Insiders said energy trading company Enron Canada Corp and online trading firm NGX Canada Inc along with energy newsletter publisher Canadian Enerdata Ltd are holding talks aimed at settling a million lawsuit Enron filed late last year against the other two companies Enron has alleged that it suffered irreparable harm when NGX operator of the online Natural Gas Exchange purchased the rights to Enerdatas natural gas price indexes last September and immediately changed the way the indexes are calculated Officials at NGX and Enerdata have countered that they struck their index deal for legitimate business purposes with no intent to harm Enrons business and that the new indexes are superior to the old calculations Sources said the talks could lead to the establishment of a socalled superindex combining trading data from several online trading systems to create a more reliable and representative measure of natural gas prices in the open market Calgarybased Enron like many participants in the Canadian natural gas market uses Enerdatas indexes as the price basis for its gas hedging contracts In its lawsuit Enron contends that the new method for calculating the indexes using only trades conducted though the Natural Gas Exchange isnt as neutral reliable or broadbased as Enerdatas old method of surveying a wide variety of market participants The dispute comes against a background of competition for market share in the fastgrowing and increasingly competitive online gas trading business Enron Canadas parent Enron Corp of Houston competes with NGX for customers through EnronOnline the dominant trading system in the online marketplace Ownership of a reliable price index is considered a surefire drawing card to attract customers NGX now controls and otherwise generates the gas price indexes based upon a far more restricted basis of compiling source data based only on those trades consummated on the NGX trading system Enron said in documents filed to the Alberta Court of Queens Bench The effect of the new methodology is to coerce industry participants to transact through the NGX trading system Participants in the natural gas market have generally applauded NGXs changes in calculating the gas price indexes arguing that the data are more timely transparent and accurate than under Enerdatas old survey method But there are indications Enron wanted to establish a benchmark price index on its own Web site In an affidavit Richard Zarzeczny the owner of Enerdata who is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit says Enron actually offered to buy Enerdata and its price indexes last October but Mr Zarzeczny refused the offer Enron declined comment Sources close to the lawsuit said the mood surrounding the dispute has thawed considerably in the past week opening the door for a possible settlement that could improve pricing information for the entire natural gas industry Enron has dropped its request for an injunction that would have forced Enerdata of Markham Ont to revert to its old method of calculating the indexes The injunction hearing had been set for Feb Enron is continuing its lawsuit but the parties are holding talks for an outofcourt solution We have dropped the injunction in order to pursue a settlement Enron Corp spokesman Eric Thode said Were currently in some discussions to try to resolve this said Peter Krenkel president of Calgarybased NGX Sources close to the talks confirmed that the superindex is on the negotiating table Thats one of the possible solutions to this Mr Krenkel confirmed National Desk Section A Senators Spar On US Role In Resolving Energy Crisis By JOSEPH KAHN The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company WASHINGTON Jan Senate Democrats and Republicans clashed today over whether the Bush administration had done enough to help California extricate itself from an electricity crisis suggesting that the politics of power are as volatile as energy prices The administration has an obligation to find a solution before the crisis worsens Senator Jeff Bingaman Democrat of New Mexico said in a Senate hearing on the problem Mr Bingaman criticized the administration for using the power shortages to promote its plan made public in last years presidential campaign to drill for oil in an Alaskan wildlife refuge All the oil in Alaska would do little to relieve electricity shortages he said But some Republicans firmly backed the new administrations relatively handsoff approach and its focus on what they called a longterm energy policy Senator Frank H Murkowski the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the Senate energy committee argued that a Clinton administration order forcing power producers and natural gas companies to sell supplies to California an order the Bush administration temporarily extended last week potentially made the federal government liable for billions of dollars in debt incurred by California utilities In the event California cannot repay generators for this power the federal government is going to have to meet that obligation because this was an order of the federal government Mr Murkowski said He has backed the Bush administrations decision to end the executive order next Wednesday a step that will increase the pressure on California politicians to solve the states problems quickly The split on the energy panel suggests that there is no groundswell of support in Congress for tackling Californias energy woes Numerous lawmakers plan to introduce legislation that will address both electricity shortages and the longterm search for domestic sources of energy But todays hearing gave no indication that the Republicancontrolled Congress plans to challenge the administrations position that the federal government should have a relatively limited role in correcting imbalances in electricity supply and demand The politics are more complex in the West where Republicans and Democrats alike have pushed for the federal government to impose price caps on electricity in the region Supporters of caps argue that the limits would curtail skyhigh prices and buy time for California and other states to line up longterm supplies Opponents say they would distort the market and remove an incentive for power companies to build more plants The power to regulate prices on interstate sales of electricity belongs to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a lowprofile independent agency The commission has shown little inclination to impose a regional price cap but critics have urged Congress to force it to take action Several Democrats including Californias two senators backed price caps at todays hearing Senator Dianne Feinstein of California cited a study predicting that her states power problems would only increase this summer and that caps were needed to keep the states two main utilities solvent and the lights on in the nations most populous state Ms Feinstein was joined in the call by California utility executives Fred John senior vice president for Sempra Energy the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric said his company had long opposed price caps But he said You reach a point where enough is enough But executives from companies that sell power to California including the Enron Corporation and the Williams Companies testified that price caps were harmful They said that the solutions to Californias problems were to allow consumer prices to reflect the markets supply and to make it easier for companies to build new power plants The Bush administration has tended to favor that position as have some Republican lawmakers Mr Murkowski said California had to devise a way to encourage companies to build new power generation plants and transmission lines You cant have the state take over the industry and try to run it he said Photo Senator Dianne Feinstein of California greeted Steve Frank chief executive of Southern California Edison as hearings began yesterday Associated Press Metro Desk Power Exchange to Live On in Lawsuits ROBIN FIELDS TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company The California Power Exchange may be passing from existence but its still a live target for litigation Enron Corp sued the market Wednesday to prevent it from using letters of credit that the company was required to file to trade on the exchange Though Enrons collateral exceeds its liabilities to the exchange the company moved preemptively to make sure the market could not tap its assets to pay off other debts an exchange spokesman said The Power Exchange has also sued Southern California Edison for failing to pay for million of power it bought in December asking to recoup the money by liquidating the utilitys longterm power contracts A Superior Court judge is scheduled to rule on the matter Friday Pacific Gas Electric fearing that the exchange would file a similar action if it defaults on its January purchases has sued to prevent the market from doing so In all three cases lawyers may still be arguing after the Power Exchange turns off its own lights On Tuesday the Power Exchange board voted to shut down its spot market saying decisions by federal regulators had diminished trading activity to the point of futility The exchange closed its day ahead market Tuesday and ended trading on its day of market at noon Wednesday It will stay open indefinitely with a skeleton staff to handle longterm contracts The Pasadenabased nonprofit was once a cornerstone of the states deregulation plan the principal market in which electricity was auctioned for delivery to Californians But the exchanges demise was sealed by continuing credit problems at Southern California

stop deliveries TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company SAN FRANCISCO Moving to head off a doomsday scenario of widespread and prolonged natural gas outages in Northern and Central California state regulators on Wednesday granted cashstrapped Pacific Gas Electric Co permission to use money owed to the company by customers as collateral for future gas purchases from suppliers As the Public Utilities Commission took steps to ease Californias natural gas shortage PUC President Loretta M Lynch unloaded on suppliers that have threatened to stop delivering gas to PGE without advance payment or collateral Calling the situation egregious Lynch accused the industry of taking advantage of the states continuing energy crunch I believe PGE is the victim of predatory practices of the natural gas industry she said The commission did not act on an unusual request by PGE to force Southern California Gas to sell emergency gas supplies to the utility a step that the gas company feared would spread the crisis to its own million customers The matter was deferred to the commission meeting next week but Lynch said she views the two PGE proposals as an eitheror proposition It is incumbent on PGE to make this work she said after Wednesdays vote In addition to allowing PGE to use its unpaid gas customer accounts as collateral the commission allowed the company to pledge its core gas inventory to secure additional gas supplies However the PUC said that action could be taken only if PGE did not have enough accounts receivable to cover a particular gas purchase The authorization the PUC said will expire once PGEs financial condition improves That could come within days of any state bailout legislation or days after certain improvements in the companys credit rating occur This is good news said PGE spokeswoman Staci Homrig We hope we can take this authorization to gas suppliers and make them do business with us This decision keeps the gas flowing for at least the next month Homrig said explaining that it takes so long to collect gas money from customers that the day limit would cover only one billing cycle The company she said could file for an extension if necessary The company estimated in filings with the PUC that firms providing of its core gas supply either have terminated or have threatened to terminate gas shipments They are J Aron Co a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs Sempra Energy Trading Duke Energy and partner Coastal Merchant Energy and Western Gas Resources Alex Hemerick spokeswoman for Sempra Energy Trading of Stamford Conn declined to comment saying the firm is studying the plan Tom Williams of Duke Energy North America said We dont have any comment one way or the other We are following developments hour by hour day by day Other suppliers did not return calls late Wednesday PGE made a series of urgent requests starting two weeks ago after gas suppliers threatened to halt sales to the utility fearing it could not pay its bills The crisis recently took on added urgency because a federal order requiring gas suppliers to sell to California expires at midnight Tuesday Without emergency assistance PGE representatives said many of the companys million residential and business customersand entire cities from Sacramento to San Francisco and Fresnofaced potential shutoff of their gas And they said dwindling supplies would have a ripple effect on many of the companys million electricity customers because gasfired power plants are among the large noncore industrial customers that would lose gas supplies first The company also warned that noncore customers farthest from pipelines would suffer catastrophic effects Hospitals government agencies and industrial users would have reduced gas supply and would have to limit or cease operations The company appealed for help from the US Department of Energy gas suppliers Southern California Gas and Gov Gray Davis who sent letters to the White House to seek assistance The utility warned that without a solution to its supply problems it would have to start diverting gas from noncore customers by midFebruary with residential and smallbusiness customers to follow shortly thereafter On Jan PGE asked the PUC to declare a gas supply emergency and to order Southern California Gas to come to the rescue Four days later PGE asked the commission for permission to use unpaid customer accounts as collateral to help persuade its suppliers to keep gas coming The PUCs order prohibits PGE from providing collateral for any gas purchases from its own affiliates A company spokesman said PGE Energy Trading has provided the utility with gas but has not asked for any advance payments or security Was the crisis averted I hope and expect so said PUC Commissioner Carl W Wood But these days we never know what tomorrow will bring Times staff writer Chris Kraul contributed to this story BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX INFOGRAPHIC Power Points Background The state Legislature approved electricity deregulation with a unanimous vote in The move was expected to lower power bills in California by opening up the energy market to competition Relatively few companies however entered that market to sell electricity giving each that did considerable influence over the price Meanwhile demand has increased in recent years while no major power plants have been built These factors combined last year to push up the wholesale cost of electricity But the states biggest utilitiesPacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edisonare barred from increasing consumer rates So the utilities have accumulated billions of dollars in debt and despite help from the state have struggled to buy enough electricity Daily Developments The state Senate put final touches on ABX which authorizes the state to enter longterm contracts for electricity and issues billion in bonds to pay for that power At a US Senate committee hearing in Washington senators complained that the power crunch is spreading throughout the West and that California brought its problems on itself by making it difficult for companies to build power plants Enron Corp sued the California Power Exchange to prevent it from tapping its assets to pay off other debts Verbatim No more talking about leadership Put up or shut up Assembly Republican Leader Bill Campbell RVilla Park Complete package and updates at wwwlatimescompower National Desk Section A Power Source Ends Direct Flow to California Businesses By JAMES STERNGOLD with MATT RICHTEL The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company LOS ANGELES Jan In a sign that problems are deepening in Californias overburdened energy market a division of the Enron Corporation that sells power directly to large industrial and commercial concerns has decided to halt such service to dozens of its clients because of the potential for mounting losses The decision which would apparently affect companies like Cisco Systems Genentech and Clorox would not stop the flow of electricity But it would potentially raise the rates these big customers pay perhaps percent or so and sharply increase the role of the state government as the major supplier of power in California Enron based in Houston is one of the largest companies if not the largest supplying lowcost energy to such big customers in California As a result of the decision the customers would be immediately switched from the Enron unit called Enron Energy Services to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company But they would lose the discounts and low rates they had enjoyed It was unclear whether Enron would compensate the customers most of whom arranged fiveyear contracts with it in and Marty Sunde chief executive of Enron Energy Services confirmed late today that his unit was taking the step because of the severe financial turmoil in the power market in the state But Mr Sunde emphasized repeatedly that the company would honor in some way its contractual obligations Enron Energy Services is a unit that seeks to help companies find ways to reduce their overall energy costs One way is by selling power at reduced rates To accomplish that it has sought to buy power on the wholesale market at competitive rates but just like Californias large utilities it has suffered from the rocketing wholesale costs Mr Sunde said two issues forced his companys hand One was the enormous losses suffered by Californias two major utilities Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison because of the soaring wholesale price of electricity The other was the recent decision by the California Power Exchange where Enron and other large energy companies buy and sell power at wholesale rates to shut down because of the crisis This actually threatened the financial mechanism of how electricity is supplied Mr Sunde said A person close to Enron said the company had determined that it could lose perhaps billion if it fulfilled all the contracts for the length of their terms But Mr Sunde denied that figure Perhaps the most important result of Enrons decision was that switching those big customers to the utilities would sharply increase the amount of power that the State of California would be forced to buy on an emergency basis With Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison saying they are on the verge of bankruptcy because of the soaring price of wholesale power the state government has stepped in buying huge amounts of power and selling it to the utilities One person with knowledge of Enrons move said that all told the customers being cut off several dozen large corporations use about megawatt hours equal roughly to the output of six major generating plants That means the state would become financially responsible for covering that potentially adding millions of dollars a day to its already heavy burden Mr Sunde said he could not confirm that total Generally the large customers that Enron supplies cannot have power service stopped as long as they pay their bills As a result of being dropped by Enron the companies would become clients of Pacific Gas and Electric which already operates the transmission lines to them While Enrons decision does not suggest that another crisis has developed it shows how quickly the private players in the oncethriving energy business here have been forced to pull out or curtail their involvement even if it means harming relations with customers It also suggests that though the state government is already playing a major role on an emergency basis it will probably have to continue that role for many years Some Enron customers contacted today said they had not received any notice from Enron and they expressed shock and dismay about the decision on withdrawal One was Kaiser Permanente the large managed care organization Rich A Seguin senior energy manager at Kaiser Permanente said late today that two weeks ago Enron had asked to modify its contract with Kaiser to allow for the switching of power sources He said Kaisers lawyers had reviewed the request and found no problem If they stand behind our contract which is what their stance is Mr Seguin said of Enron Kaiser would not be harmed But he said that if Enron was unable to supply power Kaiser might have to pay a month in extra costs because it would be more expensive to get electricity from utilities at regular rates Calvin Yee an executive at Pacific Gas and Electric who deals with large clients that would revert to his company said that if Enron withdrew the impact could be handled by the utility without disruptions It might mean a bubble of work Mr Yee said but it would not be extraordinary If it happens well be prepared At one time several large energy companies arranged these contracts directly with large industrial users and other big companies as part of Californias ambitious deregulation program The idea was that these large energy users could shop around among power companies and choose the best deal much as individuals can shop among longdistance telephone companies and pick the best plan Among Enrons other clients here are GTE Safeway IBM McDonalds and International Paper a person close to the company said WORLD DEMOCRATS UTILITIES URGE PRICE CONTROLS TO AID WEST H JOSEF HEBERT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Pittsburgh PostGazette REGION A Copyright Senate Democrats joined by Western utility companies urged federal price controls on wholesale power yesterday as fallout from Californias power problems appeared to spread across the West So far President Bush has opposed the idea At the same time one of Californias cashstrapped utilities came under criticism at a Senate hearing for diverting billion to its parent company when it now is unable to pay its own energy bill and faces possible bankruptcy and a state bailout It seems to me the shareholders came first Sen Ron Wyden D Ore told Southern California Edison chairman Steve Frank who defended the legal transfer to SoCal parent Edison International Frank rejected a suggestion by Wyden of money laundering and said the money was transferred over five years reflecting proceeds from the statemandated sale of the utilitys power plants The money simply went back to shareholders and investors Frank said a normal business practice SoCal and Pacific Gas Electric Californias two investorowned utilities owe about billion to power suppliers and face possible bankruptcy because they have been unable to pass on additional costs to retail customers During a fivehour hearing before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee senators heard repeated requests mostly from California and Northwest utilities for federal price controls on wholesale power Prices have soared not only in California but in many of the other states connected in the Western power grid Bush while conceding that Californias power problems are beginning to have widespread impact has not allowed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose price controls Power suppliers have been accused of price gouging and manipulating the California market although no clear evidence of such activities has surfaced Generating companies argued again yesterday that their prices simply reflect short energy supplies and market restrictions under Californias now widely criticized attempt at deregulation At one point during the hearing Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif asked some of the outofstate power generators who lined the witness table for a little cooperation in addressing her states electricity crisis All of you have made a lot of money off this she said scolding the executives for appearing not to care what happens not to care about the people that are being thrown out of jobs Among power producers represented by witnesses at the hearing were Calpine Corp Reliant Energy Wholesale Group Enron and the Williams Cos all major providers of power to Californias utilities Like many energy companies they have posted record profits during the past year Williams President Keith Bailey rejected suggestions of price gouging and said most of the power his company had sold was at a reasonable price very marginally above our actual costs Like other power producers Bailey said a federally imposed cap on wholesale prices makes no sense and would discourage production affect supplies and discourage consumers from conserving energy Price controls have not worked they dont get at the fundamental supply and demand problem maintained Steve Kean executive vice president of Enron the largest seller of wholesale electricity in North America As California tries to address its immediate power problems consumers in other Western states already were feeling the impact with dire predictions that the problem will get worse this spring and summer Mark Crisson of Tacoma Public Utilities in Tacoma Wash said his company recently boosted retail electricity rates by percent and may have to borrow million to keep up with wholesale price spurts We just cant raise our rates fast enough to keep up with what were seeing in these wholesale markets Crisson said Like others he urged temporary federal controls on prices across the West as a stopgap Sen Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico the panels ranking Democrat said the Bush administration has an obligation to find a solution before the crisis worsens Bingaman said the administrations only solution to the problem in California so far has been to recommend oil drilling in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge While there are many causes for Californias power shortage the ban on drilling in the refuge is not one of them Bingaman said Florida Energy Commission Recommends Deregulating Wholesale Electricity David Cox KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News The Orlando Sentinel Florida Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM TALLAHASSEE FlaFloridas political and business leaders moved cautiously toward deregulating the states electric industry Wednesday while vowing to avoid problems such as those in California where widespread blackouts and skyrocketing prices are wreaking havoc Floridas Energy Study Commission unanimously recommended that the Legislature consider deregulating wholesale electricity that is electricity sold to energy providers such as Florida Power Light from other producers The move could spark construction of a number of power plants including one proposed in New Smyrna Beach by Duke Energy of North Carolina The recommendation Wednesday was part of an effort to remove state regulations at all levels the eventual aim being a system in which consumers choose their power company much as they now choose their longdistance phone service Such a scenario though would take several years Wednesdays action if approved by the Legislature in its spring session would be a small step toward that goal The potential impact of the panels recommendations on residential and commercial electricity bills is unclear But an immediate effect would be to open Florida to independent power providers such as Duke Energy which wants to build socalled merchant plants that would generate electricity to be sold on the open market Michael Green general manager for Dukes operations in the southeastern United States said his company would immediately revive its plans to build a merchant plant near New Smyrna Beach The Florida Supreme Court killed the proposal last year ruling that such plants are prohibited under state law Several commission members and officials with the power companies say deregulation should lower customers rates over time because of the increased competition in the energy market And even if these proposals fail to lower rates they should at least keep electricity bills from going up as quickly as they would under the current system of regulated electric monopolies deregulation proponents say But consumer groups and municipal electrical providers disagree They say deregulating wholesale energy would lead to higher electricity bills because big utilities would be allowed to earn higher profits but not share the benefits with consumers Commission chairman Walter Revell rejected the idea that the panel is proposing anything that would favor power companies over consumers Were not doing this for the benefit of any company were doing it for the consumers Revell said He said Florida must build up its energy supply to avoid problems such as those in California That state is struggling with rolling blackouts and runaway utility costs stemming from a cold winter low reserves and heavy reliance on costly outofstate power California also failed to build new power plants or use effective conservation steps in the s Luckily Floridas plentiful reserves make it unlikely at least for the foreseeable future that it will experience shortages such as those in California Revell believes that deregulation will ensure that such a scenario never unfolds here But Barry Moline a spokesman for the Florida Municipal Electric Association said Revells concerns are bogus Florida law already requires power companies to hold percent of their power supplies in reserve so they can handle periods of extreme usage and utilities already are planning to provide additional capacity in the future he said The commission created by Gov Jeb Bush last May was under pressure from the governor and independent power providers to submit an initial deregulation proposal for this springs legislative session even though the panel will continue its work until December It is planning to recommend ways to deregulate the retail energy market electric power purchased by residents and businesses for the Legislature The movement toward deregulation troubled some of the commission members who were concerned that the Public Service Commissions and the state Cabinets reduced role over investorowned utilities would harm customers Duke and Enron Energy a Houstonbased energy giant that was among President Bushs top campaign contributors are among the outofstate firms charging to deregulate the industry and get a toehold on Floridas growing market But the states large investorowned monopolies Florida Power Light Tampa Electric Florida Power Corp and Gulf Power initially resisted the recommendations to let the independent suppliers enter the state Thats because they would lose their monopolies But the commission struck a deal with Floridas large companies allowing them the opportunity to cash in as well While the power sellers now in Florida could not keep their power plants the plan would allow them to transfer those plants which are often paid off to related companies Those companies in turn would be allowed to compete with the new merchant plants It was that concessions that created the most controversy among commission members including Sen Tom Lee who said he could not support the provision The Brandon Republican will be instrumental in passing any deregulation legislation this year Lee said there is simply no guarantee that the deregulation plan would benefit consumers But if lawmakers change the commissions concessions to the monopolies those companies may pull their support and jeopardize passage of anything this year Obviously the investorowned utilities are an extremely powerful political force in the state and theyll be looking out for their best interests in this said Duke Energys Green I hope theres enough in this proposal to keep them supportive of this recommendation BUSINESS Senate Powerless On Power No easy answers to state energy crisis Carolyn Lochhead Chronicle Washington Bureau The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL B Copyright Accusing outofstate power generators of price gouging Sen Dianne Feinstein warned colleagues on a Senate energy panel yesterday that chaos will spread throughout the West this summer if Californias energy crisis cant be solved From Wall Street analysts to Western utility executives who testified before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee yesterday all agreed on that much But one sides cure was the others poison leaving no clear course for federal lawmakers other than to help get more power plants on line fast while knowing none will arrive before a severe electricity crunch this summer Comparing Californias blackouts to a Third World affliction consultant Peter FoxPenner of the Brattle Group said There is no parallel to this episode in the history of the developed world Lawrence Makovich senior director of North American Electric Power at Cambridge Energy Research Associates said one of the biggest problems in California is that no one can agree on what went wrong Indeed he added there is a grave danger of drawing the wrong lessons Energy analysts and power generators warned the wholesale price caps urged by Feinstein would make the situation worse But utilities in Western states argued the situation will worsen without price caps They said they buy power on the same spot market that has driven Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison all but bankrupt and will soon face the same fate And Northwest senators angrily lashed out at California saying layoffs are spreading as electricity rates soar even as Californians are shielded from price increases while draining power from the Western electricity grid Cisco Systems of San Jose was held up by critics as the poster child of California hypocrisy The networking giant was accused of guzzling power while working to block construction of a gasfired electricity plant near its planned Coyote Valley facility Let me tell you what steams me fumed Sen Gordon Smith ROre Right now Oregonians are being notified and many Washingtonians that their rates will be soon going up percent and in one Washington utility percent Now I dont think thats fair when Californias capped at percent I think that stinks Smith said he awoke yesterday morning to a newspaper cartoon showing the view of Oregon from California an outline of the state with two empty sockets in it He added that the drain on Northwest hydroelectric reservoirs means that salmon are getting flushed Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif insisted that environmental rules are not to blame for a decade of no power plant construction in California But the generators complained the states regulatory restrictions are insane The most heated disputes were over price caps on wholesale electricity sold in the daily spot market The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to impose them saying caps could make the situation worse by drying up power sales to California Energy analysts urged more longterm contracts for cheaper power which Gov Gray Davis is trying to negotiate now saying they accomplish the same thing as price caps but without creating shortages Feinstein said California will be short of power this summer when air conditioners are flipped on California will build new power plants she said and I agree the rates have to go up But in the meantime she said without price caps by summer jets will be grounded for lack of fuel businesses will close and communications will falter What do you suggest will get us through the summer short of somebody being able to make a decision as to how much profit and how much cost should be passed through and some control she asked The utilities can only pass through a megawatt hour to consumers and theyre buying at a megawatt hour Kit Konolige managing director at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter told Feinstein I would first suggest senator that the problem is the shortage of supply And standard economic theory would be that if you put a price cap on the supply youll get less of the supply not more The remedy he said is to sign all the longterm contracts that you can Utility executives pleaded for lifting price caps on their sales to consumers but imposing them on their wholesale purchases Mark Crisson of Tacoma Public Utilities in Tacoma Wash said the utility could run out of its million reserve by April even after a percent rate surcharge on consumers Scoffing at a warning that price caps would distort the market Crisson said In my view a distortion in this market would be an improvement But executives of the generating facilities including Houstons Enron and Reliant Energy Wholesale Group San Joses Calpine Corp and the Williams Companies of Tulsa Okla adamantly disagreed All said their costs were rising due to natural gas shortages increased demand and state delays in approving new power plants Feinstein resorted to a combination of veiled threats and pleas to generators reminding them as Californias senior senator Im going to be around here for six years Im going to be on this committee and Im going to watch this situation Gentlemen she said when spot power at am in the morning is times higher than it would be normally that to me is price gouging Deals Deal Makers Burning Issues Convertible Securities Are This Years Big Model By Suzanne McGee Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc When the ducks quack you feed em The Wall Street maxim is taking on new life in the convertiblesecurities market this year The climate for initial public offerings of stock remains sluggish there have been just three IPOs in the US this year and the appetite for followon stock issues by already public companies is also muted But investors are clamoring for new convertible securities and Wall Street investment bankers with visions of a steady stream of fees dancing in their heads are obliging them We can always use new paper in this market says Nick Calamos a Naperville Ill convertiblesecurities money manager for Calamos Asset Management We may buy only two out of of these deals but we really want as much as possible out there to choose from In the aftermath of last years stockmarket slide convertibles remained one of the healthiest products for Wall Street firms That is because these hybrid securities offer the safety of a bond with features like annual interest payments with the upside potential of a stock since the investor is able to swap his securities for common stock at a predetermined premium to current market prices providing exposure to any rise in stock prices That mix of traits helped push convertible issuance to a record last year when investment bankers used the securities to raise billion in deals according to Convertbondcom an industry Web site run by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co This year looks ready to at least match if not better last year Both investmentgrade and noninvestmentgrade convertible markets are on fire thanks to the interestrate cuts weve had says Phil Jones managing director and head of global equitylinked product development at Merrill Lynch Co Yesterday Federal Reserve policy makers again cut key lending rates dropping the federalfunds rate the interest rate charged by banks on overnight loans to each other to from As with the last rate cut earlier in January the latest reduction is expected to spur investor interest in investments that offer higher yields ranging from convertibles and corporate debt to junk bonds Reflecting investors enthusiasm the Miami cruise line Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd this week sold million of year convertible bonds through underwriter Merrill Lynch Originally the company had planned to sell only million of convertible securities together with an additional million of ordinary debt But demand for the investmentgrade deal surged and the deal was increased and priced several days ahead of schedule at the top end of the range expected That deal brought convertibles issuance for the month of January up to billion dwarfing IPOs which through yesterday had raised a mere million for three companies And although followon stock issues have raised billion for issuers in deals so far this year according to CommScan LLC that is dwarfed by the issuance in January when billion was raised in issues At least one other massive deal was priced ahead of schedule late Tuesday when Enron Corp raised billion in one of the convertible markets largest and most costly deals ever Underwriter Salomon Smith Barney a unit of Citigroup Inc priced the bonds at of par value meaning that they carry a yield to maturity of and have a conversion premium of That means that at the time they were sold the bonds were worth more than the value of the common shares into which they are convertible That is extraordinarily costly Typical deals conversion premiums currently range anywhere between and while Royal Caribbeans issue which like Enrons carried no annual dividend was priced at a premium The most expensive deal of this kind ever priced was last Junes sale of million of zerocoupon bonds issued by retailer Kohls Corp at a premium Thats not a deal well be participating in says Mr Calamos of the Enron deal Theres no way wed be a buyer on those terms In fact the pricing on the Enron transaction like other features of Januarys convertible market remind participants of last years early ebullience As was the case early last year and in contrast to the closing weeks of several of the companies now issuing convertible securities carry junkbond ratings Last year more than threequarters of new convertible issues were either unrated or carried a junkbond rating By late in the year that had stung investors as the stock prices of these issuers including many telecommunications companies and even some Internet firms plunged driving down the value of the convertible securities as well In reaction Novembers newissue calendar was composed largely of higherrated investmentgrade offerings But by January the market had become more receptive to unrated or junkbond issuers and companies like Adelphia Communications Corp Six Flags Inc and XO Communications Inc were once again able to tap the convertibles market Stilljittery investors remain loath to put money to work in IPOs or anything else that is perceived as volatile or risky But some see convertibles as a relative haven meaning that investment bankers stuck with a large list of IPO candidates waiting to go public can at least generate fees from convertibles issues Part of the demand is coming from traditional investors in convertible securities including managers of convertiblesecurities mutual funds and hedge funds But some investors including individuals who at this time last year were eager buyers of IPOs figure that convertibles can offer a combination of safety and exposure to growth stocks Thats really sending demand up and making the pricing aggressive says Jonathan Cunningham managing director of Jefferies Co who monitors the convertible securities market Other markets may be wobbling but ours is open wide for business The wideopen convertibles market is also making it possible for companies to complete concurrent deals simultaneous offerings of either debt or equity along with convertible securities That is what Royal Caribbean did with its billiondollar issue this week And today Aviron a biotech company plans to raise about million in a followon stock offering and at the same time bring in another million through the sale of convertible securities Next week another concurrent deal is expected to be priced with Ciena Corp seeking as much as million from a followon stock issue and million from convertible investors But investors warn bankers not to become too complacent about demand Some warn that they wont be there for the highpriced deals or if quality once again starts to slide Theres a lot of demand for new product but not at any price says Mr Calamos Weve got to keep our heads on straight Financial Hot Dark Summer Ahead for California Drought Worsens Power Crunch Senators Told

summer consultant Larry Makovich of Cambridge Energy Research Associates told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Senators and witnesses at yesterdays hearing debated the possibility of federally imposed price caps or rate controls that Northwest governors have requested to rein in extraordinarily high wholesale electricity prices The proposals are expected to be a main focus of a meeting between western governors and Bush administration officials Friday But so far there is no indication that Congress would move rapidly on that front and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has resisted imposing wholesale price caps in California In the worst case if the regions drought continues and summer electricity demand is very high because of hot weather California could face more than hours of blackouts this year said Joe Bob Perkins president of wholesale operations for Reliant Energy a Houstonbased company that owns major power plants in California Essentially California will have to be incredibly fortunate to avoid blackouts this summer he said Members of the Senate committee agreed Were going to be in a crisis situation this summer as well said Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska the committee chairman Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said she believes that California will be short between and megawatts of power a day when heavy air conditioning use goes up in hot weather A megawatt of power provides electricity to homes In the summer Californias electricity demand rises to a peak of megawatts a day exceeding the states maximum generating capacity of around according to state officials Imports make up the rest Electricity from the Pacific Northwest most of it hydroelectric power contributes as much as percent of Californias power needs in a normal year Recent blackouts in the state were caused by shortages of megawatts affecting California households If the worstcase scenarios come true and shortages reach megawatts blackouts could last six hours at a time affecting more than million people Perkins said A drought in the Pacific Northwest is compounding Californias electricity shortages and the failure of its fouryearold deregulation program The Columbia River and Snake River regions are facing the fourth driest year on record said Sen Gordon H Smith ROre The reservoir behind the Grand Coulee Dam largest in the Northwest is at its lowest level in years and water power from Columbia River dams that normally would be used this summer is being tapped now to help California through its current shortage Smith noted The Northwest Power Planning Council recently warned that the Northwest faces a in chance of power shortages There is a very high probability that the West Coast will face blackouts said Judi Johansen executive vice president of PacifiCorp an electricity utility serving six western states Panelists at yesterdays Senate hearing agreed that California has few immediate options available to deal with continuing shortages this year Although six power plants are under construction most will not come on line until The state should consider paying big industrial users to close their plants and use electricity they have contracted to receive panelists said Conservation by companies and residents could save an additional megawatts a day by one estimate But the current prices paid by Californians capped at roughly levels dont give people an incentive to reduce electricity use panelists said Price caps wont prompt increased production from generators that are paying record prices for the natural gas used to make electricity generating companies executives said You can start turning the power off or pay the price it takes to get power to come said Steven J Kean Enron Corps chief of staff In Sacramento yesterday Gov Gray Davis D said officials are close to completing the first piece of legislation to allow the state government to enter into longterm contracts with power suppliers The state government has been buying power on an emergency basis but the pending legislation would make the state a major electricity buyer for years to come That would in effect end Californias failed experiment with deregulation The legislative action in Sacramento followed the release of a second stateordered audit of one of Californias struggling utility companies The review of Pacific Gas Electrics books showed that the company ignored warnings that its costs for wholesale electricity would soar under deregulation and that it failed to put cash aside to keep the company solvent PGE did not anticipate it would be constrained in its borrowings and did not develop a cash conservation program until December the audit report said The audit also confirmed that Pacific Gas Electric is deeply in debt and nearly broke just as an audit the day before concluded about Southern California Edison Like Southern California Edison Pacific Gas Electric had transferred about billion to its holding company PGE Corp since The money was in part from the sale of its power generating facilities and some of it was used to pay debt Such a transfer is not illegal or improper but it has outraged consumer advocates and some elected officials in CaliforniaBooth reported from Los Angeles Enron award should have been through competitive bidding says Sarma Our Economy Bureau New Delhi Business Standard Copyright c Business Standard Former economic affairs secretary EAS Sarma who quit the government last November said here today the Enron project should have been awarded through competitive bidding and should definitely not have been based on liquid fuels He said the country could not afford highcost electricity and the public sector power producers in India had set competitively low cost benchmarks NTPC and Bhel have been very cost competitive he said Sarma made these comments in his interview on India Talks programme of CNBC television network telecast today His comments are significant as he was involved with the countrys power sector as advisor power in the Planning Commission and subsequently as power secretary before moving to finance ministry as expenditure secretary Sarma however declined to elaborate on individual projects though he said the government should not give any further counter guarantees for power projects in the private sector He said he was in Planning Commission at the time when the guarantees were awarded but he had recommended that it cannot be a substitute for reforms in transmission networks and improvements in the working of state electricity boards He is slated to take over as principal of Administrative Staff College of India in Hyderabad on March Sarma refused to read any motive in his transfer but did say that he was denied the normal courtsey of being told that he was being transferred to department of coal He also said that there had been far too many transfers in last three years in the government Sarma resigned last November when he was suddenly transferred from the finance ministry in a large scale reshuffle of secretary level officers including finance secretary PG Mankad However he said that the current group of officers in North Block is competent enough to deliver the budget On the target of eight per cent growth set for the next fiscal the former economic affairs secretary said growth would be difficult

Remedies to Feb Update Adds background on missed payments in fourth paragraph power alert in seventh paragraph auction in eighth paragraph For more on Californias electricity crisis see EXTRA GO Rosemead California Jan Bloomberg Southern California Edison Cos banks agreed to delay taking action against the utility until at least Feb for defaulting on lines of credit an executive of its parent company said The banks have agreed to forbear through that date Ted Craver Edison Internationals chief financial officer said in a conference call with investors The group of banks have the right to demand accelerated payments or seek other remedies after Southern California Edison Californias secondlargest utility failed to make million of payments on maturing notes last week That produced a cross default on its lines of credit Both the utility and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric defaulted last week on commercial paper a type of moneymarket security In addition Southern California Edison failed to pay million to power generators The two utilities have piled up more than billion in powerbuying debt because rising demand and short supplies have driven up the price they pay and the states deregulation law caps the rates they can charge customers For more than a week the California Independent System Operator has kept its highest alert in place The Stage Three alert is imposed by the ISO which runs threequarters of the states power grid when reserves fall to within percent of demand Bankruptcy Outlook The state is now running an auction to solicit bids for multiyear power contracts on behalf of the utilities Producers can submit offers in the auction which ends at noon California time to sell power for as long as years Meanwhile Southern California Edison and the banks are getting the final paperwork mopped up on the forbearance agreement Craver said in yesterdays conference call The utility doesnt intend to file for bankruptcy Craver said We do not believe that solves anything he said as it doesnt change the need for political and regulatory action to address the utilitys cash crunch Thats why we instituted this additional step of the temporary payment suspension Craver said We believe were in a position to operate the business without running out of cash for at least three weeks he said He described the utilitys net cash flow as at least breakeven after the payment suspensions Craver was asked during the teleconference about the chances that power generators or other creditors might force the utility into an involuntary bankruptcy Making Progress Generators are aware of the notsosubtle threats that bubble about regarding the state using eminent domain to take control of power plants or contracts Its in everybodys best interest to find a way out that avoids bankruptcy Craver said Thats the way everybodys operating California Governor Gray Davis and state lawmakers are working on potential solutions including locking in longterm power contracts to help keep the two utilities from bankruptcy The states Department of Water Resources has an initial stake of million to buy electricity for the utilities Were continuing to make progress and its encouraging thats being recognized said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Davis There is now a very great deal of urgency among state leaders to develop a comprehensive framework of solutions Robert Foster Edisons senior vice president of public affairs said during the conference call A framework may be in place by Feb Foster said I havent seen anything quite this intense in years in the state capital he added Paying the Bills Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg is working on a bill that calls for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric to give up hydroelectric plants In exchange the state would sell revenue bonds that repay past spending and finance power purchases on their behalf I dont think at this point were really able to respond to that proposal without more details Craver said In response to a question on the transfer of hydroelectric plants utility officials said the issues would include secured bondholders liens on Edisons assets Utility officials said they have also been asked about who will repay the million of initial state spending on power purchases Based on the legislative intent it is Edisons understanding that this power be paid for directly by the customers not the utilities Stephen Pickett vice president and general counsel of Southern California Edison said during the teleconference It is not completely clear that that is the case Pickett said Craver also stressed that Edison the parent of the utility hasnt gone into default on its obligations Were not having difficulty meeting our obligations he said and its
