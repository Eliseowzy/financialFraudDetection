countless other circa market superstars has come Its way ahead of itself Theres been so much overbuilding in telecom it will take years before supply and demand come back into balance Etc Such sentiments are fine and for the most part I agree with them The problem I have is that so many bears seem to confine their discussion to the same group of stocks that mesmerized so many investors during the bubble days Thats unfortunate The same mistake that causes so much financial pain on the way down seems likely to strike again The source of the pain an inappropriately narrow view of the
