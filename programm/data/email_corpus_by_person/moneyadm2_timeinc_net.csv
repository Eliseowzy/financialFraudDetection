FREE Click Here bestof Surprise me The big surprise this week is that earnings are coming in slightly better than expected NEW YORK CNNmoney The great thing about unrelenting pessimism is that any surprises are likely to be pleasant ones Thats pretty much the point investors reached after the Sept attacks Expectations for thirdquarter profits are now so negative that even mediocre reports count as good news In fact the results that have come out in the past few days particularly for some of the financials and drug companies are better than mediocre I continue to be somewhat more optimistic than many economists I believe that the Federal Reserves enormous interestrate cuts will fuel an upturn in the economy and that the rate cuts would already be taking effect were it not for the economic damage stemming from Sept Fears of further terrorism continue to undermine the market overshadowing faint signs of improving fundamentals As a result the Dow was down points on Wednesday despite several strong earnings reports Freddie Mac FRE down to Research Estimates reported a percent earnings gain for the third quarter That follows Fannie Maes FNM down to Research Estimates strong report which I discussed in Mondays column see A lenders market Citigroup C up to Research Estimates announced a percent decline in thirdquarter earnings after expenses related to last months attacks Without the unexpected charges Citigroup would have posted a doubledigit gain and the company projects percent growth in the fourth quarter JP Morgan Chase JPM up to Research Estimates announced a percent drop in earnings but the results were in line with analysts reduced forecasts The strongest sector this fall may well turn out to be pharmaceuticals Two leading companies reported strong results on Wednesday Pfizer the worlds leading drugmaker turned in a stunning percent profit gain for the third quarter confirming the companys status as the mustown choice in the industry Blockbuster products such as anticholesterol drug Lipitor helped fuel sales while cost cutting in the wake of last years WarnerLambert acquisition bolstered profit margins Solid but less flamboyant gains were announced by Johnson Johnson where thirdquarter earnings gained nearly percent A few bright spots dont add up to a fireworks display but there are two pieces of conventional wisdom worth keeping in mind right now The first is that the direction of the market depends on how profit trends compare with expectations The bad news has already been factored into stock prices What matters from here on is not whether results are good but whether theyre not as bad as feared The other fact to remember is the importance of diversification The greatest upside leverage when the economy recovers will probably be among the bigcap tech stocks But drug stocks are equally important parts of a wellbalanced growth portfolio JJs JNJ up to Research Estimates percent longterm annual growth rate and broad diversification within healthcare makes it an appealing choice for conservative investors At a share the stock trades at times next years projected results But it may be smarter to pay up a little more for Pfizer PFE up to Research Estimates At the shares are trading at times projected earnings for Thats not a cheap PE but its a small premium to pay for the No company in the industry with a

on Friday the Defense Department announced the winner of the largest military project in history the billion Joint Strike Fighter This plane will be a mainstay for three branches of the US armed forces as well as the UKs navy and air force LockheedMartin was the big winner but it wasnt the only one Boeing which also had bid on the project will likely make parts of the plane And a host of other defense companies stand to benefit from subcontracting deals United Technologies is virtually a sure thing since that companys Pratt Whitney division was set to provide engines for both the Lockheed and the Boeing proposals Honeywell is also expected to be a major subcontractor Both Honeywell and United Technologies look like irresistible buying opportunities for contrarian investors with a time horizon beyond three years or so The stocks got clobbered after Sept because both companies make important components used on commercial aircraft With airlines reeling from the dropoff in travel the nearterm outlook for that market is dim From a longerterm perspective however demand for aircraft engines and subassemblies should be just dandy Even before the war on terrorism US military spending was slated to rise over the next few years And after the twin towers fell another billion was added to the budget for the current fiscal year Its also important to realize that the commercial market wont stay depressed for more than a couple of years Reporting its biggest loss ever on Wednesday American Airlines parent AMR said that it had cut back flights by percent and that it was postponing of the new plane deliveries scheduled for Air travel will eventually recover however and planes do wear out That means that delayed deliveries do have to be made up within two or three years United Technologies UTX up to Research Estimates gets percent of its earnings from Pratt Whitney engines and percent from Sikorsky helicopters and aircraft control systems The rest comes from airconditioning and elevators Although the stock price has rebounded from its lows its still down percent from its Sept close At a current a share the stock is trading at less than times next years earnings which are projected to be down slightly from this years results Over the next five years however earnings growth could average as much as percent annually Honeywells HON up to Research Estimates outlook is much the same although the stock is also reeling from the aftershocks of its failed merger with General Electric After the deal was stopped by European regulators the stock dropped from to It fell again to after Sept before rebounding somewhat CEO Michael Bonsignore left Honeywell after the merger failed and previous CEO Lawrence Bossidy was called back into service Bossidy is making tough restructuring moves that are hurting current results but will leave Honeywell even better positioned for the next upturn in aerospace which accounts for percent of Honeywells sales and an even larger percentage of earnings Currently a share Honeywell is trading at times earnings which are expected to be flat with this years Longterm growth is projected at percent annually Given the tough times that are likely before aerospace rebounds it may be a little bit early for both these stocks But for an investor with a longterm time horizon the PEs look awfully cheap compared

MONEY Magazine FREE Click Here bestof Boeing in the bargain bin The airline industry is reeling and the leading US maker of commercial aircraft is down to times earnings By Michael Sivy NEW YORK CNNMoney This year has been a nightmare for the airline industry The Sept attacks showed that a fully fueled airplane is the handiest terrorist weapon short of a portable atomic bomb Recurrent airport security failures and last weeks crash of an American Airlines Airbus A shortly after takeoff from New York Citys John F Kennedy Airport made travelers even more anxious Air traffic is running at least percent below normal seasonal levels In the highly leveraged airline industry profits are sensitive to even small changes in traffic So the current dropoff has devastated earnings As a result airline stocks are down percent since early September This miserable business climate has also hurt industry suppliers particularly Boeing the leading US maker of commercial aircraft which closed at on Friday up cents The company is also having problems in other facets of its business such as military contracts The cumulative effect has been to drive the stock down to its lowest valuation in nearly a decade When Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas in the company hoped it was ensuring a lock on the commercial aircraft market by eliminating a rival Since that deal closed however the European airplane manufacturer Airbus has become a much tougher competitor In addition Boeing overexpanded in the late s leading to a sharp drop in operating margins Recently many airlines have been postponing delivery of planes they have ordered Continental for instance which has been losing as much as million a day since Sept is taking delivery of planes but may defer another And on top of all that Boeing lost an important military contract to Lockheed Martin last month None of these setbacks is permanent however Terrorism can be contained and public confidence will return Despite all the scares of the past few months flying is still far less risky than getting in a car Boeing CEO Phil Condit acknowledges that the companys business may lag for as long as three and a half years But a global economic upturn will revive orders that have been postponed as airlines eventually have to replace aging planes When the upturn comes Airbus will be able to retain some of the market share it has captured since it topped Boeing in But the European consortium has made a big bet on the very largest planes while Boeing is using its military knowhow to improve the speed and fuelefficiency on regularsize jets that account for a larger percentage of the overall market This strategy should greatly improve profit margins even if the company cedes some share to Airbus When Lockheed won the Joint Strike Fighter project in October Boeing lost out on the military contract of the decade The deal could ultimately be worth billion domestically and more in international sales But the Pentagon does not want Lockheed to become the sole viable US aerospace contractor So Boeing will likely receive extensive subcontracting opportunities on the JSF and other smaller defense contracts over the next few years Boeings earnings for should rise percent from last years depressed levels But results will slip back some next year as deliveries are delayed Even allowing for that dip in profits Boeings stock is dirt cheap At a current share price of Boeing trades at only times next years projected earnings Even more striking the stock goes for only six times cash flow Thats about the cheapest that industrial companies ever get Since Boeing has used some of that cash to purchase more than percent of its outstanding stock And further massive share buybacks are planned for the next couple of years Its true that a full recovery for this stock could take as long as six years But Boeing remains an essential company for US commercial and military aviation Even partial progress would move the share price substantially higher And ultimately the share price could easily reach double or even triple current levels Thats the kind of payoff that makes a long wait worthwhile Read all of Michaels columns at

reason By Michael Sivy MONEY editoratlarge Ken Kurson and Michael Sivy go headtohead over this columns recommendation of McDonalds see Supersize this Stock moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml On Monday Sivy argued that the stock is a good buy even though it appears beset with problems the economic slowdown in the US fears about madcow disease and hoofandmouth disease that have depressed beef consumption in Europe and the chronically weak euro which reduces the value of McDonalds European profits Sivy believes that these problems will soon pass profit growth will pick up again and the stocks valuation well below historical levels will climb back toward normal Kurson doesnt buy it Their debate follows Kurson This time youve gone too far How can you possibly like anything about McDonalds either the business OR the stock Im assuming you at LEAST detest the food Yes the valuations are cheap next to its own historical averages but NOT against competitors The PEG ratio is by far highest in the group McDonalds PEG is versus for Brinker EAT for CBRL Group CBRL for Darden DRI and a lowly for Tricon YUM despite those endless delicious stuffed crust innovations at Pizza Hut And McDonalds pricesales ratio is more than TWICE any of its competitors And for what A proven ability in the PAST to build faster and a net profit margin thats the envy of the sector But as your column points out overseas is where the opportunity is and also where the problems are You say the problems will pass but I totally disagree Madcow disease and hoofandmouth disease MAY be temporary faddish fashionable concerns I happen to think theyre not so easily dismissed but even conceding that point it doesnt get at the root of MCDs failure to replicate overseas the disgusting and disgustingly profitable empire it has erected here Evidence Japan where MCD is planning a piddling new stores in versus in Thats the companys second biggest market bigger than Europe and there are concerns about profit margins there as well You rightly point out the company relied too heavily on promotional gimmicks But then you give MCD points for totally ridiculous stuff like highend coffee at their McCafes Yeah right Im sure Starbucks is quaking in its boots Just like Pizza Hut was terrified by McPizza Sivy The short response to the points you raise is that I dont really believe in securities analysis Heres the longer version I dont believe that projections of a companys business trends are more reliable than the stocks actual track record and natural statistical tendencies such as regression to the mean If analysts couldnt anticipate the effect of telecom infrastructure overbuilding on Ciscos business they cant anticipate anything Fact is McDonalds has proved remarkably resilient over time despite its mediocre products The same arguments you make now have been made before And yet McDonalds has retained its dominant position relative to Tricon and Wendys and other smaller chains When globalization was a hot concept right after the Berlin Wall fell companies with global franchises enjoyed excellent growth Now globaloney is out of fashion and no one is willing to pay up for such franchises that goes for US packaged food companies too At the moment everything is going against McDonalds stock But most of the these trends are cyclical in one way or another The US economy will turn And the McDonalds marketing machine will improve its success rate And sooner or later the stocks multiple will improve Im not looking for the next Dell Computer but I do think that from this price the return on McDonalds will beat a percent hurdle rate As to the current backlash against beef I regard it as a temporary and rather ridiculous expression of deviant psychology Basically the same sorts of people who supported North Vietnam in the s have redirected their selfhatred from the national to the personal level This leads to bodypiercing food phobias and incompetent riots at international freetrade meetings This too shall pass or at least be redirected again to rescuing mink or something Kurson I too place no faith in securities analysts and thus share your suspicion about growthrate projections But I certainly believe in securities analysis and you do too because thats what it is to recommend MCD based upon its history the cyclical nature of the economy the foolhardiness of those who oppose beef These all fit comfortably under the heading of traditional analysis and I dont see any percentage in throwing out all the tools just because a couple of them display the greasy fingerprints of sellside analysts As for your point about past record being more compelling yeah I give a company credit for a track record But only when theres a forwardlooking justification for why that success and higher valuation will continue I mean if a stock costs more than the stock of its peers because the company is doing things differently and is hard to imitate Im willing to afford it some juice But if a stock costs more simply because it always has Im skeptical Especially when things have changed to make previous advantages less impressive as I believe has happened to McDonalds Thats why I cited the sharp falloff of store openings in Japan Any drop in beef consumption may very well be temporary Theres clearly no limit to how fat Americans are willing to become and like a lot of trends were way out in front and I expect the rest of the world to follow suit in time However I DONT think McDonalds will continue to show the dominance in fulfilling that demand or at least continue to do so way better than competitors Sivy Where I differ with you is that I have a far greater skepticism toward all trend projections even though I acknowledge that we have to use them to value stocks Just as economists have predicted of the past seven recessions securities analysts tend to overpredict changes in earnings trends What really changes though is the level of valuations A decade ago everyone loved companies with global brand names Now they ignore those stocks I tend to think that the fashion has changed far more than the underlying fundamentals Statistically its most successful to bet on companies with strong track records when theyre off their game and valuations are low thats true even if you cant predict where their next success will come

rebound begins Greenspans aggressive rate cutting will fuel a market comeback that should boost stock prices percent or more over the next months By Michael Sivy For nine months the economy has been slowing And most growth stocks have been dragged down by a brutal decline in tech shares Through it all investors complained that the Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates too high Well theres nothing left to complain about Fed chairman Alan Greenspans surprise halfpoint cut on Wednesday brings interest rates down to where they should be And make no mistake about it the economy will begin picking up speed and the stock market will be substantially higher a year from now Greenspan has been widely criticized for keeping rates high for so long He began raising them in early and continued to keep rates up through the end of last year High rates made sense in the first half of when the GDP was growing at an annual rate around percent fast enough to rekindle inflation But it was a mistake for Greenspan to continue keeping money tight after growth slackened to percent in the third quarter Moreover even once he began cutting rates in January he brought them down too slowly I believe that Greenspan held up rates for so long because he knows how tough it is to fight inflation For political reasons its often hard to increase interest rates So when the Fed has a chance to give inflation an extra push down simply by keeping rates up a bit too long thats the politically savvy choice Greenspan even has a term for that ploy he calls it opportunistic disinflation Such a policy was perfectly feasible as long as the economy was expanding slightly and thereby narrowly escaping recession But capital spending continued to weaken and mounting stock market losses threatened to undercut consumer spending Then when the March employment numbers were announced on April they showed the first drop in a long time With employment weakening and unemployment rising Greenspan could no longer afford to keep his foot on the brake And so two weeks later he cut rates laying the groundwork for a substantial rebound Im not minimizing the risks that still exist The economy will most likely be weak for another quarter And plenty of individual stocks will suffer in May and June as companies warn of disappointing secondquarter results There are also lots of industryspecific problems to worry about Banks face rising losses on bad tech loans telecommuniciations companies could suffer from overcapacity for at least another months and various tech firms are still trying to work off excess inventories In fact the current market rally could burn out in a week or two But I believe the market has already seen its lows And if those lows are retested between May and July I doubt the indexes will go much below where theyve already been More important the prices of big strong wellestablished growth stocks figure to be substantially higher a year from now Historically after the Fed has cut rates four times in a row blue chips gain more than percent over the following year I think were looking at those kinds of gains again Tech stocks will rally but so will other glamour growth stocks including entertainment shares and top retailers Ive already mentioned in this column that I jumped the gun by loading up on tech indexes in January and February and then running up percent to percent losses in March as the sector suffered its final drop Well after today Im almost even so I plan on buying myself a really good brandy after dinner this evening And whatever the ups and downs of the next few months I expect to be feeling even better come next April Post your comments on Michaels column at deptsinvestingsivyindexhtml To subscribe or unsubscribe to Sivy on Stocks go to email

Trial issue of MONEY Click Here scholarship Unrecognized power plays These five electric utilities are undervalued and underappreciated by analysts But they offer superior longterm returns By Michael Sivy Given the recent turmoil in the stock market and uncertainty about the economys prospects for the rest of the year many investors have been diversifying their portfolios with income investments In March for instance shareholders pulled a record amount of money out of equity mutual funds the last time stock funds saw comparable outflows was in the aftermath of the crash Much of the money has gone into income investments and especially bond funds Funds that invest in Treasury bonds and other highquality longterm issues are especially popular Personally though I think there are better alternatives that offer higher yields more flexibility and longterm growth potential Preferred shares for instance can offer yields of more than percent compared with percent for Treasuries For more information on these unique investments see Preferred shares uncommon values moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml And they generally sell in round lots costing only about versus at least for most bonds My top income choices however are utility stocks and for one very simple reason rising dividends When you buy a bond or a preferred stock you lock in a certain level of return And since there is always some inflation the real purchasing power of your income erodes over time But most electric utilities offer longterm dividend growth Even though utilities earnings increases dont look like much compared with the growth rates of tech stocks even percent or percent a year will keep you ahead of inflation and eventually outpace the return on bonds see Selecting stocks for income moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml One of my top utility picks over the past year has been Duke Energy DUK an electric company based in the Carolinas In addition to having a wellrun local business Duke has profited enormously because one of its subsidiaries provides power to the California market where electricity prices are soaring As a result the stock has gained percent since I first recommended it last summer I still think Duke has attractive longterm prospects but obviously its not as good a buy as it was a year ago Where are todays best values in the electric utility sector For the answer I turned to the Leuthold Group a valueoriented investment advisory firm in Minneapolis that regularly does a quantitative screen for stocks that are undervalued because they are out of favor Of the stocks the most recent screen identified are electric utilities Of those Ive winnowed out five that have solid finances and offer projected earnings growth of percent or more over the next five years In addition these electric companies have modest PEs based on this years estimated results The five include DTE Energy DTE at a share The parent company for Detroit Edison is in the process of acquiring MCN Energy a Michigan gas company which could boost the combined firms longterm earnings growth In the meantime DTE pays a percent yield and trades at a PE FirstEnergy FE the holding company for Ohio Edison is in the middle of a complicated attempt to acquire GPU and uncertainty about the deal has depressed the stock Whether it goes through or not at a share FirstEnergy offers a percent yield and a PE OGE OGE Energy is the holding company for Oklahoma Gas Electric At the stock offers a percent yield and a PE Pinnacle West Capital PNW parent of Arizona Public Service is expanding its generating capacity in the Southwest At a share this growthoriented utility pays a percent yield and trades at a PE Finally Potomac Electric POM supplies power to Washington DC and the surrounding area The company is acquiring the Delaware utility Connectiv in a move that should enhance longterm returns At a share Potomac Electric carries a percent yield and a PE and should grow

the past seven years stocks with the largest market capitalizations outperformed mid and smallcap stocks As a result the big guys grew more overvalued relative to smaller companies In the wake of the tech wreck that valuation gap is narrowing but theres still a long way to go And that means opportunity Shares of the largest companies those with market caps of roughly billion or more trade at an average PE of around Smaller companies have average PEs in the to range PEs vary with companies earnings growth rates of course but right now smaller stocks offer growth at a cheaper price As investors realize what good deals are available share prices of those companies are likely to benefit from rising priceearnings multiples Here are three companies that look well worth further investigation T Rowe Price TROW is a stock Ive always liked The share price has gone nowhere since the stock traded in the high s back then and is currently at The reason not surprisingly is the economic downturn mutual fund companies take such setbacks especially hard But T Rowe Price seems to be past the worst the share price is up percent since the April lows I view this stock as a lot more than just a cyclical play however Mutual funds companies earn profits based on the dollarvalue of the assets they manage And those assets grow in two ways First investors can add new cash to funds Except for a couple of months earlier this year inflows into stock funds have remained uninterrupted for most of the past decade That trend will continue as Americans become increasingly responsible for providing for their own retirement A fund companys assets under management also grow however simply because the market rises over time increasing the total value of the stocks in the funds they run So if the SP returns percent a year T Rowes profits should climb a bit faster The shares currently trade at times this years estimated earnings St Joe JOE is a special situation a real estate holding company that controls a big chunk of the Florida panhandle Much of the companys millionplus acres or nearly percent of the state is beachfront or nearwaterfront within miles of the Gulf Coast St Joe is a competent developer of resorts and planned communities but in truth the stock is a play on the opening up of the Florida panhandle Acreage there is cheaper than along other parts of the Gulf Coast because of lousy transportation and infrastructure More highways and an enlarged airport are in the works however and as theyre completed land values could rise substantially At the shares look a bit dear on a pricetoearnings basis but St Joe is really valued on its assets Whole Foods Market WFMI operates a chain of more than natural foods supermarkets making it the category leader A quarter of the stores are in California and profit margins have been hurt there by power shortages Nonetheless earnings were up more than percent in the most recent quarter And the company has indicated that earnings could grow at a percentplus annual rate in the second half Analysts believe Whole Foods could more than double its number of stores over the next seven years simply by expanding to other parts of the US The chains compound earnings growth is projected at up to percent for the next five years At the stock which will soon split for trades at times this years estimated

of MONEY Click Here scholarship Sivys mailbox Answers to questions about tech indexes preferred stock ATT and Diebold By Michael Sivy Ive received a lot of questions and comments lately about the volatile tech sector So let me begin by explaining what I think is going on and outlining my best guess about the outlook for the rest of the year In recent columns Ive been generally upbeat about the longterm prospects for tech stocks but Ive also warned about the likelihood of a June pullback as companies begin to project weak results for the current quarter The bad news has already begun with Sun Microsystems warning on Tuesday that its quarterly earnings would be well below expectations The stock plummeted nearly percent on Wednesday and helped depress the Nasdaq composite index by more than percent And the market is likely to remain shaky until secondquarter reports are mostly out around midJuly I expect that business conditions will be starting to recover by the end of the third quarter The Federal Reserves interestrate cuts take six to nine months to work and since the first cut was in January we certainly should be feeling the effect by Oct In the meantime there will probably be a lull but that doesnt change the longterm case for big topquality tech stocks It just foreshadows a dismal summer Now here are answers to some specific questions Q Youve written about the Nasdaq Trust and the SPDR technology portfolio What are they and where can I find them A They are unmanaged index funds that trade on the American Stock Exchange You can buy them through any broker just as though they were common stocks The Nasdaq QQQ QQQ which holds Nasdaq stocks is the more aggressive of the two The tech SPDR XLK XLK holds more than tech issues but includes mature businesses like IBM that trade on the New York Stock Exchange Both however are a good way to buy a broad cross section of big tech stocks to hold for several years Q In The Bull is Back you recommend a Merrill Lynch preferred stock Where can I find it moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchiveahtml A I think preferred shares are a worthwhile alternative to bonds for investors looking for fixed income Many goodquality preferreds yield more than percent and they often can be bought in round lots costing less than compared with at least for a bond The biggest problem with preferreds is that they often can be called or redeemed before maturity Most preferreds are protected against calls for four years or so but some Merrill Lynch issues have longer call protection In the past Ive recommended Merrill Lynch preferred F merf which appears in the Wall Street Journal preferred stock table and currently yields percent Preferred ticker symbols vary from one financial website to the next For the most recent quote on Moneycom click here MERF moneyquoteqcsymbolsMERF For more information on how preferreds work see Preferred shares Uncommon values moneydeptsinvestingsivyarchivehtml Q What do you think about ATT A Frankly I dont know what to think at this point Chairman C Michael Armstrong was right that the company couldnt stick with its traditional strategy But the socalled broadband company he tried to build through expensive acquisitions of cable companies hasnt solved the problem Now ATT T is backtracking by splitting up again with planned spinoffs of its wireless and cable TV operations I figure that the share price is cheap relative to the total value of ATTs assets but the company isnt earning much money right now To my mind that makes the shares a hold on the theory that sooner or later the asset value will show through Q Youve recommended Diebold before What do you think of it now A I basically like Diebold DBD a midsize tech stock that is a leading maker of automated teller machines Diebolds stock dropped more than percent in as bank mergers and branch closings slowed demand for new ATMs And currently demand is suffering from the capital spending slump caused by the economic slowdown Even so the stock is up percent to a share over the past months and it has gained a couple of bucks since I last recommended it in November Capital spending should improve over the next couple of years Diebolds earnings look to be flat this year but should be up more than percent in and could grow at nearly a percent compound rate over the next five years Best of all the stock is cheap at only about times estimated earnings for the current year Post your comments on Michaels column at deptsinvestingsivyindexhtml To subscribe or unsubscribe to Sivy on Stocks go to email

Interest rate trends couldnt be more favorable but leading banks such as JP Morgan and Bank One cant get any traction By Michael Sivy If I were asked to name the single most important stock market indicator Id say the tilt of the yield curve When longterm interest rates are at least half a percentage point higher than shortterm rates the economy typically grows at a healthy rate But when shortterm rates are even with or higher than longterm rates the economy almost always stagnates or starts contracting The yield curve is especially important for banks since they have to borrow shortterm money that they lend to longterm borrowers The difference between short and longterm rates therefore is a rough gauge of banks profit margins After five cuts in shortterm interest rates this year by the Federal Reserve the difference between short and long rates is two full percentage points With loan margins that fat youd think that the top US bank stocks would be in great shape But they arent Shares of leading banks such as JP Morgan Chase JPM and Bank One ONE are flat to down so far this year And both stocks have announced that their earnings for the current quarter will be below what analysts were expecting Whats the explanation for the lousy results Essentially there are two problems Many of the big banks lent aggressively during the boom of the past five years and now find themselves saddled with lots of problem loans In the case of JP Morgan Chase those loans are to tech firms such as telecoms Bank Ones problem loans by contrast represent creditcard debt But in both cases the banks will have to clean up their portfolios before they can truly profit from the improved interestrate environment Global giants such as JP Morgan Chase have a second set of problems Over the past five years their earnings became increasingly dependent on investment banking activity such as IPO underwriting private equity investments and proprietary trading All of those businesses are depressed and will likely remain so until the tenor of the market improves substantially And even though the Nasdaq is up percent from the April lows JP Morgans losses on past investments are still outpacing its gains on those that are recovering Where does that leave the stocks Basically they have a lot of sewage to wade through for the rest of this year But they should be coming back strongly by the start of And of course share prices normally anticipate such improvements by at least a few months I recommended JP Morgan Chase in January at a share saying the bank faced a rough six months followed by accelerating growth over the coming three years That scenario is unfolding more slowly than I expected and the share price has declined by six bucks But for longterm investors I continue to believe that this is the mustown bank stock However long it takes to clean everything up the bank will be a powerhouse a couple of years from now And after slipping back since January the share price seems absurdly cheap The banks earnings power is well over a share a rate it should reach sometime next year At the current share price thats a priceearnings multiple of less than for a stock with a percent compound growth rate and a percent dividend yield Im less enthusiastic about Bank One Consumer indebtedness has doubled since So I cant help but wonder how quickly the banks problem loans will be taken care of Its true that consumers will be getting some tax relief and that recent mortgage refinancings have boosted disposable income But we all know that most of that money is going to be spent instead of going to reduce household debt As a result I think Bank One will be working through problem loans for a while and its a more expensive stock than many other bank issues

Click Here bestof Iron horse The lousy economy is masking steady improvement at the nations largest railroad Union Pacific By Michael Sivy NEW YORK CNNmoney As October draws to a close the stock market is being forced to digest some nasty news On the economic front there were negative earnings forecasts and fears of a massive debt default in Argentina Reports of new anthrax cases and the growing belief that the US has lost the initiative in Afghanistan further undermined investor confidence In addition many mutual funds that close out their fiscal year on Oct were windowdressing dumping losing stocks that they dont want to have in their portfolios when they next report to shareholders The overall result was that the stock market opened lower on Monday and fell throughout the day At the close the Dow was down points or nearly percent while the Nasdaq was almost percent lower Still nothing has really changed Eventually the economy will turn and many topquality growth stocks with great franchises and strong financials are clearly cheap Among them tech leaders such as Applied Materials and Microsoft healthcare giants such as Pfizer and Johnson Johnson depressed entertainment stocks such as Disney and top financial services such as Citigroup MBNA and Fannie Mae STOCKS TO CONSIDER Applied Materials Citigroup Fannie Mae Johnson Johnson Microsoft Pfizer There are lessglamorous stocks however that are advancing under the radar particularly cyclical businesses that have been reducing their costs and are now poised for big earnings gains when the economy finally rebounds A good case in point is the railroad industry and particularly the nations largest railroad Union Pacific The current company was created in when the old Union Pacific acquired Southern Pacific The merger was a strategic masterstroke on paper and a practical disaster Difficulties integrating the two railroads went far beyond the usual postmerger stumbles Rail traffic jams in Texas became a mess that took years to sort out As a result Union Pacifics share price has yet to surpass its high in fact it is currently percent below that level Nonetheless the company has slowly been getting its act together Traffic problems have been resolved and much of the excess overhead resulting from the merger has been eliminated Because business remains weak however very little of this progress is evident Today Union Pacific UNP down to Research Estimates is the largest US railroad both in track miles and in freight revenue The companys rail network covers the western twothirds of the country with major links both to the East Coast and to Mexico Union Pacifics customer mix is highly diverse including lowsulfur coal and agricultural products Revenues have basically been flat this year Lower costs and cheaper energy prices have offset this topline weakness allowing Union Pacific to post a percent earnings gain in thirdquarter results which were announced a couple of weeks ago And analysts expect these trends to continue through the first quarter of As the economy improves next year however earnings could shoot ahead at better than a percent annual rate and continue to grow in the low teens over the next five years At a current price of a share Union Pacific trades at only times next years projected earnings Moreover cash flow is more than double net income That means plenty of cash will be pouring in to improve the companys balance sheet from a B to an A Relative to cash flow Union Pacifics stock is about as cheap as you can get and the upside leverage in a

FREE Click Here bestof Shattered glass Reflections from the Corning debacle By Michael Sivy NEW YORK CNNmoney I receive emails from time to time taking me to task because stocks that I like have gone down Not surprisingly these emails have become more frequent in the past six months as the bear market has worsened But not all stock market disappointments can be fully explained by the recession Some stock disasters are genuinely shocking and seem to violate all the principles that usually keep investors out of serious trouble Such cases are worth special consideration and analysis There is no stock that has surprised me more over the past year than Corning the worlds leading maker of fiber optic cable Had you told me a year ago that Corning GLW down to Research Estimates was going to drop from more than a share to less than today I would have said that was practically impossible And yet it happened The fundamental case for Corning seems unassailable The former maker of highperformance glass discovered that the companys expertise could be much more profitably employed in hightech than in making ovenproof cookware The burgeoning telecom market had a seemingly endless appetite for fiber optic cable And Corning quickly became the worlds biggest producer with percent of the market Moreover the company not only was the bigvolume producer but was also the leader in the mostprofitable cuttingedge fiber optics Then came the problems Only trouble was that telecom companies became so overconfident in the late s that they laid far more cable than they actually needed In fact there will be excess capacity for at least another months Needless to say few customers are going to order a lot of cable from Corning in the interim So sales volume in some product lines is down more than percent In its thirdquarter report released after the market closed on Thursday Corning announced a percent drop in operating earnings to cents a share And that was the good news Aftertax restructuring costs for the quarter were million More restructuring charges are still to come The fourth quarter will likely result in an operating loss of at least cents a share And Cornings chief fiber optic cable plants will be idled for at least two months At this point there are three questions that need to be answered Where does Corning go from here Is there any point at which it would be a contrarian buy And finally is there anything to be learned from the situation If I owned individual tech stocks rather than indexes I would have owned Corning I would have held it throughout the decline and I certainly wouldnt sell it here The company remains the dominant player in fiber optic cable And for all the cable that has been laid there is still times as much left to do Moreover when the wiring starts again Corning will profit from being the technological leader with the best highmargin products On the negative side Corning is spending somewhere in the neighborhood of billion on restructuring Less than half of that is in cash and Corning has more than billion on hand so serious financial problems are unlikely But they are possible if business deteriorates far more than anyone expects At this point I would treat Corning stock like an option The upside is enormous three or four times the current price in a couple of years But the risk is much greater than usual for a stock of Cornings quality The most basic truth to be learned from the Corning story is that your reasoning can be impeccable and you can still lose your shirt on a stock Corning seemed to have everything going for it leadership and technological dominance in a market with a very high core growth rate and an exemplary balance sheet Corning is the poster child for diversification The goal is not so much guarding against obvious risks but rather guarding against risks that cant happen but do Two final thoughts Corning traded as high as PE last year and market historians will tell you that as a rule no company sustains a PE of more than for any length of time Theres just not enough good news in the world for that Finally oneproduct companies no matter how brilliant that product may be always carry special risks In the short run at least the market for Cornings fiber has turned out to be an optical illusion Read all of Michaels columns at marketssivy To subscribe or unsubscribe to Sivy on Stocks

stock market is flat on its back By Michael Sivy As longtime readers of this column know I like to focus mainly on the biggest most financially healthy companies Such bluechip growth stocks are wellfollowed by Wall Street analysts and by the media so their prospects are generally reflected in the share price Occasionally however those stocks get undervalued but they generally return to fair valuations within a few years If you buy them when theyre down odds are youll at least match and probably slightly outpace the general market over a decade or longer For a list of the stocks I think are most worth tracking see the Sivy sivy There are however smart ways to enhance that basic strategy Some investors for example search for socalled special situations stocks that will rise or fall based on unique events like a takeover bid or a corporate restructuring Anticipating such events takes some savvy but there are guideposts that can help One excellent source for those tips is The Superstock Investor a new book by Charles LaLoggia and Cherrie Mahon published by McGraw Hill Ive known Charlie for more than a decade and hes spotted a lot of great opportunities particularly among midcap and smaller stocks that arent well followed by analysts In fact I featured one of his recommendations in Sivy on Stocks last November United Industrial UIC a small defenserelated company with little debt Since then the stock has risen percent to a share Since every special situation is different the best way to learn about them is to read through a lot of case studies and Charlies book is full of them But he also lists a number of signs to watch for that can help you identify a stock poised for big gains The most important thing to remember is that a special situation needs a catalyst that can unlock its value Here are potential triggers An outside investor files a D form with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealing that it has accumulated more than percent of a companys stock A company with one outsider that owns more than percent of the stock attracts other investors who buy big stakes An outside owner announces that it is seeking ways to enhance shareholder value or expresses an interest in selling its stake A dispute about the best way to get the stock price up breaks out between a companys management and a major outside shareholder A company with one or more large outside owners announces a stock buyback program giving more influence to the biggest shareholders who will push to get the stock price up A company in a consolidating industry sells or spins off noncore assets thereby turning itself into a pure play that is likely to be even more attractive to potential acquirers A company in a consolidating industry announces a restructuring charge that causes its share price to decline substantially making the stock highly attractive to potential acquirers A company in a consolidating industry is partially owned by a brokerage or buyout firm that could devise a strategy to boost the value of its stake The founder of a company who owns more than percent of the stock passes away removing potential opposition to an acquisition A company that owns a stake in another company is itself acquired leading the acquirer to try to raise cash by selling the stake and putting the company in play None of these factors by itself is a reason to invest in a company But if the stock is attractive on fundamental grounds the chance that it will turn out to be a special situation provides an enormous kicker Post your comments on Michaels column at

Staggering toward profits The economic numbers are hard to sort out and some analysts are talking about stagflation The best stocks for this environment include consumer products companies like Procter Gamble By Michael Sivy The most recent economic data all contradict each other First we hear that real gross domestic product grew at a percent annual rate in the first quarter a stunner because just about everyone was expecting growth to be down from the percent rate of the fourth quarter So no need to worry about recession right But then we get employment data that shows payroll numbers tumbling and unemployment up from percent to percent In addition inflation pressures particularly labor costs are moving ominously higher Economists are starting to talk about stagflation the awful combination of inflation and low growth The last time they did that we had an oil crisis and a horrific bear market Dont take any of this too seriously Confusion and economic crosscurrents are normal at this point in the business cycle What were seeing now is the regular churning that occurs as the economy completes a slowdown and struggles to get back on a growth track For investors the key is to isolate the trends that really matter The most important one is that the economy as a whole is still growing Despite lots of scattered bad news we still havent has a single quarter of declining GDP We might get one but its hard to imagine that well get two really bad quarters back to back and thats what defines a recession At worst it looks as though well get what they used to call a growth recession back in the s a drop more or less to zero but not a meaningful decline Thats basically good news for corporate profits Companies can maintain earnings during a brief growth recession by cutting costs And a modest rise in unemployment is also positive for corporate America because it makes jobs easier to fill and restrains labor costs An uptick in unemployment is also likely to encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates The majority of Fedwatchers expect chairman Alan Greenspan to reduce rates at least a quarter percentage point at the next Fed meeting on May The continuing trend toward lower rates will encourage home refinancing which will add another or a month to some household budgets and help keep overall consumer spending healthy What stocks are most timely at this point in the cycle As Ive said before I think that the big money over the next five years will be made on the largest tech stocks Nearer term I think we could see strong performance among defensive consumer stocks the shares of companies that sell everyday products No one is going to stop buying toothpaste or detergent because of a mild economic slowdown And a whiff of inflation is actually good for consumer stocks because it makes it easier to raise product prices One obvious candidate is Procter Gamble PG with brands that include Tide Ivory Head Shoulders and Charmin The stock has dipped since I last recommended it but since April PG has risen percent And I expect that rally to continue PG has a number of big issues The company is in the midst of a restructuring and it could take a while to work through all the kinks In addition PG is bidding to acquire Clairol from BristolMyers Squibb But over the next year PG should emerge from its restructuring as a more focused collection of extremely attractive businesses What matters most now is that the stock is depressed and that sales wont be exposed to any significant economic downturn This past week PG announced a surprisingly solid percent gain in operating profits for the first quarter Much of that was from price increases Still analysts thought the results were encouraging and Salomon Smith Barney upgraded the stock to outperform Fullyear growth this year and next may be only around percent but PGs growth rate could be back above percent by sometime next year Add in a percent yield and youre talking about aboveaverage total return potential At a current price of a share PG is trading at less than times this years estimated earnings Thats pretty cheap and any successful results from the restructuring would just be gravy Post your comments on Michaels column at deptsinvestingsivyindexhtml To subscribe or unsubscribe to Sivy on Stocks go to email MARKETPLACE
