worked undercover for a day at one of the uberbooksellers distribution centers and then what to our wondering eyes should appear reiterated his buy recommendation on Amazons stock It really is the season of miracles According to the Financial Times Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Jamie Kiggen put in a few hours working in Amazons Delaware distribution center and then penned this sunny conclusion While our presence there suggests the hiring process could be tightened up a bit we were struck by the high level of energy and morale among warehouse management and workers alike Busy bees are happy bees Kiggens stint apparently didnt coincide with one of the six or so allhands meetings that the New York Times reported Amazon held recently to among other things squelch unionizing efforts Youd think journos might give extra scrutiny to Kiggens dotcom gig given the recent brouhaha over the New Yorkers similarly themed piece in its Nov issue Writer Rodney Rothman was supposedly aiming for humor not analysis when he wrote about his stint working for a Silicon Alley dotcom according to coverage on the Web site Media News But in a move that has left journos debating the merits of undercover gigs he neglected to tell the New Yorker that his mother worked for the firm he infiltrated And that office massage he wrote so descriptively of Never really got it Literary license you know But outlets were glowing about Kiggens undercover gig CNNfn which broke the news speculated that Kiggen and the other CS First Boston analysts who cover Amazon may have set a new precedent this week for just how far researchers will go to obtain information on a company The Financial Times enthused about Kiggens ingenuity in an era when investors often criticise analysts for being spoonfed by the companies they cover And boy did Kiggen gather some terrific intelligence According to the Financial Times Kiggens experience in the Delaware warehouse which handles as much as percent of Amazons orders suggested that the company was highly likely to meet or exceed fourthquarter revenue estimates of billion All this from an eighthour stint We guess we at Media Grok just dont know how to use our time as wisely For his part Kiggen could use a boost for his media profile He missed being named to Fortunes allstar analysts team but did get pegged for Business Weeks piece on Net analysts fall from grace Business Week reported criticism of Kiggens lifetime value of a customer metrics used to justify his bullish Amazon calls and included the mention in a paragraph on voodoo

NASA didnt think quite everything would burn up after all titanium fuel tanks batteries electronic control panels these are dense enough to make it through and find a home on land or in the sea In fact Reuters discovered that NASA estimated back in April that each bird had a in chance of striking one of Earths billion human residents and that chance grew to in for all spacecraft combined Not a sure thing but those arent lottery numbers either Its all academic now at least for a few years The Pentagon stepped in last week with an agreement to pay the million each month it takes to keep the constellation flying at least for another two years It signed the deal with Iridium Satellite the company that took over the assets of the original company when it filed for bankruptcy protection this year Iridium was planned as a global phone system for jetsetters who need to stay in touch wherever their romps take them on the planet But the companys expensive handsets originally and costly service up to per minute doomed the service to all except those who really needed it oilrig crews transoceanic yachstmen and CNN reporters Everyone else found that GSM phones get you most of what you want for a fraction of the price But it turns out the Pentagon has plenty of folks who need satellite phones particularly in the Navy Iridium will provide a commercial alternative to our purely military systems Dave Oliver principal deputy under secretary of defense for acquisitions technology and logistics told Reuters There were other reasons too Reuters also reported that a US interagency group was nervous about public reaction to satellites coming down in months The group wrote that this might create widespread anxiety and lead to a public outcry for illconsidered government action For million per month the Defense Department bought some time to figure out what to do In their current orbits the satellites wont fall to earth for about years By then however the danger may be even

permatemps will have a little extra dough to pay off their holiday Visa bills Microsoft will pay about million to compensate to longterm temporary employees for the stockpurchase plan they never had A spate of outlets ran the APs coverage including the allegation that Microsofts employment practices once allowed employees to be classified as temporary for as long as years Temporary in the Buddhist all is transitory way we assume The average assignment was months MS spokesperson Matt Pilla told Reuters MS officials also insisted that many temps dont want to go on payroll since they like the flexibility of temping and sometimes the pay is better The Washington Post and AP got some anecdotal evidence from former MS temps who argue that most temps would rather be officially hired As for the money How many stories have you ever seen about hightech contractors retiring at because they made millions of dollars a former twoyear temp asked the AP If I had had access to what everyone else had I would be in the same financial situation as a number of friends who are already retired another former temp complained to TechWeb Not that this is all about the bucks some former permatemps said Microsoft hurt their feelings They had to wear orange badges while regular employees wore blue badges and couldnt go to office parties or shop at the discounted company store said the New York Times Nor could they use the corporate health club added the Washington Posts writers who also mentioned how much the temps hated those symbolic orange badges This dichotomy of treatment was a thorn in your side one disgruntled former temp told the San Jose Mercury News You were trying to get your job done and constantly feeling like a secondclass citizen Sounds like the way most Microsoft techies probably went through junior high To get a better sense of the eightyear legal wrangling surrounding this case peruse the New York Times the Washington Post and the Seattle Times Basically it comes down to this Legal eagles say its not nice to employ people for more than a year and not let them into the stock purchase plan but temps are on their own for health insurance Microsoft got the hint in the mids told contractors to take at least days off after sticking around for months let about employees trade their orange badges for blue ones and hooked up with temp agencies that provide good benefits So maybe MS temps get that health insurance after all but the company still doesnt give temporary workers the right to purchase its stock at a discount said the Merc Several outlets stressed the importance of this case to hightech and the business world in general but the Seattle Times found a contrarian One thing that has been noteworthy is there havent been a large number of cases that have been filed in the wake of the Microsoft case said the general counsel of the American Staffing Association Nor will the case have a material impact on our results said MS spokesman Matt Pilla

but techies coming up short include Compaq and Razorfish earnings warnings and Ask Jeeves layoffs Then there are those wireless licenses the auction of which produced a frenzy of interest and money in Europe but stateside are much more modest affairs and thats a disappointment for the FCC Reporters have grown to love funky auction stories what with online sales of body organs and Nazi doodads on eBay The highpriced bids on wireless licenses however seem to make the medias eyes glaze over The Wall Street Journal reminded that wirelesslicense auctions raised billion in the UK and billionplus in Germany The US auction which kicked off Tuesday is estimated to churn up a mere billion to billion and a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst told the Journal that billion sounds more likely Part of the problem is that no one seems to quite get whats going on The Bloomberg posting on Newscom helpfully explained that carriers are using the auction to get additional airwaves to fill gaps in coverage especially in major metropolitan areas The Journal chimed in eventually that wireless companies need the airwaves to beef up their coverage and reduce the number of pesky dropped calls Thats why of the licenses covering local markets the hottest action was for hopping markets such as New York Los Angeles and Chicago So far the total bids are up to million after two rounds the FCC told outlets The highest bids have been million each by Sprint and DCC PCS a subsidiary of Dobson Communications for licenses in New York City LA was runnerup with Salmon and Verizon both bidding million for licenses in that market The Financial Times blamed the absence of ruinously expensive spectrum auctions on this side of the Atlantic on the relative backwardness of mobile telephony in the US The

court cases that collectively reined in profane names spam and anonymous libel on the Net USA Today ran an Associated Press story on a case that time and competition have rendered moot Adult Website operators had sued Network Solutions because NSI at the time the sole registrar of domain names refused to issue names the AP characterized as wwwpickanyobscenitycom Last year competing registries began accepting registrations for such names The judge ruled that domain names are mainly about navigation not about communicative speech The AP carried what amounted to a lively debate among lawyers and Internet experts on possible reverberations from the case The Washington Post and CNET covered the first libel judgement won by an individual against an anonymous online poster The Posts story by Brian Krebs of Newsbytes disentangled the complicated tale more clearly than did CNETs AP copy A US District judge awarded to an Emory University professor after an anonymous poster accused him of taking kickbacks The poster unmasked in the investigation was a former employee of the company he accused of making the payoff The Post provided the critical detail that that company had fired the libeler Krebs quoted Ari Schwartz a policy analyst with the Center for Democracy and Technology for the bottom line Theres not much difference between saying slanderous things online or offline In terms of anonymity its probably much easier to send letters in the mail Two different court cases recently struck blows against unsolicited commercial email The Los Angeles Times ran an unsigned piece on a rather typical spammer who had hijacked a companys computer to spread millions of spams offering porn and getrichquick schemes What wasnt typical about this case is that the spammer was tracked

but techies coming up short include Compaq and Razorfish earnings warnings and Ask Jeeves layoffs Then there are those wireless licenses the auction of which produced a frenzy of interest and money in Europe but stateside are much more modest affairs and thats a disappointment for the FCC Reporters have grown to love funky auction stories what with online sales of body organs and Nazi doodads on eBay The highpriced bids on wireless licenses however seem to make the medias eyes glaze over The Wall Street Journal reminded that wirelesslicense auctions raised billion in the UK and billionplus in Germany The US auction which kicked off Tuesday is estimated to churn up a mere billion to billion and a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst told the Journal that billion sounds more likely Part of the problem is that no one seems to quite get whats going on The Bloomberg posting on Newscom helpfully explained that carriers are using the auction to get additional airwaves to fill gaps in coverage especially in major metropolitan areas The Journal chimed in eventually that wireless companies need the airwaves to beef up their coverage and reduce the number of pesky dropped calls Thats why of the licenses covering local markets the hottest action was for hopping markets such as New York Los Angeles and Chicago So far the total bids are up to million after two rounds the FCC told outlets The highest bids have been million each by Sprint and DCC PCS a subsidiary of Dobson Communications for licenses in New York City LA was runnerup with Salmon and Verizon both bidding million for licenses in that market The Financial Times blamed the absence of ruinously expensive spectrum auctions on this side of the Atlantic on the relative backwardness of mobile telephony in the US The

youre looking for thestandardsbctcgisid TOP GROKS Amazon Gets a Stocking Stuffer Lucky Amazon doesnt have to wait for the Supreme Court to solve its market woes Thats because a Wall Street analyst worked undercover for a day at one of the uberbooksellers distribution centers and then what to our wondering eyes should appear reiterated his buy recommendation on Amazons stock It really is the season of miracles According to the Financial Times Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Jamie Kiggen put in a few hours working in Amazons Delaware distribution center and then penned this sunny conclusion While our presence there suggests the hiring process could be tightened up a bit we were struck by the high level of energy and morale among warehouse management and workers alike Busy bees are happy bees Kiggens stint apparently didnt coincide with one of the six or so allhands meetings that the New York Times reported Amazon held recently to among other things squelch unionizing efforts Youd think journos might give extra scrutiny to Kiggens dotcom gig given the recent brouhaha over the New Yorkers similarly themed piece in its Nov issue Writer Rodney Rothman was supposedly aiming for humor not analysis when he wrote about his stint working for a Silicon Alley dotcom according to coverage on the Web site Media News But in a move that has left journos debating the merits of undercover gigs he neglected to tell the New Yorker that his mother worked for the firm he infiltrated And that office massage he wrote so descriptively of Never really got it Literary license you know But outlets were glowing about Kiggens undercover gig CNNfn which broke the news speculated that Kiggen and the other CS First Boston analysts who cover Amazon may have set a new precedent this week for just how far researchers will go to obtain information on a company The Financial Times enthused about Kiggens ingenuity in an era when investors often criticise analysts for being spoonfed by the companies they cover And boy did Kiggen gather some terrific intelligence According to the Financial Times Kiggens experience in the Delaware warehouse which handles as much as percent of Amazons orders suggested that the company was highly likely to meet or exceed fourthquarter revenue estimates of billion All this from an eighthour stint We guess we at Media Grok just dont know how to use our time as wisely For his part Kiggen could use a boost for his media profile He missed being named to Fortunes allstar analysts team but did get pegged for Business Weeks piece on Net analysts fall from grace Business Week reported criticism of Kiggens lifetime value of a customer metrics used to justify his bullish Amazon calls and included the mention in a paragraph on voodoo

NASA didnt think quite everything would burn up after all titanium fuel tanks batteries electronic control panels these are dense enough to make it through and find a home on land or in the sea In fact Reuters discovered that NASA estimated back in April that each bird had a in chance of striking one of Earths billion human residents and that chance grew to in for all spacecraft combined Not a sure thing but those arent lottery numbers either Its all academic now at least for a few years The Pentagon stepped in last week with an agreement to pay the million each month it takes to keep the constellation flying at least for another two years It signed the deal with Iridium Satellite the company that took over the assets of the original company when it filed for bankruptcy protection this year Iridium was planned as a global phone system for jetsetters who need to stay in touch wherever their romps take them on the planet But the companys expensive handsets originally and costly service up to per minute doomed the service to all except those who really needed it oilrig crews transoceanic yachstmen and CNN reporters Everyone else found that GSM phones get you most of what you want for a fraction of the price But it turns out the Pentagon has plenty of folks who need satellite phones particularly in the Navy Iridium will provide a commercial alternative to our purely military systems Dave Oliver principal deputy under secretary of defense for acquisitions technology and logistics told Reuters There were other reasons too Reuters also reported that a US interagency group was nervous about public reaction to satellites coming down in months The group wrote that this might create widespread anxiety and lead to a public outcry for illconsidered government action For million per month the Defense Department bought some time to figure out what to do In their current orbits the satellites wont fall to earth for about years By then however the danger may be even

court cases that collectively reined in profane names spam and anonymous libel on the Net USA Today ran an Associated Press story on a case that time and competition have rendered moot Adult Website operators had sued Network Solutions because NSI at the time the sole registrar of domain names refused to issue names the AP characterized as wwwpickanyobscenitycom Last year competing registries began accepting registrations for such names The judge ruled that domain names are mainly about navigation not about communicative speech The AP carried what amounted to a lively debate among lawyers and Internet experts on possible reverberations from the case The Washington Post and CNET covered the first libel judgement won by an individual against an anonymous online poster The Posts story by Brian Krebs of Newsbytes disentangled the complicated tale more clearly than did CNETs AP copy A US District judge awarded to an Emory University professor after an anonymous poster accused him of taking kickbacks The poster unmasked in the investigation was a former employee of the company he accused of making the payoff The Post provided the critical detail that that company had fired the libeler Krebs quoted Ari Schwartz a policy analyst with the Center for Democracy and Technology for the bottom line Theres not much difference between saying slanderous things online or offline In terms of anonymity its probably much easier to send letters in the mail Two different court cases recently struck blows against unsolicited commercial email The Los Angeles Times ran an unsigned piece on a rather typical spammer who had hijacked a companys computer to spread millions of spams offering porn and getrichquick schemes What wasnt typical about this case is that the spammer was tracked down and arrested He pleaded guilty to seconddegree forgery and faces up to seven years in prison Wired News and InternetNews assigned reporters to the other spam case this one involving Web host

permatemps will have a little extra dough to pay off their holiday Visa bills Microsoft will pay about million to compensate to longterm temporary employees for the stockpurchase plan they never had A spate of outlets ran the APs coverage including the allegation that Microsofts employment practices once allowed employees to be classified as temporary for as long as years Temporary in the Buddhist all is transitory way we assume The average assignment was months MS spokesperson Matt Pilla told Reuters MS officials also insisted that many temps dont want to go on payroll since they like the flexibility of temping and sometimes the pay is better The Washington Post and AP got some anecdotal evidence from former MS temps who argue that most temps would rather be officially hired As for the money How many stories have you ever seen about hightech contractors retiring at because they made millions of dollars a former twoyear temp asked the AP If I had had access to what everyone else had I would be in the same financial situation as a number of friends who are already retired another former temp complained to TechWeb Not that this is all about the bucks some former permatemps said Microsoft hurt their feelings They had to wear orange badges while regular employees wore blue badges and couldnt go to office parties or shop at the discounted company store said the New York Times Nor could they use the corporate health club added the Washington Posts writers who also mentioned how much the temps hated those symbolic orange badges This dichotomy of treatment was a thorn in your side one disgruntled former temp told the San Jose Mercury News You were trying to get your job done and constantly feeling like a secondclass citizen Sounds like the way most Microsoft techies probably went through junior high To get a better sense of the eightyear legal wrangling surrounding this case peruse the New York Times the Washington Post and the Seattle Times Basically it comes down to this Legal eagles say its not nice to employ people for more than a year and not let them into the stock purchase plan but temps are on their own for health insurance Microsoft got the hint in the mids told contractors to take at least days off after sticking around for months let about employees trade their orange badges for blue ones and hooked up with temp agencies that provide good benefits So maybe MS temps get that health insurance after all but the company still doesnt give temporary workers the right to purchase its stock at a discount said the Merc Several outlets stressed the importance of this case to hightech and the business world in general but the Seattle Times found a contrarian One thing that has been noteworthy is there havent been a large number of cases that

Europe but stateside are much more modest affairs and thats a disappointment for the FCC Reporters have grown to love funky auction stories what with online sales of body organs and Nazi doodads on eBay The highpriced bids on wireless licenses however seem to make the medias eyes glaze over The Wall Street Journal reminded that wirelesslicense auctions raised billion in the UK and billionplus in Germany The US auction which kicked off Tuesday is estimated to churn up a mere billion to billion and a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst told the Journal that billion sounds more likely Part of the problem is that no one seems to quite get whats going on The Bloomberg posting on Newscom helpfully explained that carriers are using the auction to get additional airwaves to fill gaps in coverage especially in major metropolitan areas The Journal chimed in eventually that wireless companies need the airwaves to beef up their coverage and reduce the number of pesky dropped calls Thats why of the licenses covering local markets the hottest action was for hopping markets such as New York Los Angeles and Chicago So far the total bids are up to million after two rounds the FCC told outlets The highest bids have been million each by Sprint and DCC PCS a subsidiary of Dobson Communications for licenses in New York City LA was runnerup with Salmon and Verizon both bidding million for licenses in that market The Financial Times blamed the absence of ruinously expensive spectrum auctions on this side of the Atlantic on the relative backwardness of mobile telephony in the US The pricey auctions in Europe have been for fancy G wireless licenses while the US is still peddling local markets Expect a proper G auction to follow here in two years the peach paper wrote A jump in

chance of the rword in Like your doctor the UCLA economists said it would only pinch a little and then it would all be over CBS MarketWatch Newsbytes and MSNBC provided good summaries of the report which insisted everything would be peachy again in Newsbytes Michael Bartlett led with some encouragement for deflated techie egos The stimulus of the Internetled New Economy was enough to keep the current economic expansion in the United States driving forward for four years longer than it might have he said paraphrasing the report Funny how everyones putting new economy in quotes these days it used to seem so real The San Jose Mercury News called the predicted downturn recession lite and noted that local California readers will escape the worst of it A separate UCLA report on California put the odds of a statewide recession at percent report author Tom Lieser prefers the term deceleration Many experts expect percent growth next year so the Mercs Jennifer Bjorhus called other economist to compare notes One Bay Area econ professor agreed that we may be in trouble but the UCLA report has other economists scratching their heads said Bjorhus I dont know of anybody else thats out there that far said economist Richard Carlson We do CBS MarketWatch columnist Paul Farrell wondered if the slump has already arrived citing Ken Kursons article Nine Signs Were Already in a Recession in Esquires

court cases that collectively reined in profane names spam and anonymous libel on the Net USA Today ran an Associated Press story on a case that time and competition have rendered moot Adult Website operators had sued Network Solutions because NSI at the time the sole registrar of domain names refused to issue names the AP characterized as wwwpickanyobscenitycom Last year competing registries began accepting registrations for such names The judge ruled that domain names are mainly about navigation not about communicative speech The AP carried what amounted to a lively debate among lawyers and Internet experts on possible reverberations from the case The Washington Post and CNET covered the first libel judgement won by an individual against an anonymous online poster The Posts story by Brian Krebs of Newsbytes disentangled the complicated tale more clearly than did CNETs AP copy A US District judge awarded to an Emory University professor after an anonymous poster accused him of taking kickbacks The poster unmasked in the investigation was a former employee of the company he accused of making the payoff The Post provided the critical detail that that company had fired the libeler Krebs quoted Ari Schwartz a policy analyst with the Center for Democracy and Technology for the bottom line Theres not much difference between saying slanderous things online or offline In terms of anonymity its probably much easier to send letters in the mail Two different court cases recently struck blows against unsolicited commercial email The Los Angeles Times ran an unsigned piece on a rather typical spammer who had hijacked a companys computer to spread millions of spams offering porn and getrichquick schemes What wasnt typical about this case is that the spammer was tracked down and arrested He pleaded guilty to seconddegree forgery and faces up to seven years in prison Wired News and InternetNews assigned reporters to the other spam case this one involving Web host Verios use of whois customer information from Registercom in violation of the registrars acceptableuse policy The case has not yet gone to trial but a federal judge ordered Verio to stop using the whois data to barrage Registercoms customers by email phone and mail Writing for InternetNews Clint Boulton detailed the judges order and talked to outside experts on the possible effects of the

youre looking for thestandardsbctcgisid TOP GROKS Amazon Gets a Stocking Stuffer Lucky Amazon doesnt have to wait for the Supreme Court to solve its market woes Thats because a Wall Street analyst worked undercover for a day at one of the uberbooksellers distribution centers and then what to our wondering eyes should appear reiterated his buy recommendation on Amazons stock It really is the season of miracles According to the Financial Times Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Jamie Kiggen put in a few hours working in Amazons Delaware distribution center and then penned this sunny conclusion While our presence there suggests the hiring process could be tightened up a bit we were struck by the high level of energy and morale among warehouse management and workers alike Busy bees are happy bees Kiggens stint apparently didnt coincide with one of the six or so allhands meetings that the New York Times reported Amazon held recently to among other things squelch unionizing efforts Youd think journos might give extra scrutiny to Kiggens dotcom gig given the recent brouhaha over the New Yorkers similarly themed piece in its Nov issue Writer Rodney Rothman was supposedly aiming for humor not analysis when he wrote about his stint working for a Silicon Alley dotcom according to coverage on the Web site Media News But in a move that has left journos debating the merits of undercover gigs he neglected to tell the New Yorker that his mother worked for the firm he infiltrated And that office massage he wrote so descriptively of Never really got it Literary license you know But outlets were glowing about Kiggens undercover gig CNNfn which broke the news speculated that Kiggen and the other CS First Boston analysts who cover Amazon may have set a new precedent this week for just how far researchers will go to obtain information on a company The Financial Times enthused about Kiggens ingenuity in an era when investors often criticise analysts for being spoonfed by the companies they cover And boy did Kiggen gather some terrific intelligence According to the Financial Times Kiggens experience in the Delaware warehouse which handles as much as percent of Amazons orders suggested that the company was highly likely to meet or exceed fourthquarter revenue estimates of billion All this from an eighthour stint We guess we at Media Grok just dont know how to use our time as wisely For his part Kiggen could use a boost for his media profile He missed being named to Fortunes allstar analysts team but did get pegged for Business Weeks piece on Net analysts fall from grace Business Week reported criticism of Kiggens lifetime value of a customer metrics used to justify his bullish Amazon calls and included the mention in a paragraph on voodoo

NASA didnt think quite everything would burn up after all titanium fuel tanks batteries electronic control panels these are dense enough to make it through and find a home on land or in the sea In fact Reuters discovered that NASA estimated back in April that each bird had a in chance of striking one of Earths billion human residents and that chance grew to in for all spacecraft combined Not a sure thing but those arent lottery numbers either Its all academic now at least for a few years The Pentagon stepped in last week with an agreement to pay the million each month it takes to keep the constellation flying at least for another two years It signed the deal with Iridium Satellite the company that took over the assets of the original company when it filed for bankruptcy protection this year Iridium was planned as a global phone system for jetsetters who need to stay in touch wherever their romps take them on the planet But the companys expensive handsets originally and costly service up to per minute doomed the service to all except those who really needed it oilrig crews transoceanic yachstmen and CNN reporters Everyone else found that GSM phones get you most of what you want for a fraction of the price But it turns out the Pentagon has plenty of folks who need satellite phones particularly in the Navy Iridium will provide a commercial alternative to our purely military systems Dave Oliver principal deputy under secretary of defense for acquisitions technology and logistics told Reuters There were other reasons too Reuters also reported that a US interagency group was nervous about public reaction to satellites coming down in months The group wrote that this might create widespread anxiety and lead to a public outcry for illconsidered government action For million per month the Defense Department bought some time to figure out what to do In their current orbits the satellites wont fall to earth for about years By then however the danger may be even worse As Nicholas Johnson NASA program manager for orbital debris told Reuters there will no doubt be more people on earth and a thus higher chance that one of them could get hit David Sims NASA
