I could find so that it reduces this amount But the final decision on division of the home is up to the judge The child support amount will be determined too It really doesnt matter the judge wants the kids to be in the house and the most important thing is that I will make all parenting decisions with regard to the children Since then its been crazy at work then I was on the program committee

September AM To Mims Patrice L Subject RE Hey You sound good Im glad you made it home safely Here are the numbers w h dads yes the wedding was beautiful I didnt think it was going to happen Steve literally through a fit when it looked like his family was not going to make it He wanted to postpone Nell was concerned about losing money girlI was on Steves side and could not belief they were worried about the cost of flowers and the cakehowever Steve has two blessings in his best men He spoke with them one from SpokaneWA and the other from Montana They drove in to Chicago to be with him hours straight through He was so happy on Saturday because they got there in enough time to enjoy the city on Friday Everything else went off without a hitch but Karen didnt stop shaking until they cut the cake I think she needed a cigarette Of course Jordan is doing wellhes a Thurston with all there good and bad traitsintellect runs large conduct however is questionable I hope Todd quickly sees that making a life together is the big payoff Im attaching a special message that Ill send to Todd separately One suggestion if you dont mind come to an agreement on how to disciple the children Kids will play you even at Jordans age This will drive a fatal stake in your relationship with Todd Love Robyn AM So good to hear from you Yes I did drive back to Houston I was there on Monday went to the conference in Lincolnshire went to dinner Monday night got up Tuesday drove to the conference and all hell broke loose at that point Total total chaos I was so frightened The group said were driving back to Houston once they announced that all airports were closed Hours to get back but I Thank God we made it back and none of us were in harms way One of my close coworkers father just happened to be in New York at the World Trade Center for a meeting that Tuesday and has been presumed to be dead It is just a crying shame Also the impending wardid you ever think you would see this in your lifetime Incidents of this kind really show you thattomorrows never promised I will be back in the Chicago area real soon more than likely the first or second week in October Im really skeptical about flying but what do you do How was the wedding I know it was beautiful Im taking care of myself and living my life I do what I can if Todd wants to participate Im glad to have him but if not me and the boys rollwe cant wait around Jordan seems to be getting his self together in school hes received very good conduct grades recently and the teacher says he at the top of his class as long as he keeps the conduct grades up to snuff Talk to you later Love Patrice PS Please email me your work and home number as well as Uncle CharliesI need to program these into my cell phone so that I have them at

same The boys are still being the boys Theyre alot of fun Todd is still being Todd Although I must say I think hes getting a little concerned regarding my somewhat cavalier attitude Nothing seems to really bother me that much any more because Ive made some resolutions in my own mind that work for me I guess I better start fussing at him more to get him back on track not I thought for a moment that I might be visiting Chicago again real soon and even contemplated spending the weekend to do some shopping on Michigan Avenue but I dont know now Our company in case you havent heard is really going through Out senior management allegedly was involved in some suspect deals and joint ventures that have cost this company dearly We are suddenly finding ourselves going from hero to zero in a heartbeat Last year around this time Enrons stock was trading at plus and right now our stock is trading at Just since news of this scandal came out a week and a half ago we took a billion third quarter writedown weve come down from to roughly speaking It hurts and it appears that its all because of or senior level executives If this company survives this it will truly be a miracle Pray for me and pray for Enron How are the girls doing I know theyre doing fine Hows Cecelia Tell her we said hello Hows Uncle Charlie Any word when Grandpa Thurston is moving down or is that still on hold I know Todd talks to Sherry alot so I know shes doing fine Hows the yoga instructor I attended the Harlem Dance Theater Production lasts Friday night with a girlfriend Interesting although I found out I really dont have an appreciation for that ballet thang I was hoping for more sho nuff modern dance It was interesting but now worth the I spent My girlfriend and I went to a club afterwardswhat an experience Im glad Im not into that scene anymorerough life We stayed a couple of hours and came on home The same girlfriend kept the boys overnight on Saturday night and I actually had a free day to myself from about that afternoon until I got out of church the next day Boy what a good friend Todd was in Austin this weekend so I was totally free I ended up shopping for an hour or so and came home

the other from Montana They drove in to Chicago to be with him hours straight through He was so happy on Saturday because they got there in enough time to enjoy the city on Friday Everything else went off without a hitch but Karen didnt stop shaking until they cut the cake I think she needed a cigarette Of course Jordan is doing wellhes a Thurston with all there good and bad traitsintellect runs large conduct however is questionable I hope Todd quickly sees that making a life together is the big payoff Im attaching a special message that Ill send to Todd separately One suggestion if you dont

harms way One of my close coworkers father just happened to be in New York at the World Trade Center for a meeting that Tuesday and has been presumed to be dead It is just a crying shame Also the impending wardid you ever think you would see this in your lifetime Incidents of this kind really show you thattomorrows never promised I will be back in the Chicago area real soon more than likely the first or second week in October Im really skeptical about flying but what do you do How was the wedding I know it was beautiful Im taking care of myself and living my life I do what I can if Todd wants to participate Im glad to have him but if not me and the boys rollwe cant wait around Jordan seems to be getting his self together in school hes received very good conduct grades recently and

boy who is close to Siera in age My nd cousin Kenny who lives here in Houston also lost his wife on Sunday around pm She was only years old and they have a two year old daughter This situation is really sad because it stemed from a disagreement that was very petty The Saturday before last Kenny and his wife were on their way to Blockbuster They were arguing over Kenny buying a DVD player He stated that she was selfish when it came down to him spending etc He told me that the next thing he knew she jumped out of the moving car He was going about mph She had bad head injuries and underwent two surgeries She lived a week and one day Her family is now blaming my cousin and they called the police on him at the hospital The police had to escort my cousin and his family to their cars because her family was trying to fight him Kennys wife was responding when they brought her in to the hospital and the police asked her if Kenny pushed her out of the car and she said no Its a good thing they have this on record I will most definitely keep your father in my prayers I cant believe hes lost that much weight He is blessed and were praying for God to heal him Were praying for eternal remission right now in the name of Jesus I know he was so happy to see you and his grandchildren You all alone give him the strength to keep fighting Church service was good on Sunday Greg sho nuff preached

you later Original Message From mailtoENRON Sent Tuesday April PM To PatriceLMims Subject Re Whats Happening Hey girl Welcome back I had a great Easter with the exception of the bad news I received late Sunday night My cousin Renee passed on Sunday around noon She lived here in Houston Her husband gave her and her baby AIDS Her husband died some years ago Her mom now has her little boy who is close to Siera in age My nd cousin Kenny who lives here in Houston also lost his wife on Sunday around pm She was only years old and they have a two year old daughter This situation is really sad because it stemed from a disagreement that was very petty The Saturday before last Kenny and his wife were on their way to Blockbuster They were arguing over Kenny buying a DVD player He stated that she was selfish when it came down to him spending etc He told me that the next thing he knew she jumped out of the moving car He was going about mph She had bad head injuries and underwent two surgeries She lived a week and one day Her family is now blaming my cousin and they called the police on him at the hospital The police had to escort my cousin and his family to their cars because her family was trying to fight him Kennys wife was responding when they brought her in to the hospital and the police asked her if Kenny pushed her out of the car and she said no Its a good thing they have this on record I will most definitely keep your father in my prayers I cant believe hes lost that much weight He is blessed and were praying for God to heal him Were praying for eternal remission right now in the name of Jesus I know he was so happy to see you and his grandchildren You all alone give him the strength to keep fighting Church service was good on Sunday Greg sho nuff preached However the choir didnt sound too good Doren was out sick so Gerald had to play and direct It was aweful We were all rocking different ways No we did not sing any of my songs I only made the service Are you going to rehearsal tonight Well I did buy that cute dress from Lane Bryant with the shirt to match I also bought the green print skirt with the green solid shirt and the pink solid shirt Honey I was a fox in that dress at the wedding on Saturday I missed the wedding but made the reception When I walked in the room all eyes were on me For once I didnt feel self conscious about my arms My husband was all over me and giving me compliments Several of his cousins told me how good I looked also Steve wasnt too pleased about that Have you worn those capri pants and spaghetti top that you bought Write Back on PM To cc Subject Whats Happening Hello How was your weekend My weekend was great visiting with my family Everyone is doing fine Daddy is doing okay The radiation treatments put the prostate cancer in remission although the Dr said the cancer would just move to another part of his body He thinks it may have moved to his leg He had a MRI done last week and today he will get the results and hes so afraid hes going to need surgery again Hes has to use a walker to get around and hes lost so much weight he probably went from to l Its really sad he is so small and frail Hes starting to get his appetite back somewhat He sure had a good time eating this weekend My sister and I threw down on Easter dinner Please keep him in your prayers Its so sad to see a vibrant man reduced to needing help in everything he does but hes definitely a BLESSED MAN How was church services on Sunday Did you make it to all the services I dont even know why Im asking I know you didnt go to all of them thats a bit much Did Greg show out on Easter Anything new going on with the choir did you sing any of your songs This month is going to be extremely busy with the revivial and the other church outing You know I never did get a chance to ask you what all you ended up purchasing when we went to Lane Bryant the other day Anyway talk with you later

look at the calendar again but I think we will be leaving on Saturday the th of June Well probably stop in Coffeyville for a day or so and come on through to Omaha Im sad to hear that Daddys tube does not seem to be doing the job I had to hear that because I too feel confident that if we can get some nourishment into his body that he will get alot better Im so glad you stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands I also feel like Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well I spoke with Mom yesterday daddy was sleep so she really got a chance to tell me how everything really is She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad shape I asked Daddy about the retirement and he said the same thing he is not ready yet but the reality of it is is that we still need to move now and not wait I just hope he understands Im glad Daddy is not in alot of pain I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up Its so hard to face all of this uncertainty isnt it The good part if there is any is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering Hes certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever but if there is pain involved I d rather see him out of pain Just keep praying for Daddy as well as Mom If there is anything I can do from hear just let me know Talk with you later Original Message From Mims Charnella ENRON
