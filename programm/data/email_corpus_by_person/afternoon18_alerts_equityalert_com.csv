these o ptions The terms and conditions of the replacement options including the vesting schedules will be substantially the same as the terms and conditio ns of the cancelled options Our most important assets are our employees Equity in the form of options has been a major employee motivator and a s such a significant contributor to our success in the past Dave Rickey Chairman and Chief
