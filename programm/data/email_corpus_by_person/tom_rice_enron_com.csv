am not seeing something here I dont feel as though investing dollars to install EFM or Bullhorn would be a good idea Tom Original Message From Anderson Gary E Sent Thursday October AM To Zadow Raetta Lachapelle Donna Stewart Angeline FarmingtonPipeline Team Rice Tom Cc Blair Lynn Dietz Rick Floyd Jodie Subject RE Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the th work day close so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings Even if they were it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a day chart Even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing The answer is to install EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined On these types of installations how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet todays business needs so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists and identify the costs to resolve the problem Thanks Gary Original Message From Zadow Raetta Sent Tuesday October AM To Anderson Gary E Lachapelle Donna Stewart Angeline FarmingtonPipeline Team Rice Tom Cc Blair Lynn Dietz Rick Floyd Jodie Zadow Raetta Subject FW Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas Gary was wondering if you could help us out Scott has told me that they have day charts for the stations listed below and he was wondering why we couldnt read those so as to get daily volumes rather than taking the total for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get the daily volume The reason for this is because especially in the winter time this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices which are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe If these charts cannot be read daily what can we do to make it so that they can Could you please check to find out what we need to do in order to have accurate daily volumes for these stations Thanks Raetta Original Message From FarmingtonPipeline Team Sent Monday October AM To
