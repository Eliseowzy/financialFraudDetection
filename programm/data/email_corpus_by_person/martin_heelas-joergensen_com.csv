<10776874.1075861953486.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,martin@heelas-joergensen.com,2001-10-26 09:34:53,RE Hello from HoustonMark Home is Yew Tree Cottage Hammer Lane Warborough OX DJ Phone Cell What are yours Martin I have made note to your new email address When I make it over to London again you will be one of the first that I contact Could you send me your home number and address Great luck running the search firm Mark Original Message From Martin Joergensen mailto Sent Friday October AM To McConnell Mark Subject FWDHello from Houston Mark Godav to you too And great to hear from you again Yes certainly the world has changed since we last met As it turned out I was in the Enron building in London when it all happened on Sep And to all of us in London that moment has been as defining as it has been to you in the States With one exception We have had terrorism here for a very long time So much so that I have learned to tell the difference between the sounds of an IRA semtex bomb and a Palestinian fertiliser one And life goes on I keep reminding everybody how many people die in the traffic every day and that I shall have to go someday anyway So even though London probably is high on the hit list I have not changed my lifestyle significantly Now it looks like EBS definitively is closing down in Europe Personally if find it a shame since I rather valued the people in the group but probably it was inevitable But I am pleased that you have moved into the Oil and Gas part of Enron Whatever the current woes of Enron Corp that sector is doing fine as a whole My own stray into telecomms components did not last long I was out after months on the back of completely collapsing sales in the US Now I have ventured into Executive Search where I am working as COO for a small group with staff in countries I am not hunting myself but rather involved in corporate issues such as reporting contracts and business development We are hoping to place some Eastern European engineers into a Houston company before long but I am not expecting to have to go there for some time to come You may notice that I am sending this email from a new address I am trying to face out the old one since it has caused me endless problems So in future please use the new one heelas being my wifes maiden name I am very pleased to hear that you are well but would rather hope that you could find an excuse to come to London even if your pipelines do not reach that far All the best Martin Forwarded Message To From Martin B Joergensen Subject FWDHello from Houston Date Fri Oct Original Message From McConnell Mark Subject Hello from Houston Date Mon Oct Mr Joergensen A big Howdy from your Texas friend I was so glad to get your voice message the other day week It is always nice to pick up a voicemail and have it turn out to be a colleague from the not so distant past I hope you and your family are doing well As EBS changed direction I did as well I decided to get back to my roots in the gas and gas asset business I looked inside of Enron and also with some outside companies and decided to work with Transwestern pipeline an Enron company Ive been here for about a month and all is well The people here are very nice and very genuine just like my old friends from London It is weird to actually have a product to sell if you know what I mean I think Ill like it but Im already missing my travels in your neck of the woods Also Im home so much now my wife doesnt know what to do with me Im still saddened by the demised of our BlockbusterVOD deal It was a great concept and it worked Oh well Well see it someday Im just not sure who is going to win the race on getting it to the public in bulk Christian sent an email to me and he seems to be doing fine loving Rio but still looking for a job Speaking of that I hope your job is going well and as secure as it can be in todays climate It is a strange time here in America The terrorist attacks the retaliation in Afghanistan and the constant update on new discoveries of the spread of Anthrax are constantly being talked about and on every news channel It is amazing how a handful of peoplesadness and effect the world in so many ways There is no doubt that the spirit of the people will prevail Take care Martin It was great to hear your voice Mark Mark McConnell Transwestern Pipeline Company office cell fax This email is the
