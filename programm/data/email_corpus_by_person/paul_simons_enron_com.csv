<33089329.1075859901862.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,paul.simons@enron.com,2000-01-17 06:01:00,Credit Trading OnLine Results of Legal Due Diligence and Risk Memo Cc GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF JANUARY FOR THIS PRODUCT THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGAL DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO As you know we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries where it was intended the credit product would initially be traded via EnronOnLine namely the UK the US Canada Finland Germany Norway Sweden and Switzerland Under the terms of the credit product on the occurrence of a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party the Reference Entity the Seller of the product which could be either Enron or its online counterparty will pay a fixed preagreed cash sum in an agreed currency to the Buyer It should be borne in mind that this product differs in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in the international markets This means that a change in the nature or terms of our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely change the analysis below Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more significant legal issues I am also attaching a two page Executive Summary of Legal Advice prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significant legal issuesrisks in each country and which should be read in conjunction with this note mail As you will see the Executive Summary does not focus on issues we raised which are all clear from a legal perspective so as to keep the summary to a sensible length but there was plenty of good news too Where a legal issue has been identified I have either set out below what action is to be taken or not addressed it further on the basis that on the advice of foreign counsel the risk is not very substantial or unlikely to materialise Therefore where no comment is made below in relation to a risk highlighted in the attached summary please assume that the legal risk is one which in our view it is reasonable to take A Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January Finland Norway Sweden Switzerland UK US B Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to be delayed Canada Germany reasons set out below C General Issues applicable in all countries The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks of a general nature i Capacity We will not be able to assume generally that our counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade the product and so will need to check each counterpartys constitutional documents before allowing them to trade the product online This applies to almost all entities eg corporates municipalities insurance companies in all countries Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general law in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all or under their constitutional documents in which case they will need to amend their constitutional documents if they wish to trade The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading relationship and so can be added to our procedures It is not a particularly onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally ii Confidentiality We will need to put in place procedures to ensure that we are not misusing confidential information about our business counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection Misuse can occur both in pricing the product and trading it The procedures will not include formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders or the credit department a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US counsel following very detailed discussions The procedures will include a the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe similar to the procedure currently used in Houston and b practical steps to ensure that confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which we are not entitled to use eg because it is the subject of a confidentiality agreement is not imparted to the credit traders In addition where Enron has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity or otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity we will need its written consent before offering protection on that entity Without such consent there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by that entity for breach of confidence D Country Specific Issues i Canada There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute insurance business constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the product unenforceable against our counterparties We should try to resolve this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in Canada Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter ii Germany Again the issue is insurance The risk is higher than in Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially iii Norway There is a material risk that the credit product could be regarded as gaming in Norway in which case trades would be void and unenforceable The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a substantial professional effort to satisfy ourselves that a trade is being entered into for valid commercial purposes normally hedging by our counterparty Clearly it will not be possible to take such steps on a trade by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline At a minimum we should therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic behind its trading this product type iv Switzerland If the credit product is the main purpose of our trading relationship with a counterparty we should check with the Swiss supervisory authority whether the product constitutes insurance the position being unclear If a trade is insurance it can be terminated by the counterparty which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer and an offence will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer However I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing business relationships in which case we can parallel path this issue v US New York Law a CFTC regulation by structuring the product either as a swap or an option and meeting certain other conditions we can rely on exemptions under the US Commodities Exchange Act b US securities laws there is a small chance that the credit product constitutes a security under US securities laws please see attached Executive Summary However SEC regulations allow the public offering of securities to accredited investors which will allow us to deal with investors having at least US million in assets Since most of our counterparties will be fairly large sophisticated players this test should not impede the business c Insider trading US counsel have advised that the risk of insider trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as security see b above is relatively remote Please feel free to call me on x if you would like to discuss this project further

<5826611.1075859909002.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,paul.simons@enron.com,2000-02-18 05:01:00,Re Credit GTC Cc Thank you for your comments on the US GTC Taking each of your main points in turn Section ei This Section does not preclude us from doing business with banks or other financial institutions As you anticipate breach of warranty constitutes an Event of Default entitling termination Section Your main concern appears to focus on the issue of sleeving As you will see we have included in Section of all GTCs a provision prohibiting transactions to be entered into by the reference entity itself or by any of its affiliates Any purported transaction of that sort is automatically void We considered carefully both internally and with outside counsel going further than this by including a provision stopping parties acting in concert with reference entity groups We concluded that such a provision would be inappropriate for two main reasons First as a practical matter it is almost impossible to police such a provision and detect cases of such collusion Secondly if we were to find out about such collusion we would be entitled to withhold payment regardless of any contractual provision on the basis that such collusion constitutes fraud It is also worth pointing out in this context that sleeving is not an issue germaine only to credit derivatives trading online It is possible in the existing OTC credit derivatives markets for this kind of activity to be perpetrated You will not find any provisions in existing market documentation addressing this point indeed the new ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions are consistent with this I only hope that reference entities do not follow the devious thought processes set out in your options ac and we will clearly have to keep an eye on you if you ever decide to pursue a different career It is not nasty defining Enron as the Determination Agent This accords with the standard ISDA Master Agreement and in fact is less dramatic than the ISDA insofar as all Enron will be required to do as Determination Agent is to verify the validity of notices submitted under transactions in the context of ISDA all sorts of complex calculations and subjective evaluations fall to be made by the Calculation Agent Thanks very much for thinking through the issues on the GTC and reviewing it Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further Best regards Paul Simons David Forster To Bryan CT Mark CT Edmund CT Paul CT cc Mark CT Subject Credit GTC All I have looked over the US credit GTC and the long descriptions I see we have decided to go with quarterly billing rather than monthly Will the paymentcollections cycle cause any heartburn for the back office I didnt spot any problems with the long descriptions A few relatively minor comments on the GTCs which you may or may not want to consider Clause e i Does this clause preclude us from doing business with banks or other financial institutions Could we append with regard to the Transaction What happens if a Rep or Warranty is broken Does that constitute sufficient breach to terminate the contract Im thinking specifically about sleeving which is perhaps covered by Clause eii I still think that sleeving is one of the most significant commercial risks faced by online trading of derivatives If I were working for a third party Id immediately look for ways to set up a sleeving service to sell credit protection to the Reference Entities where the Reference Entity or its affiliate views its own risk differently from Enron If I were the Reference Entity in question Id consider a Buying a load of protection via sleeving and then declaring bankruptcy then do a Phoenix in the UK at least b Buy a load of protection via sleeving then take the Credit Derivatives to another third party financial institution and using the credit derivatives as collateral to increase my line of credit Im no expert but I suspect there might be an interesting leverage effect here which might actually cause a significant increase in Enrons risk exposure c Like b only the financial institution could buy the credit derivative with or without the need for sleeving we probably need a restriction on this I know financial institutions are not our preferred counterparts up front but if I were a financial insitution Id quickly find a way around this limitation Affiliates or Sleevers Do you think it would beneficial to strengthen our protection against sleeving by adding something to Clause like It is not entering into a Transaction for the purpose of concluding a similar transaction with the party or any Affiliate of such party which is the Reference Entity in the Transaction Should Defn of Contract Currency be Contractual Currency Contractual is also used in the Long Descriptions Defn of Credit Product after Entity should we insert which is Are we being a bit too nasty by defining the Determination Agent as Enron As the reference to Determination Agent in the contract is in a context similar to that of an arbitrator it seems a bit cheeky to then define ourselves as the arbitrator would this be enforceable if we were in court Im assuming the other GTCs are very similar to the US one and I have not read them Dave

Commodity Transit Trade structure The concern relates to the passing of title to the metal forming the subjectmatter of the contract Under this structure MCC sells metal to the counterparty Counterparty on a spot basis with payment deferred Contract Counterparty simultaneously sells back the metal to MCC also on a spot basis but not on deferred payment terms the spot payment received Counterparty therefore constitutes the finance Contract The concern is that as the transaction has been explained to us there may be a delay of two or three days between i legal title to the metal passing to Counterparty under Contract and ii legal title passing back again to MCC under Contact There is therefore a risk that an event could occur in the interim which prevents title passing back to MCC The most likely event would be the insolvency of the counterparty but other events eg supervening illegality due to the imposition of sanctions are conceivable More specifically a liquidator of Counterparty could seek to disclaim or set aside Contract if the market price of metal has increased during the interim Consequences The consequences stem from the fact that the metal forming the subject matter of these financings will typically be on the high seas bound for a third party ie not counterparty MCC will have a contractual obligation to transfer good title to the metal to that third party If title to the metal remains vested in Counterparty then Enron cannot fulfil this obligation to the third party Conversely if MCC completes the sale to the third party MCC cannot be said to have passed good title to Counterparty under Contract above In other words MCC could be sued for breach of contract for failure to transfer good title to Counterparty or the third party on the basis that it has sold the same goods twice The likely downside is that Enron could be forced to perform both to counterparty and to the third party at a loss or to perform to one and pay market damages to the other However there is a remote possibility that punitive damages could also be awarded against MCC on the basis that it has sold the same goods twice or possibly on the basis that the transactions are not genuine sales of goods but a sham this danger should not be exagerated and is mitigated by the choice of English law as the governing law of the contract A further consequence would of course be that the financing itself would not be capable of being completed with the attendant loss of feescommissions etc but this is probably a minor consideration Mitigants There are possible mitigants of the risk highlighted above as follows Cross default Contracts and will include cross default language to the effect that if Counterparty does not execute Contract Contract is cancelled Care should be taken to ensure that this language is wide enough to cover all circumstances eg if Counterparty has executed but not performed Contract would the cross default apply More significantly even if the cross default language works contractually it may be overriden by the bankruptcy laws of the Counterparty as invoked by Counterpartys liquidator In other words the liquidator may be able to cherry pick Contract while renouncing Contract This could be checked on a jurisdictional basis if considered appropriate As mentioned English law as the governing law of the contracts may mitigate the risk described above to some degree but local insolvency law in the country of Counterparty could override the parties choice of English law Probability As a matter of crude probability it may be regarded as fairly unlikely that within a narrow window of a few days or so i a Counterparty goes bankrupt ii in a rising market and iii its liquidator takes the point and insists on performance of Contract while renouncing Contract particularly in light of the fact that Counterparty does not have posssession of the metal and possession would be difficult to obtain This may be why the issue appears not to have arisen under past transactions It is however no assurance that these circumstances will not arise in the future Conclusion There is a real risk of loss to MCC should the Counterparty go bankrupt after Contact above but before performance of Contract This risk is most accute in a rising market and is relatively unlikely to materialise in a given case If it does materialise it is hard to assess definitively the possible loss involved but this would be likely to be at a minimum the difference between the then prevailing market price and the price of the metal under Contract Please anyone let me know if you would like to discuss this before we move to a formal DASH Thanks Paul Olivier Herbelot To Paul CT cc Subject Re Metal Trade Finance Paul Did you have any big concerns from your point of view after this mornings meeting Olivier

Following up on our discussion yesterday this is to summarize the issues and questions that we identified with respect to the trading of credit derivatives through Enron OnLine The proposal needs to be analyzed more closely from the perspective of three principal regulatory schemes securities commodities and insurance If the credit derivatives are not priced on the basis of or indexed to securities there should not be any significant securities law issues With respect to the Commodity Exchange Act if the derivatives are executed as swaps they will need to satisfy the CFTCs swap exemption and if executed as options they will need to satisfy the trade option exemption With respect to insurance there could be an issue as to whether the credit derivatives constitute insurance This determination as well will depend largely on how the derivatives are structured For example how will payment amounts be determined and will payments be tied to losses actually experienced by a counterparty As a result of the foregoing it will be necessary to obtain more details regarding the structure of the proposed transactions Will they be swaps or options What will the precise terms be and are there any draft forms of confirms that can be reviewed It will also be necessary to determine how bankruptcy events will be defined This approach is clearly simpler than other forms of credit derivatives that include a variety of triggers such as those based on defaults under loans derivatives securities or other instruments because bankruptcy should generally be a public and objective event However in many jurisdictions it is possible for third parties to cause an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding to be commenced and even frivolous proceedings can be commenced and maintained for some period Presumably the definition that is used will need to provide for some period in which the proceeding might be dismissed Also the definition will need to take into account the possibility of nonUS bankruptcy proceedings We also should obtain more information on the manner in which the derivatives will be priced and the manner in which such prices will be published or disseminated to clients This goes to the issue of whether Enron could be found to have breached some duty to a third party or whether that party may have a claim against Enron on some other basis For example it is possible that an entity whose name is included in the list of those on which derivatives are written will claim that Enron improperly used confidential information that it received about that party through a trading relationship in pricing derivatives on its credit In addition such name might claim that Enron caused it injury by publishing a price for derivatives on its credit that reflected a weaker credit rating than was warranted That party might claim that by publishing such price Enron caused other parties to suspend trading with it to declare defaults or to demand collateral This

Commodity Transit Trade structure The concern relates to the passing of title to the metal forming the subjectmatter of the contract Under this structure MCC sells metal to the counterparty Counterparty on a spot basis with payment deferred Contract Counterparty simultaneously sells back the metal to MCC also on a spot basis but not on deferred payment terms the spot payment received Counterparty therefore constitutes the finance Contract The concern is that as the transaction has been explained to us there may be a delay of two or three days between i legal title to the metal passing to Counterparty under Contract and ii legal title passing back again to MCC under Contact There is therefore a risk that an event could occur in the interim which prevents title passing back to MCC The most likely event would be the insolvency of the counterparty but other events eg supervening illegality due to the imposition of sanctions are conceivable More specifically a liquidator of Counterparty could seek to disclaim or set aside Contract if the market price of metal has increased during the interim Consequences The consequences stem from the fact that the metal forming the subject matter of these financings will typically be on the high seas bound for a third party ie not counterparty MCC will have a contractual obligation to transfer good title to the metal to that third party If title to the metal remains vested in Counterparty then Enron cannot fulfil this obligation to the third party Conversely if MCC completes the sale to the third party MCC cannot be said to have passed good title to Counterparty under Contract above In other words MCC could be sued for breach of contract for failure to transfer good title to Counterparty or the third party on the basis that it has sold the same goods twice The likely downside is that Enron could be forced to perform both to counterparty and to the third party at a loss or to perform to one and pay market damages to the other However there is a remote possibility that punitive damages could also be awarded against MCC on the basis that it has sold the same goods twice or possibly on the basis that the transactions are not genuine sales of goods but a sham this danger should not be exagerated and is mitigated by the choice of English law as the governing law of the contract A further consequence would of course be that the financing itself would not be capable of being completed with the attendant loss of feescommissions etc but this is probably a minor consideration Mitigants There are possible mitigants of the risk highlighted above as follows Cross default Contracts and will include cross default language to the effect that if Counterparty does not execute Contract Contract is cancelled Care should be taken to ensure that this language is wide enough to cover all circumstances eg if Counterparty has executed but not performed Contract would the cross default apply More significantly even if the cross default language works contractually it may be overriden by the bankruptcy laws of the Counterparty as invoked by Counterpartys liquidator In other words the liquidator may be able to cherry pick Contract while renouncing Contract This could be checked on a jurisdictional basis if considered appropriate As mentioned English law as the governing law of the contracts may mitigate the risk described above to some degree but local insolvency law in the country of Counterparty could override the parties choice of English law Probability As a matter of crude probability it may be regarded as fairly unlikely that within a narrow window of a few days or so i a Counterparty goes bankrupt ii in a rising market and iii its liquidator takes the point and insists on performance of Contract while renouncing Contract particularly in light of the fact that Counterparty does not have posssession of the metal and possession would be difficult to obtain This may be why the issue appears not to have arisen under past transactions It is however no assurance that these circumstances will not arise in the future Conclusion There is a real risk of loss to MCC should the Counterparty go bankrupt after Contact above but before performance of Contract This risk is most accute in a rising market and is relatively unlikely to materialise in a given case If it

up with Sanjev at Slaughter and May who is coordinating the European side Regulation We agree with the analysis Securities laws will not be relevant Insurance is likey to be the main issue If it emerges from our legal review of the relevant countries that we can avoid the insurance point by making our contracts look like derivatives swapsoptions that will determine whether the CFTC commodity regulations will be relevant For this reason it makes sense to complete the survey before drafting the confirms which in any event will be fairly simple Note though that we will not be using ISDA documentation since it is unnecessarily complex for the product contemplated described below and using the GTCs approach will tie in more neatly with OnLine Of course we will also need to look at local regulation in each target jurisdiction SFA for example are taking an increased interest in the internet and have recently released a detailed questionnaire which we may need to complete before launch The Product From my most recent discussions with Bryan the product will be a simple Bankruptcy only digital payout That is if the reference entity goes bankrupt probably as defined under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation local counsel will need to draft in each case the protection seller will pay the buyer a fixed preagreed sum of money not determined by reference to the value of a bond or anything else Bankruptcy Please see above Also note that we are looking for a harder more certain definition of bankruptcy which will be relatively easy to ascertain in each case Early warning type events will probably be out and court based or other formal proceedings which are readily verifiable will be in In practice this will make it harder for the buyer to claim than under the ISDA definition for example which is a far softer and more sensitive trigger Confidentiality Ken also raised this important point when we spoke yesterday There are issues of confidentiality which will be relevant While as a matter of UK regulation a Chinese WallRestricted List procedure will not be required since no securities will be involved contractual duties of confidentiality will need to be considered The issue is perhaps more a commercial one We will need to think carefully about the impact our public betting on the bankruptcy of our counterparties will or might have on our business relationships with them Ill come back with a legal game plan once Bryan Sanjev and I have got together Best regards Paul Louise Kitchen PM To Paul CT John CT Bryan CT cc Mark CT Subject Enron OnLineCredit Derivatives FYI Forwarded by Louise KitchenLONECT on Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From David Gilberg To Mark CT cc bcc Louise KitchenLONECT Subject Enron OnLineCredit Derivatives Following up on our discussion yesterday this is to summarize the issues and questions that we identified with respect to the trading of credit derivatives through Enron OnLine The proposal needs to be analyzed more closely from the perspective of three principal regulatory schemes securities commodities and insurance If the credit derivatives are not priced on the basis of or indexed to securities there should not be any significant securities law issues With respect to the Commodity Exchange Act if the derivatives are executed as swaps they will need to satisfy the CFTCs swap exemption and if executed as options they will need to satisfy the trade option exemption With respect to insurance there could be an issue as to whether the credit derivatives constitute insurance This determination as well will depend largely on how the derivatives are structured For example how will payment amounts be determined and will payments be tied to losses actually experienced by a counterparty As a result of the foregoing it will be necessary to obtain more details regarding the structure of the proposed transactions Will they be swaps or options What will the precise terms be and are there any draft forms of confirms that can be reviewed It will also be necessary to determine how bankruptcy events will be defined This approach is clearly simpler than other forms of credit derivatives that include a variety of triggers such as those based on defaults under loans derivatives securities or other instruments because bankruptcy should generally be a public and objective event However in many jurisdictions it is possible for third parties to cause an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding to be commenced and even frivolous proceedings can be commenced and maintained for some period Presumably the definition that is used will need to provide for some period in which the proceeding might be dismissed Also the definition will need to take into account the possibility of nonUS bankruptcy proceedings We also should obtain more information on the manner in which the derivatives will be priced and the manner in which such prices will be published or disseminated to clients This goes to the issue of whether Enron could be found to have breached some duty to a third party or whether that party may have a claim against Enron on some other basis For example it is possible that an entity whose name is included in the list of those on which derivatives are written will claim that Enron improperly used confidential information that it received about that party through a trading relationship in pricing derivatives on its credit In addition such name might claim that Enron caused it injury by publishing a price for derivatives on its credit that reflected a weaker credit rating than was warranted That party might claim that by publishing such price Enron caused other parties to suspend trading with it to declare defaults or to demand collateral This obviously is not generally a problem with credit derivatives because they are done privately on a onetoone basis Please call us if you have any questions or would like to discuss these or other issues

This Section does not preclude us from doing business with banks or other financial institutions As you anticipate breach of warranty constitutes an Event of Default entitling termination Section Your main concern appears to focus on the issue of sleeving As you will see we have included in Section of all GTCs a provision prohibiting transactions to be entered into by the reference entity itself or by any of its affiliates Any purported transaction of that sort is automatically void We considered carefully both internally and with outside counsel going further than this by including a provision stopping parties acting in concert with reference entity groups We concluded that such a provision would be inappropriate for two main reasons First as a practical matter it is almost impossible to police such a provision and detect cases of such collusion Secondly if we were to find out about such collusion we would be entitled to withhold payment regardless of any contractual provision on the basis that such collusion constitutes fraud It is also worth pointing out in this context that sleeving is not an issue germaine only to credit derivatives trading online It is possible in the existing OTC credit derivatives markets for this kind of activity to be perpetrated You will not find any provisions in existing market documentation addressing this point indeed the new ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions are consistent with this I only hope that reference entities do not follow the devious thought processes set out in your options ac and we will clearly have to keep an eye on you if you ever decide to pursue a different career It is not nasty defining Enron as the Determination Agent This accords with the standard ISDA Master Agreement and in fact is less dramatic than the ISDA insofar as all Enron will be required to do as Determination Agent is to verify the validity of notices submitted under transactions in the context of ISDA all sorts of complex calculations and subjective evaluations fall to be made by the Calculation Agent Thanks very much for thinking through the issues on the GTC and reviewing it Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further Best regards Paul Simons David Forster To Bryan CT Mark CT Edmund CT Paul CT cc Mark CT Subject Credit GTC All I have looked over the US credit GTC and the long descriptions I see we have decided to go with quarterly billing rather than monthly Will the paymentcollections cycle cause any heartburn for the back office I didnt spot any problems with the long descriptions A few relatively minor comments on the GTCs which you may or may not want to consider Clause e i Does this clause preclude us from doing business with banks or other financial institutions Could we append with regard to the Transaction What happens if a Rep or Warranty is broken Does that constitute sufficient breach to terminate the contract Im thinking specifically about sleeving which is perhaps covered by Clause eii I still think that sleeving is one of the most significant commercial risks faced by online trading of derivatives If I were working for a third party Id immediately look for ways to set up a sleeving service to sell credit protection to the Reference Entities where the Reference Entity or its affiliate views its own risk differently from Enron If I were the Reference Entity in question Id consider a Buying a load of protection via sleeving and then declaring bankruptcy then do a Phoenix in the UK at least b Buy a load of protection via sleeving then take the Credit Derivatives to another third party financial institution and using the credit derivatives as collateral to increase my line of credit Im no expert but I suspect there might be an interesting leverage effect here which might actually cause a significant increase in Enrons risk exposure c Like b only the financial institution could buy the credit derivative with or without the need for sleeving we probably need a restriction on this I know financial institutions are not our preferred counterparts up front but if I were a financial insitution Id quickly find a way around this limitation Affiliates or Sleevers Do you think it would beneficial to strengthen our protection against sleeving by adding something to Clause like It is not entering into a Transaction for the purpose of concluding a similar transaction with the party or any Affiliate of such party which is the Reference Entity in the Transaction Should Defn of Contract Currency be Contractual Currency Contractual is also used in the Long Descriptions Defn of Credit Product after Entity should we insert which is Are we being a bit too nasty by defining the Determination Agent as Enron As the reference to Determination Agent in the contract is in a context similar to that of an arbitrator it seems a bit cheeky to then define ourselves as the arbitrator would this be enforceable if we were in court Im assuming the other GTCs are very similar to the US one and I have not read them Dave

<5899579.1075859982905.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,paul.simons@enron.com,2000-01-17 06:01:00,Credit Trading OnLine Results of Legal Due Diligence and Risk Memo Cc GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF JANUARY FOR THIS PRODUCT THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGAL DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO As you know we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries where it was intended the credit product would initially be traded via EnronOnLine namely the UK the US Canada Finland Germany Norway Sweden and Switzerland Under the terms of the credit product on the occurrence of a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party the Reference Entity the Seller of the product which could be either Enron or its online counterparty will pay a fixed preagreed cash sum in an agreed currency to the Buyer It should be borne in mind that this product differs in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in the international markets This means that a change in the nature or terms of our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely change the analysis below Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more significant legal issues I am also attaching a two page Executive Summary of Legal Advice prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significant legal issuesrisks in each country and which should be read in conjunction with this note mail As you will see the Executive Summary does not focus on issues we raised which are all clear from a legal perspective so as to keep the summary to a sensible length but there was plenty of good news too Where a legal issue has been identified I have either set out below what action is to be taken or not addressed it further on the basis that on the advice of foreign counsel the risk is not very substantial or unlikely to materialise Therefore where no comment is made below in relation to a risk highlighted in the attached summary please assume that the legal risk is one which in our view it is reasonable to take A Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January Finland Norway Sweden Switzerland UK US B Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to be delayed Canada Germany reasons set out below C General Issues applicable in all countries The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks of a general nature i Capacity We will not be able to assume generally that our counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade the product and so will need to check each counterpartys constitutional documents before allowing them to trade the product online This applies to almost all entities eg corporates municipalities insurance companies in all countries Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general law in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all or under their constitutional documents in which case they will need to amend their constitutional documents if they wish to trade The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading relationship and so can be added to our procedures It is not a particularly onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally ii Confidentiality We will need to put in place procedures to ensure that we are not misusing confidential information about our business counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection Misuse can occur both in pricing the product and trading it The procedures will not include formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders or the credit department a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US counsel following very detailed discussions The procedures will include a the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe similar to the procedure currently used in Houston and b practical steps to ensure that confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which we are not entitled to use eg because it is the subject of a confidentiality agreement is not imparted to the credit traders In addition where Enron has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity or otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity we will need its written consent before offering protection on that entity Without such consent there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by that entity for breach of confidence D Country Specific Issues i Canada There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute insurance business constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the product unenforceable against our counterparties We should try to resolve this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in Canada Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter ii Germany Again the issue is insurance The risk is higher than in Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially iii Norway There is a material risk that the credit product could be regarded as gaming in Norway in which case trades would be void and unenforceable The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a substantial professional effort to satisfy ourselves that a trade is being entered into for valid commercial purposes normally hedging by our counterparty Clearly it will not be possible to take such steps on a trade by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline At a minimum we should therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic behind its trading this product type iv Switzerland If the credit product is the main purpose of our trading relationship with a counterparty we should check with the Swiss supervisory authority whether the product constitutes insurance the position being unclear If a trade is insurance it can be terminated by the counterparty which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer and an offence will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer However I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing business relationships in which case we can parallel path this issue v US New York Law a CFTC regulation by structuring the product either as a swap or an option and meeting certain other conditions we can rely on exemptions under the US Commodities Exchange Act b US securities laws there is a small chance that the credit product constitutes a security under US securities laws please see attached Executive Summary However SEC regulations allow the public offering of securities to accredited investors which will allow us to deal with investors having at least US million in assets Since most of our counterparties will be fairly large sophisticated players this test should not impede the business c Insider trading US counsel have advised that the risk of insider trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as security see b above is relatively remote Please feel free to call me on x if you would like to discuss this project further

<31046273.1075860276416.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,paul.simons@enron.com,2000-02-18 05:01:00,Re Credit GTC Cc Thank you for your comments on the US GTC Taking each of your main points in turn Section ei This Section does not preclude us from doing business with banks or other financial institutions As you anticipate breach of warranty constitutes an Event of Default entitling termination Section Your main concern appears to focus on the issue of sleeving As you will see we have included in Section of all GTCs a provision prohibiting transactions to be entered into by the reference entity itself or by any of its affiliates Any purported transaction of that sort is automatically void We considered carefully both internally and with outside counsel going further than this by including a provision stopping parties acting in concert with reference entity groups We concluded that such a provision would be inappropriate for two main reasons First as a practical matter it is almost impossible to police such a provision and detect cases of such collusion Secondly if we were to find out about such collusion we would be entitled to withhold payment regardless of any contractual provision on the basis that such collusion constitutes fraud It is also worth pointing out in this context that sleeving is not an issue germaine only to credit derivatives trading online It is possible in the existing OTC credit derivatives markets for this kind of activity to be perpetrated You will not find any provisions in existing market documentation addressing this point indeed the new ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions are consistent with this I only hope that reference entities do not follow the devious thought processes set out in your options ac and we will clearly have to keep an eye on you if you ever decide to pursue a different career It is not nasty defining Enron as the Determination Agent This accords with the standard ISDA Master Agreement and in fact is less dramatic than the ISDA insofar as all Enron will be required to do as Determination Agent is to verify the validity of notices submitted under transactions in the context of ISDA all sorts of complex calculations and subjective evaluations fall to be made by the Calculation Agent Thanks very much for thinking through the issues on the GTC and reviewing it Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further Best regards Paul Simons David Forster To Bryan CT Mark CT Edmund CT Paul CT cc Mark CT Subject Credit GTC All I have looked over the US credit GTC and the long descriptions I see we have decided to go with quarterly billing rather than monthly Will the paymentcollections cycle cause any heartburn for the back office I didnt spot any problems with the long descriptions A few relatively minor comments on the GTCs which you may or may not want to consider Clause e i Does this clause preclude us from doing business with banks or other financial institutions Could we append with regard to the Transaction What happens if a Rep or Warranty is broken Does that constitute sufficient breach to terminate the contract Im thinking specifically about sleeving which is perhaps covered by Clause eii I still think that sleeving is one of the most significant commercial risks faced by online trading of derivatives If I were working for a third party Id immediately look for ways to set up a sleeving service to sell credit protection to the Reference Entities where the Reference Entity or its affiliate views its own risk differently from Enron If I were the Reference Entity in question Id consider a Buying a load of protection via sleeving and then declaring bankruptcy then do a Phoenix in the UK at least b Buy a load of protection via sleeving then take the Credit Derivatives to another third party financial institution and using the credit derivatives as collateral to increase my line of credit Im no expert but I suspect there might be an interesting leverage effect here which might actually cause a significant increase in Enrons risk exposure c Like b only the financial institution could buy the credit derivative with or without the need for sleeving we probably need a restriction on this I know financial institutions are not our preferred counterparts up front but if I were a financial insitution Id quickly find a way around this limitation Affiliates or Sleevers Do you think it would beneficial to strengthen our protection against sleeving by adding something to Clause like It is not entering into a Transaction for the purpose of concluding a similar transaction with the party or any Affiliate of such party which is the Reference Entity in the Transaction Should Defn of Contract Currency be Contractual Currency Contractual is also used in the Long Descriptions Defn of Credit Product after Entity should we insert which is Are we being a bit too nasty by defining the Determination Agent as Enron As the reference to Determination Agent in the contract is in a context similar to that of an arbitrator it seems a bit cheeky to then define ourselves as the arbitrator would this be enforceable if we were in court Im assuming the other GTCs are very similar to the US one and I have not read them Dave
