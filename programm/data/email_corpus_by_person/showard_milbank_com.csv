Securities Indemnity claim Dear Khun Peangpanor Khun Kasemsi We refer to our telephone discussion last Friday regarding the enforcement of the Indemnity Clause in the Purchase Agreement As discussed we would like to have a telephone conference call among WC Bangkok and US Milbank and us With respect to the objective of the conference call we would like to propose that we discuss and agree on the circumstances that the Indemnity Clause can be enforceable Then we will put such circumstances as a condition in the application of ECT Securities For example our statement to the Official Receiver may say that The applicant has accepted that the claim under this application can be enforceable to the debtor NSM only in case We need only the exact wording to be agreed on between WC US and Milbank We are not sure that it is possible that we say that only in the case where the applicant has not been claimed against for reasons of fraud or willful misconduct We just put the condition in the application without having to prove whether in fact such condition has occurred or not This fact will be proved in the future In case where ECT Securities would like NSM to make actual payment to it in the future it has to prove to NSM that the condition has occurred We note from WC Bangkok that WC US may call Milbank for a discussion on this matter today However if you please forward this email to WC US so that the US lawyers of WC can discuss with Milbank via email also If we cannot reach the agreed wording by this Wednesday evening Bangkok time it seems that all of us may have to ask WC US and Milbank to attend the meeting with the official receiver in Bangkok this Friday It is very possible that should the Official Receiver give an order in favour of either of us the case would be appealed to the court by the loser Such will incur lots of cost for both ECT Securities and NSM Therefore an amicable resolution to this issue is in the interests of all parties If you have any

We are not sure that it is possible that we say that only in the case where the applicant has not been claimed against for reasons of fraud or willful misconduct We just put the condition in the application without having to prove whether in fact such condition has occurred or not This fact will be proved in the future In case where ECT Securities would like NSM to make actual payment to it in the future it has to prove to NSM that the condition has occurred We note from WC Bangkok that WC US may call Milbank for a discussion on this matter today However if you please forward this email to WC US so that the US lawyers of WC can discuss with Milbank via email also If we cannot reach the agreed wording by this Wednesday evening Bangkok time it seems that all of us may have to ask WC US and Milbank to attend the meeting with the official receiver in Bangkok this Friday It is very possible that should the Official Receiver give an order in favour of either of us the case would be appealed to the court by the loser Such will incur lots of cost for both ECT Securities and NSM Therefore an amicable resolution to this issue is in the interests of all parties If you have any

will try to chase them to contact you quickly and try to get the name of the contact person at WhiteCase US for you I understand your reason It is possible to postpone the meeting After it seems that we cannot reach the agreed wording within this Wednesday I will contact the official receiver and other parties to postpone the meeting for our witness I think they already received your memorandum

major family plans to attend this conference Is there any way to postpone it Has White Case seen our memorandum about enforceability of indemnity claims That memo should go a long way toward showing

we would like to have a telephone conference call among WC Bangkok and US Milbank and us With respect to the objective of the conference call we would like to propose that we discuss and agree on the circumstances that the Indemnity Clause can be enforceable Then we will put such circumstances as a condition in the application of ECT Securities For example our statement to the Official Receiver may say that The applicant has accepted that the claim under this application can be enforceable to the debtor NSM only in case We need only the exact wording to be agreed on between WC US and Milbank We are not sure that it is possible that we say that only in the case where the applicant has not been claimed against for reasons of fraud or willful misconduct We just put the condition in the application without having to prove whether in fact such condition has occurred or not This fact will be proved in the future In case where ECT Securities would like NSM to make actual payment to it in the future it has to prove to NSM that the condition has occurred We note from WC Bangkok that WC US may call Milbank for a discussion on this matter today However if you please forward this email to WC US so that the US lawyers of WC can discuss with Milbank via email also If we cannot reach the agreed wording by this Wednesday evening Bangkok time it seems that all of us may have to ask WC US and Milbank to attend the meeting with the official receiver in Bangkok this Friday It is very possible that should the Official Receiver give an order in favour of either of us the case would be

<4288523.1075853245906.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,showard@milbank.com,2000-11-21 06:00:00,RE ECT Securities Indemnity claim Cc I suggest adding the following language to ECTs claim The foregoing claim does not seek indemnification from NSM against any claims arising under the Securities Act of or the Securities Exchange Act of of the United States or against any claims that require proof of fraud or willful misconduct on the part of the Applicant This language has not yet been reviewed by Enron counsel or other lawyers at Milbank By copy of this email to them I am asking each to let you and me know of any changes that they suggest Steve Howard Original Message From Ngodngam Rittichai Sent Monday November PM To Cc Dunn Charles Eammongkolchai Pichitphon Phungmaha Ajaree Smith Richard Subject RE ECT Securities Indemnity claim Dear Steve Thank you very much for your quick response My suggested wording is just to make it quickly for the discussion It will be appreciate if you could draft the specific wording for us then we will email it to White Case That will make the discussion between you and White Case be easy and quick WhiteCase have not contacted us yet for today This afternoon I will try to chase them to contact you quickly and try to get the name of the contact person at WhiteCase US for you I understand your reason It is possible to postpone the meeting After it seems that we cannot reach the agreed wording within this Wednesday I will contact the official receiver and other parties to postpone the meeting for our witness I think they already received your memorandum because WhiteCase Bangkok received it last Thursday By the way I have a suggestion that you may not have to discuss with WhiteCase to much on the academic legal issues but we just need them to agree with our proposal of adding the condition in the application and let them agreed with your wording Best regards Rittichai Ngodngam Associate Linklaters Thailand Ltd Bangkok Linklaters is a member firm of Linklaters Alliance Tel Ext Fax Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday November PM To mailto Cc mailto mailto Subject RE ECT Securities Indemnity claim Dear Mr Ngodngam I very much like your idea of ECTs amending its claim to add a condition to the claim to accommodate WCs position about the unenforceability of indemnity agreements visavis certain types of securities claims and not others Would you like me to draft some specific language The language that you suggest in your email is an excellent start but it may need a little refinement in order to get White Case to drop their objection Have you heard from WCBangkok or WCUS We have not I am available for a conference call almost anytime I do not think it is practical for US lawyers to get to Thailand for a conference on Friday in Thailand Thursday Nov is a major family holiday in the United States probably the second biggest holiday in the entire year here I am extremely reluctant to ask any US lawyer to disrupt major family plans to attend this conference Is there any way to postpone it Has White Case seen our memorandum about enforceability of indemnity claims That memo should go a long way toward showing WC that we can probably reach agreement on this matter without lawyers having to travel to Thailand this week Steve Howard Original Message From Ngodngam Rittichai SMTP Sent Monday November AM To Cc Dunn Charles Eammongkolchai Pichitphon Phungmaha Ajaree Ngodngam Rittichai Smith Richard Subject RE ECT Securities Indemnity claim Dear Khun Peangpanor Khun Kasemsi We refer to our telephone discussion last Friday regarding the enforcement of the Indemnity Clause in the Purchase Agreement As discussed we would like to have a telephone conference call among WC Bangkok and US Milbank and us With respect to the objective of the conference call we would like to propose that we discuss and agree on the circumstances that the Indemnity Clause can be enforceable Then we will put such circumstances as a condition in the application of ECT Securities For example our statement to the Official Receiver may say that The applicant has accepted that the claim under this application can be enforceable to the debtor NSM only in case We need only the exact wording to be agreed on between WC US and Milbank We are not sure that it is possible that we say that only in the case where the applicant has not been claimed against for reasons of fraud or willful misconduct We just put the condition in the application without having to prove whether in fact such condition has occurred or not This fact will be proved in the future In case where ECT Securities would like NSM to make actual payment to it in the future it has to prove to NSM that the condition has occurred We note from WC Bangkok that WC US may call Milbank for a discussion on this matter today However if you please forward this email to WC US so that the US lawyers of WC can discuss with Milbank via email also If we cannot reach the agreed wording by this Wednesday evening Bangkok time it seems that all of us may have to ask WC US and Milbank to attend the meeting with the official receiver in Bangkok this Friday It is very possible that should the Official Receiver give an order in favour of either of us the case would be appealed to the court by the loser Such will incur lots of cost for both ECT Securities and NSM Therefore an amicable resolution to this issue is in the interests of all parties If you have any question please feel free to call us Rittichai Ngodngam Associate Linklaters Thailand Ltd
