Reconciliation Across Risk Applications Rick and Greg Wanda has done a good job of capturing some of the points that she Beth Apollo and I discussed recently Rick as you and I discussed in our meeting on August we have spent many months documenting discrepancies between source systems ERMS Enpower etc and RisktRAC and the implications for calculations and Credit Aggregation The process of a daily meeting and a tracking tool for discrepancies helped to identify true operational process issues that have been addressed As we discussed our daily tracking has now for months documented evidence pointing to the true underlying issue that the linkage of information between source systems and RisktRAC is not smooth and reliable and has never been appropriately addressed for its completeness accuracy and efficiency I applaud the IT team who delivered the analytical tools that are valuable in RisktRAC Now it is time to align business rules employed across source systems calculations and CreditAg and to partner the IT resources from source systems and RisktRAC to solve the underlying problem In my meeting with Rick Buy I volunteered to take ownership of fixing the problem obviously with much help from the operations teams IT resources and Ricks designated RAC stakeholder Debbie Brackett Our focus on this project is global and will be threefold assuring that agreements on business rules and changes in processes or systems will deliver ACCURACY COMPLETENESS and EFFICIENCY Wandas summary seems to allude to a daily reconciliation process that will take place To clarify our purpose in this project will be to create systematic checks control totals and exception reporting so that humans do not have to implement a daily reconciliation process Wanda is a little ahead of herself with the to day timeline We do not have a firm timeline established yet We have designated business and IT resources and are in the process of discussing with London how they will be involved We have had a preliminary meeting with Steve Stock and he is on board and understands that we must make meaningful progress in a short period of time With the exception of London Steve has the necessary IT resources reporting to him for both RisktRAC and source systems Steve is reviewing some diagnostics from his architecture group and then we will be at the point of delineating milestones and timelines within the next days We do anticipate a relatively short timeframe for results on this effort but that is not yet defined We are creating a steering committee and project management office for this project with operations RAC and IT members that will be appropriate but not too large We want to focus on getting the work done I will gladly update all on this distribution list in the next days on our finalized steering committee project managers definition of outcomes from the project and planned completion dates We look forward to the opportunity to solve this data

William S Port David Subject Reconciliation Across Risk Applications Rick and Greg I met with Sally and Beth on August th to discuss the operational risk management initiative requiring a reconciliation across all major risk applications This reconciliation is necessary to validate the transfer of all data from source systems ie risk books into risk applications which calculate VAR provide credit exposures feed Infinity with daily cash flows and ultimately the DPR Sally and Beth along with IT have initiated a project to improve and monitor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces The scope includes a review of the processes which impact the accuracy of information timing of interfaces production performance issues inventory of books and improved controls over changes to book attributes and the officialization process They have agreed to add a requirement to provide on a daily basis this reconciliation across all major risk applications The projected timeline to complete this project including the reconciliation initiative is to days We will need to reassess the decision to combine these initiatives if the GRMO timeline slips This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics not currently available the ability to track data accuracy in terms of the percentage of information which transferred and processed correctly

Conversation with Edison re Getting Negative CTC Paid I know that SCE is taking this position They are simple wrong Unless and until we get all of our positive CTC back from the Utility why should I even begin to consider their goofy arguments In addition SCE is receiving B which is a full payment of all Negative CTC If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers thats a different policy matter The CPUC agreed to the idea of Negative CTC and SCE needs to pay Also if we are of load and the Undercollection is B I think that SCE would be looking for MM our entire claim

undercollection would be under Edisons view If you need another copy let me know Question I dont know what our book looks like on this issue but if we were to take the netting through a reduction in

Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Mellencamp Lisa Tribolet Michael Sanders Richard B Kean Steven J Sharp Vicki Smith Mike Williams Robert C Curry Wanda Swain Steve Huddleson Diann Calger Christopher F Belden Tim Dietrich Janet Subject Conversation with Edison re Getting Negative CTC Paid I talked to John Fielder SVP Edison about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edisons CFO about hedging Edisons QF price risk Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue Heres what he said They plan to settle with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else which he reiterated would be sometime in Q Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utilitys undercollection and that the ESPs share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways lump sum netting ie if they owe MM and the share of the undercollection is MM then they pay the ESP MM or future reductions in PX Credit ie they pay the ESP MM and then reduce the PX going forward until the MM is paid down The numbers are illustrative only In addition he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR LT contracts and whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs I recommended strongly that he delink issues and above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC He agreed He said that the PUC judges recently issued prehearing conference order requires that Edison meet and confer with ESPs prior to the Nov th hearing and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing Fielder is also the point person on getting ESPs paid and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible at the expense of creditors to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago Edisons stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it We shouldnt assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue If you have any questions let us know Best Jeff

Edison bailout today on a vote This item was not on the Commissions agenda other than as a placeholder regarding litigation We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edisons SVP of Regulatory Affairs and heres a summary The Commission will keep current rates in place through Any overcollection resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off B in Edisons past due accounts the socalled undercollection If Edison collects the B prior to then rates can change If Edison has not collected the B by the end of the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder Half the remainder will be collected in and the other half in Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the B undercollection Edison can keep of any refunds received after the B is paid off Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the B Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs ie if DWRs costs go up the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edisons rates The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edisons capital structure varies from the PUCapproved capital structure Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding the filed rate doctrine and the socalled TURN accounting method which effectively kept the rate freeze in place Edison agrees to cooperate with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the special session that the Governor recently announced We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them Best Jeff Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Tuesday October

Wanda Mellencamp Lisa Higgason Kelly Whalley Greg Mellencamp Lisa Subject California Update PUC Turns Down Davis Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event the California PUC today voted down Davis proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC The vote was with the two Republicans voting with Davis handpicked appointees Lynch and Wood Davis proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointeeGeoff Brownwho made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis proposed rate agreement What is Davis proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs no questions asked What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis proposal With the vote it remains unclear how CaliforniaDWR will pay for the DWR power contracts The political pressure to renegotiateor breakthe DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably It remains unclear how CaliforniaDWR will pay for the B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months Under the structure devised by Davis the revenues flowing from the CPUCDWR rate agreement would be used to both pay for the DWR power contracts and service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay Californias General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January In short there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds Safe to say that todays PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis and left his approach to solving California electricity crisis in shambles What Next A broad leftright coalition of energy interests supported a bill XX that passed the Legislature with broad bipartisan support The bill would create a dedicated rate component on every customers bill to service the B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue Proponents of the billand just about everyone elseargue that the dedicated rate component is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget The bill is silent however on how California would pay for the DWR contracts and the bills opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill The leftright coalition from Nader types to oil companies is also working hard to get Davis to sign it Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel Given todays vote however Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid Update on Edison Bailout Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another special session next Tuesday If you have any questions just let us know
