our transmission represented The format is ok I just need more information in the path or the ability to put the entire block of the transmission we buy in the E cell I am going to experiment with a couple of things to see how the output looks in the Confirm When I try to sort Global ID or tags I cant drag the box up to the sort area I get a slashzero icon Using a smaller set of data does not seem to change the relative speed of the confirm upload It looks like each path takes roughly minutes to do I am only putting physical paths in the confirm upload which reduces the data set dramatically I have routed MidC for the BPA deals left unrouted are and The original delivery point in the deal is NW delivered and then we move it in scheduling every day to go where it is needed This type of deal will always be done and there are other deals that get moved in the Southwest as well There is a WALC transmission deal that is at Pinnacle Peak and is changed daily in scheduling to West Wing The deals missing dashes seem to all be the same Here is one example EPMIGSPCISOTSPPVD CISOEPMIEPMICALPOOAPS VALLEYALL DAYS HLH DEAL Here is how the path should look if the dashes were placed correctly EPMIGSPCISOTSPPVD CISOEPMIEPMICALPOOAPS VALLEYALL DAYS HLH DEAL I still cannot get my PV sheet to upload to the confirm dbase properly I got the Access Violation errors yesterday and so endtasked to get out and logged off and went home today it looks like it is running but I got the access violation errors again today I am going to save the same data to a new file and try to run it under a different name The COB sheet seems to be running so hopefully the error is imbedded in the one sheet I know we discussed the possibility of tying the new path and path cuts to our other EnPower systems I apologize if I did not make it clear that this would be a complicated process involving changes to those other applications There is currently no plan for including those features in this release Our goal for the first release was to replace your existing Lotus Notes system I dont remember our discussions making this only a possibility I remember it being an improvement to existing systems and a reduction in redundant work because everything would be enpower now I would like to explore how to make this part of the release It seems to me that it would be more work to make it half what we need now and then keep adding to it to get to our goal I will keep testing today and bring more findings this afternoon Thanks Cara Original Message From Smith Will Sent Wednesday July AM To Semperger Cara Cc Bentley Corry Atta Asem Venkataswami Vishwanatha Subject RE Preschedule Workspace TestingJune target date Cara PreSchedule Concerning the path with transmission data The original format was based off of Corrys suggestion Perhaps the two of you need to discuss your needs However I should tell you that your approach will require a database access for each transmission otherwise there is no way for us to determine the POR POD and firmness for the transmission deal Can you give Asem and me some deal numbers to look into regarding the Northwest Delivered deals with multiple delivery points We will resolve the physical nonphysical in the next release as well as add a Check for Errors button Determining the cause of the speed issues with creating the confirm records can be time consuming We will work on it right away but in the meantime try working with smaller sets of data We will get you a faster solution as soon as possible Path Confirm Sorting Are Global ID and Tag sorting just not in an order that you expect Our tools are sorting strictly by alphanumeric comparisons If you need the values sorted by numbers putting the numbers ahead of the description will work better for you Can you give me a specific example of a path that is missing dashes I will have Vish change the New Path functionality to require both Supply and Market If the delivery points are different should we require a transmission path record I know we discussed the possibility of tying the new path and path cuts to our other EnPower systems I apologize if I did not

successfully copy and paste large amounts of excel data into the PSW I was able to query build route successfully for each delivery point I needed I was able to change the color of text and fonts at will When running the Confirm function I was able to print the error log which was helpful when I had to fix a few counterparty errors The routing speed was still very good What needs improvement The run time for the Confirm function is still far too slow to be useful in production The rockies sheet alone took hours to upload the Mid C sheet took over two hours I have not been able to populate the full data set because of this speed issue I will continue uploading today and try tomorrow to look at the full data set in confirm I could not import the Palo Verde sheet in to confirm I got this error message ERRORAccess violation at address EDE in module PreSchedWSexe Read of address We need the ability to check for errors before running the sheet I used another half hour fixing the errors and rerunning the sheet A spot check of routing shows that the routes are still not showing the appropriate flag for physical vs nonphysical Everything shows nonphysical Routing still did not happen on the Northwest Delivered deals that were moved in scheduling to multiple delivery points Question Will the sheet support the capability of our transmission legs showing up where the E is now the weakness with having the path show from transmission etc is it does not give the PORPOD or the firmness of the transmission The way a path should look is like this VEAPSTPVWW O FWALCTWWMEAD O MNFEPMINEVP the way this same path would show if put in to the sheet as it is now will be VEAPSWALCNEVP This is incomplete information OR would it be possible to modify the sheet to accept the following information in the Trans and Oasis number cells Instead of APS put APSTPVWW and in the OASIS cell put F In Path Confirmation What worked I was able to choose and reset colors that help me read the information better The speed to pull up an individual path is MUCH BETTER I was able to select a group of paths in the line view and attempt to confirm them The save takes too long but it worked What still needs work I still cannot sort by Global ID or Tag number Would a different tag logic work instead of PWX Tag show PWX TAG Some marketers use letters for tags The cell with the path in the expanded view must autosize to contain all of the path The program needs to insert a dash in the path when each cell boundary is passedUpstreamSupplyETransTransTransMarketDownstreamRight now some run together The path cut needs work it is cumbersome unclear on some entry requirements and does not seem to recognize any number I put in it This app seems like guesswork New path needs work as well The POR and POD needs to be a type and complete field like in build route selection not a first letter drop down list The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical It should mimic the deal entry list The new record should be three tiered Supply first then marketboth mandatory entry then transmission as an optional third To allow a Supply without a Market record is going to create many problems How are these new records going to be routed Also our original intent was that the new path and path cut would drive deal entry not deal entry being done and then numbers populated into Path Cut I will continue testing tomorrow the hotspots I see now are the upload speed to Path confirmation and a close look at how we need the Path Cut and New Path to work We are getting there I am very encouraged Cara

the end of an entrepreneurial culture that more closely resembled a startup than a Fortune behemoth That culture encouraged creativity and rewarded new ideas that worked they say even though its dark side an almost manic drive to experiment with new methods and conquer new markets resulted in its downfall Where they wonder can they go from here Innovative is a clich but thats what Enron was Brandon Rigney who operated the companys Web site said on Thursday This is four days gone from the place and Im already in withdrawal Enron which began as a gas pipeline company and transformed itself into the worlds largest energy trader in the s created an associate analysts program modeled after Wall Street investment banks Each year it tapped college graduates half of them MBAs to spend three years in rotating jobs at all parts of its empire It also gave workers opportunities to start new business units The companys energy trading platform Enron Online was created a few years ago by a yearold gas trader It quickly became one of the most profitable divisions In recent years the company came to be dominated by young people like Jeff Shankman a Wharton School graduate who joined the company at By age he had become president and chief operating officer of Enron Global Markets Mr Shankman who has just left the company said Enron was special because it didnt have a corporate hierarchy to encumber creativity Management experts like Gary Hamel praised Enron for breaking with convention and turning regular employees like the yearold gas trader into corporate entrepreneurs And Fortune magazine named it Americas most innovative company for six consecutive years The corporate makeover was largely the work of Jeffrey K Skilling who resigned as chief executive in August only six months after being promoted to the job Under Mr Skilling a former McKinsey Company consultant the company tested new strategies like structuring its corporate culture to mimic the marketplace You could come up with an idea and get people excited said Janel Guerrero who worked in Enrons government affairs department noting that a friend in the broadband unit went to top executives with an idea and Enron started moving on it quickly You didnt ponder it was about acting very quickly and it was about being a first mover she added Enron rapidly created ventures to trade everything from energy paper pulp and lumber to broadband and advertising But quickness sometimes exacts a price Some ventures went broke like Azurix newsquote its spinoff water company The broadband unit lost about billion When top management got into broadband metal steel pulp we thought it was innovative Mr Rigney said When people said Well trade water and waste water thats the future we said Thats cool I didnt hear dissent in the ranks But I drank the KoolAid with everyone else even though it made my head throb Indeed the expansion into new areas drained the profits of the successful energy trading operations critics say Undone by shaky accounting and too much borrowed money the company collapsed last month But even near the end it was buzzing with new ventures I just got here five months ago said Fred Radvansky who was attending a Houston job fair I was part of a group of about people We were rolling out a new Enron model We were going to start trading freight If inventiveness flourished at Enron the freewheeling environment there also encouraged other and less agreeable impulses cutthroat competition and management arrogance It was kind of like a dotcom phenomenon said Harvey J Padewer president of energy services at Duke Energy newsquote a big utility They created a killandeat culture Mr Rigney the former Web site operator remembers it well People tried to take work away from you he said There was a Darwinism for ideas for projects That undermined the companys health critics say For example it is widely believed that compensation for the people who negotiated deals with other companies was based on the size of the transactions rather than their longterm effect on the bottom line Annual reviews aimed at weeding out the least productive to percent of the work force damaged morale and some longtime employees felt unwanted There were all these MBAs coming in and they were evaluating things differently said Becky Cantrell who worked on regulatory matters I was one of the oldest people at When I saw someone my age it was a relief For all the doubts some employees harbored others reveled in the derringdo atmosphere even after Enrons financial fall and cringed at the prospect of being acquired by Dynegy Inc newsquote a stodgy Houston electric utility They bragged about being a meatandpotatoes company with people who went to the University of Nebraska one former Enron employee said We had all these hyperactive Harvard and Stanford types It would have never worked After the merger fell apart Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec and laid off about employees in Houston Over the next few days television crews filmed weeping employees streaming out of the headquarters and carrying boxes of personal belongings even as construction workers put finishing touches on Enrons shimmering new story headquarters office tower Some got word of their dismissal via voice mail Others are still packing up and wondering I dont think Enron will ever be recreated Mr Shankman said on Thursday sitting on a nearly empty trading floor that was built for people at Enron Maybe we got into some businesses too quickly and too early Enron officials and management experts insist it was not the corporate culture that brought Enron down it was accounting mistakes or the ballooning debt of hard assets like projects in Brazil and India Those facts may now be plumbed by business school case studies In the meantime some former employees have created Enron alumni Web sites Others are writing letters to The Houston Chronicle about how for a brief time they thought they were part of something special Enron was what I thought epitomized a global American Dream of sorts wrote Kathy Walthall a former Enron contractor By far the best days of my career were as a consultant for Enron The environment was an extreme rush Very busy very progressive and innovative But Ms Walthall said she was also outraged at the board for allowing the company to fall so swiftly I really hope the company turns around she wrote But I know it will never be the same Copyright The New York Times Company Privacy Information

Squeeze By RICHARD A OPPEL Jr and FLOYD NORRIS The Enron Corporation newsquote redirectmarketwatchredirectctxMWcustomnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbENE told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash It said that if any of a number of things went wrong its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question In a delayed quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission the company said that it would have to repay million in debt by next Tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan Enron has about billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of billion by the end of next year The report for the third quarter which was filed five days late says the company faces immediate demand for billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further Enrons independent auditors with the firm of Arthur Andersen have not been able to complete their review of Enrons financial statements for the third quarter Andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of Enrons books related to Enrons disclosure this month that it had overstated almost million in profits in the last five years Enron has said that it will restate statements that Andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon Yesterday Representative John D Dingell of Michigan the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee called for an investigation into Arthur Andersens handling of the Enron audits A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night Enron the nations largest energy trader has agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc newsquote redirectmarketwatchredirectctxMWcustomnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbDYN its smaller crosstown rival in Houston and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further downgrading of Enron which is now at the lowest investmentgrade rating Any downgrades could lead to a collapse of Enrons core energy trading business analysts say as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with Enron entirely The Dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year and the disclosures yesterday indicate that Enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed Enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next September Enron is in talks to obtain million to billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions In addition executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell million in assets by the end of the year and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year Enron is also set to receive a billion infusion from ChevronTexaco which owns a percent stake in Dynegy if the deal closes next year Still even after factoring in cash flow from Enrons core energytrading operations Enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year meaning that Enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities Carol Coale an analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston said the new disclosures indicated that Enrons troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with Dynegy was announced Our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank Ms Coale said But now it sounds like Enrons problems were actually more inherent than perceived Enrons deal with Dynegy calls for Enron holders to receive Dynegy share for each Enron share but in trading since the deal was announced Enrons share price has lagged Dynegys price reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday before the Enron filing was released Enron rose cents to and Dynegy rose to At those prices the value of the Dynegy offer is percent above Enrons share price compared with a percent difference when the deal was announced Some debts that Enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further And the merger agreement with Dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if Enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger currently an Enron share In afterhours trading yesterday after the release of the Enron filing the share price slipped to Enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than million Yesterdays filing provided some additional details on Enrons relationships with various related partnerships whose debts Enron could be forced to pay and it said that additional writeoffs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined It said that because Enrons stock value had fallen one writedown could be million The disclosures show that Enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet But the collapse of Enrons stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost Enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts It is not possible to predict Enron warned investors whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enrons ability to continue as a going concern
