Subject Thoughtful comments MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetDusascii ContentDisposition inline Dear Friends The following was sent to me by my friend Tamim Ansary Tamim is an AfghaniAmerican writer He is also one of the most brilliant people I know in this life When he writes I read When he talks I listen Here is his take on Afghanistan and the whole mess we are in Dear friend and whoever else is on this email thread Ive been hearing a lot of talk about bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Ronn Owens on KGO Talk Radio today allowed that this would mean killing innocent people people who had nothing to do with this atrocity but were at war we have to accept collateral damage What else can we do Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether we have the belly to do what must be done And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I am from Afghanistan and even though Ive lived here for years Ive never lost track of whats going on there So I want to tell anyone who will listen how it all looks from where Im standing I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in New York I agree that something must be done about those monsters But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan Theyre not even the government of Afghanistan The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan When you think Taliban think Nazis When you think Bin Laden think Hitler And when you think the people of Afghanistan think the Jews in the concentration camps Its not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity They were the first victims of the perpetrators They would exult if someone would come in there take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country Some say why dont the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban The answer is theyre starved exhausted hurt incapacitated suffering A few years ago the United Nations estimated that there are disabled orphans in Afghanistana country with no economy no food There are millions of widows And the Taliban has been burying these widows alive in mass graves The soil is littered with land mines the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets These are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Trouble is thats been done The Soviets took care of it already Make the Afghans suffer Theyre already suffering Level their houses Done Turn their schools into piles of rubble Done Eradicate their hospitals Done Destroy their infrastructure Cut them off from medicine and health care Too late Someone already did all that New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs Would they at least get the Taliban Not likely In todays Afghanistan only the Taliban eat only they have the means to move around Theyd slip away and hide Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans they dont move too fast they dont even have wheelchairs But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldnt really be a strike against the criminals who did this horrific thing Actually it would only be making common cause with the Talibanby raping once again the people theyve been raping all this time So what else is there What can be done then Let me now speak with true fear and trembling The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops When people speak of having the belly to do what needs to be done theyre thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent people Lets pull our heads out of the sand Whats actually on the table is Americans dying And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Ladens hideout Its much bigger than that folks Because to get any troops to Afghanistan wed have to go through Pakistan Would they let us Not likely The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first Will other Muslim nations just stand by You see where Im going Were flirting with a world war between Islam and the West And guess what thats Bin Ladens program Thats exactly what he wants Thats why he did this Read his speeches and statements Its all right there He really believes Islam would beat the west It might seem ridiculous but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam and the West hes got a billion soldiers If the west wreaks a holocaust in those lands thats a billion people with nothing left to lose thats even better from Bin Ladens point of view Hes probably wrong in the end the west would win whatever that would mean but the war would last for years and millions would die not just theirs but ours Who has the belly for that Bin Laden does Anyone else Tamim Ansary
