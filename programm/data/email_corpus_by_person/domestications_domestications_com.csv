recall fabrics and wood I have touched smells I have enjoyed and of course people who have made impressions and places I have been One such person was a woman at least years old who lived in a most unlikely placeher antiques store It was from another time and place certainly not from the Southwest which is where I happened upon her Upon discovering her quaint store I banged the huge doorknocker a few times before she slowly opened the door Her silver hair was pulled tightly into a bun not unlike I thought at the time Katharine Hepburn Her aura of elegance showed and her face sparkled with a bright smile Who was she Had she always lived in her store She let me in Although it was not the holiday season whispers of light were everywhere high and low The place was packed She had the best and rarest antiques the world had to offer Each piece was more polished than the previous She loved living with her things this was apparent After I had made a couple of twists and turns from one room to another she approached and kindly offered tea I declined her invitation After I purchased an unusual bottle of sterling silver and rubycolored crystal we said our goodbyes She opened the door and I returned to the real world It has been years and Ive often thought of this elegant woman and her inviting shop Whenever I do I regret not having accepted her invitation for tea The stories she could have told A place that has inspired my decorating sense is a wonderful old inn in upstate New York High tea in the grand salon is replete with scones light cookies and English tea which guests savor as they relax in butterysoft leather chairs which are nestled by a huge stone fireplace Ive sat in those chairs for hours at a time watching the other guests always certain they were dressed in Victorian ball gowns my husband however assures me theyre were wearing blue jeans This grand inn is just one of a thousand places that have inspired my decorating with its unique style and atmosphere I could have sworn it was haunted by kindred spirits I hope so Tips by Julee Tip No cupboards near the kitchen sink Install three glass shelves just above the sink or to the side of the window Great for drinking glasses Tip Have a contemporary powder room but prefer countryFrench Remove the door to the vanity Strip the finish from the cabinet Paint in French blue yellow or melon Hang a gathered French fabric in place of the door Pull one favorite color from the fabric and use for wall paint Questions I adore color but my rooms are small What can I do in choosing window coverings lighting and furniture that will ensure my use of color will not make the rooms look smaller A small but effective trick I use is staying monochromatic Do not allow a color from the smallest lampshade to the largest window treatment to jump out at you Julee I have a small budget to update my bedroom What can I skimp on and what should be an investment Invest in the finest rugs art and furniture your budget allows Now go and have fun with linens Theyre always affordable so one can have many different looks and not break the bank Even though its only January I am ready to decorate for spring What do you recommend Nothing says spring like flowers and pastel colors Choose bedding in a floral pattern like daisies that complements your existing color scheme Hang lightweight gauzy window treatments in lace or a sheer material too and arrange a vase or basket of freshcut flowers The light colors and sunshine will warm any room even in the middle of winter Time has run out again I enjoyed

<13181692.1075861085697.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,domestications@domestications.com,2002-02-06 13:36:36,Naturally Romantic RoomsRomantic hideaways need not be lacy and frilly A perfect example is the Ice House This is possibly the most unusual yet delightfully romantic hotel in the world Whats so special about it Its made entirely from ice The floor Made of ice The ceiling Ice But the bed You got it ice Top to bottom total ice The Ice House which has several rooms is comfortably warm though I wouldnt recommend going barefoot Guest accommodations are nice and cozy with oversized plush comforters keeping visitors toasty throughout the night Dozens of candles are the only source of light Theyre everywhere small ones peak out of icy nooks and tall ones stand at attention on the floor They reflect off the surrounding ice creating a surreal effect And even though the light comes from open flame no the ceiling doesnt drip on you Though a weekend of winter whimsy may be romantic to some others idea of a romantic getaway involves warm ocean breezes In Bali its not rare for private villas to be completely open to the soothing winds Guests drift to sleep with a majestic starlit sky for a ceiling and the soothing sound of waves breaking against the beach to lull them into dreamland If the warm breezes and sounds of the ocean are still not romantic enough guests can order all their meals in or in this case is it out Regardless of which dream hideaway you prefer a sanctuary that provides total tranquillity and allows us to forget our real lives is the perfect romantic setting Though you can spend a lot of time and money creating your own romantic hideaway there really is no set price tag for creating a personal retreat It can cost next to nothing and you can create it in your own home Whats your most romantic room typically the bedroom Not romantic enough Critique it Whats right Whats wrong The room definitely needs some thought and a theme Without a theme we tend to wander lose focus and end up with a hodgepodge Then think back to all the romantic locations youve ever visited or wanted to visit What was it that lingered in your mind and tugged at your heart Then ponder is there anything like that I can bring into my life To start begin with a favorite fabric and an exquisite bed or chair and expand from there ingredient by ingredient Dont be afraid to bring in fantasy Yes fantasy can be in good taste classic but with a sense of romance Done correctly no one will know exactly what your theme or inspirations were Stay subtle dont let the room or any part of it scream at you This way youll find that you will probably enjoy it for years to come Remember above all have fun Tips By Julee Tip Bored with winter Invite a friend over how about your spouse for a traditional afternoon tea Prepare English tea sandwiches made from watercress egg salad and cucumber and serve freshlybaked scones topped with Devonshire cream and preserves Serve with black tea capful of vanilla or Jasmine tea Entertaining a friend with children Serve young ones hot chocolate scones and sandwiches of Nutella and bananas yum or ham and cheese Tip Sunny windows destroy fabric and fade paint Remedy Keep the view while protecting your furnishings from harmful UV rays Have glass film applied to your windows There are several choices for degrees of darkness and color Survey says People are raving about it Tip A room with no windows Create an illusion with a pair of French doors Attach them to the wall with gathered fabric hanging behind Build window seats on either side with a walltowall mirror above each seat Then paint the walls a light and glossy color to give the room a light and airy feel Questions to Julee Could you tell me the formula used for lamp lighting How high should the lamp be on a table beside a sofa On a bedside table Which is better for reading a floor lamp with the illumination coming from the top like a torchiere or from below with a traditional shade It is unwise to apply a diehard rule or formula because the styles of the lamp the table and the sofa or chairs all contribute to the total picture Plus there is more than just function involved Common sense tells us to be sure the reading light as opposed to general or accent lighting is intense and focused on your reading material not on your face Try out a few lamps until you find one that works Ideally a threeway light is most functional One turn of the switch shoots general light to the ceiling another turn directs light down and a third even brighter allows for tasks These are often torchieres I love the natural looking tortoiseshell or matchstick blinds Ive been seeing However my drapes are floral and are hung from a pewter rod Are they a good match or are the blinds too rustic for my existing dcor Yes it is possible to combine tortoiseshell blinds with fabric Two successful examples would include a a patterned fabric in a larger scale than the tortoise but in the same tone not darker or lighter colors or b a solid fabric no obvious pattern but very textured nubby with any color from a natural pallet I have adjacent rooms and would like to paint one red and the other blue Would this interrupt the flow What do you recommend for accessories and window coverings so these spaces which open to one another work well First be certain that your blue and red paints are from the same season For example dont use a winter red with a spring blue Next pick a neutral color that goes well in both rooms Add a little red into the blue room and blue into the red room and use the neutral color in both When adding the neutral and the opposing colors to the main color remember to keep their use minimal Their purpose is as accent colors and they should be used only in trims borders frames linens or accessories The red room should remain primarily a red room Send your decorating questions to me at We at Domestications wish you and yours a romantic

consummate party giver We were recently invited t o a formal affair at her home on the banks of the Hudson River She had painstakingly prepared for her annual gala but fell ill just before the guests were to arrive She was so ill she went upstairs fully dressed never to return without having greeted a single guest The party had been in the planning for months The sprawling home was fully decorated The sitdown dinner for guests was elaborate Three incredib le appetizers fabulous assorted salads rack of lamb and individual choco late mousse cakes were to be served We all inquired about our hostesss health but a guest who happened to be a doctor checked on her and concluded that though it was nothing serious she was too ill to come down Our hostess however asked that her door be kept

about eight years old and lived in a white clapboard house with a pre tty green lawn at Douglas Avenue One spring day my best friends and I were sitting on the lawn with some cookies when we spotted Buzzy Gerard who lived cattycorner to me Buzzy was setting up his lemonade productas pproductDDzzdeptFidDparentnameDTabletopfeaturename DcodeDDOMEMAILAHTMLmacsDDBNEWSA stand It was his sprin gtime thing It wouldnt matter much and I certainly wouldnt be rememberi ng this now except for the fact that Buzzy and I were great competitors W hat began with entertaining my friends that afternoon turned into enterpris e Now as we all know summer is the traditional season for a lemonade stand and of course it did begin as a summer idea until Buzzy moved his setup d ate from June to May forcing me in turn to put my little red wagon out in April Buzzy was quite polished organized and more than a little vocal when he s aw someone coming Frankly the only thing that extended the life of my bus iness was my mothers idea to include oatmeal cookies with my watereddown lemonade as Buzzy adamantly stuck to his lemonadeonly policy However this vicious competitors established reputation and aggressive ap proach eventually led to me caving in I didnt mind that he proved victori ous I decided it was much more fun sitting on the front lawn with the girl s giggling entertaining ourselves with cookies lemonade and a frontrow seat as Buzzy trapped every car bicycle and occasional pedestrian who ente red his victim zone Whether your entertaining is formal with kings or relaxed with the kids on your street I imagine its really somewhere in between the first step i s to send out the invitations Sending the invitations first will make you realize the show must go on Keeping your entertaining simple light and casual is a great way to start People will be more inclined to return the invitation when theyre not so intimidated Here are a few easytoimplement party ideas to get you started Pick a theme This will make your selection of invitations dcor and men u much easier Engage your guests Specify a dress code that complements your theme like Chinese New Year This will energize your guests before
