<32423516.1075856788371.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,clayton.vernon@enron.com,1999-12-16 05:59:00,and Vasant Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany Capacity Trader at the East Desk related to gas transmission Typically pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis An example might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn where you might pay per month per decatherms of capacity per day a fixed payment Variable charges are for fuel costs shrinkage and for overhead expenses A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX basis and might call Brooklyn and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX The traders spread is and variable costs of transmission are so the trader would offer the leaseholder of capacity up to for firm capacity tomorrow As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible the leaseholders have an excellent knowledge of the firmequivalent of interruptible capacity Also many pipelines dont discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum its not worth their time to haggle There is a further issue of secondary markets not important to the model yet For South Texas and Brooklyn there are several different routes the gas can physically take pipelines of Enron Texas Eastern etc And once the trade is in the system traders can cover the Enron positions on each end of the pipeline in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts Clayton
