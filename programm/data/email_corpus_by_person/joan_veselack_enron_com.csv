the deals the volumes of the deals and the term which I can get from John Singer Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package Im assuming that if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the TAGG people meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point which it sounds like we did they were probably not included in the Wholesale package If this is the case then the deals are not really ours and are presumably CES Retail If CESRetail does not want the deals then we will value the transactions get together and discuss the best way to handle them ie us or EES then propose a transfer of the deals to Enron In summary if you can get the information noted above to me Ill take it from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or not Thanks Joan NRON PM To Katherine L CT Colleen CT cc Chris CT Wade R CT Victor CT Robert CT Joann NRON Subject Citygate Production GAS behind TCO PLEASE READ Kathy we may need Colleen Sullivans interpretation of behind the citygate production Back in January Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES Retail John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron If these deals stay with Enron should they be at EES since they are behind the citygate or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for CES This could be a can of worms Colleen what is the contract interruption Does the citygate production deals stay with Enron If they stay with Enron then does CES realize this Are the producers receiving two payments one from Enron and one from CES Maybe this has already be discussed and decided but I havent heard the official word Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate delivery that CES needs The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to Enron are reduced by the production I think Chris put these buysells in the system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole Currently the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply The pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to the market demand tickets but the market demand numbers need to be increased Then you could eliminate the buysell tickets that Chris Germany has been creating However if this production gas is not Enrons then Enron is creating a lot of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments From Katherine L Kelly ECT AM To Joan NRON Robert CT cc Wade R CT Subject Re CES Pool Gas Hey guys I wanted yall to see the below messages as well since these are TCO deals Im little confused now because Wade had informed me that these were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points We found a few like this on CNG last week The way we have been handling this is to show a buy from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buysell with CES retail Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail but right now hes priorities are just a bit different I guess why Im a little confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPAs Wade Do you know whether deal is pool or a citygate deal If its pool I dont know how we could have missed this all month because we would have had to nominate it in Navigator Joanie Do you have any insight into this Forwarded by Katherine L KellyHOUECT on AM From Katherine L Kelly AM To Wade R CT cc Robert CT Subject Re CES Pool Gas Im sorry Wade but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower around here Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail so he needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them My hands are kind of tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end Also I will try to follow up on these but since these are TCO

NRON Steve CT Subject Re Citygate Production GAS behind TCO PLEASE READ In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the Wholesale package I need to know who the producers are for each of the deals the volumes of the deals and the term which I can get from John Singer Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package Im assuming that if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the TAGG people meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point which it sounds like we did they were probably not included in the Wholesale package If this is the case then the deals are not really ours and are presumably CES Retail If CESRetail does not want the deals then we will value the transactions get together and discuss the best way to handle them ie us or EES then propose a transfer of the deals to Enron In summary if you can get the information noted

NRON Subject Citygate Production GAS behind TCO PLEASE READ Kathy we may need Colleen Sullivans interpretation of behind the citygate production Back in January Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES Retail John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron If these deals stay with Enron should they be at EES since they are behind the citygate or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for CES This could be a can of worms Colleen what is the contract interruption Does the citygate production deals stay with Enron If they stay with Enron then does CES realize this Are the producers receiving two payments one from Enron and one from CES Maybe this has already be discussed and decided but I havent heard the official word Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate delivery that CES needs The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to Enron are reduced by the production I think Chris put these buysells in the system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole Currently the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply The pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to the market demand tickets but the market demand numbers need to be increased Then you could eliminate the buysell tickets that Chris Germany has been creating However if

citygate that John Singer had been doing and that CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points We found a few like this on CNG last week The way we have been handling this is to show a buy from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buysell with CES retail Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail but right now hes priorities are just a bit different I guess why Im a little confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPAs Wade Do you know whether deal is pool or a citygate deal If
