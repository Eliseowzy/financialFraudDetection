Jones Capital cushion fight The Economist OTHER Players Await Forint Swaps Options Derivatives Week BIS Development Of Credit Risk Mkt An Enormous Benefit Dow Jones June By Henry J Pulizzi BASEL Dow Jones The Bank for International Settlements said Monday that the development of new techniques to transfer credit risk may be the most important new financial trend with possible implications for financial stability The BIS said a more developed market for credit risk will improve risk management and allow participants to set appropriate prices for accepting credit risk This will be of enormous perhaps revolutionary benefit the BIS said in its annual report Credit derivatives are said to be the fastest growing segment of the overthecounter derivatives markets The complex instruments let investors trade and hedge credit risk outside of the loans in which the risk is embedded They allow lenders to lay off credit risk while keeping assets on their balance sheets and give investors exposure to credit without a position in the actual debt A recent Goldman Sachs report put the notional value of the credit derivatives market at about trillion The BIS cautioned however that the development of a more active market for credit risk could give rise to supervisory problems by making the distribution of risk less transparent and possibly concentrating risk among market participants The BIS also raised concern about insurance companies becoming increasingly involved in credit risk markets This implies the need for ever closer collaboration between banking and insurance supervisors to prevent the possible growth of regulatory arbitrage and to ensure that risks are monitored and priced correctly the BIS said Capital cushion fight The Economist June INTERNATIONAL banks and their regulators are wrangling over the level of additional capital that banks should be made to carry as a cushion against socalled operational risk that might damage a banks health or even the financial system Operational risk includes anything from computer failure and postal strikes to fraud and cockups of Baringstyle proportions Insurance companies which you might think would steer well clear of this debate have joined the fray offering to replace bank capital with newfangled insurance cover They were in Washington this week trying to sell the idea to bank regulators from the Group of Ten countries Under present rules banks carry capital against the credit and market risks that they run Bold proposals by the Basel Committee of bank supervisors now seek to refine the charges for credit risk as well as to add new charges for operational risk The banks responses to Basel which had to be in by May st are almost all critical of the proposals for operational risk Few agree even with the committees definition of such risk the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events Many dispute the inclusion of indirect loss since it is so hard to quantify Some say that strategic and reputational risks should be added And that is just for starters before even getting to the level of charges The committee has suggested that operational risk should account for roughly of a banks regulatory capital Since it has also said that the overall capital charge should stay about the same banks have been looking for a reduction in charges for credit risk In vain Hong Kong complains that its banks will face a capital charge percentage points higher if the Basel proposals are applied in their crudest form with most of the increase being for operational risk Privately regulators agree that the figure is too high and will come down but by less than the banks would like The horsetrading can be followed on the Basel Committees where many bank responses are posted The banks biggest beef with the charge for operational risk is that the levels by the most basic method are set according to a banks gross income What kind of incentive is it that rewards banks for reducing their income The proposal offers three further levels of sophistication in measuring operational risk all of which the banks find either flawed or too complex A standardised approach would rely on industrywide loss data divided by business lines such as corporate finance trading or retail banking providing a standard factor by which a banks volume or gross income in that business would be multiplied to arrive at a capital charge Then there is an internal measurement approach using a banks own loss data multiplied by a formula for expected loss and by a factor for how the supervisor rates the banks risk controls Finally there is a loss distribution approach which allows the bank to use its own probability analysis although neither supervisors nor banks think the technique can be used yet The big problem is insufficient data There are plenty on socalled expected losses such as predictable levels of creditcard abuse failed trades even petty fraud But the aim of the charge for operational risk is to cover the unexpected such as a bomb blast or big losses by a rogue trader How many events like that have there been over the past decade How statistically relevant is a decadeold event All the same data collection and datapooling are going ahead There are even some commercial databases on offer One comes from NetRisk It is based on data that Bankers Trust an American bank now owned by Deutsche Bank began to collect in That is being added to by the MORE consortium a joint effort by a dozen big banks and by PricewaterhouseCoopers an accounting firm The other offering comes from a subsidiary of Zurich Insurance called Zurich IC Squared which offers a tenyear database online The source of its early data is once again Bankers Trust Supervisors find themselves using the same data too Banks worry that some operational risk will be doublecounted as credit or market events for example bad documentation that leads to credit failure There is also a debate about where to put reputation risk since a blow to reputation can sink a bank The regulators exclude reputation risk says an insurer because it happens slowly and a bank can be unwound or sold as in the case of NatWest a British bank sold to Royal Bank of Scotland The debate on this and other topics could run for years the banks certainly want more time for consultation Yet deadlines loom A framework for Basel and its equivalent in the European Union a draft capitaladequacy directive is meant to be ready by the end of the year in order to be implemented in Banks and supervisors will need at least that time to prepare themselves once they know what to prepare for A debate with the insurance industry has only just got serious Insurers do not normally lobby together but two lobby groups BAIWG and PCIIWG do not ask what they stand for are presenting bank regulators with ideas for lightening the capital charge that banks must bear for operational risk Big chunks of banks operational risk such as professional liability and computer fraud are already insured Regulators agree that this already merits some offset against a capital charge If insurers can concoct insurance cover for a wider range of risks then the capital offset would be bigger For that to happen regulators want to be satisfied that there would be immediate payouts not a hallmark of insurers and that there would be legal certainty with no weasel clauses to let insurers off the hook Insurers must be satisfied that they will not be left as a lender of last resort in a systemic crisis At the discussions in Washington the very definition of operational risk was still a stickingpoint On the fringes but maybe destined some time to take centre stage are ideas to let the market impose discipline on the banks at least as far as operational risk is concerned Catastrophe bonds linked to earthquake and storm risk have been sold to investors and so has contingent capital in the form of callable equity Adriana Cronin of Blanch Crawley Warren an insurancebroking firm would like to see an opbond based on a portfolio of operational risk covering the combined risks for a number of banks Rating agencies would be needed to analyse and rate the portfolio backing the bond Most insurers think a capitalmarkets solution for operational risk is a distant goal The nearer one is to bring their centuries of actuarial skills to bear to help banks save capital and so to tap a rich new market of potentially banks

Derivatives Wall Street Journal LATIN AMERICA WORLD NEWS Brazils weakness set for some time Financial Times OPERATIONS Bank of New York demands backup links from customers Financial Times RISK MANAGEMENT DTCC seeks to address post Sept oprisk concerns Risk News Regulators Seek More Data About Credit Derivatives Dow Jones Newswire WASHINGTONUS bank regulators saying the notional amount of credit derivatives at banks has increased more than sixfold since from billion to billion are proposing new reporting requirements on credit derivatives The requirements focus on what are known as bank call reports which banks file with the federal bank regulatory agencies each quarter these are used to monitor the condition and risk profile of reporting banks and the industry as a whole In a joint notice the Federal Reserve Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said tile new Items proposed to be added to call reports should result in a minimal additional reporting burden for affected banks WORLD NEWS Brazils weakness set for some time Financial Times Oct By Raymond Colitt in Sao Paulo Brazils financial markets have recovered this week halting at least temporarily the downward spiral of the Real But few analysts support the governments hopes of asustained currency recovery that would allow interest rates to come down and economic growth to resume With a tighter monetary policy and somewhat brighter shortterm prospects after elections in neighbouring Argentina the Brazilian portion of the JP Morgans EMBI emerging markets bond index has narrowed by basis points since October By midweek the Real had recovered to RDollars up per cent against the dollar from its postattack low Future interest rates also came down by more than basis points this week The Real had depreciated per cent against the dollar since the beginning of the year raising concerns about the countrys inflation target and credit outlook However the currency weakness is here to stay says Marcelo Carvalho chief economist with JP Morgan Chase the investment bank in Sao Paulo The fundamental problems of the Brazilian economy have not changed and the market outlook remains uncertain Indeed a consensus forecast published by the central bank sees the currency at RDollars against the dollar at the end of this year and at RDollars by the end of next year A sustained currency weakness implies higher inflation and a larger nominal budget deficit and subsequently slower economic growth says Mr Carvalho JP Morgan Chase foresees GDP growth next year of only per cent compared to the market consensus of per cent next year Brazils principal problem is its dependence on international capital markets and direct foreign investment to finance a current account deficit estimated at USDollars bn this year the largest of any emerging market Total external financing requirements are estimated at just under USDollars bn next year a tall order at a time of a global downturn and heightened risk aversion towards emerging markets Earlier this month the economic authorities issued more dollarlinked debt increased obligatory bank deposits and reformed corporate reporting rules designed to reduce the need for currency hedging The economic slowdown these measures helped to trigger will help improve the countrys trade balance by driving down imports As a result the market expects the current account deficit to fall from Dollars bn this year to Dollars bn next year The domestic slowdown has also helped to dampen inflationary pressure caused by the currency depreciation On Wednesday the central bank decided to maintain its prime interest rate at per cent with a neutral bias Yet more action to tighten monetary policy such as a further increase of bank deposit requirements may be necessary given the ongoing threat of an Argentine default an escalation of the USled war on terrorism and political noise ahead of Brazils presidential elections next year Bank of New York demands backup links from customers By Joshua Chaffin in New York The Bank of New York will require some customers to have backup communications links to its securities processing operations and will more closely inspect its vendors technology and communications capabilities to ensure they function in the event of disaster Thomas Renyi chief executive announced the changes on Thursday when discussing the banks third quarter earnings which suffered more than expected from the September attacks BoNY which specialises in securities processing was one of the Wall Street firms hardest hit by the attacks More than a month later it is still struggling to reconcile trades that clients executed after September As a result its disaster recovery plans have been among the most scrutinised by the financial services industry as it tries to prepare for future disasters BoNY executives had contended that much of the disruption was due to damaged telecommunications lines Mr Renyi reiterated Wall Streets newfound appreciation of how important telecommunications are to the smooth operation of the capital markets But he also pointed to problems with computer and communications systems at BoNYs vendors that may have hindered the banks recovery Some of the things just didnt work as billed by our vendors he said Mr Renyi also said that he and other Wall Street executives would reevaluate the practice of outsourcing large volumes of business to a small number of companies His comments are notable because BoNY has aggressively promoted itself to customers as a single provider for all backoffice needs from trade processing to accounting Overall losses from the disaster cut BoNYs thirdquarter earnings by onethird from last years levels to m or cents a share BoNY pointed out that excluding the disaster earnings rose per cent from last year BoNY recorded a m charge related to the disaster This covers a variety of expenses from renting office space in midtown Manhattan to buying computers BoNY estimated it lost about m in fees from the closure of the markets and problems with its automatic teller machines and paid about m to compensate customers for trades that failed or were slow However it expected that a substantial amount would be covered by insurance DTCC seeks to address post Sept oprisk concerns By Gallagher Polyn October The Depository Trust Clearing Corporation DTCC the worlds largest clearing company has seized the initiative to address the issue of systemic operational risk concerns raised in the aftermath of the US terrorist attacks of September DTCC chairman and chief executive Jill Considine held the first in a series of discussions with representatives of the Securities Exchange Commission the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York yesterday to address operational risks exposed by the attacks on the World Trade Center In a speech to the Bond Market Association in New York prior to the meeting Considine said the major systemic risk posed by the September attack stemmed from overcentralisation of physical assets people and facilities related to financial markets in New York Bond market settlement banks the New York telephone carrier Verizons network in lower Manhattan and numerous market makers on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE and Nasdaq were briefly incapacitated by the attack US fixedincome markets did not resume trading until September while trading on NYSE and Nasdaq did not resume until September The Bank of New York a large custodian and securities settlement bank had major problems paying out funds due to failed communications lines with some market sources indicating that Bank of New Yorks payments backlog reached billion on Thursday September leaving a number of large European institutions with large overdrafts with other banks After a breather from weeks of intensive recovery efforts by US regulatory authorities subsequent to the attack Considine said the DTCC would look to take a leadership role in helping the US financial industry adopt new best practices to manage the newly exposed risks Comments made by Considine during her speech suggested the DTCC would hold discussions with regulators brokerdealers electronic trading network service providers clearing houses and even public utilities like phone companies Asked whether new awareness of the risks stemming from spatial concentration would result in calls to disperse financial market operations over wider areas Considine said I think people are looking at that very seriously But it was unclear whether Considine was referring to regulatory authorities Neither the SEC nor the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have yet issued any new regulations related to the attacks though impact assessment is ongoing spokespersons for the two organisations said The DTCC is the worlds largest posttrade infrastructure organisation providing clearance settlement and custody
