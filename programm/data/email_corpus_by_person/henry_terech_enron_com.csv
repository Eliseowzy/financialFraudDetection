which occurred the past hours and the steps taken to mitigate the damage and risk Enron Center North Smith As a result of the flooding downtown approximately six skyscrapers had their electrical vaults flooded and began to cause cascading problemd in the electrical grid downtown The net result was the loss of one of the two kv circuits which serve Smith We engineers EES Maint electrical subs believe at the time the circuits blew we shifted from three phase to single phase power which caused an imbalance in the load to the building Consequently UPS C which serves a portion of the Lv Data Ctr the Rolm phone switch and a protion of the Traders floors lost a circuitboard and blew two internal fuses This power degradation caused PDU S on Lv to trip its main breaker and shutdown power load to servers and equipment on this PDU This occurred shortly after Noon on Saturday ResponseRestoration UPS D transferred load from UPS C as the N back up and carried the full load of the UPS loss as designed EPSCelectrical sub Henderson Electric EES Maint IT worked together to power down systems to begin repair work by pm Saturday EPSCEES Maint coordinated with PillarHenderson Elec to obtain replacement parts and begin the repairs By pm all repairs to UPSC had been made and the system bought back on line As a measure of extra protection the back up genset for Enron Ctr North was in operation Reliant Energy restored the circuit at approximately pm Saturday evening EPSCEES Maint and subs conducted a thorough review of all electrical and back up systems Saturday evening Enron Network IT Operations began restoration of all affected systems Saturday evening EPSCEES Maint obtained diesel fuel and topped off all gensets Saturday in case of additional problems and due to fuel consumption during the outage Other Building damage was limited to flooding in the tunnels and water damageflooding to portions of the Body Shop on Lv B Enron Center South Louisiana ImpactDamage Summary Levels received very limited amounts of water from the core area elevator shafts and exterior curtainwall There was no exposure to water on any systems or network cabling during the entire period Response Crews contained and cleaned all water as it traced into the building ALL IDF closets on Lvs Traders Floors remained dry throughout the duration of the rainsflooding on Friday Saturday Lv received some water from Lv Response The area was contained and cleaned No additional damage beyond Tuesday evenings flooding occurred Due to extreme street flooding and water pressure a sanitary sewer line tied into ECS burst on Friday evening causing extensive flooding of Lv B area approximately inches of water in the basement Response Clark Way Engr was able to install a temporary plug in the line to stop the on going flood waters from penetrating the basement Clean up has continued throughout the weekend Due to the extreme flooding and water pressure the water seal of the Reliant Vault burst early Saturday and flooded the electrical vault room with of water This resulted in a complete loss of power at approximately pm on Staurday afternoon The back up systems engaged and operated per design to support the Data Ctr and Traders Floors The temporary cooling tower went off line Prior to the flooding Clark had been in the process of tieing in the temporary feed into the back up system by in prep for the migration Response Clark used back up water pumps to pump out and clean the Reliant electrical vault as well as maintained operation of the back up systems The Data Ctr AHUs were kept on line with the dehumidifiersblowers to modulate the airflow in the Data Ctr EPSC had Way Engr techs use temphumidity probes to monitor the areas The recordings indicated temps on

Reliant gear on line We are still operating all systems safely on the back up sytems for the past hours It is expected Relaint will be complete by am Clark the engineers and MEP subs shall be conducting a thorough system review and repirs as required of all systems throughout the building during the coming week In summary the back up systems in both facilities did engage and operate as
