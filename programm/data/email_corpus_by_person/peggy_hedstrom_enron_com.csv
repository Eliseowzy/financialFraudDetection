<5271946.1075855788331.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,peggy.hedstrom@enron.com,2000-07-20 02:49:00,Re Financial Confirm NPfor your prompt response I really hope that you can convince Mark Taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right thing to do As you recall we have been down the road of improving the service to Calgary previously This seems to work in the short term but as soon as there is turnover in the group which unfortunately seems to occurs regularly the service level starts to drop I would like you to consider the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary when you meet with Mark First when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial confirmations to Calgary Mark Taylors concern was our legal staff At that time we had one attorney who did not have expertise in the financial area We now have three very competent attorneys Greg Johnston has spent time in Houston and has recently attended an ISDA training course Second there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by Houston and with the process itself At the time of the Project Doorstep audit we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent out after we had approved them As you saw from my memo confirmations are periodically sent out without our review Also we have found mistakes in the confirmations themselves including the contract date referred to in the confirmation The first two issues cause me a lot of concern Some of the confirmations sent out without our review were wrong which is a big problem We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out which is even a bigger problem Third there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston generate the confirmations If you think about what the process is the transactions are done in Calgary we fax the deal sheets to Houston the confirmation is generated using a template that has been preapproved by legal we review and approve the confirmation and execute them online if done by Enron Canada Corp or send an email if the Enron Entity is Enron North America Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty If the counterparty is a trading company Houston follows up on the status of execution For all other entities the Calgary office is now doing the followup All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary office If the transactions were done in Calgary we would be using the same preapproved templates that Houston is using It is not clear to me where there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston or conversely why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare our own financial confirmations If there is some perception that an element of risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations why are we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations Fourth there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in Houston while the review process is done in Calgary Currently Houston has staff handling the Calgary transactions Because the confirmations are reviewed and approved here I have similar staff who print the confirmations route them for review update TAGG notify Houston when the review is complete and then followup with either Houston or the counterparty on issues or execution We are currently following up on all nontrading company financial confirmations So we are both printing and reviewing the transactions following up with the counterparties and filing these documents As I stated before Calgary could assume full responsibility for the financial confirmations without adding any staff Fifth there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth the confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within hours of the transaction being done We feel this time line could be met if we did the financial confirmations here This reduces risk for Enron Finally because we are a small office I need the opportunity to develop my existing employees so that they dont feel that they need to leave the company in order to broaden their knowledge base Given the skill sets of the documentation group it is difficult for them to move into other areas such as risk logistics or accounting so it is important that I am able to keep them challenged within the documentation group Because we review the confirmations the basic understanding of the financial transactions already exists However I know that my employees would appreciate having full accountability and responsibility for this function and have the opportunity to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations As a final note I report to you I am fully accountable to you for ensuring that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function properly It would mean a lot to me as well as the documentation staff to get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this function to Calgary Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff yet I get the impression that he doesnt think we are capable of handling this function I hope that you will be able to set him straight on this He just needs to look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that exists here If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in this memo please let me know As you can see the Calgary office feels very strongly about this issue including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane Please let me know how your meeting with Mark goes Thanks Peggy Enron North America Corp From Sally Beck PM To Peggy CT cc Subject Re Financial Confirm NP I got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in the office on Friday he has been in New York re MG since Monday night Together we will do two things devise a foolproof plan to insure an excellent level of service to Calgary starting immediately and work with Mark Taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation preparation to Calgary and to eliminate his concerns We will keep you posted on both items Sally Peggy Hedstrom PM To Sally CT cc Subject Re Financial Confirm NP Just so that you are aware we continue to have problems with the financial confirm process from Houston On more than one occasion confirmations have been sent to our counterparties prior to review by Calgary Attached is

<32575149.1075855840611.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,peggy.hedstrom@enron.com,2000-07-20 02:49:00,Re Financial Confirm NPfor your prompt response I really hope that you can convince Mark Taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right thing to do As you recall we have been down the road of improving the service to Calgary previously This seems to work in the short term but as soon as there is turnover in the group which unfortunately seems to occurs regularly the service level starts to drop I would like you to consider the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary when you meet with Mark First when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial confirmations to Calgary Mark Taylors concern was our legal staff At that time we had one attorney who did not have expertise in the financial area We now have three very competent attorneys Greg Johnston has spent time in Houston and has recently attended an ISDA training course Second there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by Houston and with the process itself At the time of the Project Doorstep audit we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent out after we had approved them As you saw from my memo confirmations are periodically sent out without our review Also we have found mistakes in the confirmations themselves including the contract date referred to in the confirmation The first two issues cause me a lot of concern Some of the confirmations sent out without our review were wrong which is a big problem We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out which is even a bigger problem Third there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston generate the confirmations If you think about what the process is the transactions are done in Calgary we fax the deal sheets to Houston the confirmation is generated using a template that has been preapproved by legal we review and approve the confirmation and execute them online if done by Enron Canada Corp or send an email if the Enron Entity is Enron North America Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty If the counterparty is a trading company Houston follows up on the status of execution For all other entities the Calgary office is now doing the followup All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary office If the transactions were done in Calgary we would be using the same preapproved templates that Houston is using It is not clear to me where there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston or conversely why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare our own financial confirmations If there is some perception that an element of risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations why are we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations Fourth there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in Houston while the review process is done in Calgary Currently Houston has staff handling the Calgary transactions Because the confirmations are reviewed and approved here I have similar staff who print the confirmations route them for review update TAGG notify Houston when the review is complete and then followup with either Houston or the counterparty on issues or execution We are currently following up on all nontrading company financial confirmations So we are both printing and reviewing the transactions following up with the counterparties and filing these documents As I stated before Calgary could assume full responsibility for the financial confirmations without adding any staff Fifth there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth the confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within hours of the transaction being done We feel this time line could be met if we did the financial confirmations here This reduces risk for Enron Finally because we are a small office I need the opportunity to develop my existing employees so that they dont feel that they need to leave the company in order to broaden their knowledge base Given the skill sets of the documentation group it is difficult for them to move into other areas such as risk logistics or accounting so it is important that I am able to keep them challenged within the documentation group Because we review the confirmations the basic understanding of the financial transactions already exists However I know that my employees would appreciate having full accountability and responsibility for this function and have the opportunity to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations As a final note I report to you I am fully accountable to you for ensuring that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function properly It would mean a lot to me as well as the documentation staff to get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this function to Calgary Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff yet I get the impression that he doesnt think we are capable of handling this function I hope that you will be able to set him straight on this He just needs to look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that exists here If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in this memo please let me know As you can see the Calgary office feels very strongly about this issue including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane Please let me know how your meeting with Mark goes Thanks Peggy Enron North America Corp From Sally Beck PM To Peggy CT cc Subject Re Financial Confirm NP I got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in the office on Friday he has been in New York re MG since Monday night Together we will do two things devise a foolproof plan to insure an excellent level of service to Calgary starting immediately and work with Mark Taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation preparation to Calgary and to eliminate his concerns We will keep you posted on both items Sally Peggy Hedstrom PM To Sally CT cc Subject Re Financial Confirm NP Just so that you are aware we continue to have problems with the financial confirm process from Houston On more than one occasion confirmations have been sent to our counterparties prior to review by Calgary Attached is the most recent one We have been assured over and over that this will not happen again however it continues to happen Luckily this confirmation went out without any errors in it I know that you are very busy but is there any way that you can make it a priority to get resolution on moving the financial confirmations to Calgary Forwarded by Peggy HedstromCALECT on PM From Larry Joe Hunter PM To

<20686735.1075855877504.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,peggy.hedstrom@enron.com,2000-07-20 02:49:00,Re Financial Confirm NPfor your prompt response I really hope that you can convince Mark Taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right thing to do As you recall we have been down the road of improving the service to Calgary previously This seems to work in the short term but as soon as there is turnover in the group which unfortunately seems to occurs regularly the service level starts to drop I would like you to consider the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary when you meet with Mark First when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial confirmations to Calgary Mark Taylors concern was our legal staff At that time we had one attorney who did not have expertise in the financial area We now have three very competent attorneys Greg Johnston has spent time in Houston and has recently attended an ISDA training course Second there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by Houston and with the process itself At the time of the Project Doorstep audit we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent out after we had approved them As you saw from my memo confirmations are periodically sent out without our review Also we have found mistakes in the confirmations themselves including the contract date referred to in the confirmation The first two issues cause me a lot of concern Some of the confirmations sent out without our review were wrong which is a big problem We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out which is even a bigger problem Third there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston generate the confirmations If you think about what the process is the transactions are done in Calgary we fax the deal sheets to Houston the confirmation is generated using a template that has been preapproved by legal we review and approve the confirmation and execute them online if done by Enron Canada Corp or send an email if the Enron Entity is Enron North America Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty If the counterparty is a trading company Houston follows up on the status of execution For all other entities the Calgary office is now doing the followup All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary office If the transactions were done in Calgary we would be using the same preapproved templates that Houston is using It is not clear to me where there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston or conversely why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare our own financial confirmations If there is some perception that an element of risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations why are we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations Fourth there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in Houston while the review process is done in Calgary Currently Houston has staff handling the Calgary transactions Because the confirmations are reviewed and approved here I have similar staff who print the confirmations route them for review update TAGG notify Houston when the review is complete and then followup with either Houston or the counterparty on issues or execution We are currently following up on all nontrading company financial confirmations So we are both printing and reviewing the transactions following up with the counterparties and filing these documents As I stated before Calgary could assume full responsibility for the financial confirmations without adding any staff Fifth there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth the confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within hours of the transaction being done We feel this time line could be met if we did the financial confirmations here This reduces risk for Enron Finally because we are a small office I need the opportunity to develop my existing employees so that they dont feel that they need to leave the company in order to broaden their knowledge base Given the skill sets of the documentation group it is difficult for them to move into other areas such as risk logistics or accounting so it is important that I am able to keep them challenged within the documentation group Because we review the confirmations the basic understanding of the financial transactions already exists However I know that my employees would appreciate having full accountability and responsibility for this function and have the opportunity to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations As a final note I report to you I am fully accountable to you for ensuring that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function properly It would mean a lot to me as well as the documentation staff to get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this function to Calgary Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff yet I get the impression that he doesnt think we are capable of handling this function I hope that you will be able to set him straight on this He just needs to look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that exists here If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in this memo please let me know As you can see the Calgary office feels very strongly about this issue including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane Please let me know how your meeting with Mark goes Thanks Peggy Enron North America Corp From Sally Beck PM To Peggy CT cc Subject Re Financial Confirm NP I got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in the office on Friday he has been in New York re MG since Monday night Together we will do two things devise a foolproof plan to insure an excellent level of service to Calgary starting immediately and work with Mark Taylor to understand his concerns over the movement of confirmation preparation to Calgary and to eliminate his concerns We will keep you posted on both items Sally Peggy Hedstrom PM To Sally CT cc Subject Re Financial Confirm NP Just so that you are aware we continue to have problems with the financial confirm process from Houston On more than one occasion confirmations have been sent to our counterparties prior to review by Calgary Attached is

be treated no differently than any other third parties when you are discussing negotiating or documenting transactions that do not concern them It is Enron Canada Corps intention to be cooperative and

the appropriate things to ensure that our rights and interests are protected while being as cooperative as possible I want to emphasize the Enron Canada Corp believes any claim made by or through Industry Canada is without merit and the steps we have taken should only be viewed as prudent and not as any indication of any liability by Enron Canada Corp Regards Peter

CcWebb Jay Burchfield Richard Beck Sally Piper Greg Kitchen Lo uise Hedstrom Peggy Koehler Anne C Redmond Brian SubjectIT Back Office Service Agreements Enron North America and Enron Canada are still providing IT and Back Office Services to several parties Beth has expressed some concerns about the e states ability to be able to support a production trading environment onc e a split of applications and hardware is made between NETCO and the estate Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these services agreements Here are some suggestions Peggy Hedstrom in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Ser vices agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity Bridgeline which is a JV in which ENA owns a interest currently has n o way that they can support themselves They are totally dependent on Enro n for everything from email internet network services and office applicat ions as well as trading risk and back office applications If there are c oncerns about the estates ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in Enrons best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO AEPHPL is more of a stand alone operation They have their own infrastruc ture in place and currently provide for their own email and office support services They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA sy stem and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our Pipeline Operations system If we sell them our version of PGAS to support their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications into their own Trade Blotter Open Link Financials and Altra Their goal w as to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year Given all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and sugges t that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP That way if the estate defaults on the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information fro m one system to another until they have put in their own integration betwee n the applications listed above Please let me know if you

Regan M Hillier Bob CcWebb Jay Perlman Beth SubjectIntegration Test Planning Coordination Mtg Summary Key Planning Assumptions Jan go live New Co Conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by Jan This assumes all major production data setup users rights books global data is completed and tested on a per application basis Some co de changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ens ure the applications still talk to each other Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactio ns from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that app lications and interfaces still work We will not be testing functional perm utations data conditions validation or exceptions to any significant degr ee Each application conversion team must test their changes before approvin g their changes for integration testing We are operating from the premise that data infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a applicatio n system level before the enterprise integration test starts All systems will be physically split even Unify at this point Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Es tate and New Co We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and ex ecution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conve rsion and test team purposes There are two teams Conversion and Integrat ion Test Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co Resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co co nversion work can begin in earnest Estate conversion is on the critical pa th for New Co Key Issues We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial tradi ng first then physical If financial is the focus delivery risk goes down dramatically For now we must plan on the worst case physical and fina ncial on Jan We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support A EP and Bridgeline in Estate This means that we need a dev environment and HW gap addressed for Unify Sitara CPR TAGGERMS Conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure w ere in synch Unify servers probably cant be owned by New Co while running a single l icense of Unify Some systems are using short name instead of Duns ID as a key for coun terparties from Global The Global TAGG ERMS Unify and SAP reps must qu ickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizin g hard coded reference id risks We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates We must focus on core systems with only core changes requi red to support day one trading We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP Bridgeline cons
