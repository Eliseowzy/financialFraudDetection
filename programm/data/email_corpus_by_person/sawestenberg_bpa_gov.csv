provide a short description of each line in the two tables lines including a a comparison of the differences between t he two tables either the reasons for any differences in amounts for a line description that is the same in both tables or the reason for any differences in the logic of the calculations and b a crosswalk showing how each line in each table corresponds to a variable or equation or both in section f of the GRSPs beginning on p of Attachment A to this testimony responsetext The following two tables are excerpted out of WPEBPA page lines Table Illustrating JCG Method Table Illustrating BPA Method Before beginning the comparison of the two tables it should be pointed out that the tables calculate gross augmentation costs We left out the step that calculates the net augmentation costs As a result the Total line dollar amounts M and M in the JCG table and M and M in the BPA table should all be reduced by the amount of augmentation resale revenue However since this modification will not affect the comparison requested i n the data request let us continue as if the Total line dollar amoun ts are already net of the augmentation revenue See the attachment to the data response Another item that may be confusing is the item labeled Prepurchase day rule This is the incremental cost associated with purchases made betw een the day cutoff and the day cutoff Also a crosswalk of each table showing how it corresponds to a variable or equation in section f is not possible since section f reflects the BPA method not the JCG method Perhaps an overview of BPAs perspective on the difference between the JCG method and the BPA method will be helpful JCG calculated the augmentation costs using two different cost pools one cost pool for the Slice product using the day rule and a second cost pool for all other products using the day rule The products then collected a portion of the augmentation costs associated with a specific rule When these two cost pools yield different net augmentation costs which they usually will unless all of the augmentation is purchased under the day rule the JCG method doesnt collect the actual amount of e ither of those pools from Slice or nonSlice Rather it collects a proportion of each of the cost pools In contrast to the JCG method the BPA method distributes the costs using t he day rule proportionally between the Slice and nonSlice products and then assesses all the incremental cost from using the day rule rather tha n the day rule to the nonSlice products In contrast to JCG method thi s assures that all the actual incremental net augmentation costs calculated b y replacing the day rule with the day rule are recovere d from purchasers of nonSlice power products In addition this also assures tha t purchasers of the Slice product do not bear any nearer term market prices fluctuations Now for a short description of each line in the two tables and a compariso n of the differences The example assumes that we dont actually purchase all of our augmentation that some of it is served from BPAs secondary or is bought in the spot market Prepurchase day rule is the total cost of augmentation pu rchases made at least days prior to the month of delivery This amount is M in both tables in both columns This amount represents the sum of DIURNALACA for the sixmonth period This would have represented DIURNALACAS in the GRSPs proposed by the JCG in their Direct Case Prepurchase day rule is the additional cost of prepurchase s made less than days prior to the month of delivery This amount is M in both tables in the nonSlice column The day rule prepurchases are not applicable to the Slice product thus the NA in the Slice column in both tables If Prepurchase day rule and Prepurchase day rule were summed the sum would represent DIURNALACANS in the GRSPs proposed by the customers Note that the Prepurchase day rule appears in a different row in the BPA table since BPA has proposed that these incrementa l cost enter the calculations at a different point Short position is the cost of the amount of AAMTA that is not prepurchased This is the amount that is valued at PRICE in the GRSPs In the JCG the short position is different between the Slice and nonSlice columns This is because the example has BPA purchasing some additional augmentation M worth under the day rule and there is a corresponding reduction in the value of BPAs short position The change also reflects that the short position is valued using different PRICEs for the day rule and the da y rule In the BPA example Short position is M for both Slice and nonSli ce products and the difference M is found in the row Short positio n day rule Buydown is the cost of all buydowns It is the same in both tables for both Slice and nonSlice products In the examples BPA spent M buying do wn load Total is the gross cost of augmentation As stated above it shoul d be reduced by the augmentation resale revenue To continue on let us assume that Total has been reduced by augmentation resale revenue and rep resents the net augmentation costs In the JCG example Total is M for Slice and M for nonSlice These would represent NACAS and NACANS in the GRSPs proposed by the JCG in their Direct Case In the BPA example Total is M for both Slice and nonSlice This represents NACA in the BPA GRSPs Percent of CRACable revenue is the same in both tables The exampl e shows that the Slice revenue is of the total CRACable revenue and the nonSlice revenue is of the total CRACable revenue LB CRAC Costs only appears in the BPA example It is the NACA dist ributed between Slice and nonSlice products in proportion to actual revenue Prepurchase day rule and Short position day rule are t he changes in the valuation of prepurchases M and Short position M between th e day rule and the day rule The net difference of M is equivalent to the difference that is seen in Total in the JCG example the dif ference between M and M This difference is also equivalent to NACDIFF in t he BPA GRSPs Total LB CRAC Costs is the cost that the Slice and nonSlice grou ps true up to In the JCG example the Slice product trues up to of M or M while the nonSlice products true up to of M for a total from both groups of M In BPAs example the Slice product pays of M or M the same as in the JCG example while the nonSlice products pay of M plus the net difference between valuation of net augmentation costs using the day rule and valuation using the day rule The nonSlice amount is M plus M or M The following information is from the web server Logon IUSRGRANITE

provide a short description of each line in the two tables lines including a a comparison of the differences between t he two tables either the reasons for any differences in amounts for a line description that is the same in both tables or the reason for any differences in the logic of the calculations and b a crosswalk showing how each line in each table corresponds to a variable or equation or both in section f of the GRSPs beginning on p of Attachment A to this testimony responsetext The following two tables are excerpted out of WPEBPA page lines Table Illustrating JCG Method Table Illustrating BPA Method Before beginning the comparison of the two tables it should be pointed out that the tables calculate gross augmentation costs We left out the step that calculates the net augmentation costs As a result the Total line dollar amounts M and M in the JCG table and M and M in the BPA table should all be reduced by the amount of augmentation resale revenue However since this modification will not affect the comparison requested i n the data request let us continue as if the Total line dollar amoun ts are already net of the augmentation revenue See the attachment to the data response Another item that may be confusing is the item labeled Prepurchase day rule This is the incremental cost associated with purchases made betw een the day cutoff and the day cutoff Also a crosswalk of each table showing how it corresponds to a variable or equation in section f is not possible since section f reflects the BPA method not the JCG method Perhaps an overview of BPAs perspective on the difference between the JCG method and the BPA method will be helpful JCG calculated the augmentation costs using two different cost pools one cost pool for the Slice product using the day rule and a second cost pool for all other products using the day rule The products then collected a portion of the augmentation costs associated with a specific rule When these two cost pools yield different net augmentation costs which they usually will unless all of the augmentation is purchased under the day rule the JCG method doesnt collect the actual amount of e ither of those pools from Slice or nonSlice Rather it collects a proportion of each of the cost pools In contrast to the JCG method the BPA method distributes the costs using t he day rule proportionally between the Slice and nonSlice products and then assesses all the incremental cost from using the day rule rather tha n the day rule to the nonSlice products In contrast to JCG method thi s assures that all the actual incremental net augmentation costs calculated b y replacing the day rule with the day rule are recovere d from purchasers of nonSlice power products In addition this also assures tha t purchasers of the Slice product do not bear any nearer term market prices fluctuations Now for a short description of each line in the two tables and a compariso n of the differences The example assumes that we dont actually purchase all of our augmentation that some of it is served from BPAs secondary or is bought in the spot market Prepurchase day rule is the total cost of augmentation pu rchases made at least days prior to the month of delivery This amount is M in both tables in both columns This amount represents the sum of DIURNALACA for the sixmonth period This would have represented DIURNALACAS in the GRSPs proposed by the JCG in their Direct Case Prepurchase day rule is the additional cost of prepurchase s made less than days prior to the month of delivery This amount is M in both tables in the nonSlice column The day rule prepurchases are not applicable to the Slice product thus the NA in the Slice column in both tables If Prepurchase day rule and Prepurchase day rule were summed the sum would represent DIURNALACANS in the GRSPs proposed by the customers Note that the Prepurchase day rule appears in a different row in the BPA table since BPA has proposed that these incrementa l cost enter the calculations at a different point Short position is the cost of the amount of AAMTA that is not prepurchased This is the amount that is valued at PRICE in the GRSPs In the JCG the short position is different between the Slice and nonSlice columns This is because the example has BPA purchasing some additional augmentation M worth under the day rule and there is a corresponding reduction in the value of BPAs short position The change also reflects that the short position is valued using different PRICEs for the day rule and the da y rule In the BPA example Short position is M for both Slice and nonSli ce products and the difference M is found in the row Short positio n day rule Buydown is the cost of all buydowns It is the same in both tables for both Slice and nonSlice products In the examples BPA spent M buying do wn load Total is the gross cost of augmentation As stated above it shoul d be reduced by the augmentation resale revenue To continue on let us assume that Total has been reduced by augmentation resale revenue and rep resents the net augmentation costs In the JCG example Total is M for Slice and M for nonSlice These would represent NACAS and NACANS in the GRSPs proposed by the JCG in their Direct Case In the BPA example Total is M for both Slice and nonSlice This represents NACA in the BPA GRSPs Percent of CRACable revenue is the same in both tables The exampl e shows that the Slice revenue is of the total CRACable revenue and the nonSlice revenue is of the total CRACable revenue LB CRAC Costs only appears in the BPA example It is the NACA dist ributed between Slice and nonSlice products in proportion to actual revenue Prepurchase day rule and Short position day rule are t he changes in the valuation of prepurchases M and Short position M between th e day rule and the day rule The net difference of M is equivalent to the difference that is seen in Total in the JCG example the dif ference between M and M This difference is also equivalent to NACDIFF in t he BPA GRSPs Total LB CRAC Costs is the cost that the Slice and nonSlice grou ps true up to In the JCG example the Slice product trues up to of M or M while the nonSlice products true up to of M for a total from both groups of M In BPAs example the Slice product pays of M or M the same as in the JCG example while the nonSlice products pay of M plus the net difference between valuation of net augmentation costs using the day rule and valuation using the day rule The nonSlice amount is M plus M or M The following information is from the web server Logon IUSRGRANITE
