<16679974.1075845723622.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ann.white@enron.com,2001-05-22 15:26:00,Status of AEWs projects Cc Here is an overview of what projects are active Midway Greg Krause The hot item is a Property Owners Association Agreement that will be entered into between Midway Development Company LLC MDC and CooneyMidway Groves the owner of the property on which MDC has an option to purchase The agreement will not be entered into or effective until MDC has given notice it will proceed with the project and thus we control the trigger I have asked Chris Boehler at AK to turn a redline draft that incorporates changes that Greg and I discussed last week with he and Darren Inoff David Layman at Greenburg Traurig our Florida counsel also needs to incorporate some changes now that the platting has been done Chris is to send his redline to Greg David and you David is to make his additions and then send a composite to Greg you and Chris This will probably take a week or so and then it can go to the counterparty when everyone on our side is in agreement with the changes The biggest issue we have right now is that CooneyMidway Groves wants to maintain control over the property as long as they own an interest in one of the tracts and we are not willing to allow that when we will own of the property but have less than of the vote This is because the agreement is designed to give one vote to each acre There are three tracts of which CM will own one and MDC will own but the rd tract is not alloted any votes since it must remain undeveloped land for a retention pond Chris is also working on some title commitment letters for the option we just secured from Clyde Thompson and Paul Freeman Theres no rush on those and can definitely wait until I get back Pompano Steve Krimsky Pompano has issues that are hot The infamous Developers Agreement Debbie has turned another draft and has asked that we bless it before Thursday so that she can go visit with the city attorney on Friday The hearing in Pompano is scheduled for the evening of June and you have indicated that you will attend Ill send them a note to tell them youll be there We need to have a deal worked out with the Pompano commissioners before the public meeting The thing to keep in mind here is that in Pompano unlike Deerfield the same group that will be approving our request for a zoning change is the same group we have to negotiate the developers agreement with Allegedly they will settle for MM in annual payments Ive laid a copy of the agreement Debbie has prepared on your chair In an effort to block the power plant project Broward County has drafted a proposed ordinance that will place a moratorium on the approval of any power plant air permits until the matter can be studied at length The problem is they expressly do not have the power to have any say in the air permit process That is expressly delegated to the Dept of Environmental Protection DEP However the DEP hasnt taken the clean approach and said they have NO authority but it has stated that BC is entitled to reasonable rules and regulations and DEP will let them have some permit approvals HOWEVER air permits for power plants are expressly not delegated to BC Greenburg is probably a week away from being able to give us a legal opinion on the likelihood that Broward County will be able to do something that is legally defensible Once they started looking into this it became quite the legal search because at one time BC did have the authority to pass special acts However in their special act authority was cut off but the legislature ratified all rules they had in effect at that time After that they were granted charter power to adopt have such authority as a charter county to adopt their own home rules as long as they were not inconsistent with state or federal law or the constitution In they repealed all prior acts relating to the issuance of air permits and said they would rely on their charter power to make up their own rules Problem is the DEP has expressly not given them the right to have a say in air permits for power plants Needless to say this is sticky and icky My recommendation is that we dont jump out and incur litigation costs Let us get a memo together go talk to the county attorney and show him that they dont have the right to do this The hearing on adopting this ordinance is pm on June same day as the commissioners meeting on the Developers Agreement Between now and June Debbie Orshefsky would like to talk to the attorney and to the DEP Indications are that the DEP will strongly support us as this could be a turf battle for them The county attorney may come to his senses and advise the commission that passing such an ordinance will be costly as it is unenforceable if challenged We can also ask the DEP to issue a declaratory statement and it is likely that statement would say that state law is preemptive and the ordinance is invalid This is a very very broad brush of what is a very legislative history intensive issue Debbie will be looking to you to read the memo that will come next week and agree on a strategy on going forward Deerfield Steve Krimsky Unlike Pompano where the commissioners who vote on the rezoning are the same who vote on the developers agreement in Deerfield they dont have a say over any of the approval process However to facilitate coming into the city they expect something If we can agree on the form of developers agreement then it would be substantially used in the same manner in Deerfield In Deerfield they have said they want things a payment in lieu of taxes a landscape fund to fund upkeep of a particular street which is basically an adopt a street program and is required of any new business coming into Deerfield and they want an easement to put a cellular tower on our property Ive told Steve Krimsky the latter can be a headache because if they are successful in leasing the space on the tower to third parties that creates a lot of traffic going across your property It is very doable we just need to structure it correctly Ive done several radio tower agreements and we can use those as gobys They may also want a fire service fee if we give one to Pompano Theres also lots and lots of negative publicity on a daily basis and Eric Thode is wanting to respond with an editorial in the SunSentinel Ill forward the most recent version they have been sharing amongst themselves and not we lawyers The hearing in Deerfield is June th and you may want to attend it as well Ill copy my notes for you THANK YOU for

platting has been done Chris is to send his redline to Greg David and you David is to make his additions and the n send a composite to Greg you and Chris This will probably take a week or so and then it can go to the counterparty when everyone on our side is i n agreement with the changes The biggest issue we have right now is that CooneyMidway Groves wants to maintain control over the property as long as they own an interest in one of the tracts and we are not willing to allow that when we will own of the property but have less than of the vot e This is because the agreement is designed to give one vote to each acre There are three tracts of which CM will own one and MDC will own but the rd tract is not alloted any votes since it must remain undeveloped la nd for a retention pond Chris is also working on some title commitment letters for the option we ju st secured from Clyde Thompson and Paul Freeman Theres no rush on those and can definitely wait until I get back Pompano Steve Krimsky Pompano has issues that are hot The infamous Developers Agreement Debbie has turned another draft an d has asked that we bless it before Thursday so that she can go visit with the city attorney on Friday The hearing in Pompano is scheduled for the e vening of June and you have indicated that you will attend Ill send t hem a note to tell them youll be there We need to have a deal worked out with the Pompano commissioners before the public meeting The thing to ke ep in mind here is that in Pompano unlike Deerfield the same group that w ill be approving our request for a zoning change is the same group we have to negotiate the developers agreement with Allegedly they will settle f or MM in annual payments Ive laid a copy of the agreement Debbie ha s prepared on your chair In an effort to block the power plant project Broward County has draft ed a proposed ordinance that will place a moratorium on the approval of any power plant air permits until the matter can be studied at length The pr oblem is they expressly do not have the power to have any say in the air p ermit process That is expressly delegated to the Dept of Environmental P rotection DEP However the DEP hasnt taken the clean approach and said they have NO authority but it has stated that BC is entitled to reason able rules and regulations and DEP will let them have some permit approvals HOWEVER air permits for power plants are expressly not delegated to BC Greenburg is probably a week away from being able to give us a legal opin ion on the likelihood that Broward County will be able to do something that is legally defensible Once they started looking into this it became qui te the legal search because at one time BC did have the authority to pass s pecial acts However in their special act authority was cut off but t he legislature ratified all rules they had in effect at that time After t hat they were granted charter power to adopt have such authority as a char ter county to adopt their own home rules as long as they were not inconsist ent with state or federal law or the constitution In they repealed all prior acts relating to the issuance of air permits and said they would rely on their charter power to make up their own rules Problem is the DE P has expressly not given them the right to have a say in air permits for p ower plants Needless to say this is sticky and icky My recommendation is that we dont jump out and incur litigation costs Let us get a memo to gether go talk to the county attorney and show him that they dont have th e right to do this The hearing on adopting this ordinance is pm on Ju ne same day as the commissioners meeting on the Developers Agreement Between now and June Debbie Orshefsky would like to talk to the attorn ey and to the DEP Indications are that the DEP will strongly support us a s this could be a turf battle for them The county attorney may come to hi s senses and advise the commission that passing such an ordinance will be c ostly as it is unenforceable if challenged We can also ask the DEP to iss ue a declaratory statement and it is likely that statement would say that state law is preemptive and the ordinance is invalid This is a very very broad brush of what is a very legislative history inte nsive issue Debbie will be looking to you to read the memo that will come next week and agree on a strategy on going forward Deerfield Steve Krimsky Unlike Pompano where the commissioners who vote on the rezoning are the sam e who vote on the developers agreement in Deerfield they dont have a say over any of the approval process However to facilitate coming into the city they expect something If we can agree on the form of developers ag reement then it would be substantially used in the same manner in Deerfiel d In Deerfield they have said they want things a payment in lieu of taxes a landscape fund to fund upkeep of a particular street which is bas ically an adopt a street program and is required of any new business coming into Deerfield and they want an easement to put a cellular tower on our p roperty Ive told Steve Krimsky the latter can be a headache because if t hey are successful in leasing the space on the tower to third parties that creates a lot of traffic going across your property It is very doable we just need to structure it correctly Ive done several radio tower agree ments and we can use those as gobys They may also want a fire service f ee if we give one to Pompano Theres also lots and lots of negative publ icity on a daily basis and Eric Thode is wanting to respond with an editori al in the SunSentinel Ill forward the most recent version they have bee n sharing amongst themselves and not we lawyers The hearing in Deerfield is June th and you may want to
