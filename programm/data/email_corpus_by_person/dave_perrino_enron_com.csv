Oppose FERC RTO Mandate By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow Jones Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions mandate for consolidation of powergrid assets in the region The House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERCs effort to establish a regional transmission organization or RTO The lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing the concerns which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result in cost savings for the regions consumers FERC shouldnt force an RTO on the region without first conducting a costbenefit analysis said Rep Peter DeFazio DOre who is spearheading the effort Speaking with reporters prior to Wednesdays hearing DeFazio complained that a bunch of bureaucrats at FERC are embracing the national powergrid agenda of Enron Corp ENE without assessing the costs and regardless of what it does for local reliability DeFazios complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesdays hearing The region already enjoys an open and competitive transmission network thanks to the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration according to hearing testimony expressing concern that RTO West as the RTO proposed for the region is called will cost more to implement than it will provide in benefits We are troubled that RTO West will not achieve any net benefit for enduse consumers in the Northwest the Public Power Council testified Although work is beginning on a costbenefit study we are troubled that a transmission system that has served us all well for so long will be disassembled because FERC has announced that RTOs by definition are good Regional transmission organizations may be necessary to remedy the transmission ills in other regions of the country but not in the Northwest declared a group of transmissiondependent utilities The balkanization and isolation of transmission systems that characterize most other regions is simply not present in the Northwest For this reason the economic powerside benefits of an RTO will be relatively small said a group of aluminum producers Similar costbenefit concerns have been voiced by state utility regulators in the Eastern US who oppose FERCs effort to consolidate grid assets under large RTOs in the Southeast and Northeast RTO Week FERC Chairman Pat Wood III acknowledged the complaints Thursday adding that he expected to address the concerns of regulators and industry during RTO Week Oct when the commission will hold five days of hearings on the commissions RTO mandate I think I need the decisionmakers at the table Weve had the lawyers in the suits arguing about it for eight years now Wood said at an energy community forum sponsored by Enron in Arlington Va Wood told Dow Jones Newswires following his remarks at the Enron forum that FERC answered the complaints about the lack of a costbenefit analysis at its Sept meeting The commission agreed to undertake a comprehensive analysis in support of its claim that RTOs will bring about operational efficiencies that will translate into consumer savings Wood also noted a study by Mirant Corp MIR which concluded that combining the three independent system operators in the Northeast into a single RTO would produce million in annual consumer benefits During the Enron forum Edward Meyers a regulator with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission urged Wood to seek out the input of affected state regulators Meyers noted that he is in the minority among regulators in the region in supporting the Northeast RTO gridconsolidation while most others oppose the effort as economically dangerous Arnetta McRae chairman of the Delaware Public Service Commission told Wood that her fellow state regulators arent so much opposed to grid regionalization but the lack of consultation by FERC The state regulators want an opportunity to be at the table McRae said If such a process were offered there would be a lot less opposition she predicted FERC is reaching out to address the concerns of state regulators Wood said adding that he was blindsided by the opposition among state regulators to FERCs gridconsolidation mandate Later in the day Wood told reporters that RTO Week will feature an entire hearing devoted to the concerns of state regulators At the Enron forum Wood defended the commissions RTO policy which calls for carving up the nations interconnected electricity system under the control of four or five large RTOs as necessary to jumpstart the overly long transition from regulation to competition This process needs to be goosed said Wood calling FERCs RTO orders an external catalyst to get the process moving If Im wrong Id love to find a better way around that he said

<20223395.1075858702434.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,dave.perrino@enron.com,2001-09-26 09:53:03,RE NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOsChristi The NERC statements clearly seem to indicate they feel threatened by the RTO formation process and EISB Frankly nothing stated anywhere in the attachments hasnt already been thought out and handled by the three ISOs in the East and the CAISO as well All four of these entities have fully functional backup facilities in other parts of their regions and NERC is fully aware of them I would assume ERCOT also has a fully functional redundant control scheme in place as well In the case of NY there is another site physically apart from the main control center which has a fully redundant computer and communications system They have or used to have plans which in the event neither center is available can revert control back to the TOs heaven forbid until ISO personnel can resume control of the grid So they have sets of redundancy in addition to radio and satellite communications if necessary Earlier RTO West discussions all contained similar concerns and plans for redundancy and the DSTAR preliminary design documents also plan on redundancy NERCs assertion that they would slowdown the RTO formation process is absurd geez its going too slow now Running distributed synchronized computer networks is not rocket sciencehow do the folks at NERC explain the NYSE quick recovery from a ground zero attack There was no report of crippling loss of financial informationat least that I am aware of Even a small operation like APX operates their systems using distributed computing and synchronized data For NERC to use the NIMDA virus as a specific attack on the electrical grid operation and the compromising of reliability is preposterous and the resulting service denials cited are probably refusals of tags which from what I understand the utilities probably cause much more selfinflicted havoc than this virus The press release you refer to just confirms NERCs position of maintaining status quo Should we call NERC on these statements The remarks made in these public statements seem irresponsible Kind Regards Dave

Committee Regulatory Affairs Committee NAERO Working Group FROM Scott Weiner Legislative Affairs Committee Chair Jim Steffes Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Donn Salvosa Manager of Government Affairs DATE September RE NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs The attached email in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press The statements concern NERCs view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERCs Four RTO policy set forth in its July th Order The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization particularly the possibility that NERCs responsibilities could be shifted to EISB Also attached is an article containing the views of RJ Rudden Associates Inc that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations Specifically NERC representatives informed the press that on September the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilitiesfrom an information administration standpoint They noted that this resulted in service denials although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much This event was attributed to the socalled NIMBA virus NERCs statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role theyve played not only in security matters but possibly other aspects pertaining to reliability standards They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERCs July th Order Moreover it is likely that NERC will argue that given its expertise and experience recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization EISB ill advised It is unclear what if any impact all this may have on RTO development the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Boards consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting However we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at or
