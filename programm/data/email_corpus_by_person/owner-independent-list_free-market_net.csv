Welcome to The Lighthouse the email newsletter of The Independent Institute the nonpartisan public policy research organization We provide you with updates of the Institutes current research publications events and media programs IN THIS WEEKS ISSUE Holding Bureaucrats Personally Accountable A st Amendment Victory The Independent Review Fall Issue Now Available Public Health vs The Nanny State Next Independent Policy Forum HOLDING BUREAUCRATS PERSONALLY ACCOUNTABLE A st Amendment Victory The legal doctrine of sovereign immunity and its modern cousin qualified immunity has historically allowed government bureaucrats to escape full accountability for misdeeds they have perpetrated under the guise of government policy Thus a recent decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that a group of government bureaucrats may be held personally liable for outrageous constitutional violations is news worthy of celebration The facts of the case attest to the need for strong checks on government power Three Berkeley Calif residents had campaigned against a proposed homeless shelter in their neighborhood At the behest of local housing rights activists who said the antishelter campaign was discriminatory and violated the Fair Housing Act the US Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD got into the act HUD officials demanded interviews with the three antishelter neighbors told their neighbors they had violated the law and ordered them to give HUD all materials including the names addresses and phone numbers of other opponents of the shelter that they had collected for their campaign To the Berkeley Three HUDs harassment violated their freedom of speech To the appeals court qualified immunity of government bureaucrats did not apply here the Berkeley Three may proceed with their First Amendment lawsuit against the HUD officials and seek monetary damages This ruling although unusual by todays standards harks back to another early legal tradition the idea that citizens can hold government officials personally liable for improper conduct In John Wilkes a member of Britains parliament was the subject of an outrageous search and seizure warrant issued by Secretary of State Lord Halifax after Wilkes published an anonymous attack on the government Wilkes then sued Halifax and other officials and was awarded a sum comparable to million today Americans were so enraptured with this refutation of unrestrained government power that they made Wilkes a hero and followed in his footsteps suing government officials for unreasonable search and seizures Since the th century however this commonlaw tradition has nearly withered away The creation of the exclusionary rule has replaced Wilkess remedy with an inferior one While the exclusionary rule brings some satisfaction to criminals who are the subject of unreasonable searches and seizures it does nothing for the innocent Furthermore the th century has seen the rise of the doctrine of qualified immunity which the US Supreme Court explains seeks to ensure that government defendants reasonably can anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability by attaching liability only if the contours of the right violated are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right The Ninth Circuits recent ruling that HUD officials were not acting reasonably when they violated the First Amendment rights of the Berkeley Three is refreshing because it rekindles the idea that civil liability can be a restraint on government power In an

Welcome to The Lighthouse the email newsletter of The Independent Institute the nonpartisan public policy research organization We provide you with updates of the Institutes current research publications events and media programs IN THIS WEEKS ISSUE Defective Tires Defective Bureaucracy Paul Craig Roberts on the War on Crime Medicare Reform Economics versus Politics DEFECTIVE TIRES DEFECTIVE BUREAUCRACY Some fans of the regulatory state believe that NHTSA the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration deserves much credit and in reward expanded powers for its role in exposing the Firestone tire Ford Explorer fiasco But although NHTSA received early reports of fatalities caused by the separation of Firestone tires its investigation began very recently last May long after investigations by State Farm Insurance the Center for Auto Safety and Safety Forum brought the problem to light This isnt the first time that NHTSA has failed its mission argues Michael I Krauss law professor at George Mason University and author of the recent Independent Institute book FIRE AND SMOKE Government Lawsuits and the Rule of Law NHTSA the agency responsible for minimum fuel economy standards found by a court to have likely cost many lives by forcing manufacturers to produce light dangerous cars and for illegaltodisable babykilling airbags does not deserve to be rewarded for its asleepattheswitch approach to the tire problem Krauss wrote recently It would be absurd to reward Firestone for selling defective tires However when NHTSA fails selfproclaimed consumer advocates call for a parallel absurdity lavishing the agency with more regulatory authority and taxpayer funds But NHTSAs pattern of failure indicates a systemic problem a design flaw that cannot be easily repaired In contrast as the Firestone episode demonstrates the watchful eyes of the American economic and legal systems have enormous incentives to detect and report product defects In this light perhaps what most needs to be recalled and held accountable for sloppy workmanship and false advertising is the defective regulatory state For more information see The Feds Eye Firestone by

PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS ON THE WAR ON CRIME Electionyear promises always renew the risk that peaceful Americans will see their rights sacrificed for the sake of political expediency This is especially true when politicians promise to get tough on crime as syndicated columnist and Independent Institute research fellow Paul Craig Roberts pointed out recently Although one anticrime bill or antiprivacy according to its critics was recently defeated another anticrime bill this one strengthening asset forfeiture laws has just been introduced Unfortunately says Roberts asset forfeiture laws violate due process and are any easy way for politicians to look tough on crime even though such laws harm innocent Americans far more than criminals The House Judiciary Committee led by Henry Hyde RIll has documented the most extraordinary abuses of the asset forfeiture laws writes Roberts The Banking Committee and the bills author should sit down with Hyde and listen carefully before they create any more Gestapo powers for lawenforcement officers For more information see Dangers lurk in war on crime by Paul Craig Roberts at tiilighthouseLHLinkhtml For more on civil forfeiture laws see CIVIL

been intensely debated since the mids However its advocates found no way to overcome opposition until when Medicares staunchest advocate on the House Ways and Means Committee found the opportunity to smuggle Medicare legislation into another bill at the last minute Yet as vocal as debates over Medicare have been very little of that debate has been informed by sound economic principles This omission which has stalled any genuine reform of Medicare is largely the fault of economists says economist Robert B Helms in the new issue of THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW My criticism is not directed to the economists who have attempted for many years to apply market principles to healthcare issues but to the larger number of economists who have not Helms writes Moreover my criticism pertains to the failure of economists to teach the fundamental principles of economics to educated Americans rather than to the failure of economics To improve the quality of the debate over Medicare Helms recommends three measures First more economists must explain to policymakers and the public that that market competition in health care as in other markets would improve quality of health care Second they must explain that competition would also make health care more efficient by allocating scarce resources to highervalued uses Finally they must explain that price controls and destructive of these desirable ends Without a concerted effort to impart these principles to a wider audience Helms argues Medicare reform and other necessary healthpolicy reforms will become victim of political maneuvering much to the detriment of the lives and wellbeing of the American public This lack of education in economics is appallingly evident in Washington DC especially on Capitol Hill says Helms For more information
