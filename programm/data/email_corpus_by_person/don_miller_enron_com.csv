Cartwright IRJFcom on AM To RJF EnergyGram cc Subject Pacific Gas and Electric Company Files for Chapter Reorganization SAN FRANCISCOBUSINESS WIREApril Pacific Gas and Electric Company the utility unit of PGE Corporation NYSE PCG today filed for reorganization under Chapter of the US Bankruptcy Code in San Francisco bankruptcy court The company said it is taking this action in light of its unreimbursed energy costs which are now increasing by more than million per month continuing CPUC decisions that economically disadvantage the company and the now unmistakable fact that negotiations with Governor Gray Davis and his representatives are going nowhere Neither PGE Corporation nor any of its other subsidiaries including its National Energy Group have filed for Chapter reorganization or are affected by the utilitys filing We chose to file for Chapter reorganization affirmatively because we expect the court will provide the venue needed to reach a solution which thus far the State and the States regulators have been unable to achieve said Robert D Glynn Jr Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company The regulatory and political processes have failed us and now we are turning to the court Glynn added Our objective is to move through the Chapter reorganization process as quickly as possible without disruption to our operations or inconvenience to our customers Throughout this crisis our employees have been and remain committed to providing safe and reliable service to the million Californians who depend on us to deliver their gas and electricity Pacific Gas and Electric Company decided to file for the protection of Chapter primarily due to Failure by the state to assume the full procurement responsibility for Pacific Gas and Electrics net open position as was provided under ABX This has the result of increasing financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy procurement costs which the utility estimates to be approximately million or more per month The impact of actions by the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC on March and April that created new payment obligations for the company and undermined its ability to return to financial viability Lack of progress in negotiations with the state to provide recovery of billion in wholesale power purchases made by the utility since June which have not been recoverable in frozen rates The adoption by the CPUC of an illegal and retroactive accounting change that would appear to eliminate our true uncollected wholesale costs In addition despite Pacific Gas Electrics best efforts to work with the State of California to reach a consensual responsible fair and comprehensive solution to Californias energy crisis no agreement has been reached with the Governor and the Governors representatives have dramatically slowed the pace and the progress of discussions over the past month Furthermore since last fall we have filed comprehensive plans for resolving this matter with the CPUC but they have not acted affirmatively on them said Glynn On October Pacific Gas and Electric sought emergency rate action by the CPUC In November we filed our rate stabilization plan which if adopted would have increased electric prices by an initial percent compared with the percent recently adopted by the CPUC Neither request was acted upon Had the state acted at that time Pacific Gas and Electric would have been kept creditworthy Pacific Gas and Electric would have been able to enter into longterm power purchase contracts at prices lower than those announced by the state The state would not have had to almost exhaust the states budget surplus by spending billions of dollars to purchase power for the utilitys customers The state would not now need to issue billions of dollars in bonds to cover these power purchases and The state would not now be advancing a proposal to spend billions of dollars to purchase the states three investorowned utilitys electric transmission systems This year the state has spent more than billion on power purchases and with the CPUC has arranged to be reimbursed for these expenses noted Glynn In contrast since June Pacific Gas and Electric Company has spent billion in excess of revenues to pay for power for its customers and exhausted its ability to continue borrowing but there has been no progress on a plan to reimburse it for those expenditures as provided by law Statements by the Governor and other public officials since last September gave us reason to believe that a solution could be reached outside the context of Chapter that would restore the utilitys financial viability and enable it to meet its financial obligations equitably However these statements have not been followed up by constructive actions and a reorganization in Chapter is now the most feasible means of resolution The utility will utilize existing resources to continue operating its business during bankruptcy including paying vendors and suppliers in full for goods and services received after the filing The utility will pay electric commodity suppliers as provided by law The utility intends to continue normal electric and gas transmission and distribution functions during the Chapter process Employees will continue to be paid Health care plans and other benefits for employees and most retirees will continue The utilitys qualified retirement plans for retirees and vested employees are fully funded and protected by federal law Notice A media teleconference will be held today at AM Pacific Daylight Time to discuss this announcement Pacific Gas and Electric Company Chairman Robert D Glynn Jr and Pacific Gas and Electric Company President and CEO Gordon R Smith will be available for questions The dialin number is and

<8192828.1075854428265.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,don.miller@enron.com,2000-12-13 07:15:00,Cinergy Confidentiality Cc the following goes without saying but I wanted to highlight a few specific points relevant to this transaction As all of you know the sale of Brownsville and Caledonia to Cinergy was recently announced As the press release indicated the terms of the transaction were not released While Allegheny with the sale of the s took the same position in its announcement the purchase price was subsequently released to the market by Allegheny Cinergy and Enron both agreed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement to not release the price and terms without the others consent ie THE PRICE AND TERMS WILL REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL To the extent legally permitted Cinergy will not release the price as part of its regulatory filings and in fact will redact the price from all of its filings If through your involvement in this process you inadvertently learned the price you must keep it to yourself As we all know information moves around this organization very quickly With two deals on very similar assets in the market at once Allegheny and Cinergy it only makes sense to contain the external flow of information By the way both transactions should close MarchApril Thanks for your help in this process and your cooperation in keeping this information confidential Regards Don
