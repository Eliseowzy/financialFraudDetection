especially for the Pacific NW and No rthern Intermountain region Some minor easing is expected farther South T he next trough will move into the Pac ific NW this weekend and will reform in the Plains early next week setting up another round of storms for the M idwest Late in the period the Rockies ridge starts to reform back to the West Coast I am starting to notice a small warming of upper level

Day discussion Yesterdays extreme chillfor the season solution of the MRF for the East has been tempered s omewhat as I expected it would However there is pretty fair agreement amo ng the long range models going into the middle of June We have seen a bloc king pattern in Canada for weeks now which has allowed the jet stream to ro am farther South and stronger than normal The only difference I see in the block is a Westward shift of it to the central part of the country This s hift may be the first signs of a pattern change outside this window It won t make a huge difference in the evolution of the US pattern through day We should continue to see a mean ridge located over the West with a tro ugh in the East Other than the deep South and of course the ongoing Wester n heat it looks unlikely that any sustainable warmth will develop through mid June Th e warmer upper levels in the South though I believe are anoth er indicator to a change in the pattern to more typical summer after June th We still have ample rainfall opportunities for the next two weeks Ot her than a few localized areas unusual heat feedback due to drought appears unlikely through at least July th Day Summary Forecast

amplified this week The temperature contrast may not be as large as the last two weeks but rainfall and storminess look to be mor e widespread More important some of the best rainfall potential is locate d over the Gulf Coast and SE states Most other areas East of the Rockies w ill see above normal rainfall prospects as well as moisture flows out of th e Gulf into a warm front set up over the Mississippi Valley This will lift into the Northeast midweek allowing a temporary surge of warm air to flow North As mentioned last week this surge may bring temperatures back to ne ar normal for a day or two Additional energy later in the week from Canada will allow our Eastern trough to amplify again sending a cold front and mo re moderate cooling deep into dixie Energy needs East of the Ro ckies sti ll look below normal this week although AC usage will be increasing especia lly in the Southern states as the more humid air keeps night time temperatu es up In the West the excessive heat from last week has broken in many a reas There may be another round though later in the week The same pattern that amplfies a trough in the East will also amplify the ridge in the West It appears to be set up a little farther East into the Intermountain regi on as opposed to last weeks position right along the coast Precipitation p otential as is typically the case this time of year is rather limited I am sure there will be some lighter showers in the NW but hardly enough to he lp the hydro situation The East slopes of the Rockies could see some moder ate rains as a favorable upslope

Mean Max Min Range StDP Count Day discussion There should be some change to the pattern especi ally late in the period Most of the long range models indicate the blockin g in Canada will ease allowing for a Northward migration of the jet stream In addition there appear to be some jet stream alignment changes going on in the Pacific that should eventually translate downstream If these occur we should see a strong trough in the NW a weaker trough in the NE and an expanding flat ridge in the middle of the country by midJune Sensible we ather changes would include substantial cooling of the West and moderate wa rming of the North and East The various long term models seem to be recogn izing the change but vary on its depth The European is the most aggressiv e blasting summer from the Plains into the NE by Day The American MRF m ay actually keep the East a little too cool as it has a more amplified tr ough in the NE This seems to leave me in the Canadian camp today I expect a more normal summer pattern to finally emerge by the middle of next week But keep in mind I am saying NORMAL not excessive heat The last we eks have seen a fairly widespread moderate to heavy rainfall occur

ridge plenty of jet stream ene rgy moves out of Canada carving out another Mississippi Valley trough that heads East over the weekend There will be an upper level closed low that moves from Minnesota to the Eastern Lakes by early next week This feature should contain more significant rainfall deep into the South and East as we ll as more unusually cool air for the North and East Late in the period

do offer differi ng opinions The revered MRF has done a on its forecast For days now it has advertised a NE surge of the ridge and heat into the Eastern US To day it shows another deep trough in the East for Day and is actually th e coldest looking of the models I didnt accept the warm solution earlier but I think this is too extreme The markets may not agree with me as there appears to be some price weakness today On the other extreme we have the European model which I think brings the warm air too far North into the Pla ins but does acknowledge weak troughing in the NE This brings me to the Ca nadian and US Navy models which in my opinion hold the closest answer I expect the setup to be a ridge in the inland West with a trough across the Great L akes and NE Most of the West will remain above normal and the Eas t below normal The East will also continue to see the potential for above normal rains Day Summary Forecast for Tue Jun Syncrasys C hoice Delta Temp Volatility Matrix

from spring to summer Over the last several days we have seen the Gulf Coast and SE states become quite humid as the f low has come out of the Gulf There is some upper level energy in this regi on as well and the waters off the Texas and Louisiana coasts are seeing som e very heavy rains this morning This tropical moisture will come ashore la ter today and spread NE over the next hours Combine that with anothe r cold front and upper air trough sweeping in from the Northern Plains and you run the risk of seeing some significant rains from the Plains Eastward the rest of this week Temperatures will still run below normal on average but a brief bubble of warm air is coming North with a warm front in the Oh io Valley AC usage may increase a little midweek due to the higher humid ities which will keep overnight temperatures up Of course most of this wil l be swept away late this week when the cold front moves through bringing o ne more shot of cooler drier air from Canada for the weekend This should n ot be as strong though as the last several rounds In the West the recent cooling trend will relax The ridge will rebuild especially from the SW in to the Rockies More heat is anticipated later this week particularly over the Southern half It does not look at this time that any significant heat will build West to the coast but rather remain in the interior I also don t see any significant precipitation over the next days Only light amoun ts are expected in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies Tomorrow S ummary Forecast for Wed Jun Syncrasys Choice Delta Temp

yelling on several occasions the last three weeks but there se ems to be some support for it now Pattern changes in the Pacific partiucl arly in Asia and near Hawaii support the ridge expanding NE out of the Inte rmountain West next week The question becomes one of how far East and how strong They all agree the ridge expands from the Plains to the Great Lakes However the US and Canadian models expand all the way to the NE while the European does not The key will be where the Western US trough sets u p The US model says its well off the coast the others near or slightly inland I have said for awhile that the next change would feature troughs n ear both coasts and a ridge in the middle I see no reason to change that v iew for now In addition recent rains not to mention the potential for m ore the next several days will leave the ground moist enough to keep any ma jor heat from developing Ultimately I see next week running near normal W est and East and slightly above normal Central

Mexico We were acutely aw are of tstorms yesterday along the Texas and Louisiana coasts and then in the afternoon Allison was born She came ashore last night in SE Texas and is located north of Houston The surface circulation should disappear later today but the remnants may hang around for quite sometime Some models su ggest this well into next week Combine this with a front that approaches f rom the North and stalls over the region towards the weekend and you have a recipe for very heavy rains In the extreme you could see some areas get well over a foot of rain the next several days in Louisiana Mississippi a nd Alabama The rest of the Gulf Coast into the SE and Tennessee Valley sho uld see significant rain as well from these features The rest of the sh ort term forecast appears as advertised earlier in the week A cold front i n the Midwest now gets to the East coast by the weekend This brings more s cattered Showers and Tstorms to areas East of the Mississippi Another dip in the jet stream follows this front for the East this weekend into early next week The trough is not expected to be as strong as the last several s o the air will not be as cool Still it looks like low AC demand for much of the East into early next week and lower than normal demand in the South due to the heavy rain threat The ridge reforms later this week in the Inte rior West Warmer than normal

the longer range With that in mind I will leave my predictions from earlier in the week intact until I see evid ence from the actual weather that a change is in order I will leave it to others to flipflop daily depending upon what a particular model does Most of the modelling shows evidence of troughs near both coasts with a ridge i n the middle The disagreements are on strength and size The American mode ls take on more of a status quo look with the potential for another deep Gr eat LakesNortheast trough late next week Granted this has been the patter n the last month but it seems overdone for Mid June The European and Cana dian models meanwhile expand the Continental US Ridge more than I am comf ortable with The European in particular may have some forec asters scream ing heatwave next week Given the recent heavy rains in most of the Eastern two thirds of the country this too is overdone So a compromise still lo oks to be the best solution at this point Therefore I see a definite warm up in the five day period but anything much above normal will have a toug h time getting East of the Mississippi Day Summary Forecast for Mon Jun Syncrasys Choice Delta Temp Volatility

in the regi on early next week Since the system has started moving SSW toward the Gulf Waters speculation may intensify to the possibility of regeneration I st ill dont expect it but I can not dismiss the potential entirely Whether this happens or not more heavy rain looks likely from SE Texas into Alabam a There have been unofficial reports of close to two feet of rain in SE Te xas The rain though farther North and East remains welcome Into Florida a nd the Carolinas a cold front will spark additional welcome moderate to h eavy rains The above developments may help to put a lid on daytime temper atures in the deep South for a few more days This is not the case for the Plains however The ridge that has been in the SW for weeks now will flex NE Temperatures in the s could get as far North as Nebraska and Iowa A mild NW flow aloft will keep things slightly below normal from the Lakes t o the MidAtlantic though a strong June sun is starting to work on the atmo sphere The only fresh

a consensus There is still a question in my mind as to whether I accept the solution The mo dels now agree to expand the ridge into the Eastern US later next week an d beyond There are a number of compelling arguments to support this scenar io If one translates the upper level features down to the surface you get a return to the early April heat in the Northeast The one difference thoug h is the addition of tropical air to the mix Where it does not rain AC de mand will certainly soar but it is my feeling that there will be Showers a nd a cold front passage or two despite the upper level look So while yes it will be warmingand thats been well documented here for over a week I w ant to see what the models look like Monday before committing to an expande d warm spel l here Besides this is all contingent on the next Pacific upp er low lifting far North into Canada a situation I am not yet convinced on That low by the way spells more tstorm mischief and cooling into the Nor thern Plains and Great Lakes during this period The deep South slowly drie s out while the east expansion of the ridge allows the amplitude to modify a bit in the West Overall it does look much more like a

rede velops in the East Allison in the short term looks fairly easy to answer With the main jet stream to the North and ridges East and West Allison lik ely will not move very much I still expect more significant rainfall along the Western Gulf Coast for the next days though probably not quite as heavy as yesterday Just as an aside there is one model that pushes the re mnants all the way into the Ohio valley next week and another that pushes t hem back into the Gulf waters where it could possibly regenerate I am disc ounting both solutions for now with the feeling that it will eventually fiz zle in Louisiana this weekend The trough in the East should reamplify in t he Gre at Lakes by Friday and then linger in the NE through the five day p eriod I still expect temperatures to run a bit below normal though some wa rming is on the way For the West a strong upper low will crash into the P NW this weekend and move East towards the Northern Plains early next week Light to moderate rain

with regards to the evolving long term pat tern The European looks much too cold in the NE the MRF as usual has flip ped and now surges warm air into the NE and looks too warm there The Canad ian looks more reasonable in the East but too strong and too far South wit h a trough in the West Where there seems to be agreement is in the middle of the nation where a large ridge should reside The ridge will result in a warmer than normal pattern in my view from the SW to the Central Plains to the Great Lakes However the departures do not look too significant In a ddition there still appears to be opportunity for rainfall especially for t he South and also East of the Mississippi With all of the model uncertaint y East and West pattern recognition indicates to me that troughs will prev ail in the NW a nd NE given the ridge in the middle The NW trough may be a little stronger than seasonal norms resulting in more cooler than normal air for the PNW The NE trough looks seasonal to me These

The storm track will be well North which con fines snow to the Northern US Significant winter weather though from Wyom ing to Minnesota is possible The large scale pattern ending November will be for a trough to sit in the Interior West while a strong ridge exists ove r the Southeast There is still plenty of arctic air available in Canada but with the jet stream in a broad West to SW flow no means of delivery ap pear available until at least December st In a general sense I look for temperatures to be below normal in the West with above normal in the South and East The North is somewhat a

Reg CT HP NE NW RK SE SP S W Mean Max Min Range StDP Count Click Here to See Each Weather Forecast Us ed Within the Volatility Matrix Day Discussion Models converging o n an increasingly stormy pattern The question still to be answered is when the arctic air arrives The current cool down in the East is very transit ional with warmer air to return by the end of the week The pattern has cle arly changed as the jet stream has been suppressed Southward In the short and medium terms things should turn stormier but not neccessarily colde r In fact latest charts indicate a healthy ridge to build late this perio d over the SE US in response to a trough developing over the Rockies Thi s opens the Gulf of Mexico up in a moisture sense but any winter snows loo k to be confined to the extreme Northern tier of states Much needed rains may fall from the Plains to the East Coast by the weekend in areas that hav e been parched this Fall In terms of temperatu res day averages will n ot

consistently forecasting colder air along with most others in the day period for a couple of weeks now It has been slow in developing a nd the cool down now in the East would hardly be considered significant unl ess it is compared to the record warmth of the last couple of weeks The pa ttern I foresee going into early December is colder relative to normal in t he West and warmer in the East Specifically a storm track from the SW into the Plains and NE will set up allowing for generous rain with snow North to develop Arctic air is moving to this side of the pole and pooling in N W Canada Now a mechanism to drive it SE is needed One of the tools used that I occasionally refer to is the North Atlantic Oscillation NAO Most winter forecasts have predicted this as largely negative this se ason whi ch is a robust signal for cold air in the East It has been negative the la st two weeks though in fairness its reliability as a signal gets much highe r in December for cold I find it interesting to note the signal is expecte d to go weakly positive next week Bottom line for the period is I see a co ntinuation of a cold bias with the Western trough and a warm bias in the vi cinity of the Eastern ridge We may also see a significant storm move throu gh the country during the period but again I look for snow to be confined to the North Day Sunday November Syncrasys Choice Del ta

still expected in the West W e will probably beat down the SE ridge somewhat this period It still looks doubtful to me that we would see any sustainable cold air very far South i nto the US In fact the trend in the arctic regions appears to be one of cooling during this period Typically when this happens the result is one of warming in the Southern half of Canada I dont see a major warm up and

significant Persistence also shoul d pay off in this forecast These troughs have not had any problem digging into the Eastern US since Labor Day while troughs into the West have been nonexistence This could be giving us clues on how the winter will go Th e good news is that will aid in verifying my winter outlook the bad news i s it could result in a long season in the East Specifics can wait until

century Superstorm or whatever yo u want to call yesterdays event was overhyped a bit in my opinion but sig nificant in some respects There were some large tornadoes in Northern Indi ana and the surface low pressure center had one of the lowest readings I ha ve seen in an October storm Otherwise it was a squall line of tstorms wi th a turn to colder and windier weather things we have certainly seen befo re and will see again The cold front should reach the Atlantic coastline l ater today and another line of tstorms may certainly go up along it We al so have some measurable snow in Minnesota this morning and could see some lake effect snows through Friday Once this storm is off the field the o nly inclement weather threats appear to be the PNW from a trough in the Gul f of Alaska and in Florida from something tropical I do not mean from a na med storm or hurricane but merely that the disturbance originated in the C aribbean A large polar air mass has swept in behind this storm insuring a drier and cooler than normal pattern from the Mississippi River and East th rough the weekend The Plains start to warm early next week is ridging star ts to evolve in response to

pronounced initially in the North than the South though by late in the period all will share I mentioned an atmosphe ric turnaround yesterday and still feel there is potential by the middle of next week to become almost as warm as the recent warm episode The pattern remains progressive but not as volatile as recent weeks Charts show anot her trough pushing through the Plains and Eastern US but

a large area and very unusual for late October Significan t Tornadoes damaging winds and hail are possible Farther East along the E astern Seaboard a day of near record highs are expected before the cold fr ont arrives Thursday night There is also a winter component to this storm Arctic air pouring in to the upper Plains has produced some snow and near zero wind chills in North Dakota Very gusty winds and a degree temp erature drop will shift South and East over the next several days There is very little to write about in the West The current pattern is zonal comin g in from off the Pacific The Northwest may be a little damp but the rest of the West remains dry and close to seasonal This weekend as the East C oast trough reaches maximum amplitude the jet in the Eastern Pacific shoul d

The day outlook should bring th e atmosphere back to roughly the current stateminus the big storm I think it is important to mention that the arctic air forecast for the East in th e short term is NOT the beginning of an endless winter Winter forecasts co ntinue to be released showing a cold and snowy East That may be the case but the calendar is just now approaching November or the middle of Fall In fact most medium range models redevelop the Eastern ridge and Western tro ugh for this period We will be starting cold East of the Mississippi but should warm rapidly I suspect the models are a little fast and strong with the ridgetrough set up but the trend looks good The MRF has a weak trou gh progressing into the Midwest by day and this looks reasonable Day Monday October Syncrasys Choice

HP NE NW RK SE SP SW Mean Max Min Range StDP Count Day Discussion Powerhouse storm is about to exit The coldest air of the season is about to enter A signific ant warm up will commence late in the period The storm of the century Superstorm or whatever you want to call yesterdays event was overhyped a bit in my opinion but significant in some respects There were some larg e tornadoes in Northern Indiana and the surface low pressure center had one of the lowest readings I have seen in an October storm Otherwise it was a squall line of tstorms with a turn to colder and windier weather things we have certainly seen before and will see again The cold front should re ach the Atlantic coastline later today and another line of tstorms may cer tainly go up along it We also have some measurable snow in Minnesota this morning and could see some lake effect snows through Friday Once this s torm is off the field the only inclement weather threats appear to be the PNW from a trough in the Gulf of Alaska and in Florida from something tropi cal I do not mean from a named storm or hurricane but merely that the dis turbance originated in the Caribbean A large polar air mass has swept in b ehind this storm insuring a drier and cooler than normal pattern from the M ississippi River and East through the weekend The Plains start to warm ear ly next week is ridging starts to evolve in response to troughing off the W est Coast Neither of these features look particularly strong in the short term and overall weather in the West has a benign look to it Tomorrow Fr iday October Syncrasys Choice

that kicks in for the Plains advances EastRelative to no rmal this will be more pronounced initially in the North than the South tho ugh by late in the period all will share I mentioned an atmospheric turnar ound yesterday and still feel there is potential by the middle of next week to become almost as warm as the recent warm episode The pattern remains p rogressive but not as volatile as recent weeks Charts show another trough pushing through the Plains and Eastern US but it does not have the ampli tude that the current one does Therefore it cant tap the arctic air and bring it down I have a

Reg CT HP NE NW RK SE SP SW Mean Max Min Range StDP Coun t Day Discussion Cold air in the East wil l linger through the weekend but will get rapidly scoured out next week Ne xt trough set to enter the Western US There is currently a long and stro ng fetch of NW winds driving cold air through the Plains and then South and East Some Lake effect snows are occurring with this as well though much o f the Great Lakes moisture is a cold rain Sprawling high pressure covers a lmost the rest of the country and the trend in temperature is about to beco me one of moderation The surface high in the Plains will shift to the East coast by early next week and the NW winds now will shift to the SW allowin g the warm up to commence It will start in the Plains this weekend and go East of the Mississippi by Monday My five day temperature departures are s till largely below normal but they s hould be used with caution in a see saw pattern such as this After all some areasespecially in the Plains ma y start out below normal today and go above normal by Day Tue sday By the end of the period the Eastern trough will be out to sea a n ew trough will invade the West and Pacific style air will rule coast to coa st That air can be damp along the West coast but as it sinks over the mou ntains it quickly warms up and dries out This pattern is allowing the wet season to get started in the PNW It appears each successive Pacific storm is getting a little stronger and forming further South If the trend contin ues we could start seeing moisture getting into Northern California next w eek Tomorrow

The country should remain bathed in Pacific air well into the first week of November and I believe even beyond Troughs continue to move into the West and then in a progressive pattern stay fairly weak in their move East Wit hout any blocking in Canada it is hard for me to see much likelihood for a ny arctic air to get entrained My confidence remains high in a largely abo ve normal temperature forecast It is a little less optimistic in terms of precipitation I question how much Gulf of Mexico moisture can be worked ba ck to the North but some models suggest the Plains could get wet next week I have not discussed the tropics much this week because there has not bee n a storm to mention There still isnt but the overall pattern we are goi ng into ne xt week can in a climatological sense sometimes crank something up in the Caribbean and push it North towards Florida My guess is there w ill not be a named storm as such but some potential for heavy rain Day Wednesday October Syncrasys

Reg CT HP NE NW RK SE SP SW Me an Max Min Range StDP C ount Day Discussion Pacific air to overwh elm most of the country this week with a lack of significant storminess Th ere may however be some late season percolation in the tropics For the th ird time this month we set a handful of record lows in the SE US this we ekend The Canadian high is moving toward the coast though and we should so on initiate a broad though light SW flow of air that will warm the East b ack to above normal levels This is already well under way in the Plains wh ere s were common this weekend This pattern shuts off the Gulf of Mexic o and allows for mainly dry frontal passages One such front in the Plains will shift to the NE through Wednesday Since we have a zonal flow developi ng in the upper levels this front does little more than slow down the warm up as opposed to stopping it all together Storms are a little more robu st in the Pacific NW as a deep trough in the Gulf of Alaska continues to se nd impulses of energy your way Some precip should get as far South as Nort hern California With no additional arctic air in sight this week most fiv e day averages return to above seasonal norms The most excitement for wea ther fanatics this week may be late season development in the tropics We h ave a tropical depression in the Central Atlantic now and satellite picture s suggest another one may be developing over the next hours in the Carib bean off the coast of Nicaragua My initial thought was its a little too fa r South and too close to land to really have an impact in the Gulf and SE However there is considerable forecast scatter among the models It runs a nywhere from nothing at all to development in the Gulf of Mexico So I won t rule it out yet but since it would be days away and not

be the case The next change in weather will likely not be so agreed upon and there is already some scatter in the models My early expectations are for another buckle to take place in the jet stream over the Eastern US e arly in this period Some keep things zonal but you certainly cant argue the trend so far this fall is for this to occur about every seven days But there is reason to think the Eastern trough will not be as robust as the last several In other words it wont be as cold or spread as far South or West If it goes this way we would turn slightly below normal East a lit tle above

stormine ss is I dont expect any large storms during the period but a series of weak to moderate ones appear likely With the jet stream in a zonal flow it gets difficult to bring up much in the way of Gulf moisture Therefore precipitation production is more a function of the dynamics of the storm it self Bottom line nothing heavy for a while This zonal flow is also keepi ng the polar and subtropical jet streams separate and distinct There is pl enty of cold air now on this side of the pole in Canada waiting for an excu se to come South but it runs into a wall in the Northern US Any buckle of the jet stream looks to be confined to the Western US over the next se veral days and probably longer That trough in the West looks fairly weak so the temperature departures from normal are

the Volatility Matrix Day Discus sion The day outlook in my view features more of the same There is frustration in that Day models continue to show the Southward progressio n of arctic cold but without any real change in the upper level flow patte rns While I recognize cold air by weight can flow South on its own it is tough to get very far South The NWS day outlook is warm virtually eve rywhere East of the Rockies I am inclined to trim back the Northern part o f that to allow for that slow South drift of arctic air In addition this p attern may grow more favorable for Great Lakes enhanced snows But without a large surface High to press South out of the Yukon and with the Caribbea n ridge still exerting an influence I cannot see any large scale cold outb reaks developing Day

strange and frustrating winter for many forecasters O ne of the strongest Noreasters in years forms in MidJanuary this past wee kend It turns out to be a harmless event for most as it tracks just too fa r off the coast Plus it was too warm for snow other than upstate Maine an d a bit of Eastern Mass Then a seemingly innocent looking system over the Great Lakes drops some locally heavy snows over areas who spent much of la st week over degrees above normal So much for the look back now we look ahead There are several challenges ahead though the main one for energy is in the medium range Ill outline that one in the day paragraph b elow In the short term we have lost the unusual warmth in the North thou gh to call this air cold is a disservice to Northern climes There are two distinct storm tracks this morning The Southern branch is all rain along t he Gulf Coast and Southeast The North is a mix with rain in the Southern l akes and some moderate snow in the North We will see a couple of weak to m oderate weather systems come into the West and move across the country The y dont appear to be travel interrupters but may at least introduce some w inter to areas who have not

below normal almost nationwide But notice they go near normal in the Northern Plains That is significant as it refers to source region of air masses If the North is above normal short term and near normal mid term then where is the alleged arctic air coming from What may actually ha ppen is a redevelopment of the broad trough occurs over the Eastern half o f the country next week That is straight out of the MRF playbook The oper ational runs of the Canadian and European do not concur I certainly accept no ridge in the Eastern US but the bottom line in my view is this still is not a very cold pattern The NWS had NO ONE not one location above nor mal in their day period I think most of the South and East w ill run above normal during the period just not excessively so The North and Wes t will run close to normal Interestingly enough the European day looks to be the coldest of the medium range models Since it seems to be my favo rite this winter there could be some credibility to some arctic air the la st days of the month But even its appearance makes it difficult in my view for any real cold to get very far South Day Wednesday January Click Here for Syncrasys

verify c orrectly if you are one degree below normal as their forecast is a probabil ity scheme I cant totally rule out some arctic air in the normally frigid northern US this time of year but current patterns and charts convince me it would be extremely difficult to send this air very far South The MRF and its ensembles remain in the camp of a trough East and ridge holding in the West The European and Canadian models hint in the day period of a pattern reversal with more of a trough in the West and ridge in the East This ridge would not have near the amplitude of the one that produced the record warm November and December but it would effectively choke off any cold air East of the Mississippi I think the EuropeanCanadian combo has d one a much better job than the MRF this year and may be a believable soluti on The one change it does result in though is an opportunity to drive some cold air into the sparsely populated areas of the Interior NW and Rockies Day Tuesday January Click

Volatility Matrix Day Di scussion Bismarck North Dakota was warmer yesterday than Miami Florida Overall weather pattern still finds bitter cold arctic air lurking in the NW territories Bismarck was degrees above normal yesterday at w hile Miami was about degrees below normal at Its all a product of th e jet stream pattern which has taken modified Canadian air deep into the So uth while allowing a downslope wind off the Rockies to really warm up the P lains This warm air is heading East and will attack the Ohio Valley and Ea st Coast snow cover with a vengeance the next couple of days I do see a re versal of temperatures gradually occurring in the South the rest of the wee k as the deep trough weakens The current quiet pattern will become a littl e more active in the storm department later in the week There is a benign loo king system on the West Coast today which may redevelop over the Lower Mississippi Valley this weekend While I would not give this a major stor m designation it could provide the East some snow late in the period In addition another moderate cold front in the Northern branch will end the u nseasonable warmth in the Plains this weekend but I would hardly call it c old The five day numbers will still grade out well above normal The stagn ant pattern in the West looks to continue as high pressure remains anchored over the Great Basin Storms coming in off the Pacific have a small punch as they hit the coast but rapidly weaken once inland Overall temperature s there look to remain a bit above normal Tomorrow Thursday January Syncrasys Choice Delta Temp

NE NW RK SE SP SW Mean Max Min Range StDP Count Click Here to See Each Weather Forecast Used Within the Volatility Matrix Day Discussion My mid range forecast continues to disagree with many who are calling for much col der air to invade the Northern US The NWS and day products seem to be leading this charge with strong probabilities of below normal temper atures over much of the country especially in the day time frame I th ink a mistake is being made in equating a large area of below normal probab ilities with very cold air Keep in mind that in a probability forecast one degree below normal grades out the same as degrees below normal There are two distinct branches of the jet stream right now but clearly the Paci fic branch is more dominant in the US than the arctic branch Repeated ef forts at reversing that have not yet materialized and I wont forecast that occurrence without more evidence I am not arguing against cooler tha n c urrent weather or even the return to below normal temperatures in the North next week I just dont see the whole motherlode of arctic air coming down This outlook will bust big time if I am wrong though if one looks at the extreme cold being predicted on the end panels days of the MRF in N W Canada Those readings are as cold as anything I have ever seen But the y are at the end of the long range and in NW Canada I think it has been pr oven several times already this winter it is very premature to bring that a ir down though if you hammer at it often enough it may eventually happen Day Monday January Click Here for Syncrasys

the Volatility Matrix Day Discuss ion Thaw underway for the short term Longer range models continue to in sist as I continue to resist that real arctic air arrives later in the mo nth There is some potential for yet another winter storm in the East late in the five day period The point in question is how much cold air is avai lable or is it just another cold rain for many folks That will be answered later in the week The overall pattern definitely looks warmer for now tho ugh some of this energy goes into melting snow cover rather than warming th e air The absence of snow in the Plains is one reason why they are so much warmer relative to normal than areas farther East But most of the countr y goes warmer than normal before the end of the week The last to catch on to this trend is

Volatility Matrix Day Discussion I am not as bul lish as the charts and some forecasters in regards to cold air developing in the medium range period and beyond I am not saying next week and the w eek after will not be colder than this week they likely will be But I co ntinue to have questions as to intensity and Southern extent of whatever de velops First we have yet to see any real polar flow so far this winter S econd lack of deep snow cover in the Northern US tends to inhibit bitter cold Third and perhaps most important to me is the lack of high surface pressures developing over Canada Now they may develop eventually but I w ant to see it first Finally most models have more of a West to East confi guration at the jet stream level rather than a NW to SE orientation straigh t out of the arctic Given these conditions and recent history I am just n ot ready yet to pronounce any major cold developing In fact I would expec t the Gulf Coast and SE to actually run warmer than normal through the t h of the month The Plains Lakes and NE probably go back to below normal l evels but not excessively so It looks comparable to the past couple of we eks The West is expected to take on a temperature profile that closely res embles normal MidJanuary levels Day Sunday January Clic k Here for Syncrasys summary information Syncrasys Choice Delta Temp Volatility Matrix IMAGEIMAGE

Discussion The day period shows the polar vortex locked in to place over the Great Lakes It is also possible that Southern jet stream energy will undercut this polar air spinning up a winter storm in the Sout h that could head up the East Coast This storm is clearly in the speculati ve stages and should be watched But the cold is not speculative it is re al I am very confident in the evolution of this at long last It appears t o be a fairly long lasting event the question now is how long and how seve re One extreme example of how strong this potential may be down the road w as a report earlier this week that record high barometric pressure readings were approached in Mongolia The center of this Siberian high had a pressu re of around of mercury The temperature at the time of the reading was below zero Most of the models on a hemispheric scale are now lini ng up the surface highs from the US Northwest to the Pole The Canadian m odel in particular shows some very frigid air in the NW

Discussion Important storm about to hit the West coast By the time it exits the East for Christmas a moderate arctic airmass sh ould have finally invaded much of the Eastern two thirds of the US The a ir behind the storm now exiting the NE turned out to be a little colder tha n expected as s and s are widespread this morning even down to the Gu lf Coast The first real Lake Effect snows of the season are underway in th e Eastern Lakes Sunshine farther West will modify this airmass to near if not slightly above normal this afternoon But it is a part of a stepping d own in temperatures that has gradually occurred over the last week to da ys That pattern should continue as Canadian highs are lined up to our NW a nd I still expect each one to be progressively colder into early January T he next storm is plowin g into the West Coast today with rain this morning well South into Central California This system should emerge into Colorad o tomorrow with a weekend track to the NE toward the Great Lakes then East from there I do expect some Christmas weekend snows in the Northern fringe s of this storm but more real estate will see rain rather than snow A bel ow normal plunge of air should follow this storm by Christmas as ridging ra pidly develops in the West deepening a trough into the East Five day tempe rature numbers still reflect an above normal bias as we see one final warmu p the next days before the colder air strikes late in the period Tom orrow Friday December Syncrasys Choice Delta Temp Volatili ty Matrix IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE Click on image to

than normal for much of the East If it does it will be the first period in over two months that runs cold Relative to normal it may not b e as significant as some of the warmer departures have been but it should get some attention There are some differences on where the heart of the co ld sets up I believe it will tend to be more on the Plains rather than the East Coast But all models in this time frame have a strong ridge Westtro ugh East signature on them One additional surprise could be a Southern jet stream storm I dont see anything particularly ominous yet but the setup suggests

Day Discussion The strong ridgetrough configuration of re cent weeks relaxes temporarily It will reload again this weekend on the wa y to a transition to winter The weather system in the Midwest this morni ng is weak when compared to recent standards There is however a decent co ol air push behind it though most of the precipitation with this is still l iquid in nature The gradual trend down in temperatures continues as the pa ttern slowly changes We have seen near record warming out ahead of these s ystems early in December now the warming is not quite so robust There won t be many changes yet to day temperature departures as they remain above normal Those changes may start to show up by Friday The next system to h it the West coast tonight and Thursday looks more robust Models continue t o show the evolution of thi s storm as the window to the soul of the long awaited pattern change It will be a sizeable wet weather maker this weeken d and into Christmas There should be ample cold in the Northern US for s now but most still see rain It is a little early as to the potential of t his storm with regard to the East Coast for Christmas It is my feeling at this early stage that the I corridor is mainly a rain event with snow for the Lakes and Interior NE Tomorrow Thursday December Syncra sys Choice Delta Temp Volatility Matrix IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE IMAGEIMAGE Click on image to

Click He reto See Each Weather Forecast Used Within the Volatility Matrix Day Discussion Model consensus remains fairly strong with the evolution of the day period We should at long last start seeing negative departure s East of the Rockies though I wouldnt call the numbers significant It is significant only when comparing to the last two months Late in the period all of the models forecast a sizeable Western US ridge and Eastern trou gh This brings the flow out of Canada and into the Plains Now attention turns to source region of the air mass It is clearly Canadian but equally clear to me it is not pure arctic Thats why I dont think we are yet headi ng way below normal The coldest polar air is on the other side of the hemi sphere It can come around if this pattern were to lock in for a while but that is after the first of the year There is potential for serious cold e arly to mid January but rig ht now its all potential Until then the gra dual stepdown seems in order Day Monday
