Subject def authorization Attached herewith is the filed Conference Report statutory and report language for the Department of Defense Reauthorization Today at pm EST The House Rules Committee will

tomorrow October th The Senate also plans consideration this week but they have not yet announced their exact date for floor consideration and they are still seeking resolution of the price cap concerns which could result in a possible filibuster The Conference statutory language and report language is a victory for Enron Federal Solutions which had been threatened with House language which would have required a sole source by the local franchise utility The House receded to the Senate language translation the Hefley language was killed Further the political compromise reached does not support state franchise rights nor does it challenge Federal sovereignty nor does it challenge bundling but it does affirm the competitive rights for nonutility bidders Given the resources employed by EEI and their member companies plus employed by APPA NRECA and NARUC this is a major victory for EFS and the DOD By close of business today we need to determine whether or not to proceed with a

system or part of a utility system under subsection a that the conveyee manage and operate the utility system in a manner consistent with applicable Federal and State regulations pertaining to health safety fire and environmental requirements Conveyance authority regarding utility systems of military departments sec The House bill contained a provision sec that would amend section of title United States Code to require the secretary concerned to comply with the competition requirements of section of title United States Code in the conveyance of utility system infrastructure The provision would also require that the secretary concerned carry out a conveyance or award only if he determines that the conveyance or award complies with State laws regulations rulings and policies governing the provision of utility systems The Senate amendment contained a provision sec that would amend section of title United States Code to clarify that the secretary concerned may use procedures other than competitive procedures only under the circumstances specified in section c through f of title United States Code The House recedes with an amendment that would require the secretary concerned to structure the solicitation process for the privatization of utility systems on military installations in such a manner that would allow to the maximum extent possible all interested regulated and unregulated entities the opportunity to acquire and operate utility systems on military installations regardless of franchise rights in the area of the installation concerned The amendment would also

language but nonetheless clarifies the issue of state interference with competition and the extent to which states may regulate contractors it may not look like it at first blush I could explain the probable intent behind para a and b Anyway this will probably reappear on the CA radar screen at some point Regards Bob Forwarded by Robert FrankNAEnron on PM From Cynthia Sandherr on AM EDT To Thomas

Subject def authorization Attached herewith is the filed Conference Report statutory and report language for the Department of Defense Reauthorization Today at pm EST The House Rules Committee will meet to formulate a rule on HR The Floyd Spence National Defense Authorization Act for FYConference Report The plan is to then vote on both the Rule and the Conference Report on the House floor tomorrow October th The Senate also plans consideration this week but they have not yet announced their exact date for floor consideration and they are still seeking resolution of the price cap concerns which could result in a possible filibuster The Conference statutory language and report language is a victory for Enron Federal Solutions which had been threatened with House language which would have required a sole source by the local franchise utility The House receded to the Senate language translation the Hefley language was killed Further the political compromise reached does not support state franchise rights nor does it challenge Federal sovereignty nor does it challenge bundling but it does affirm the competitive rights for nonutility bidders Given the resources employed by EEI and their member companies plus employed by APPA NRECA and NARUC this is a major victory for EFS and the DOD By close of business today we need to determine whether or not to proceed with a possible floor Colloquy Congratulations to all involved with this successful team effort SEC CONVEYANCE AUTHORITY REGARDING UTILITY SYSTEMS OF MILITARY DEPARTMENTS a Selection of ConveyeeSubsection b of section of title United States Code is amended by inserting before If more than one and by adding at the end the following new paragraphs Notwithstanding paragraph the Secretary concerned may use

system or part of a utility system under subsection a that the conveyee manage and operate the utility system in a manner consistent with applicable Federal and State regulations pertaining to health

States Code to require the secretary concerned to comply with the competition requirements of section of title United States Code in the conveyance of utility system infrastructure The provision would also require that the secretary concerned carry out a conveyance or award only if he determines that the conveyance or award complies with State laws regulations rulings and policies governing the
