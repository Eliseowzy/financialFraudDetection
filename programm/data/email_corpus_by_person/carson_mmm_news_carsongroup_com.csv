PROFILE STARO ASSET MANAGEMENT BRIAN STARK and MICHAEL ROTH met years ago at the prestigious Harvard Law School While both may have intended to pursue very successful careers in law they found their success in a very different area After graduation the duo parted ways Stark moved to Denver where he handled general commercial litigation antitrust law and intellectual property cases Roth on the other hand moved to Washington DC where he handled bankruptcy cases It wouldnt be long before Stark would take what was once a hobby and turn in into his profession Investing had always been of great interest to Stark According to an article written by the Business Journal Milwaukee while Stark attended law school he researched and wrote a book on complex investment strategies like hedging arbitrage and liquidation This book was a culmination of his interest in investing which began at a very early age With the knowledge Stark accumulated over the years in the research and writing of his book and managing his own money Stark took this experience and decided to apply it to his own investment partnership Founded in Staro Asset Management originally opened in New York and later moved to Mequon WI in The firm manages the Shepherd Investments International Ltd Stark Global Fund Ltd Stark Europe Fund Ltd and the Stark Investments LP hedge funds The firm expanded its investment prowess when it launched BayStar Management which manages the Baystar Capital LP hedge fund Stark and Roth are joined in the venture by STEVE LAMAR and LARRY GOLDFARB According to MARHedge the fund invests in public companies through the purchase of individuallynegotiated privatelyplaced securities relying heavily on investing in convertible securities Staro Asset Management uses a combination of topdown and bottomup analysis In the topdown approach the firm uses proprietary qualitative models to screen a global universe of convertible and risk arbitrage opportunities The quantitative screens evaluate a convertibles fair value attractiveness from a historical perspective and expected return Qualitative factors considered include the fundamentals of the underlying common stock shortterm supply and demand forces affecting either the common stock or the convertible security and default risk The firm then relies on its vast experience and expertise to decide which of the uncovered opportunities are real and which are merely apparent The firm will purchase or short sell a convertible bond convertible preferred stock warrant or option coupled with the respective short sale or purchase of the underlying security of which the convertible can be exchanged Through out all of the firms affiliated funds there are no restrictions or limitations on what sector marketcap or country the firm can invest in thought it concentrates on the G markets It uses the same screening and selection process in the bottomup approach applied in uncovering optimal riskadjusted opportunities The firms primary objective is to achieve an uncorrelated absolute return of to net of fees The primary strategy of the firm is convertible hedging which typically represents to of overall investing Other strategies are used on an opportunistic basis and will differ per fund In its convertible hedging strategy the firm will take advantage of temporary mispricings between related securities to create positions that generate significant streams of cash flow The firm finds the most attractively priced convertible products in outoffavor sectors In a shareholder letter dated May the firm detailed its outlook on the global market stating We have continued to decrease our exposure to merger arbitrage and redeploy the capital into other arbitrage strategies that currently offer much more attractive riskreturn profiles The letter goes on to state that In convertible arbitrage potential opportunities in the near term are abundant According to HedgeWorld Staro Asset Management has approximately billion in assets under management SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISTS UP THEIR DEMANDS Many activist funds have continued to grow as a depressed stock market has left many smaller cap companies with decreasing stock prices making them prime targets for corporate raiders and management shakeups Many firms are reluctant to become too active instead trying to keep a low profile and involving themselves when they believe their interest is not being adequately represented Recently Harvard Management Company entered the fray when a company it was involved in received a tender offer While the firm felt the tender offer fell short of the companys true value it had to take it unable to persuade other shareholders of its position Many socially responsibly funds have also increasingly used proxy statements to push their own agendas BP Amoco Plc ADR BP recently faced a shareholder proxy that would have forced the company to phase out its production of oil and gas and instead focus on more environmentally friendly means of energy production The measure failed but had a good deal of support from some pension funds and other institutional managers that have had a record of support for environmental causes In a G filed in late October notable financier Carl C Icahn declared a stake in VISX Inc EYE However Icahn recently failed in his bid to oust the board of the eye surgery equipment maker Icahn had repeatedly railed again VISXs management hoping to elect his own nominees to the companys board Memphis TNbased Southeastern Asset Management Inc has made sizable gains through its activist billion Longleaf Partners Fund The fund was up in an otherwise brutal and it was up through April according to Morningstar The fund is a traditional GARP investor which also takes into account the underlying value of a company in the event of a turnaround or outright sale Stocks are purchased on current and projected free cash flow or cash profits minus expenditures necessary to run the business When evaluating pricing the firm determines a companys liquidation value or the sum of what a companys pieces would sell for on the open market From January to March Southeastern Asset Management acquired approximately million shares of Aetna Inc AET according to a D filing with the SEC dated March That gave Southeastern a share in the Hartford CTbased insurer Aetna had been battered in the market and many shareholders wanted to see the company spin off its less profitable businesses In that filing Southeastern announced its interaction with other parties to determine the best way to increase Aetnas true economic value About million of the shares purchased were for Southeasterns Longleaf Partners Fund In this situation the filing reported Southeastern has had conversations with third parties and intends to have additional conversations with these and one or more other third parties andor the Issuers management regarding actions or transactions Southeastern typically works closely with management to determine the best way to increase shareholder value Aetna had received a joint bid from Dutch financial company ING Group NV and WellPoint Health Networks ING was interested in Aetnas financial services while WellPoint was interested in Aetnas US HealthCare wing Southeasterns efforts were foiled however when Aetna sold off its financial services arm while holding on to its health care operations Since then Longleaf has slightly eased off on its stake but still kept the majority of its holding Top five holdings for the Longleaf Partners Fund as of March included Marriott International Inc New MAR with shares valued at million Waste Management Inc Del WMI with shares valued at million General Motors Corp GM with shares valued at million FedEx Corp FDX with shares valued at million and Tricon Global Restaurants Inc YUM with shares valued at million Other funds have also adopted more intrusive activist programs The California Public Employees Retirement System CalPERS believes that good corporate governance means the difference between shortterm setback and longterm financial difficulty CalPERS spent many years simply reacting to situations such as takeovers The firm has since taken a more proactive approach to investments in adopting its Corporate Governance Core Principles and Guidelines to achieve this end The firm believes that some measure must be taken to achieve longterm profitability but that some investors may not be willing to wait out shortterm difficulties The guidelines however are not absolute CalPERS readily realizes that some firms are constrained by competitive pressures as well as a myriad of other factors The firm likes to see independent board members and an open shareholder friendly environment This typically means the banning of greenmail and an accessible CEO who is free of additional constraints and is capable of acting in the best interests of shareholders Most important in their evaluation is the appearance of an independent board of directors Hedge fund Wynnefield Capital Management LLC has also recently entered the fray The firms Wynnefield Partners Small Cap Value LP recently submitted a shareholder proposal to the board of directors at Airgas Inc ARG The firm is pushing for the company to sell itself or to seek out new strategic partnerships The measure will go before shareholders at the firms annual meeting in August Wynnefields top five holdings for the quarter ended March included Sylvan Inc SYLN with shares valued at million Pricesmart Inc PSMT with shares valued at million First Aviation Services Inc FAVS with shares valued at million Delta Pine Land Co DLP with shares valued at million and CTB International Corp CTBC with shares valued at million Many companies boards of directors are under increasing outside pressure Growing demands on management from shareholders is increasingly an inevitable part of the future SECTOR COVERAGE BOSTON PARTNERS

its estimated million in assets to investors The remaining capital will stay invested Since mid to late the fund has reportedly had trouble finding new suitable investments Rather than invest in companies it did not find viable the firms managers have decided to return their excess assets The firm was founded in March by a formidable team seeking to capitalize on the raging bull market The timing could not have been worse The firms founding in March came at the beginning of the Internet bubbles burst and the market declines that came with it While the firm was able to garner returns early on its prospects became increasingly dim as the floor fell out of the IPO market The firm started out looking to get into companies on the ground floor by operating a crossover style fund The fund invested in companies with a public offering on the horizon Ideally the firm would be able to identify solid companies and benefit handsomely after an IPO pop The firms established staff helped lend an air of prestige to the firm itself Octane Capital was originally founded with the help of Emeric McDonald and Alex MonteSanto both formerly with Amerindo Investment Advisors Inc David Golob formerly with Tiger Management LLC Tim Murphy formerly with Capital Research Management and George Lee and Laura Paradis former bankers with Goldman Sachs Unfortunately the firm concentrated on companies with high revenues regardless of earnings In many cases the kinds of companies that have taken a beating in the market recently The firm specifically invests in emerging growth companies within the technology sector Using a fundamental approach Octane seeks companies with high revenue growth leadership qualities and innovative products Unlike other sectors emerging growth within the technology sector may include companies that have reached large market caps The public equity portfolio typically consists of to core issues some of which are private investments that have since gone public In the year there was approximately billion in US common stock underwriting up from billion in according to Thomson Financial Securities Data However much of last years gain was a result of a high volume of new issues introduced in the first quarter of More foreboding for firms such as Octane Capital approximately of IPOs were trading below their issue price as of the beginning of Many analysts believe that Octane Capital is one of the many firms that will soon be winding down their operations and consolidating with other firms Venture capital and crossover funds flourished throughout and early offering tremendous returns as a result of a frantic and euphoric stock market As the IPO market has suffered so have the firms most closely tied to it JP MORGAN CHASE CO MERGE TO CREATE INVESTMENT POWERHOUSE Throughout the past few months the buzz on the street was the recent merger between Chase Manhattan Corp and JP Morgan Co completed on December The merged firm operates under the name JP Morgan Chase Co with various deviations for the subsidiaries A global competitor with operations in over countries stockholders equity valued at more than billion assets in excess of billion and a marketcap of roughly billion the newly merged JP Morgan Chase Co is an investment management powerhouse The firm activities encompass investment banking strategic advisory equity and debt capital raising credit global trading market making activities operating services wealth management institutional asset management and private equity UNITED STATES JP Morgan and Chase have complimented each other with various investment styles ranging from growth to value For example Houstonbased JP Morgan Fleming Asset Management US formerly Chase Fleming Asset Management and Chase Texas Investment Management Group is a core growth investor utilizing four equity strategies equity income America core equity growth and smallcap Research is guided by proprietary valuations and decisions are made based on company visits discussions with customers and competitors and industry analysts The firms analysts then make recommendations to the senior portfolio managers who ultimately make the final decision On the other hand New Yorkbased JP Morgan Investment Management Inc which employs an active equity strategy is designed to outperform the SP based on a bottomup GARP philosophy Internal fundamental research systematic stock valuation and disciplined portfolio construction enable the firm to build solid portfolios JP Morgan places greater emphasis on normalized earnings and longterm growth rates and less emphasis on nearterm earnings The firm uses a proprietary DDM to derive at a DDR dividend discount rate The DDR serves a dual purpose allowing investment professionals to rank each potential investment and determine performance for possible sellouts Similar to the Houston office a majority of the research is conducted inhouse with decisions made on a team basis between analysts and portfolio managers The combination of Chase and JP Morgan has enabled the firm to offer a wider array of investment philosophies As a result of the merger structural changes have begun to take place and will continue throughout the next few months The Houston office of Chase Fleming Asset Management formerly Chase Texas Investment Management Group has exchanged the Chase brand name for JP Morgan and now operates as JP Morgan Fleming Asset Management The former New York office of Chase Fleming previously located on Park Avenue has merged with the team at JP Morgan Investment Management located at Fifth Avenue Some of the equity analysts that have relocated are ROBERT ZECH who follows smallcap and private equity CRAIG LEIGHTON who follows microcap companies GLENN GAWRONSKI

and multiline As a result of the merger between JP Morgan Chase the December filing is a combination of approximately institutions JP Morgan Investment Management Morgan Guaranty Chase Fleming and Chase Asset Management now JP Morgan Private Bank are among the entities now included in this filing UNITED KINGDOM Numerous changes have occurred at the London offices JP Morgan Fleming Asset Management UK Ltd as well The firm also dropped the use of the Chase brand name as both the JP Morgan and Fleming brand names carried the most cache in much of the UK Following the merger of Chase and Fleming Chase Fleming moved to a new office at Aldermanbury from its old Copthall Avenue location in September While the merger between JP Morgan and Chase was completed at the beginning of the year the firms did not combine physically until late April Following the merger with JP Morgan the former Chase Fleming made yet another move to Finsbury Dials its current location The combined firm JP Morgan Fleming Asset Mgmt UK Ltd started operating out of its new offices on April The former JP Morgan entity also changed its location moving from King St to join its sister staff at Finsbury Dials However the combined location has not led to a combined investment staff and investment approach Despite their common location and common name JP Morgan Fleming Asset Mgmt UK Ltd the former Chase Fleming and JP Morgan entities continue to operate as separate entities MARTIN PORTER has remained as the chief investment officer at the former Fleming entity while PABLO FORERO remains chief investment officer of the former JP Morgan entity The reasons for the separation lie in the firms divergent client base Each institution had too many large institutional clients that both sides feared

above the SP In an article in Barrons on Saturday May it was reported that Bowmans two principals Larry Bowman and John Hurley would be going their separate ways The firm has not responded The breakup it is widely believed is a result of lagging performance in a difficult market While the firm shorts and hedges against potential downturns the firms technology focus may have left it few places to hide Bowman has also made notable efforts in recent years to expand its involvement in private equity and mezzanine financing It even opened a new office in London to focus on European venture capital During the dotcom boom venture capital was an excellent way to get involved in hightech companies on the ground floor As the IPO market has shriveled up and technology stocks have fallen out of favor Bowman has been left holding long positions in companies that benefited from an opening IPO pop but that suffered following the downturn One such example was fiberoptic communications equipment maker

was not a result of poor performance or souring market conditions such conditions were responsible for the downfall of Soros Fund Management and Julian Robertsons Tiger Management The split is reportedly a result of differing opinions and visions of Pequots future Benton a technology specialist wanted to continue to make large bets long or short on technology while Samberg was interested in further diversification The fund has also struggled under a growing asset base In a letter to shareholders following the fourth quarter the firm reported in excess of billion in net assets under

with company management Despite its technology focus however the fund seems to have taken less risky positions in market tracking instruments While such baskets of stocks can be traded and shorted quickly it may also identify a trend among some technology funds Quickly running out of solid techcompanies to invest in many funds are moving to safer positions before returning to the fray For

AbouKhater joins Avera from Hilspen Capital Management where he executed the majority of trades handling trade breaks reconciliation performance tracking and maintenance of client accounts The firm relies on the belief that relative earnings momentum is what drives absolute as well as relative stock price performance The foundation of the firms investment philosophy is built upon the idea that companies with improving earnings momentum trading at a discount to their region and sector will outperform while companies with deteriorating earnings momentum trading at a premium to their region and sector will under perform The firm utilizes both quantitative and qualitative techniques in identifying long and short candidates from an initial universe of the largest publicly traded companies globally excluding emerging markets Avera Global Partners uses relative earnings momentum metrics and a quantitative ranking system built primarily around valuation metrics to scale down their investment universe Fundamental analysis is conducted at the company and sector level and modeling tools are used to identify trends and inflection points in earnings momentum As the forecast horizon rarely exceeds six months the firm tends to focus on nearterm earnings trends At the sector level analysts monitor sector specific data series such as order trends and inventory levels After the investment universe is narrowed down to a short list of long and short candidates the firm employs portfolio optimization technology to help identify the long and short candidates for the final portfolio GALLEON REPORTS SANS KRISHEN SUD For the third quarter ended September New Yorkbased Galleon Management LP reported ownership of companies valued at million a decline from the previous

Julian Robertson and the more recent announcement of the split of Bowman Capital Management and Pequot Capital Management Moore has quickly moved to the head of this alternative investment class although not without its own problems Recently the firm has been marred by a series of high profile departures that began last year with the departure of equity strategist Stanley Shopkorn In the past few months however the number of departures has increased significantly as some of the firms employees have taken financial backing from their former employer and splintered off to form their own hedge funds In a situation quite similar to that of Pequots Arthur Samberg and Dan Benton who is taking some of Pequots assets to launch Andor Capital Management Moore Capital has experienced its own split In March Moore Capitals technology and telecom group led by TONY ANAGNOSTAKIS left the firm to start the Agnos Group With seed money provided by Moore Capital Agnos Group maintains a close

a health care fund manager with Moore Capital left the firm to launch Maximus Capital with the help of MSDWs Teresa McRoberts and Galleons Prem Lachman The Financial Times reported that Maximus a health care hedge fund is backed by Moore Capital With the formation of the Agnos Group and Maximus Capital it appears as if Moore has expanded into a fund of funds approach while maintaining its own

ended March Moore Capital Managements F filing reported million in equity assets invested in a portfolio of companies This was a dramatic decline from the previous quarter in which the firm reported billion in equity assets invested in a portfolio of companies While some may consider ever shrinking F filings as evidence of a firm in trouble in fact just the opposite may be true When reviewing the F filings of many hedge funds it is important to remember that these filings are not always an accurate representation of a firms true equity assets as a result of the variety of investing techniques available to hedge funds For example when a firm shorts a stock essentially borrowing shares that it will attempt to replace at a lower price thus making money off of the difference this will often appear on a F as a purchase when in fact they are just replacing the shares Moore Capitals portfolio was invested across a wide variety of industries including financials basic materials diversified consumer staples and communication services Technology which was the second most widely held sector at the end of with dropped to only in the first quarter of likely a result of the formation of the
