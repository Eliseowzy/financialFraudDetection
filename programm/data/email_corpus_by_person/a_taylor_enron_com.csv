Mark A TaylorE ES Sheila nronXgate Steve Van nronXgat e John nronXgate Marcus Vonbock Und UEnronX Gate Christian nronXgate cc SubjectMandatory Setoff Language for Inclusion in all EWS Trading Contr acts One of the most important credit tools available to help Enron Wholesale Se rvices EWS manage counterparty credit risk is setoff rights This is par ticularly true as our trading business is expanding to include numerous com modity lines including gas power coal steel pulp and paper each of wh ich may be traded under different masters with a single counterparty This complexity is further increased as a result of EWS using multiple affiliat ed entities to trade the various commodities Absent express contractual s etoff rights EWS may be unable to setoff exposures under different master contracts A team of EWS lawyers has been working to assemble setoff language that will substantially enhance EWSs credit position with counterparties with w hom we trade multiple commodities This setoff language which is set fort h below must be in all EWS trading form contracts Similarly when negoti ating on third party paper we should request that this additional setoff l anguage be added MANDATORY SETOFF LANGUAGE FOR EWS TRADING CONTRACTS A Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination D ate the NonDefaulting Party X may at its option and in its discretio n setoff against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party Y by X or a ny Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreements ins truments or undertakings any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of Xs Affi liates under this Agreement or under any other agreements instruments or undertakings The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in resp ect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by X andor Xs Affiliates X will give Y not ice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff For purposes of this Section Owed shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable regardless o f whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced as of the Early Term ination Date Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be conver ted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at t he rate of exchange at which X acting in a reasonable manner and in good f aith would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being c onverted If an obligation is unascertained X may in good faith estimate t hat obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate subject to the releva nt party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained Nothi ng in this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other securit y interest except as may be provided under applicable law This setoff pr ovision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff netting offset combination of accounts counterclaim lien or other righ t to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled whether by operatio n of law contract or otherwise Each of the parties represent and acknow ledge that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral part of the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions The parties further ackno wledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as princip al and with respect to this Section as agent on behalf of its Affilia tes which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section and oth erwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to Section B Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agre ement the NonDefaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Default ing Party any amount under Section until the NonDefaulting Party receiv es confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion which may include an opinion of its counsel that all other obligations of any kind w hatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the NonDefaultin g Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other ag reements instruments or undertakings which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts du e and owing as of the Early Termination Date but does not include future p ayments between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates triangular se toff after the designation of an Early Termination Date This language ha s been reviewed by US bankruptcy counsel and is appropriate under US l aws for commodity transactions with USbased counterparties Each group will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdic tion in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability In addition prior to introducing this language into your forms changes will be require d to terminology andor to include terminations resulting from events other than Events of Default eg Affected Party under ISDA Finally when incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms please be aw are that this language is not intended to override the payment netting term s monthly netting of receivables or the closeout netting procedures app licable upon the designation of an Event of Default both of which should remain in the trading forms Rather this language is only intended to add setoff rights to all EWS trading forms When incorporating this setoff la nguage into your trading forms you will need to review the forms to determ ine if there are any references to setoff or other similar concepts that wi ll need to be overridden andor coordinated Finally in order to assist a ll lawyers in negotiating these setoff provisions we are in the process of preparing a brief explanation of how this setoff works and why it is mutua lly beneficial to EWS and our counterparties which explanation you will be able to share with your counterparties This explanation will be distribut ed shortly If you have any questions please contact me at or Elizabet h Sager at
