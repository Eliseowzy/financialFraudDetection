<32958913.1075842974537.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,braun@cmua.org,2000-09-18 04:58:00,RE IMPORTANT Letter to Governor Davis Cc Group A response to the ISOs recent message regarding CMUAs proposed language is necessary First CMUA proposed its language to the Group on participation of municipal System Units during the week of August st and discussed the matter at length with the Group when ISO representatives were in attendance and commenting on various drafting suggestions Any implication that there is an element of surprise associated with the CMUA language is unfounded If anything it is the ISOs latest suggestion to remove the language that is tardy The Letter underwent several iterative changes during which time the ISO had an opportunity to make constructive suggestions to modify the language preferably or at a minimum explain its position so that the Group could consider the issue Second the ISO indicates that there is ongoing and longstanding litigation over how to bring MUNIs into the ISO system as a reason for not including the language in the proposed Letter Certainly the fact that an issue is being litigated is not a distinguishing characteristic What issue hasnt been litigated including Load participation in ISO Ancillary Service markets As we fully discussed with the Group there are a host of issues associated with municipalISO discussions including ISO cost allocation to Load CMUAs specific proposal is to uncouple issues of transmission and Load cost allocation from the issue of getting generation capacity into the markets It is unfortunate that when we all recognize that we need more capacity in the ISO markets to deepen supply the ISO is taking a position to hold on to chits in an effort to strengthen its hand on transmission and Load cost allocation issues The end result is that generation is not in the ISO markets whatever the exact number it is far in excess of several of the other recommendations made in the letter because the issue is being held hostage for negotiating purposes on issues that have nothing to do with supply At this point it appears we will not have agreement on this matter In the past the Group has acted as a consensus organization CMUA would like the group to consider how the letter is characterized to the Governor or anyone else if one or more members have remaining concerns Tony Braun Braun Associates

Email Tommy Ross Tony Braun Victoria Schaefer Email Cc Winter Terry Subject RE IMPORTANT Letter to Governor Davis I do not have a comment on Karens edit but I wanted to email the entire group about CMUAs insistence on keeping Proposal under the generation section This is the section referencing potential MUNI units that could be bid into the ISO AS market if we can figure out a way to avoid having them join formally I had mentioned when this was first brought upwhich was frankly rather late in the drafting gamethat I thought this would be very controversial at ISO Not only does ISO not concur with the notion that there would be over MW of addiitonal supply into AS markets but placing this language in a letter to the Governor makes it look like ISO is the obstacle to having these units available There is ongoing and longstanding litigation over how to bring MUNIs into the ISO system I am not uncomfortable with discussing this issue at any AB meeting but forcing the issue in this Governors letter is not placing the issue on a level playing field in my opinion If CMUA decides not to sign the letter without this controversial piece that will be unfortunate Original Message

are driven by legislation sent to the Governor in the last days of session A redlined version is attached I hope this is helpful We propose to eliminate one proposed solution that is part of AB Our edits move to the description of AB the recommendation for allowing plants expected to come on line in or years to come on line earlier as single cycle facilities from the list of solutions We propose to move the proposal to expedite renewable generation to a comment that signing AB SB will expedite more than MW of new renewable generation by next summer This number is based on a CEC letter We propose to consolidate solutions and since both involve changes or additions to existing plants Finally we propose to modify the description of the CECs expedited siting process to reflect AB more
