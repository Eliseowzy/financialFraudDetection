<18527468.1075840489507.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,executive.office@enron.com,2002-03-29 09:18:54,Retention Severance Planpst To All US Domestic Employees From Office of the Chief Executive Earlier this week we reached final resolution with the Creditors Committee on a comprehensive retention and severance plan for employees of debtor companies or those parts of Enron in bankruptcy Later this morning we will file the plan with the bankruptcy court It will be public and posted on the courts website but we have posted the plan on See link below Other creditors and interested parties are allowed to review and comment on the plan After that the court may approve or modify it We have asked the court to expedite a hearing date to consider the plan and we anticipate a hearing will be scheduled as early as the middle of April We want you to know that this plan is the result of much negotiation and compromise between Enron and our Creditors Committee To be viable for approval by the bankruptcy court a plan has to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors This plan meets that criterion We know all of you are interested in the plans details so you can have some degree of financial certainty and make educated decisions for your future To help you fully understand how the retention and severance plan will work we should first explain some nearterm restructuring goals As we work to secure the most value for our creditors and other stakeholders restructuring requires us to determine which assets or businesses provide greater value by being sold as well as which assets or businesses provide greater value by generating ongoing cash flows We do have businesses and assets that are capable of emerging from bankruptcy We intend to separate those businesses from the liabilities and litigation facing the estate so they can succeed as part of a viable reorganized entity This will require us to identify employees best suited to liquidate noncore assets or wind down the estate as well as employees best suited to support an emerging business Given the inherent uncertainty of restructuring the retention and severance plan offers some measure of financial assurance to all employees of debtor companies regardless of their role within the organization The proposed plan is retroactive to March and has a maximum value up to million depending on the value of asset sales and other cash collections It includes the following components Severance benefits valued up to million Retention payments valued at million and Liquidation incentive pool which is a variable pool tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate with a minimum value of million and a maximum value of up to million one percent of the estates cash collection target of billion SEVERANCE BENEFITS A primary component of the proposed retention and severance plan is a new severance program for employees of debtor companies not currently participating in another plan Under the proposed plan employees will be eligible for two weeks base pay for every full or partial year of service with a maximum of eight weeks base pay and a minimum of If an employee resigns voluntarily or is terminated for cause he or she is not eligible for severance benefits Some nondebtor companies were able to recently institute separate severance plans for their employees This was possible because their plans do not require the approval of the bankruptcy court The details of those plans have been shared with employees of nondebtor companies RETENTION Under the proposed plan retention payments will be made to many employees in debtor companies whose skills or knowledge are required indefinitely or for a predetermined duration of the restructuring Regrettably not all employees will receive retention An eligible employees retention will be a percentage of his or her quarterly base salary At the beginning of each quarter or threemonth period eligible employees will be informed of their projected range of retention compensation for the period by their supervisors The actual quarterly payout an employee earns will be decided at the end of the quarter based on performance and achievements during the period An employee participating in the retention program will receive percent of the earned quarterly retention at the end of each period with payouts as soon as practical after May August November and February The remaining percent of the earned retention for a period is nonvested deferred and will be paid to an employee after February If involuntarily terminated without cause prior to February an employee will receive all deferred retention plus retention based on the actual earned salary for the quarter in which he or she is terminated Employees earned and deferred retention payments are considered postpetition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate An employee involuntarily terminated without cause is eligible for the greater of severance benefits or earned retention with the total amount of retention payments received offsetting the amount of severance received Depending on an employees personal circumstances a participant in the retention program may wish to consider setting aside some portion of retention as a financial safety net in the event he or she is involuntarily terminated If an employee receiving retention voluntarily resigns prior to February or is terminated for cause he or she does not earn a retention payment for that quarter and forfeits all deferred retention He or she would not be eligible for severance Any amounts not paid out are returned to the retention fund and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program LIQUIDATION INCENTIVE POOL Under the proposed plan employees identified as critical to the sale of noncore assets and businesses will be eligible to participate in the liquidation incentive pool LIP The amount of money in the pool will be directly tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate Enrons management committee will have discretion to assign incentive payments to participants in the liquidation pool after each million dollars is collected also called a collection milestone Fifty percent of an employees earned liquidation incentive for a collection period will be distributed at the time a milestone is reached The remaining percent of the earned liquidation incentive is nonvested and deferred If a collection milestone is not reached in a given quarter but progress has been made a quarterly advance may be allocated among participants of the program based on a quarterly floor amount of million Fifty percent of an employees quarterly advance will be paid as soon as practical after May August November and February The remaining percent of an earned advance will be nonvested and deferred and will offset against future incentive payments All accrued and deferred liquidation will be paid at the earlier of the following events Enrons reorganization is complete or the employee is involuntarily terminated without cause or upon specified dates related to incremental cash collections Employees earned and deferred liquidation incentives are considered postpetition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate Employees participating in the liquidation incentive pool are not eligible for severance benefits If an employee receiving liquidation incentives voluntarily resigns prior to February or is terminated for cause he or she will forfeit any deferred liquidation incentive payment and any minimum liquidation payment for the quarter in which he or she resigns Any amounts not paid out are returned to the liquidation incentive pool and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program OTHER ITEMS Bankruptcy law allows creditors to claim as fraudulent any significant payments made by a company in the day period prior to its bankruptcys filing To that end creditors may attempt to reclaim retention payments made prior to Enrons bankruptcy filing that they perceive were inappropriate or have not returned adequate value to the estate The Creditors Committee has agreed to forego its right to pursue claims against any current employee who agrees to release claims against the company and stays with the company through August or until he or she is involuntarily terminated without cause whichever comes first All debtor company employees will be required to sign a general release to receive their final severance benefits deferred quarterly retention payments or deferred liquidation payments We know how long you have waited for details about this plan We will instruct supervisors to begin communicating projected participation to each individual employee next week Although the Creditors Committee has approved it this proposed plan is not final until approved by the bankruptcy court Therefore it is possible an employees status could change depending on the final plan approved by the court Supervisors will hold follow up meetings with each employee to confirm his or her individual participation after the bankruptcy court rules on the plan To review the plan in its entirety click on the following link updatesretsevplanhtml

mentioned at the employee meeting in April this Friday May we will present to the Creditors Committee a plan to separate our core energy assets from the estate and the issues surrounding our bankruptcy through a process called a Sale These assets are viable businesses that represent Enrons roots If we are able to move quickly we believe this Sale process will allow us to maximize the value of these assets We intended to rollout our plan to employees early next week following the presentation to the Creditors Committee However the Wall Street Journal got a relatively final draft of our plan and were prepared to run a story today To ensure accuracy we decided to work with the Journal on their story and I participated in an interview late yesterday afternoon I certainly regret that you have to learn about our plans from the media rather than directly from me or other members of the management team Yet until we present to the Creditors Committee we are still not at liberty to share the full details of the plan with employees We look forward to proceeding with our rollout early next week In the meantime weve attached below the article from the Wall Street Journal Enron Plans Return to Its Roots Draft Proposal to Creditors Envisions a Smaller Firm Focused on Hard Assets By Rebecca Smith and Mitchell Pacelle The Wall Street Journal Enron Corp plans to reorganize as a small company under a new name according to a draft copy of the firms plans returning to its roots of a decade ago before the aggressive strategy that led to its spectacular expansion and then collapse Under plans scheduled to be presented to creditors Friday Enron would carve out a small integrated energy company with assets of about billion in North and South America The new entity would likely take a new name in order to escape the taint of Enrons fall and the baggage of numerous investigations into its finances It would then be put on the block in bankruptcy court quickly giving Enrons creditors the choice to retain a stake in the new company or sell it off whole or in parts if more attractive bids emerge Enron lost the confidence of creditors and investors as revelations emerged last fall that the Houstonbased company had hid debt and pumped up profit through a series of offbalancesheet ventures that in some cases enriched a handful of senior executives After failing to merge with rival Dynegy Corp the company sought bankruptcycourt protection in December the largest such filing in US history The new plan calls for a small operating company for now dubbed OpCO Energy Co to own power plants electric utilities naturalgas pipelines and liquefiednaturalgas facilities but little else The biggest properties would be the Portland General Electric utility in Oregon Elektro a Sao Paulobased Brazilian utility and about miles of pipeline assets on both continents less than half the amount of pipes that Enron once possessed The plan would essentially make the Enron successor little different from other US energy companies that provide electricity and natural gas giving it few advantages over competitors It would also make the new company more reliant than ever on volatile South American operations at a time when its US rivals are scaling back their commitments in the region Nevertheless Enrons new management team headed since January by restructuring specialist Stephen Cooper hopes that the creation of a new company will protect the assets it needs from a long bankruptcyreorganization process that could hurt their value Under the companys plan all of Enrons other assets would be liquidated in that process The number of employees would drop steeply from about today already down from a peak of before the bankruptcy to around In my view were going to be in bankruptcy for a number of years because of the difficulty were going to have resolving all of the claims Mr Cooper said in an interview yesterday afternoon after Enrons board had met to go over the plan A spinoff he said also could protect the new business from problems stemming from the bankruptcy such as customers wary of entering into new contracts and a welter of litigation and competing claims Customers who otherwise might shun Enron could embrace the new company Mr Cooper predicted Once were out from under what they will see is a company with great assets and great cash flow that can stand on its own two legs Enrons creditors wield enormous influence over how the bankruptcy reorganization will unfold Mr Cooper and his advisers will have to convince these unsecured creditors who have asserted billions of dollars in claims that they stand to recover more of their money by turning Enrons core assets into a new company than selling them off in a fire sale Because Enron now owes a fiduciary obligation to them these creditors have the power to press the company to alter the plan considerably or to proceed directly to a liquidation The creditors committee has a bunch of bright reasonable businesspeople on it said Mr Cooper Their goal to maximize value is consistent with ours Im confident that we will be able to make a case for value maximization by adopting this approach Luc Despins a lawyer for the creditors committee said he hadnt yet seen the plan and couldnt comment Protracted negotiations are likely to follow the Friday meeting If and when Enron reaches an accord with creditors Enron will file the plan with the bankruptcy court which must then approve it The proposed reorganization would sweep away a decade of rapid growth returning the company to its size in when former Chairman Kenneth Lay and thenPresident Richard Kinder were running the company Four years later Mr Kinder left Enron and was replaced by Jeffrey Skilling under whose leadership the company began to disparage hard assets and emphasize the energytrading business that eventually turned Enron into a far larger concern Whether the new company can escape the taint of Enron is far from certain The success of OpCo as a going concern will depend on its ability to separate reputationally from Enron the draft business plan says In addition to winning support from creditors Enron must disentangle itself from many complicated financial arrangements and an existing agreement to sell Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas Co a deal which hasnt yet closed In recent months new managers have devoted considerable energy to trying to understand Enrons complicated financial arrangements They are also trying to unravel the contents of a plethora of SPEs or specialpurpose entities They were created beginning in the mids as a way to pump up profits hide debt and raise money from outside investors The draft plan contains a list of assets Enron wishes to retain for the new company some of which may be entangled in these specialpurpose entities For example Centragas a pipeline company in Colombia is a proposed asset of the new company But separate internal spreadsheets reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show that controlling interest of that pipeline already had been pledged to two investment vehicles Rawhide LP and Whitewing LP They in turn may have passed along interests to other Enron entities Tombstone Assets LLC and Ponderosa Assets LP The company said it is trying to unwind many of the investment vehicles to gain clear title to the assets for the new company but it cautioned that the unwind and resolution of these structures may affect the financial results presented for the new company If the new company is created as outlined its pro forma net income based on past performance of the units it hopes to retain is projected to be million this year million next year million in and million by That is based on assets of billion currently rising to billion by Thats a far cry from what Enron claimed at its peak In the last year that full financial records were posted by the company Enron said its net income was million on billion in revenue Those numbers as well as financial statements in the previous three years were eventually retracted as Enron came under increasing scrutiny from investors and regulators The plan said the company wants to keep enough assets to form the basis of a new company because the market is already overloaded with properties for sale and prices arent very good Enrons collapse is partly to blame for that market glut because credit standards have been tightening forcing many energy firms to shed assets and pare debt

<24933034.1075841333686.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,executive.office@enron.com,2002-03-29 09:18:54,Retention Severance Planpst To All US Domestic Employees From Office of the Chief Executive Earlier this week we reached final resolution with the Creditors Committee on a comprehensive retention and severance plan for employees of debtor companies or those parts of Enron in bankruptcy Later this morning we will file the plan with the bankruptcy court It will be public and posted on the courts website but we have posted the plan on See link below Other creditors and interested parties are allowed to review and comment on the plan After that the court may approve or modify it We have asked the court to expedite a hearing date to consider the plan and we anticipate a hearing will be scheduled as early as the middle of April We want you to know that this plan is the result of much negotiation and compromise between Enron and our Creditors Committee To be viable for approval by the bankruptcy court a plan has to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors This plan meets that criterion We know all of you are interested in the plans details so you can have some degree of financial certainty and make educated decisions for your future To help you fully understand how the retention and severance plan will work we should first explain some nearterm restructuring goals As we work to secure the most value for our creditors and other stakeholders restructuring requires us to determine which assets or businesses provide greater value by being sold as well as which assets or businesses provide greater value by generating ongoing cash flows We do have businesses and assets that are capable of emerging from bankruptcy We intend to separate those businesses from the liabilities and litigation facing the estate so they can succeed as part of a viable reorganized entity This will require us to identify employees best suited to liquidate noncore assets or wind down the estate as well as employees best suited to support an emerging business Given the inherent uncertainty of restructuring the retention and severance plan offers some measure of financial assurance to all employees of debtor companies regardless of their role within the organization The proposed plan is retroactive to March and has a maximum value up to million depending on the value of asset sales and other cash collections It includes the following components Severance benefits valued up to million Retention payments valued at million and Liquidation incentive pool which is a variable pool tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate with a minimum value of million and a maximum value of up to million one percent of the estates cash collection target of billion SEVERANCE BENEFITS A primary component of the proposed retention and severance plan is a new severance program for employees of debtor companies not currently participating in another plan Under the proposed plan employees will be eligible for two weeks base pay for every full or partial year of service with a maximum of eight weeks base pay and a minimum of If an employee resigns voluntarily or is terminated for cause he or she is not eligible for severance benefits Some nondebtor companies were able to recently institute separate severance plans for their employees This was possible because their plans do not require the approval of the bankruptcy court The details of those plans have been shared with employees of nondebtor companies RETENTION Under the proposed plan retention payments will be made to many employees in debtor companies whose skills or knowledge are required indefinitely or for a predetermined duration of the restructuring Regrettably not all employees will receive retention An eligible employees retention will be a percentage of his or her quarterly base salary At the beginning of each quarter or threemonth period eligible employees will be informed of their projected range of retention compensation for the period by their supervisors The actual quarterly payout an employee earns will be decided at the end of the quarter based on performance and achievements during the period An employee participating in the retention program will receive percent of the earned quarterly retention at the end of each period with payouts as soon as practical after May August November and February The remaining percent of the earned retention for a period is nonvested deferred and will be paid to an employee after February If involuntarily terminated without cause prior to February an employee will receive all deferred retention plus retention based on the actual earned salary for the quarter in which he or she is terminated Employees earned and deferred retention payments are considered postpetition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate An employee involuntarily terminated without cause is eligible for the greater of severance benefits or earned retention with the total amount of retention payments received offsetting the amount of severance received Depending on an employees personal circumstances a participant in the retention program may wish to consider setting aside some portion of retention as a financial safety net in the event he or she is involuntarily terminated If an employee receiving retention voluntarily resigns prior to February or is terminated for cause he or she does not earn a retention payment for that quarter and forfeits all deferred retention He or she would not be eligible for severance Any amounts not paid out are returned to the retention fund and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program LIQUIDATION INCENTIVE POOL Under the proposed plan employees identified as critical to the sale of noncore assets and businesses will be eligible to participate in the liquidation incentive pool LIP The amount of money in the pool will be directly tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate Enrons management committee will have discretion to assign incentive payments to participants in the liquidation pool after each million dollars is collected also called a collection milestone Fifty percent of an employees earned liquidation incentive for a collection period will be distributed at the time a milestone is reached The remaining percent of the earned liquidation incentive is nonvested and deferred If a collection milestone is not reached in a given quarter but progress has been made a quarterly advance may be allocated among participants of the program based on a quarterly floor amount of million Fifty percent of an employees quarterly advance will be paid as soon as practical after May August November and February The remaining percent of an earned advance will be nonvested and deferred and will offset against future incentive payments All accrued and deferred liquidation will be paid at the earlier of the following events Enrons reorganization is complete or the employee is involuntarily terminated without cause or upon specified dates related to incremental cash collections Employees earned and deferred liquidation incentives are considered postpetition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate Employees participating in the liquidation incentive pool are not eligible for severance benefits If an employee receiving liquidation incentives voluntarily resigns prior to February or is terminated for cause he or she will forfeit any deferred liquidation incentive payment and any minimum liquidation payment for the quarter in which he or she resigns Any amounts not paid out are returned to the liquidation incentive pool and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program OTHER ITEMS Bankruptcy law allows creditors to claim as fraudulent any significant payments made by a company in the day period prior to its bankruptcys filing To that end creditors may attempt to reclaim retention payments made prior to Enrons bankruptcy filing that they perceive were inappropriate or have not returned adequate value to the estate The Creditors Committee has agreed to forego its right to pursue claims against any current employee who agrees to release claims against the company and stays with the company through August or until he or she is involuntarily terminated without cause whichever comes first All debtor company employees will be required to sign a general release to receive their final severance benefits deferred quarterly retention payments or deferred liquidation payments We know how long you have waited for details about this plan We will instruct supervisors to begin communicating projected participation to each individual employee next week Although the Creditors Committee has approved it this proposed plan is not final until approved by the bankruptcy court Therefore it is possible an employees status could change depending on the final plan approved by the court Supervisors will hold follow up meetings with each employee to confirm his or her individual participation after the bankruptcy court rules on the plan To review the plan in its entirety click on the following link updatesretsevplanhtml

mentioned at the employee meeting in April this Friday May we will present to the Creditors Committee a plan to separate our core energy assets from the estate and the issues surrounding our bankruptcy through a process called a Sale These assets are viable businesses that represent Enrons roots If we are able to move quickly we believe this Sale process will allow us to maximize the value of these assets We intended to rollout our plan to employees early next week following the presentation to the Creditors Committee However the Wall Street Journal got a relatively final draft of our plan and were prepared to run a story today To ensure accuracy we decided to work with the Journal on their story and I participated in an interview late yesterday afternoon I certainly regret that you have to learn about our plans from the media rather than directly from me or other members of the management team Yet until we present to the Creditors Committee we are still not at liberty to share the full details of the plan with employees We look forward to proceeding with our rollout early next week In the meantime weve attached below the article from the Wall Street Journal Enron Plans Return to Its Roots Draft Proposal to Creditors Envisions a Smaller Firm Focused on Hard Assets By Rebecca Smith and Mitchell Pacelle The Wall Street Journal Enron Corp plans to reorganize as a small company under a new name according to a draft copy of the firms plans returning to its roots of a decade ago before the aggressive strategy that led to its spectacular expansion and then collapse Under plans scheduled to be presented to creditors Friday Enron would carve out a small integrated energy company with assets of about billion in North and South America The new entity would likely take a new name in order to escape the taint of Enrons fall and the baggage of numerous investigations into its finances It would then be put on the block in bankruptcy court quickly giving Enrons creditors the choice to retain a stake in the new company or sell it off whole or in parts if more attractive bids emerge Enron lost the confidence of creditors and investors as revelations emerged last fall that the Houstonbased company had hid debt and pumped up profit through a series of offbalancesheet ventures that in some cases enriched a handful of senior executives After failing to merge with rival Dynegy Corp the company sought bankruptcycourt protection in December the largest such filing in US history The new plan calls for a small operating company for now dubbed OpCO Energy Co to own power plants electric utilities naturalgas pipelines and liquefiednaturalgas facilities but little else The biggest properties would be the Portland General Electric utility in Oregon Elektro a Sao Paulobased Brazilian utility and about miles of pipeline assets on both continents less than half the amount of pipes that Enron once possessed The plan would essentially make the Enron successor little different from other US energy companies that provide electricity and natural gas giving it few advantages over competitors It would also make the new company more reliant than ever on volatile South American operations at a time when its US rivals are scaling back their commitments in the region Nevertheless Enrons new management team headed since January by restructuring specialist Stephen Cooper hopes that the creation of a new company will protect the assets it needs from a long bankruptcyreorganization process that could hurt their value Under the companys plan all of Enrons other assets would be liquidated in that process The number of employees would drop steeply from about today already down from a peak of before the bankruptcy to around In my view were going to be in bankruptcy for a number of years because of the difficulty were going to have resolving all of the claims Mr Cooper said in an interview yesterday afternoon after Enrons board had met to go over the plan A spinoff he said also could protect the new business from problems stemming from the bankruptcy such as customers wary of entering into new contracts and a welter of litigation and competing claims Customers who otherwise might shun Enron could embrace the new company Mr Cooper predicted Once were out from under what they will see is a company with great assets and great cash flow that can stand on its own two legs Enrons creditors wield enormous influence over how the bankruptcy reorganization will unfold Mr Cooper and his advisers will have to convince these unsecured creditors who have asserted billions of dollars in claims that they stand to recover more of their money by turning Enrons core assets into a new company than selling them off in a fire sale Because Enron now owes a fiduciary obligation to them these creditors have the power to press the company to alter the plan considerably or to proceed directly to a liquidation The creditors committee has a bunch of bright reasonable businesspeople on it said Mr Cooper Their goal to maximize value is consistent with ours Im confident that we will be able to make a case for value maximization by adopting this approach Luc Despins a lawyer for the creditors committee said he hadnt yet seen the plan and couldnt comment Protracted negotiations are likely to follow the Friday meeting If and when Enron reaches an accord with creditors Enron will file the plan with the bankruptcy court which must then approve it The proposed reorganization would sweep away a decade of rapid growth returning the company to its size in when former Chairman Kenneth Lay and thenPresident Richard Kinder were running the company Four years later Mr Kinder left Enron and was replaced by Jeffrey Skilling under whose leadership the company began to disparage hard assets and emphasize the energytrading business that eventually turned Enron into a far larger concern Whether the new company can escape the taint of Enron is far from certain The success of OpCo as a going concern will depend on its ability to separate reputationally from Enron the draft business plan says In addition to winning support from creditors Enron must disentangle itself from many complicated financial arrangements and an existing agreement to sell Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas Co a deal which hasnt yet closed In recent months new managers have devoted considerable energy to trying to understand Enrons complicated financial arrangements They are also trying to unravel the contents of a plethora of SPEs or specialpurpose entities They were created beginning in the mids as a way to pump up profits hide debt and raise money from outside investors The draft plan contains a list of assets Enron wishes to retain for the new company some of which may be entangled in these specialpurpose entities For example Centragas a pipeline company in Colombia is a proposed asset of the new company But separate internal spreadsheets reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show that controlling interest of that pipeline already had been pledged to two investment vehicles Rawhide LP and Whitewing LP They in turn may have passed along interests to other Enron entities Tombstone Assets LLC and Ponderosa Assets LP The company said it is trying to unwind many of the investment vehicles to gain clear title to the assets for the new company but it cautioned that the unwind and resolution of these structures may affect the financial results presented for the new company If the new company is created as outlined its pro forma net income based on past performance of the units it hopes to retain is projected to be million this year million next year million in and million by That is based on assets of billion currently rising to billion by Thats a far cry from what Enron claimed at its peak In the last year that full financial records were posted by the company Enron said its net income was million on billion in revenue Those numbers as well as financial statements in the previous three years were eventually retracted as Enron came under increasing scrutiny from investors and regulators The plan said the company wants to keep enough assets to form the basis of a new company because the market is already overloaded with properties for sale and prices arent very good Enrons collapse is partly to blame for that market glut because credit standards have been tightening forcing many energy firms to shed assets and pare debt

<15939468.1075841388122.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,executive.office@enron.com,2002-03-29 09:18:54,Retention Severance Planpst To All US Domestic Employees From Office of the Chief Executive Earlier this week we reached final resolution with the Creditors Committee on a comprehensive retention and severance plan for employees of debtor companies or those parts of Enron in bankruptcy Later this morning we will file the plan with the bankruptcy court It will be public and posted on the courts website but we have posted the plan on See link below Other creditors and interested parties are allowed to review and comment on the plan After that the court may approve or modify it We have asked the court to expedite a hearing date to consider the plan and we anticipate a hearing will be scheduled as early as the middle of April We want you to know that this plan is the result of much negotiation and compromise between Enron and our Creditors Committee To be viable for approval by the bankruptcy court a plan has to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors This plan meets that criterion We know all of you are interested in the plans details so you can have some degree of financial certainty and make educated decisions for your future To help you fully understand how the retention and severance plan will work we should first explain some nearterm restructuring goals As we work to secure the most value for our creditors and other stakeholders restructuring requires us to determine which assets or businesses provide greater value by being sold as well as which assets or businesses provide greater value by generating ongoing cash flows We do have businesses and assets that are capable of emerging from bankruptcy We intend to separate those businesses from the liabilities and litigation facing the estate so they can succeed as part of a viable reorganized entity This will require us to identify employees best suited to liquidate noncore assets or wind down the estate as well as employees best suited to support an emerging business Given the inherent uncertainty of restructuring the retention and severance plan offers some measure of financial assurance to all employees of debtor companies regardless of their role within the organization The proposed plan is retroactive to March and has a maximum value up to million depending on the value of asset sales and other cash collections It includes the following components Severance benefits valued up to million Retention payments valued at million and Liquidation incentive pool which is a variable pool tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate with a minimum value of million and a maximum value of up to million one percent of the estates cash collection target of billion SEVERANCE BENEFITS A primary component of the proposed retention and severance plan is a new severance program for employees of debtor companies not currently participating in another plan Under the proposed plan employees will be eligible for two weeks base pay for every full or partial year of service with a maximum of eight weeks base pay and a minimum of If an employee resigns voluntarily or is terminated for cause he or she is not eligible for severance benefits Some nondebtor companies were able to recently institute separate severance plans for their employees This was possible because their plans do not require the approval of the bankruptcy court The details of those plans have been shared with employees of nondebtor companies RETENTION Under the proposed plan retention payments will be made to many employees in debtor companies whose skills or knowledge are required indefinitely or for a predetermined duration of the restructuring Regrettably not all employees will receive retention An eligible employees retention will be a percentage of his or her quarterly base salary At the beginning of each quarter or threemonth period eligible employees will be informed of their projected range of retention compensation for the period by their supervisors The actual quarterly payout an employee earns will be decided at the end of the quarter based on performance and achievements during the period An employee participating in the retention program will receive percent of the earned quarterly retention at the end of each period with payouts as soon as practical after May August November and February The remaining percent of the earned retention for a period is nonvested deferred and will be paid to an employee after February If involuntarily terminated without cause prior to February an employee will receive all deferred retention plus retention based on the actual earned salary for the quarter in which he or she is terminated Employees earned and deferred retention payments are considered postpetition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate An employee involuntarily terminated without cause is eligible for the greater of severance benefits or earned retention with the total amount of retention payments received offsetting the amount of severance received Depending on an employees personal circumstances a participant in the retention program may wish to consider setting aside some portion of retention as a financial safety net in the event he or she is involuntarily terminated If an employee receiving retention voluntarily resigns prior to February or is terminated for cause he or she does not earn a retention payment for that quarter and forfeits all deferred retention He or she would not be eligible for severance Any amounts not paid out are returned to the retention fund and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program LIQUIDATION INCENTIVE POOL Under the proposed plan employees identified as critical to the sale of noncore assets and businesses will be eligible to participate in the liquidation incentive pool LIP The amount of money in the pool will be directly tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate Enrons management committee will have discretion to assign incentive payments to participants in the liquidation pool after each million dollars is collected also called a collection milestone Fifty percent of an employees earned liquidation incentive for a collection period will be distributed at the time a milestone is reached The remaining percent of the earned liquidation incentive is nonvested and deferred If a collection milestone is not reached in a given quarter but progress has been made a quarterly advance may be allocated among participants of the program based on a quarterly floor amount of million Fifty percent of an employees quarterly advance will be paid as soon as practical after May August November and February The remaining percent of an earned advance will be nonvested and deferred and will offset against future incentive payments All accrued and deferred liquidation will be paid at the earlier of the following events Enrons reorganization is complete or the employee is involuntarily terminated without cause or upon specified dates related to incremental cash collections Employees earned and deferred liquidation incentives are considered postpetition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate Employees participating in the liquidation incentive pool are not eligible for severance benefits If an employee receiving liquidation incentives voluntarily resigns prior to February or is terminated for cause he or she will forfeit any deferred liquidation incentive payment and any minimum liquidation payment for the quarter in which he or she resigns Any amounts not paid out are returned to the liquidation incentive pool and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program OTHER ITEMS Bankruptcy law allows creditors to claim as fraudulent any significant payments made by a company in the day period prior to its bankruptcys filing To that end creditors may attempt to reclaim retention payments made prior to Enrons bankruptcy filing that they perceive were inappropriate or have not returned adequate value to the estate The Creditors Committee has agreed to forego its right to pursue claims against any current employee who agrees to release claims against the company and stays with the company through August or until he or she is involuntarily terminated without cause whichever comes first All debtor company employees will be required to sign a general release to receive their final severance benefits deferred quarterly retention payments or deferred liquidation payments We know how long you have waited for details about this plan We will instruct supervisors to begin communicating projected participation to each individual employee next week Although the Creditors Committee has approved it this proposed plan is not final until approved by the bankruptcy court Therefore it is possible an employees status could change depending on the final plan approved by the court Supervisors will hold follow up meetings with each employee to confirm his or her individual participation after the bankruptcy court rules on the plan To review the plan in its entirety click on the following link updatesretsevplanhtml
