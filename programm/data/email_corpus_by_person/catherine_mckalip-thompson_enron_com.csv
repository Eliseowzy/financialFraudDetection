KEELER EDITS Here is my draft for Ken in response to Anns eBiz request Comments welcome The President after a good deal of study and soul searching decided not to support mandatory controls on carbon dioxide CO emissions from power plants as part of a multipollutant clean air strategy His decision was based on some very important factors the nations energy markets are experiencing unprecedented supply and price challenges that any CO mandate could exacerbate and US regulation of CO in the nearterm could be illadvised because the Kyoto protocol on global treatment of greenhouse gas emissions is unworkable in its current form I was somewhat concerned that the message sent by the Bush administration would polarize the debate over how the US should treat CO emissions in the long term as his statement did provoke a very negative antienvironment reaction by many concerned individuals and organizations Because this is an important issue to all parties on all sides of the debate I believe that the administration should convene an ongoing process to carefully examine global climate change and all the longterm economic scientific and social impacts of action regulate CO emissions The Presidents position on CO notwithstanding Enron continue to be a private sector leader in offering real solutions towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a rapidly expanding energy market We are wellpositioned through our experience with lowcarbon fuels for electric generation natural gas and wind in particular our focus on new power generation and tecnologies our leadership position in promoting efficiency through Enron Energy Services energy outsourcing business and our expertise in emissions trading and risk management A multipollutant appraoch to reducing power plant emissions makes a lot of sense from and environmental and energy policy standpoint Enron will continue to work with the Bush administration and Congress toward structuring a program that can achieve environmental goals while providing incentives to build cleaner more efficient generation promoting a broad mix of fuels and tecnologies and giving industry the flexibility and economic incentives to make reductions in a marketbased costeffective way If were able to make meaningful reductions in pollutants NOx SO and mercury and we do it in a way that promotes efficiency and new technology well make progress on CO whether it is regulated or not In the meantime I will remain active in the global climate change debate to position Enron as a constructive player in the public policy arena and as

PR under Karen Denne and write for our internal eBiz publication I am working on a story about the recent issue with respect to carbon dioxide emissions and Enrons position compared to President Bushs as well as the coal industry I know that Bushs viewpoint on this issue is not to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from coalburning power plants I also understand he based his decision in large part due to a recent Department of Energy report that warns that such a policy would lead to an even more dramatic shift from coal to natural gas for electric power generation and significantly higher electricity prices causing problems similar to California I wondered if you would mind adding first hand knowledge for employees A quote from you about this issue would be great I would also be interested in giving employees some of your reasons for being in favor of controlling CO such as your idea for a credit trading system for CO Thank you for your time and please let me know if you have
