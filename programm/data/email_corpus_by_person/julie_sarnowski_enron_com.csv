Rebecca Grace indicates that Riverside is current on cash payments due Enron I recommend that we continue delivery until such time as Riverside refuses or they fail to make payment when due It may make sense to hold off on hedging the July Riverside position currently planned for next Thursday to see if they follow through on their threat In addition we may want to consider a written response to the vague threats contained in their May letter Harlan your opinion Original Message From Baughman Edward Sent Thursday May PM To Gang Lisa Sarnowski Julie Cavanaugh Darren Cc ONeil Murray P Elafandi Mo Murphy Harlan Sharp Vicki Erwin Kenton Miller Don Asset Mktg Semple Robert Subject City Of Riverside I just received notice from COR that they do not intend to schedule or pay for any further energy deliveries by Enron The notice is dated May Please let me know the instant Riverside refuses our energy delivery schedule Since we have purchased the entire month of June we will be in a position of liquidating that length should Riverside refuse delivery Once Riverside refuses delivery we should plan on attempting to schedule at least once again to demonstrate their intent to continue to refuse delivery Therefore we need to discuss strategy before selling Riverside length back into the market or alternatively booking out with the energy supplier Let me know if you have any questions Thanks Ed
