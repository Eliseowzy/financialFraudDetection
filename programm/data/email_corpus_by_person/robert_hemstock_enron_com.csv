Meeting with Alberta Department of Resource Development Rick Shapiro Aleck Dadson and I met with two senior officials from the Alberta Department of Resource Development last week Larry Charach Executive Director Electricity and Stan Wenger Assistant Deputy Minister Gas Alberta Markets and it is our view that the ADRD is not aware of Project Stanley based on some rather awkward questions we were asked by Larry Charach relating to our views on whether Powerex has complied with the spirit of the rules in Alberta Meeting with TransAlta and Other Alberta Marketers I attended a meeting of Alberta marketers last week hosted and organized by TransAltas trading group TransAlta proposed the companies in attendance form a coalition whose mandate and objective would be to retain counsel US and Canadian along with possibly other experts to assist the coalition in formulating a strategy designed to address concerns of the invited market participants with BC Hydro Power Supply BCHydro Grid Operations and Powerexs alleged improper use of the Network Economy Tariff provisions in the BC Hydro Wholesale Transmission Tariff The attendees at the meeting included representatives from of the Alberta PPA Buyers namely Enron TransCanada Power Engage Energy and Enmax along with Atco Power PanCanadian Duke Energy and Aquila In addition although Bonneville Power Administration was not in attendance it was interesting that TransAlta advised that BPA shared TransAltas concerns and was interested in working with this group to address these concerns At the meeting TransAlta walked the group through a specific example of a situation that occurred in May where TransAlta alleges that both it and TransCanada Power were blocked from using scheduled interruptible transmission capacity out of Alberta by BC Hydro Power Supply through its use of the Network Economy provisions in the BC Hydro Wholesale Transmission Tariff which has a higher priority than interruptible transmission during a period when prices were considerably higher in the Pacific Northwest than in Alberta As a result of the interruption of TransAltas and TransCanadas interruptible transmission reservation transmission capacity between AlbertaBC border and BCUS border became available and was immediately acquired by BC Hydro Power Supply and used to support Powerex exports during these periods into the US TransAlta estimates the opportunity cost of this curtailment to TransAlta was million TransAltas frustration is no surprise to Enron Canada I can advise that I wrote a memo to John Lavorato dated March in which I reviewed Enrons concerns regarding the behavior of BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerex that is very similar to the allegations presented by TransAlta The purpose of my memo to John L was to outline my initial thoughts on what Enron Canada may wish to do to attempt to stop this abuse and was focused on the idea of proceeding with a complaint to FERC that BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerex were exercising transmission market power Enron Canada did not pursue this any further at the time Among the ideas reviewed by TransAlta with the group to address and rectify the abuse it alleges exist on the transmission path between Alberta and the US Pacific Northwest included i a complaint to ADRD and a request they become involved ii a complaint to the Alberta Market Surveillance Administrator iii a complaint to FERC iv a complaint to the BCUC v a complaint to the BC Government vi a complaint to the NEB vii a complaint to the Competition Bureau andor viii a NAFTA complaint With respect to TransAltas comments relating to the Competition Bureau they advised the group that they have spoken to the Competition Bureau about their concerns and were told by the Competition Bureau that it is monitoring the Alberta electricity market Based on the description provided by TransAlta of its discussions with the Competition Bureau and other comments made by TransAlta at the meeting I do not believe TransAlta is aware of Project Stanley I believe the comments made by the TransAlta trader Enrons trader last month about the Competition Bureau were not about Project Stanley but were in the context of TransAlta complaining to the Competition Bureau about BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerexs alleged abuse of the Network Economy provisions in the Tariff The next step in the coalition building process is a meeting on September of those companies that wish to proceed to form a coalition The idea is that the coalition members would work out the terms of confidentiality documentation prior to any member sharing historical information that it may wish to provide relating to potential abuses by BC Hydro Power Supply or Powerex In addition they intend to begin to consider which of the possible courses of action described above would be most effective It appears from the discussion at the initial meeting that the option that involves a complaint to FERC is the most favored by TransAlta at this time Finally they intend to discuss a preliminary budget which TransAlta suggested may be in the range of Cdn if the group elects to proceed with a complaint to FERC There are without question a number of reasons why a decision that Enron Canada should not even consider having any part of this coalition in view of the Project Stanley matter is the safest strategy Having said this Enron Canada has a significant commercial interest in seeing this coalition with or without Enron achieve its objective to reduce or eliminate BC Hydro Power Supplys and Powerexs ability to use the Network Economy Service to block its competitors from access to import capacity into Alberta and export capacity into the US Enron Canadas recent acquisition of the Alberta Sundance B PPA MW of capacity dispatch rights in Alberta makes this issue even more commercially significant as the ability to contract for transmission capacity without the risk of a reasonable probability of curtailment as a result of BC Hydro Power Supply invoking Network Economy Service would represent a significant risk mitigant for Enrons Sundance B long position There is also some benefit of participating in the coalition to influence the direction it takes and to stay abreast of what it is doing I have discussed the matter with Rob Milnthorp and he agrees that the decision to participate in the coalition would obviously have to be considered and approved by those managing the Project Stanley issue If the decision of the Project Stanley team is that Enron Canada must steer clear of this coalition because of Project Stanley then Rob M and other commercial guys in ENA who do business with Powerex will not need to give further consideration to additional reasons why Enron Canada may elect not participate such as i the implications on Enron Canadas and ENAs commercial relationship with Powerex ii whether Enron Canada would be prepared to commit to anything more than attending the first meeting of the coalition with a view to understanding the nature of the confidentiality obligations the favored course of action and the budget iii whether Enron Canada would explicitly reserve the right to withdraw from the coalition at any time and iv whether Enron would want to be in a coalition with BPA who I understand we believe may also be engaged in exercising transmission market power To complicate this further Enron Canada is presently being sued by TransAlta over the interpretation of the wording in two swap transactions and Rob Milnthorp has indicated that Enron Canada will not agree to participate in any coalition with TransAlta unless and until TransAlta discontinues this lawsuit I look forward to your comments and feedback on this issue Regards Rob

Bureau that it is monitoring the Alberta electricity market Based on the description provided by TransAlta of its discussions with the Competition Bureau and other comments made by TransAlta at the meeting I do not believe TransAlta is aware of Project Stanley I believe the comments made by the TransAlta trader Enrons trader last month about the Competition Bureau were not about Project Stanley but were in the context of TransAlta complaining to the Competition Bureau about BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerexs alleged abuse of the Network Economy provisions in the Tariff The next step in the coalition building process is a meeting on September of those companies that wish to proceed to form a coalition The idea is that the coalition members would work out the terms of confidentiality documentation prior to any member sharing historical information that it may wish to provide relating to potential abuses by BC Hydro Power Supply or Powerex In addition they intend to begin to consider which of the possible courses of action described above would be most effective It appears from the discussion at the initial meeting that the option that involves a complaint to FERC is the most favored by TransAlta at this time Finally they intend to discuss a preliminary budget which TransAlta suggested may be in the range of Cdn if the group elects to proceed with a complaint to FERC There are without question a number of reasons why a decision that Enron Canada should not even consider having any part of this coalition in view of the Project Stanley matter is the safest strategy Having said this Enron Canada has a significant commercial interest in seeing this coalition with or without Enron achieve its objective to reduce or eliminate BC Hydro Power Supplys and Powerexs ability to use the Network Economy Service to block its competitors from access to import capacity into Alberta and export capacity into the US Enron Canadas recent acquisition of the Alberta Sundance B PPA MW of capacity dispatch rights in Alberta makes this issue even more commercially significant as the ability to contract for transmission capacity without the risk of a reasonable probability of curtailment as a result of BC Hydro Power Supply invoking Network Economy Service would represent a significant risk mitigant for Enrons Sundance B long position There is also some benefit of participating in the coalition to influence the direction it takes and to stay abreast of what it is doing I have discussed the matter with Rob Milnthorp and he agrees that the decision to participate in the coalition would obviously have to be considered and approved by those managing the Project Stanley issue If the decision of the Project Stanley team is that Enron Canada must steer clear of this coalition because of Project Stanley then Rob M and other commercial guys in ENA who do business with Powerex will not need to give further consideration to additional reasons why Enron Canada may elect not participate such as i the implications on Enron Canadas and ENAs commercial relationship with Powerex ii whether Enron Canada would be prepared to commit to anything more than attending the first meeting of the coalition with a view to understanding the nature of the confidentiality obligations the favored course of action and the budget iii whether Enron Canada would explicitly reserve the right to withdraw from the coalition at any time and iv whether Enron would want to be in a coalition with BPA who I understand we believe may also be engaged in exercising transmission market power To complicate this further Enron Canada is presently being sued by TransAlta over the interpretation of the wording in two swap transactions and Rob Milnthorp has indicated that Enron Canada will not agree to participate in any coalition with TransAlta unless and until TransAlta discontinues this lawsuit I look forward to your comments and feedback on this issue Regards Rob

Project Stanley Recent Meetings with Alberta Government and TransAlta Absent Milnthorps concern I believe we should participate in coalitions and issues that make business sense as this one appears to While we need to be cognizant of Stanley it should be business as usual so I would participate if that were the decision we would make absent Stanley We did nothing wrong in Stanley and this is an issue ie BC Hydropowerex transmission market power that needs to be remedied I would also ask Milnthorp to reconsider his objection to participating while were in litigation I think on issues like this where we have common ground that are unrelated to the litigation we need to rise above it and work to achieve the common objective Thanks To Richard B CT Jeffrey T CT Mark E CT Steven J ES Richard ES Aleck CT Mark NRON cc Rob CT Peter CT Subject Project Stanley Recent Meetings with Alberta Government and TransAlta Privileged and Confidential Please note I have not sent this memo to GPC Meeting with Alberta Department of Resource Development Rick Shapiro Aleck Dadson and I met with two senior officials from the Alberta Department of Resource Development last week Larry Charach Executive Director Electricity and Stan Wenger Assistant Deputy Minister Gas Alberta Markets and it is our view that the ADRD is not aware of Project Stanley based on some rather awkward questions we were asked by Larry Charach relating to our views on whether Powerex has complied with the spirit of the rules in Alberta Meeting with TransAlta and Other Alberta Marketers I attended a meeting of Alberta marketers last week hosted and organized by TransAltas trading group TransAlta proposed the companies in attendance form a coalition whose mandate and objective would be to retain counsel US and Canadian along with possibly other experts to assist the coalition in formulating a strategy designed to address concerns of the invited market participants with BC Hydro Power Supply BCHydro Grid Operations and Powerexs alleged improper use of the Network Economy Tariff provisions in the BC Hydro Wholesale Transmission Tariff The attendees at the meeting included representatives from of the Alberta PPA Buyers namely Enron TransCanada Power Engage Energy and Enmax along with Atco Power PanCanadian Duke Energy and Aquila In addition although Bonneville Power Administration was not in attendance it was interesting that TransAlta advised that BPA shared TransAltas concerns and was interested in working with this group to address these concerns At the meeting TransAlta walked the group through a specific example of a situation that occurred in May where TransAlta alleges that both it and TransCanada Power were blocked from using scheduled interruptible transmission capacity out of Alberta by BC Hydro Power Supply through its use of the Network Economy provisions in the BC Hydro Wholesale Transmission Tariff which has a higher priority than interruptible transmission during a period when prices were considerably higher in the Pacific Northwest than in Alberta As a result of the interruption of TransAltas and TransCanadas interruptible transmission reservation transmission capacity between AlbertaBC border and BCUS border became available and was immediately acquired by BC Hydro Power Supply and used to support Powerex exports during these periods into the US TransAlta estimates the opportunity cost of this curtailment to TransAlta was million TransAltas frustration is no surprise to Enron Canada I can advise that I wrote a memo to John Lavorato dated March in which I reviewed Enrons concerns regarding the behavior of BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerex that is very similar to the allegations presented by TransAlta The purpose of my memo to John L was to outline my initial thoughts on what Enron Canada may wish to do to attempt to stop this abuse and was focused on the idea of proceeding with a complaint to FERC that BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerex were exercising transmission market power Enron Canada did not pursue this any further at the time Among the ideas reviewed by TransAlta with the group to address and rectify the abuse it alleges exist on the transmission path between Alberta and the US Pacific Northwest included i a complaint to ADRD and a request they become involved ii a complaint to the Alberta Market Surveillance Administrator iii a complaint to FERC iv a complaint to the BCUC v a complaint to the BC Government vi a complaint to the NEB vii a complaint to the Competition Bureau andor viii a NAFTA complaint

Richard ES Aleck CT Mark NRON cc Rob CT Peter CT Subject Project Stanley Recent Meetings with Alberta Government and TransAlta Privileged and Confidential Please note I have not sent this memo to GPC Meeting with Alberta Department of Resource Development Rick Shapiro Aleck Dadson and I met with two senior officials from the Alberta Department of Resource Development last week Larry Charach Executive Director Electricity and Stan Wenger Assistant Deputy Minister Gas Alberta Markets and it is our view that the ADRD is not aware of Project Stanley based on some rather awkward questions we were asked by Larry Charach relating to our views on whether Powerex has complied with the spirit of the rules in Alberta Meeting with TransAlta and Other Alberta Marketers I attended a meeting of Alberta marketers last week hosted and organized by TransAltas trading group TransAlta proposed the companies in attendance form a coalition whose mandate and objective would be to retain counsel US and Canadian along with possibly other experts to assist the coalition in formulating a strategy designed to address concerns of the invited market participants with BC Hydro Power Supply BCHydro Grid Operations and Powerexs alleged improper use of the Network Economy Tariff provisions in the BC Hydro Wholesale Transmission Tariff The attendees at the meeting included representatives from of the Alberta PPA Buyers namely Enron TransCanada Power Engage Energy and Enmax along with Atco Power PanCanadian Duke Energy and Aquila In addition although Bonneville Power Administration was not in attendance it was interesting that TransAlta advised that BPA shared TransAltas concerns and was interested in working with this group to address these concerns At the meeting TransAlta walked the group through a specific example of a situation that occurred in May where TransAlta alleges that both it and TransCanada Power were blocked from using scheduled interruptible transmission capacity out of Alberta by BC Hydro Power Supply through its use of the Network Economy provisions in the BC Hydro Wholesale Transmission Tariff which has a higher priority than interruptible transmission during a period when prices were considerably higher in the Pacific Northwest than in Alberta As a result of the interruption of TransAltas and TransCanadas interruptible transmission reservation transmission capacity between AlbertaBC border and BCUS border became available and was immediately acquired by BC Hydro Power Supply and used to support Powerex exports during these periods into the US TransAlta estimates the opportunity cost of this curtailment to TransAlta was million TransAltas frustration is no surprise to Enron Canada I can advise that I wrote a memo to John Lavorato dated March in which I reviewed Enrons concerns regarding the behavior of BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerex that is very similar to the allegations presented by TransAlta The purpose of my memo to John L was to outline my initial thoughts on what Enron Canada may wish to do to attempt to stop this abuse and was focused on the idea of proceeding with a complaint to FERC that BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerex were exercising transmission market power Enron Canada did not pursue this any further at the time Among the ideas reviewed by TransAlta with the group to address and rectify the abuse it alleges exist on the transmission path between Alberta and the US Pacific Northwest included i a complaint to ADRD and a request they become involved ii a complaint to the Alberta Market Surveillance Administrator iii a complaint to FERC iv a complaint to the BCUC v a complaint to the BC Government vi a complaint to the NEB vii a complaint to the Competition Bureau andor viii a NAFTA complaint With respect to TransAltas comments relating to the Competition Bureau they advised the group that they have spoken to the Competition Bureau about their concerns and were told by the Competition Bureau that it is monitoring the Alberta electricity market Based on the description provided by TransAlta of its discussions with the Competition Bureau and other comments made by TransAlta at the meeting I do not believe TransAlta is aware of Project Stanley I believe the comments made by the TransAlta trader Enrons trader last month about the Competition Bureau were not about Project Stanley but were in the context of TransAlta complaining to the Competition Bureau about BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerexs alleged abuse of the Network Economy provisions in the Tariff The next step in the coalition building process is a meeting on September of those companies that wish to proceed to form a coalition The idea is that the coalition members would work out the terms of confidentiality documentation prior to any member sharing historical information that it may wish to provide relating to potential abuses by BC Hydro Power Supply or Powerex In addition they intend to begin to consider which of the possible courses of action described above would be most effective It appears from the discussion at the initial meeting that the option that involves a complaint to FERC is the most favored by TransAlta at this time Finally they intend to discuss a preliminary budget which TransAlta suggested may be in the range of Cdn if the group elects to proceed with a complaint to FERC There are without question a number of reasons why a decision that Enron Canada should not even consider having any part of this coalition in view of the Project Stanley matter is the safest strategy Having said this Enron Canada has a significant commercial interest in seeing this coalition with or without Enron achieve its objective to reduce or eliminate BC Hydro Power Supplys and Powerexs ability to use the Network Economy Service to block its competitors from access to import capacity into Alberta and export capacity into the US Enron Canadas recent acquisition of the Alberta Sundance B PPA MW of capacity dispatch rights in Alberta makes this issue even more commercially significant as the ability to contract for transmission capacity without the risk of a reasonable probability of curtailment as a result of BC Hydro Power Supply invoking Network Economy Service would represent a significant risk mitigant for Enrons Sundance B long position There is also some benefit of participating in the coalition to influence the direction it takes and to stay abreast of what it is doing I have discussed the matter with Rob Milnthorp and he agrees that the decision to participate in the coalition would obviously have to be considered and approved by those managing the Project Stanley issue If the decision of the Project Stanley team is that Enron Canada must steer clear of this coalition because of Project Stanley then Rob M and other commercial guys in ENA who do business with Powerex will not need to give further consideration to additional reasons why Enron Canada may elect not participate such as i the implications on Enron Canadas and ENAs commercial relationship with Powerex ii whether Enron Canada would be prepared to commit to anything more than attending the first meeting of the coalition with a view to understanding the nature of the confidentiality obligations the favored course of action and the budget iii whether Enron Canada would explicitly reserve the right to withdraw from the coalition at any time and iv whether Enron would want to be in a coalition with BPA who I understand we believe may also be engaged in exercising transmission market power To complicate this further Enron Canada is presently being sued by TransAlta over the interpretation of the wording in two swap transactions and Rob Milnthorp has indicated that Enron Canada will not agree to participate in any coalition with TransAlta unless and until TransAlta discontinues this lawsuit I look forward to your comments and feedback on this issue Regards Rob

attendance it was interesting that TransAlta advised that BPA shared TransAltas concerns and was interested in working with this group to address these concerns At the meeting TransAlta walked the group through a specific example of a situation that occurred in May where TransAlta alleges that both it and TransCanada Power were blocked from using scheduled interruptible transmission capacity out of Alberta by BC Hydro Power Supply through its use of the Network Economy provisions in the BC Hydro Wholesale Transmission Tariff which has a higher priority than interruptible transmission during a period when prices were considerably higher in the Pacific Northwest than in Alberta As a result of the interruption of TransAltas and TransCanadas interruptible transmission reservation transmission capacity between AlbertaBC border and BCUS border became available and was immediately acquired by BC Hydro Power Supply and used to support Powerex exports during these periods into the US TransAlta estimates the opportunity cost of this curtailment to TransAlta was million TransAltas frustration is no surprise to Enron Canada I can advise that I wrote a memo to John Lavorato dated March in which I reviewed Enrons concerns regarding the behavior of BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerex that is very similar to the allegations presented by TransAlta The purpose of my memo to John L was to outline my initial thoughts on what Enron Canada may wish to do to attempt to stop this abuse and was focused on the idea of proceeding with a complaint to FERC that BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerex were exercising transmission market power Enron Canada did not pursue this any further at the time Among the ideas reviewed by TransAlta with the group to address and rectify the abuse it alleges exist on the transmission path between Alberta and the US Pacific Northwest included i a complaint to ADRD and a request they become involved ii a complaint to the Alberta Market Surveillance Administrator iii a complaint to FERC iv a complaint to the BCUC v a complaint to the BC Government vi a complaint to the NEB vii a complaint to the Competition Bureau andor viii a NAFTA complaint With respect to TransAltas comments relating to the Competition Bureau they advised the group that they have spoken to the Competition Bureau about their concerns and were told by the Competition Bureau that it is monitoring the Alberta electricity market Based on the description provided by TransAlta of its discussions with the Competition Bureau and other comments made by TransAlta at the meeting I do not believe TransAlta is aware of Project Stanley I believe the comments made by the TransAlta trader Enrons trader last month about the Competition Bureau were not about Project Stanley but were in the context of TransAlta complaining to the Competition Bureau about BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerexs alleged abuse of the Network Economy provisions in the Tariff The next step in the coalition building process is a meeting on September of those companies that wish to proceed to form a coalition The idea is that the coalition members would work out the terms of confidentiality documentation prior to any member sharing historical information that it may wish to provide relating to potential abuses by BC Hydro Power Supply or Powerex In addition they intend to begin to consider which of the possible courses of action described above would be most effective It appears from the discussion at the initial meeting that the option that involves a complaint to FERC is the most favored by TransAlta at this time Finally they intend to discuss a preliminary budget which TransAlta suggested may be in the range of Cdn if the group elects to proceed with a complaint to FERC There are without question a number of reasons why a decision that Enron Canada should not even consider having any part of this coalition in view of the Project Stanley matter is the safest strategy Having said this Enron Canada has a significant commercial interest in seeing this coalition with or without Enron achieve its objective to reduce or eliminate BC Hydro Power Supplys and Powerexs ability to use the Network Economy Service to block its competitors from access to import capacity into Alberta and export capacity into the US Enron Canadas recent acquisition of the Alberta Sundance B PPA MW of capacity dispatch rights in Alberta makes this issue even more commercially significant as the ability to contract for transmission capacity without the risk of a reasonable probability of curtailment as a result of BC Hydro Power Supply invoking Network Economy Service would represent a significant risk mitigant for Enrons Sundance B long position There is also some benefit of participating in the coalition to influence the direction it takes and to stay abreast of what it is doing I have discussed the matter with Rob Milnthorp and he agrees that the decision to participate in the coalition would obviously have to be considered and approved by those managing the Project Stanley issue If the decision of the Project Stanley team is that Enron Canada must steer clear of this coalition because of Project Stanley then Rob M and other commercial guys in ENA who do business with Powerex will not need to give further consideration to additional reasons why Enron Canada may elect not participate such as i the implications on Enron Canadas and ENAs commercial relationship with Powerex ii whether Enron Canada would be prepared to commit to anything more than attending the first meeting of the coalition with a view to understanding the nature of the confidentiality obligations the favored course of action and the budget iii whether Enron Canada would explicitly reserve the right to withdraw from the coalition at any time and iv whether Enron would want to be in a coalition with BPA who I understand we believe may also be engaged in exercising transmission market power To complicate this further Enron Canada is presently being sued by TransAlta over the interpretation of the wording in two swap transactions and Rob Milnthorp has indicated that Enron Canada will not agree to participate in any coalition with TransAlta unless and until TransAlta discontinues this lawsuit I look forward to your comments and feedback on this issue Regards Rob

sent this memo to GPC Meeting with Alberta Department of Resource Development Rick Shapiro Aleck Dadson and I met with two senior officials from the Alberta Department of Resource Development last week Larry Charach Executive Director Electricity and Stan Wenger Assistant Deputy Minister Gas Alberta Markets and it is our view that the ADRD is not aware of Project Stanley based on some rather awkward questions we were asked by Larry Charach relating to our views on whether Powerex has complied with the spirit of the rules in Alberta Meeting with TransAlta and Other Alberta Marketers I attended a meeting of Alberta marketers last week hosted and organized by TransAltas trading group TransAlta proposed the companies in attendance form a coalition whose mandate and objective would be to retain counsel US and Canadian along with possibly other experts to assist the coalition in formulating a strategy designed to address concerns of the invited market participants with BC Hydro Power Supply BCHydro Grid Operations and Powerexs alleged improper use of the Network Economy Tariff provisions in the BC Hydro Wholesale Transmission Tariff The attendees at the meeting included representatives from of the Alberta PPA Buyers namely Enron TransCanada Power Engage Energy and Enmax along with Atco Power PanCanadian Duke Energy and Aquila In addition although Bonneville Power Administration was not in attendance it was interesting that TransAlta advised that BPA shared TransAltas concerns and was interested in working with this group to address these concerns At the meeting TransAlta walked the group through a specific example of a situation that occurred in May where TransAlta alleges that both it and TransCanada Power were blocked from using scheduled interruptible transmission capacity out of Alberta by BC Hydro Power Supply through its use of the Network Economy provisions in the BC Hydro Wholesale Transmission Tariff which has a higher priority than interruptible transmission during a period when prices were considerably higher in the Pacific Northwest than in Alberta As a result of the interruption of TransAltas and TransCanadas interruptible transmission reservation transmission capacity between AlbertaBC border and BCUS border became available and was immediately acquired by BC Hydro Power Supply and used to support Powerex exports during these periods into the US TransAlta estimates the opportunity cost of this curtailment to TransAlta was million TransAltas frustration is no surprise to Enron Canada I can advise that I wrote a memo to John Lavorato dated March in which I reviewed Enrons concerns regarding the behavior of BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerex that is very similar to the allegations presented by TransAlta The purpose of my memo to John L was to outline my initial thoughts on what Enron Canada may wish to do to attempt to stop this abuse and was focused on the idea of proceeding with a complaint to FERC that BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerex were exercising transmission market power Enron Canada did not pursue this any further at the time Among the ideas reviewed by TransAlta with the group to address and rectify the abuse it alleges exist on the transmission path between Alberta and the US Pacific Northwest included i a complaint to ADRD and a request they become involved ii a complaint to the Alberta Market Surveillance Administrator iii a complaint to FERC iv a complaint to the BCUC v a complaint to the BC Government vi a complaint to the NEB vii a complaint to the Competition Bureau andor viii a NAFTA complaint With respect to TransAltas comments relating to the Competition Bureau they advised the group that they have spoken to the Competition Bureau about their concerns and were told by the Competition Bureau that it is monitoring the Alberta electricity market Based on the description provided by TransAlta of its discussions with the Competition Bureau and other comments made by TransAlta at the meeting I do not believe TransAlta is aware of Project Stanley I believe the comments made by the TransAlta trader Enrons trader last month about the Competition Bureau were not about Project Stanley but were in the context of TransAlta complaining to the Competition Bureau about BC Hydro Power Supply and Powerexs alleged abuse of the Network Economy provisions in the Tariff The next step in the coalition building process is a meeting on September of those companies that wish to proceed to form a coalition The idea is that the coalition members would work out the terms of confidentiality documentation prior to any member sharing historical information that it may wish to provide relating to potential abuses by BC Hydro Power Supply or Powerex In addition they intend to begin to consider which of the possible courses of action described above would be most effective It appears from the discussion at the initial meeting that the option that involves a complaint to FERC is the most favored by TransAlta at this time Finally they intend to discuss a preliminary budget which TransAlta suggested may be in the range of Cdn if the group elects to proceed with a complaint to FERC There are without question a number of reasons why a decision that Enron Canada should not even consider having any part of this coalition in view of the Project Stanley matter is the safest strategy Having said this Enron Canada has a significant commercial interest in seeing this coalition with or without Enron achieve its objective to reduce or eliminate BC Hydro Power Supplys and Powerexs ability to use the Network Economy Service to block its competitors from access to import capacity into Alberta and export capacity into the US Enron Canadas recent acquisition of the Alberta Sundance B PPA MW of capacity dispatch rights in Alberta makes this issue even more commercially significant as the ability to contract for transmission capacity without the risk of a reasonable probability of curtailment as a result of BC Hydro Power Supply invoking Network Economy Service would represent a significant risk mitigant for Enrons Sundance B long position There is also some benefit of participating in the coalition to influence the direction it takes and to stay abreast of what it is doing I have discussed the matter with Rob Milnthorp and he agrees that the decision to participate in the coalition would obviously have to be considered and approved by those managing the Project Stanley issue If the decision of the Project Stanley team is that Enron Canada must steer clear of this coalition because of Project Stanley then Rob M and other commercial guys in ENA who do business with Powerex will not need to give further consideration to additional reasons why Enron Canada may elect not participate such as i the implications on Enron Canadas and ENAs commercial relationship with Powerex ii whether Enron Canada would be prepared to commit to anything more than attending the first meeting of the coalition with a view to understanding the nature of the confidentiality obligations the favored course of action and the budget iii whether Enron Canada would explicitly reserve the right to withdraw from the coalition at any time and iv whether Enron would want to be in a coalition with BPA who I understand we believe may also be engaged in exercising transmission market power To complicate this further Enron Canada is presently being sued by TransAlta over the interpretation of the wording in two swap transactions and Rob Milnthorp has indicated that Enron Canada will not agree to participate in any coalition with TransAlta unless and until TransAlta discontinues this lawsuit I look forward to your comments and feedback on this issue Regards Rob

stay abreast of what it is doing I have discussed the matter with Rob Milnthorp and he agrees that the decision to participate in the coalition would obviously have to be considered and approved by those managing the Project Stanley issue If the decision of the Project Stanley team is that Enron Canada must steer clear of this coalition because of Project Stanley then Rob M and other commercial guys in ENA who do business with Powerex will not need to give further consideration to additional reasons why Enron Canada may elect not participate such as i the implications on Enron Canadas and ENAs commercial relationship with Powerex ii whether Enron Canada would be prepared to commit to anything more than attending the first meeting of the coalition with a view to understanding the nature of the confidentiality obligations the favored course of action and the budget iii whether Enron Canada would explicitly reserve the right to withdraw from the coalition at any time and iv whether Enron would want to be in a coalition with BPA who I understand we believe may also be engaged in exercising transmission market power To complicate this further Enron Canada is presently being sued by TransAlta over the interpretation of the wording in two swap transactions and Rob Milnthorp has indicated that Enron Canada will not agree to participate in any coalition with TransAlta unless and until TransAlta discontinues this lawsuit I look forward to your comments and feedback on this issue Regards Rob

request and subsequent approval Please let me know if anyone disagrees with me on this Regards Rob Original Message From Hemstock Robert Sent Friday August PM To Harold R Huber Email Cc Dave Vetsch Email Subject Enron Position ATCO Affiliate Code of Conduct Hearing Harold I have consolidated the relevant documents you have been working with to prepare your cross into one email for ease of reference a Power Budd Preliminary Report dated July b The Enron CodeAtco Code Matrix c The Power Budd CodeAtco Code Matrix For the purpose of confirming the instructions I provided to you my interest is not to reduce your crossexamination to a word smithing exercisenegotiation with the ATCO witness but rather to put to the ATCO witness questions in specific areas that the ATCO Code has either addressed insufficiently or not addressed at all The very best possible result we could achieve would be for the Board to direct ATCO to refile a code that is consistent with the Power Budd Code with the exception that to the extent that ATCO does not incorporate a provision in the Power Budd Code it must provide the Board with an explanation as to why the provision was not included in the ATCO Code I recognize you have some concerns about putting the Power Budd Report on the record in the event ATCO can selectively use a portion of it to our detriment Based on my review of the Report I think this risk is very small compared to the benefit of providing the Board with a comprehensive Report prepared by a consultant that was hired by the Alberta Government and consulted all affected parties in Alberta including ATCO prior to preparing the Report Therefore I think you should try to get the Report placed into evidence We can discuss this further if you disagree My sense is that the following areas of the proposed ATCO Code should be addressed in your crossexamination Applicability of the Code The ATCO Code must apply to all affiliates not just ATCOs unregulated affiliates as ATCO has a number of regulated businesses in Alberta the regulated affiliates of the utility to which the code applies must govern this relationship also See Vanderveen Page Nondiscrimination see PB Report page The absence of any reference to this by ATCO in their code other than the one sentence in the Purpose section leaves the code significantly deficient Our key concern here is that the code makes it abundantly clear that a utility must not provide its affiliates with preferential treatment relative to its treatment of unaffiliated companies See Blanks in matrix and PB Report page Separation see PB Report page a Separate Corporate Entity Each regulated ATCO utility and should be a separate corporate entity from its unregulated affiliates I believe they have done this in their reorganization so they should not oppose this requirement in the code b Sharing of Facilities Atco code is very brief and PB is preferable as it defines what cannot be shared c Corporate Support Clearly ATCO is advocating no restrictions on corporate oversight versus PB which talks about allowing it subject to some restrictions and emphasizes pricing rules d Joint Purchases Atco has no requirement respecting appropriate cost sharing relative to benefit or mention of certain products or services that are not appropriate to jointly acquire such as the energy commodity e Separate Officers a limit of of Board of the utility should not also be members of unregulated affiliates is reasonable f Sharing of Employees Atco want to share those who dont have access to Confidential Info EnronPB advocate no sharing g Employee Movement there should be a time limit ie one year on employees not being able to transfer back and forth between the utility and the affiliate h Other Sharing Prohibitions see PB Code c g Transfer Pricing The key point here is definition and application of fair market value As per Enron Code the onus should be on utility to prove product or service acquired at FMV See PB page Marketing and Advertising Pursue the need for no joint marketing equal access to written communication clear rules on responses to customer requests for retailer information provision of leads to affiliates See PB Report page Compliance Plan Atco has no requirement for development of a plan or its contents See PB Report page Audit and Record Keeping Atco has no audit requirements Atco should also be required to keep a complaints log and disclose the records it is required to keep to industry participants See PB Report page Enforcement and Penalties ATCO Code has no provisions whatsoever under this category See PB Report page Regards Rob

adding another individu al to our Canadian team based in Calgary and Aleck invited me to prepare a description of the need and our circumstances for your review I understand Derek Davies and Rob Milnthorp spoke to John Lavorato about th e need for additional support for our PPA exposure last week They tell me that John agreed with them that we need additional transmission rate design experience inhouse in Calgary given we are exposed through our PPA positi on to considerable transmission rate risk From Dereks and Robs perspect ive the dedication of an additional individual to assist in managing outst anding transmission rate related matters that have not yet been addressed and other issues that impact the value of our PPA could be conservatively quantified as in excess of Cdn million over the year life of the PPA While this person does not necessarily have to be in the Government Affa irs Group my sense is that our group would be a much better fit than havin g the person join our commercial group Background The Alberta Conservatives were reelected with a significant majority in Ma rch and is now in the early years of a new four year mandate The new Minister of Energy has reaffirmed the vision and commitment of the Alberta Government to electricity restructuring which started to a limited degree in with the deregulation of generation and the creation of a power poo l and transmission administrator Effective Jan the formerly regul ated generation was sold in the form of Power Purchase Arrangements and ret ail customer choice for all classes of electricity customers was introduced In late August Enron Canada purchased the MW Sundance B PPA in the PPA Auction for an up front price of Cdn million and assumption of th e fixed and variable costs over the year starting Jan remainin g base life of units and of the Sundance B Power Plant of approximately Cdn billion The Sundance Power Plant is owned by TransAlta Corporatio n and located west of Edmonton in central Alberta In Q Enron Canada launched Enron Direct in Alberta which is a retail supplier of natural gas and electricity whose initial target market is comm ercial customers of all sizes Enron Direct recently began operating in On tario and will initially serve the same market segment as the Alberta opera tion Enron Directs initial business plan does not involve serving reside ntial customers but it is expected that Enron Direct will expand its target market to include these customers within years Current Government Affairs Coverage Fino Tiberi joined the Government Affairs team on May and his focu s has been on dealing with market design and implementation issues that imp act the risk profile and profitability of Enron Directs retail electricity and gas business in Alberta In particular the Alberta electricity retai l market is in the very early stages of development and the first months of operation have revealed some significant design flaws in the initial set tlement process that have implications for Enron Direct In addition othe r issues need to be addressed such as exit fees unreasonable distribution tariffs lack of oversight of municipal utilities The government has ind icated that one of its top priorities is address the problems with the pres ent retail market design Fino has also had some limited involvement in su pporting Enron Directs retail initiative in Ontario and has recently began investigating the current status of the retail gas market in BC with a vie w to advising Enron Direct on the requirements for entry and the market des ign issues that must be addressed It is reasonable to assess the task of influencing retail market design and providing informationsupport to Enron Directs commercial staff in Albert a and Ontario as requiring Finos full time attention for the next years Since Finos arrival my focus has primarily been on providing input and co mments to the Alberta Government Power Pool of Alberta Transmission Admin istrator and AEUB on wholesale electricity matters and to a lesser extent s ome retail gas matters unbundling code of conduct In addition I have been working closely with the Enron Canada commercial and legal groups on n umerous issues that impact the value of or relate to commercial opportunit ies arising out of the Sundance B PPA position This includes issues such as Alberta Government approval to split the Sundance B PPA into two small er PPAs for resale by Enron Canada treatment of the unsold PPAs transmiss ion congestion issues transmission tariff issues energy importexport rul es power pool rule changes Transmission issues are of particular interes t to Enron given Albertas unique transmission rate design regime under whi ch suppliers in Alberta pay of the transmission revenue requirement M any of these issues are complex and in many cases the implications of their outcome impact Enron Canadas Sundance PPA position by millions of dollars For example Enron Canada is leading a coalition of PPA Buyers Derek Da vies and I will be on the PPA Buyer Coalition witness panel that is presen tly involved in an AEUB hearing to contest the STS rate schedule proposed b y the Transmission Administrator that if approved will have the effect of requiring the PPA Buyers to pay for transmission capacity that is used sol ely by the PPA Owners for their own financial benefit Enron Canada estima tes the value of it prevailing in this application over the year life of the PPA is approximately Cdn million Staffing Requirements and External Resources Going Forward A number of key wholesale market issues are yet to be debated and resolved such as transmission congestion the consolidation of the TA and Power Poo l the role of the Balancing Pool in managing the unsold PPAs the future d esign of the transmission tariff ie whether generators should continue to pay one half of the costs of the deepbulk transmission system export import transmission access power pool price caps and other distortionary p ool rules such as those that exclude importers from setting pool price aut hority of the market surveillance administrator and amendments to the Elec tric Utilities Act in spring My initial plan was to manage these issues myself and rely on the approval of RCRs to obtain ongoing support from the team of external consultants I have worked with TCA Frontier Altitude Energy to assist me in circumst ances where the issues are technically complex andor where I am unable to commit the time necessary to develop Enrons positioninput on an issue T his has worked but it is clear that given the scope complexity and numbe r of the issues in Alberta that we must be involved in given the value at r isk of our Sundance PPA position it can reasonably be concluded that the c ost of these resources over the next two years will far exceed the cost of a full time Director level Government Affairs staff member familiar with th e Alberta electricity market design and more specifically the Power Pool an d Transmission Administrator designs including the TAs rates and tariff In addition these consultants are much less accessible to our commercial staff than a fulltime employee I anticipate the most substantial changes in the Alberta electricity market design will occur over the next years as this is the period during which the Government itself and via pressure on the institutions it oversees A EUB Power Pool TA will implement changes with a view to then leaving a period of two full years prior to the next provincial election for the mark et to respond There is a clear need for at least this period of time for fulltime coverage of Alberta electricity issues alone Proposed Individual Randy Stubbings is currently Director Regulatory Affairs at ESBI Alberta Limited the Transmission Administrator and is responsible for the TAs fi lings before the AEUB I have known Randy for approximately years and ha ve found him to be an intelligent and reasonable individual who is well res pected by the Government AEUB and other industry participants Randy is c apable of providing immediate and valuable advice and input in the developm ent of Enron Canadas participation in the transmission related matters tha t could impact Enron Canada including the STS Rate Schedule issue the hea ring will resume on Nov His technical background and experience along with his long term involvement in various Alberta electricity market issue s would be of significant and immediate benefit to Enron Canadas commercia l group Derek Davies has had some limited dealings with Randy and has wa tched Randy as one of EALs witnesses at the STS hearing and has been impr essed with his knowledge and expertise Randy called me recently to advise that he was interested in leaving ESBI a nd thought Enron would be a challenging and interesting place to work He advised that the current salary including bonus for a person of his level at ESBI is between Cdn If the position is approved I would propose we not proceed through the normal recruiting process but rat her immediately have Randy meet firstly with Aleck and I then with Derek D
