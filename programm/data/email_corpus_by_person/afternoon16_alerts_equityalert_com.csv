Includes TIs Mbps TechnologyD Mandatory Modes a OFDM in the GHz band and b CCK Optional Modes PBCC From TI and CCKOFDM DALLAS Nov PRNewswire via COMTEX As a leading participant in the ongoing work of the IEEE g Task Group members from Texas Instruments Incorpo rated NYSE TXN TI helped the body reach a critical technology selectio n for the g standard for highrate wireless networking in the GHz band which will allow multimedia applications to be wirelessly networked a nd enable the next generation of wireless LAN devices for consumers The ne w draft standard a compromise proposal from TI Intersil Corp and several other companies combines elements from the final two independent proposal s that were originally considered for the g standard It offers compa tibility with b and a set of datarates up to Mbps in the GHz ba nd In addition the new draft standard also contains modes of operation us ing PBCC and CCKOFDM This integration of modes will enable consumer pr oducts to support multiple modulations and provides a clear bridge from M bps to Mbps data rates The IEEE has defined a clear path for g that bridges and Mbps making multimode products based on one st andard a reality said Allen Nogee senior analyst Cahners InStatMRD B y already offering Mbps capabilities with the ACX TI and its customer s are well positioned to enable the first step in the deployment of g compliant products in the GHz band The g draft standard utili zes framework from the original proposals for g which called for OFDM in the GHz band as an optional mode to the primary proposed modulation either PBCC or CCKOFDM The g draft standard has two mandatory m odes OFDM offering a data rates in the GHz band and implementati on of b CCK for full backward compatibility It also offers two optio nal modes of PBCC and CCKOFDM to support rates up to Mbps This bala nced compromise offers a much clearer bridge between the a and b standards plus is a straightforward means to develop true multimodeRF devices TI supports the new IEEE g draft standard and commends th e group for its work to reach a wellbalanced compromise that offers the WL AN industry a clear path to support multiple modes within a single standard said Marc Cetto general manager Wireless Networking at TI This is a p ositive development for customers offering or developing products based on TIs ACX solution providing b compliance with differentiating exte nded data rates via PBCC now and be confident that their solutions are fully embraced by the standards organization Now that the techno logy behind g has been clarified TI will be developing gcompl iant devices by using elements of its existing b solution as well as its a work in progress for availability in mid Additionally since TIs PBCC is specified in the g draft the companys existi ng devices which already offer this higher rate feature will be able to i nteroperate at Mbps with the companys gcompliant devices that wil l also offer PBCC This ensures a high degree of forward compatible int eroperability at this higher data rate while maintaining full b comp liance TI is currently shipping the ACX to customers offering b c ompatibility with g standards compliant Mbps extended data rates al lowing them to quickly differentiate their products in a less confusing WLA N ecosystem TI is a strong proponent of industry standards and has cons istently and proactively worked with TGg to find a compromise proposal that would be acceptable to all the members This effort has paid off in the cr eation and selection of a compelling proposal in which multiple parties can walk away as winners most notably end consumers of WLAN products said Bill Carney director of business development Wireless Networking at TI Texas Instruments Incorporated is the world leader in digital signal proce ssing and analog technologies the semiconductor engines of the Internet ag e The companys businesses also include sensors and controls and educatio nal and productivity solutions TI is headquartered in Dallas Texas and ha s manufacturing or sales operations in more than countries Texas Inst ruments is traded on the New York
