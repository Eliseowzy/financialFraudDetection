Kim S CT Bill D ct Stacy E CT Subject Re DivisionTradename Audit part deux Okay folks We are starting in on the DivisionTradename audit our side of the equation As it stands we are not going to terminate any existing contracts with counterparties that are classified as Division or Tradename However what we are going to do is to verify that the name on any existing master contracts matches the name as it exists in the Global Counterparty database So what we need to do is to view all of the attached master contracts please note that the attached spreadsheet has tabs Physical Financial Transportation and verify how the names are listed on the contract how the counterparty executed the contract Please email me any differences you come across Remember watch for name change notices assignment notices etc while reviewing these contracts Anthony Since Georgi is out would you mind verifying the Financial contracts only SylviaMarlene I know that in many cases your records wont have master contracts or actual paper however there is a tab for transportation related contracts many of them are status executed Where at all possible please verify counterparty names primarily any changes made on the financial or physical side can impact any executed agreements we may have on the transport side name might be one way on a phy contract another way on a transport contract Then we can at least make sure that changes wont negate anything we have on either side Please try to get this done as soon as possible Id like to have all variations by end of the day tomorrow Wednesday If you are working on something else at the moment please let me know Ill add the contracts to my list to review This project is fairly important we need to wrap it up as soon as we can Thank you all Cyndie Stacey CT AM To Cyndie Balfour NRON cc Linda S CT Kim S TheriotHOUECT Bill D ct Stacy E CT Subject Re DivisionTradename Audit part deux Oh yes this will be a choice project So Credit or Legal hasnt requested the number of deals attached to any of those contracts I assumed that would be part of the original evaluation Id be concerned with which of those masters were trading under now as well as how many deals volume etc Once you hear from Legal and we have an idea of what needs to be done then lets all set up a meeting to discuss within Global Contracts We can then follow up with Credit and Legal at that point Just keep us posted Thanks SBR Cyndie Balfour NRON AM To Stacey CT cc Linda S CT Kim S CT Bill D ct Stacy E CT Subject Re DivisionTradename Audit part deux We really dont have anything to divide until Legal decides if it is a contractlegal issue or a Credit Business Process issue Stacy Dickson was checking with Jeff H to see what their position was on it If it does come down to a kill the record scenario the fastest way will probably be to do a mail merge format letter from list to create termination letters where necessary or mail merger to create amendments adding additional counterparty names to existing master contracts However I have a feeling it wont be that easy will come down to a business process challenge instead For us if it comes down to it I think the big issue will center around GTCs at least with Master contracts you have or usually have better defaultremedies have a fairly good chance at either a security provision or a collateral provision existing in the contract We can potentially end up with multi layer GTC records where we do not have master contracts This will be the only way to guarantee that new GTCs especially GTC Spots which are masterized from being generated Even then it cant be a guarantee since I cant see ENA stopping customers traders from executing transactions with CPs other than the parent company we may have to look more closely at the CP setup info share with GKs we will have no controls to prevent GTCs or Master contracts from being established with CPs established as Division Tradename ect unless we want to commit to checking the CP database before we establish a new contract record master K or GTC Then is the GCP group ready to be accountable for how they have been are now classifying the CP records headquarters division tradename ect are the current records accurate With all the turnover contractors and the CES scenarios Id say it would be impossible to have done a double check on all the records we are even still weeding out cleaning up data in our system THEN how do we want to handle the records classified in the GCP database as New Needs DnB which are records that have not had their status established in the database yet Either way much fun lies ahead for this one Cyndie Stacey CT AM To Cyndie Balfour NRON cc Linda S CT Kim S TheriotHOUECT Bill D ct Stacy

Kim S CT Bill D ct Stacy E CT Subject Re DivisionTradename Audit part deux Okay folks We are starting in on the DivisionTradename audit our side of the equation As it stands we are not going to terminate any existing contracts with counterparties that are classified as Division or Tradename However what we are going to do is to verify that the name on any existing master contracts matches the name as it exists in the Global Counterparty database So what we need to do is to view all of the attached master contracts please note that the attached spreadsheet has tabs Physical Financial Transportation and verify how the names are listed on the contract how the counterparty executed the contract Please email me any differences you come across Remember watch for name change notices assignment notices etc while reviewing these contracts Anthony Since Georgi is out would you mind verifying the Financial contracts only SylviaMarlene I know that in many cases your records wont have master contracts or actual paper however there is a tab for transportation related contracts many of them are status executed Where at all possible please verify counterparty names primarily any changes made on the financial or physical side can impact any executed agreements we may have on the transport side name might be one way on a phy contract another way on a transport contract Then we can at least make sure that changes wont negate anything we have on either side Please try to get this done as soon as possible Id like to have all variations by end of the day tomorrow Wednesday If you are working on something else at the moment please let me know Ill add the contracts to my list to review This project is fairly important we need to wrap it up as soon as we can Thank you all Cyndie Stacey CT AM To Cyndie Balfour NRON cc Linda S CT Kim S TheriotHOUECT Bill D ct Stacy E CT Subject Re DivisionTradename Audit part deux Oh yes this will be a choice project So Credit or Legal hasnt requested the number of deals attached to any of those contracts I assumed that would be part of the original evaluation Id be concerned with which of those masters were trading under now as well as how many deals volume etc Once you hear from Legal and we have an idea of what needs to be done then lets all set up a meeting to discuss within Global Contracts We can then follow up with Credit and Legal at that point Just keep us posted Thanks SBR Cyndie Balfour NRON AM To Stacey CT cc Linda S CT Kim S CT Bill D ct Stacy E CT Subject Re DivisionTradename Audit part deux We really dont have anything to divide until Legal decides if it is a contractlegal issue or a Credit Business Process issue Stacy Dickson was checking with Jeff H to see what their position was on it If it does come down to a kill the record scenario the fastest way will probably be to do a mail merge format letter from list to create termination letters where necessary or mail merger to create amendments adding additional counterparty names to existing master contracts However I have a feeling it wont be that easy will come down to a business process challenge instead For us if it comes down to it I think the big issue will center around GTCs at least with Master contracts you have or usually have better defaultremedies have a fairly good chance at either a security provision or a collateral provision existing in the contract We can potentially end up with multi layer GTC records where we do not have master contracts This will be the only way to guarantee that new GTCs especially GTC Spots which are masterized from being generated Even then it cant be a guarantee since I cant see ENA stopping customers traders from executing transactions with CPs other than the parent company we may have to look more closely at the CP setup info share with GKs we will have no controls to prevent GTCs or Master contracts from being established with CPs established as Division Tradename ect unless we want to commit to checking the CP database before we establish a new contract record master K or GTC Then is the GCP group ready to be accountable for how they have been are now classifying the CP records headquarters division tradename ect are the current records accurate With all the turnover contractors and the CES scenarios Id say it would be impossible to have done a double check on all the records we are even still weeding out cleaning up data in our system THEN how do we want to handle the records classified in the GCP database as New Needs DnB which are records that have not had their status established in the database yet Either way much fun lies ahead for this one Cyndie Stacey CT AM To Cyndie Balfour NRON cc Linda S CT Kim S TheriotHOUECT Bill D ct Stacy E CT Subject Re DivisionTradename Audit part deux When Linda gets back in lets all meet on how to split this up and run the Sitara reports Id like to get a total as soon as possible for Credit and Legal Im not sure how you want to divide the work but considering the potential exposure with Credit I think this should be the top of our priority list However you want to run this project is OK with me but lets get everyone working on this one Thanks SBR Cyndie Balfour NRON PM To Linda S CT Kim S CT cc Stacey CT Bill D ct Stacy E CT Subject DivisionTradename Audit part deux Okay Fred reran the report to pull all maintenance groups Instead of splitting into two separate reports the attached report has three tabs The first tab shows ALL active Global records for ALL Global Maintenance Groups the second tab shows only our maintenance groups Hougas Aruba FinancialNorth America and the third tab runs a subtotal on all maintenance groups In total there are global records tied to counterparties that have a Division or Tradename classification in Global Counterparties for our maintenance groups Please let me know if you have any additional report views you would like to be included data sort or subtotaled by counterparty by contract type ect Fred is running a report against the list we received today for all counterparties classified as Agent in Global Counterparties I should be able to have this report to you all on Tuesday as I will be out of the office on Monday
