message Louis Dreyfus is maintaining that their transactions with Todoroff are totally legitimate and binding upon EOTT Vinson Elkins is of the opinion that before we assert an argument to Louis Dreyfus regarding the validity of their contract we need to hear the tapes of Todoroffs conversations with Louis Dreyfus The paper that we have including the notes from the Louis Dreyfus contract administrator certainly indicates that Louis Dreyfus suspected or knew that something was not quite right about the December transaction with Todoroff but it is not enough to make a very good case for challenging the validityenforceability of that contract We need more John DeGeeter of Vinson Elkins has spoken with Louis Dreyfus general counsel Louis Dreyfus general counsel has told John that before he will consider providing EOTT with the tapes he wants EOTT to set forth in writing the reason EOTT is requesting the tapes Louis Dreyfus general counsel has also indicated that he is not sure that Louis Dreyfus taped these conversations Although a final decision has not been made heres where I think we are headed with Louis Dreyfus We will send their general counsel a letter next week indicating the irregularities with this contract eg the prices quoted in the contract were far below market and the contract administrator had questions about Todoroffs authorization and the legality of the deal This proposed letter would then suggest that Louis Dreyfus provide us with their tape recordings of the conversations with Todoroff in order that we can immediately resolve our questions as to whether one of Louis Dreyfus employees knowingly assisted Todoroff in his scheme to defraud EOTT My guess is that a letter of that nature will at least cause Louis Dreyfus lawyers to listen to the tapes If the tapes do contain incriminating conversations we might see a softening of their negotiating position If the tapes do not contain anything incriminating it would seem to be in Louis Dreyfus best interest to provide us with the tapes to support their position that there was nothing irregular about the transaction Steve Duffy PM To Walt ott cc Dana ott Lori ott Susan ott Michael

vacation and havent heard anything on this Werent we going to send a VE litigator to visit Dreyfus general counsel If we commence legal proceedings against Dreyfus things will become costly and contentious between us Information will come slowly and grudgingly We have copies of some of their internal notes which indicate that they knewor should have knownthat something wasnt quite right with

Thanks SWD WALT ZIMMERMAN AM To Dana ott Lori ott Susan ott cc Michael ott Steve ott Stanley nron Subject Todoroff ProsecutionCONFIDENTIALSUBJECT TO ATTORNEYCLIENT PRIVILEGE Earlier this week I spoke with Bill Moore the chief prosecutor in the Harris County District Attorneys Special Crimes Unit regarding the abovereferenced matter Mr Moore acknowledged receiving the investigative materials that we submitted last week and he indicated that his office is commencing its review of those materials I emphasized to Mr Moore the desire of EOTTs management to have this case aggressively prosecuted Mr Moore acknowledged that the aggressive prosecution of this matter would send a strong message to other traders who might consider dishonest acts and he assured me that his office would vigorously pursue this matter Based upon some statements made by Mr Moore during our discussion it was obvious that he recalled much of the presentation from our initial meeting I will call Mr Moore again tomorrow afternoon to get an update on the progress of this matter We are also attempting to obtain from Louis Dreyfus tape recordings of Todoroffs conversations with them regarding the series of deals that we are describing as The Second Transaction If Louis Dreyfus does not voluntarily provide us with copies of those tapes or if they assert that tapes do not exist the next step will be to consider filing a lawsuit or seeking a bill of discovery in order to obtain the tapes Based upon some notes we have received from a contract administrator at Louis Dreyfus it appears that Louis Dreyfus also suspected or knew that something was amiss with The Second Transaction Assuming that Todoroffs conversations with Louis Dreyfus were taped the tapes should tell us whether Todoroff had a conspirator at Louis Dreyfus who assisted him in his scheme to defraud EOTT If Louis Dreyfus does not voluntarily produce tape recordings of its conversations with Todoroff we will need some guidance
