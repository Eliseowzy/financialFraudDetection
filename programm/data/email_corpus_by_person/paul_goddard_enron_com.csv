email Also as I mentioned to Justin yesterday we have taken the precaution of registering the following four domain names for Enron Metals for possible use until we retrieve enronmetalscom and enronmetalscouk from Peter Quine This was also done to preclude further cybersquatting enronmetalscom enronmetalscouk enronmetalsnet enronmetalsorg Also FYI to internal folks note that Felipe Foys team in London is now coordinating registration of all domain names Enronwide to ensure consistency and central tracking We are trying to ensure that prior to any new domain name registrations by Enron that we first talk to Legal and Tax to ensure there are no trademark infringement issues or tax liability issues particular for foreign jurisdiction registrations eg registering enrononlinede for Germany Please let me know if you require further information or have any concerns with any of this Thank you Paul Goddard Forwarded by Paul GoddardEUEnron on Felipe CT To Paul nron cc Subject

Action Under New RegulationsCommodity Online Energy Exchanges Spring Into Action Under New RegulationsCommodity Futures Modernization Act OnExchange Inc True Quote LLCBrief Article The Oil Daily ITEM Copyright Gale Group All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Energy Intelligence Group Online Energy Exchanges Spring Into Action Under New Regulations Electronic energy exchanges are moving quickly to take advantage of new US legislation that clarified rules for regulating futures and overthecounter OTC markets The reforms took effect late last month after the legislation was squeezed through Congress and signed by outgoing President Clinton One startup company Massachusettsbased OnExchange says it was the first exchange to be registered under the new legislation having applied to the regulatory Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC several months before OnExchange will start by trading futures on financial markets but also plans to act as a clearinghouse for energy transactions True Quote an electronic energy exchange has also received CFTC clarification of its status under the new rules The legislation comes at the end of a twoyear drive to reform derivatives markets But this long and twisted process is not quite over The CFTC has withdrawn its own set of similar reforms in order to bring them into full compliance with the new law The CFTC reforms had been due to take effect in midFebruary the agency said they will be revised promptly The legislation the Commodity Futures Modernization Act was pushed through Congress as part of an appropriations bill and signed into law Dec It loosens the rules for futures exchanges gives OTC contracts greater legal standing and encourages the development of electronic trading platforms As a result energy traders should enjoy a greater choice of products and venues while new exchanges will face lower barriers of entry and less regulation But the changes also point to a more complex energy market in the near term at least as well as greater challenges for price discovery The CFTCs revised proposals will include more detail for example on how exactly to apply for registration They also will adopt the legislations terminology such as the names of three new tiers of futures exchanges A top tier called designated contract markets will match current futures markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange Nymex which allow retail participation A second rank of registered derivatives transaction execution facilities will be largely limited to institutional trade and will require looser regulation The third tier which escapes most regulation will be known as exempt boards of trade Energy platforms will not qualify for this last category The CFTC also encourages the establishment of independent clearinghouses which act as a central counterparty to reduce financial risk but these must register with the agency The legislation encourages online activity by limiting CFTC jurisdiction over derivatives contracts for socalled exempt commodities essentially energy and metals when traded on electronic platforms This clause Section applies when contracts are traded between experienced institutional traders It effectively limits oversight to requirements preventing fraud and manipulation Exchanges may be required to disseminate data on prices and trading volumes if they have a significant influence on the wider market The reforms cover bilaterally traded instruments with multilateral activities still in something of a gray area Basically an electronic exchange handling multilateral trades of energy derivatives can apply to the CFTC for official status if it thinks this will bring credibility and legal standing However a derivatives exchange that does not register with the CFTC will not be pursued OnExchange has been classified by the CFTC as both a designated contract market and a recognized clearing organization The firm specializes in technology for trading and clearing commodity and financial derivatives It will start by trading futures contracts in US treasuries but plans to expand The firm recently agreed with another startup EnergyClear to develop electronic clearing services for the energy industry EnergyClear is a joint venture of the Bank of New York and energy brokers Amerex and Prebon Yamane True Quote a Kentuckybased electronic platform specializing in physical and financial energy trade recently completed development of its online platform It is now signing up users and plans to start trading North American contracts for natural gas electricity and coal in the first quarter True Quote will also activate an agreement with Enron connecting its system to the EnronOnline platform True Quote is looking to expand into European gas and

suggest you get back in touch with h im then I tend to agree with Mark Taylors view re perhaps best not to use EOL or EOL Manager and the like given our substantial existing investme nt in the brandtrademark EnronOnline At the same time the press are often referring to EnronOnline as EOL so if the trademark EOL is in fact still available Kal Shah and I are of th e view that it would make sense to apply for it for possible use and also t o preclude others in our market from securing it though at some stage we wou ld need to demonstrate use vs just applying for the trademark itself for it to afford us any legal protection My concern from a marketing standpoint is not to dilute the EnronOnline brand or logo by also using the term EOL However if we could secure t he trademark it would be nice to have the option of using it at our discretio n eg perhaps more so in interviews and press releases rather than creati ng a logobrand for EOL which I think we should avoid Clearly though if anyone else already has the EOL trademark for the same goods and services classes we would be looking for we would need to steer clear of this entirely to avoid infringing on that trademark Happy to discuss this further Paul x Forwarded by Paul GoddardEUEnron on Paul Goddard To Justin CT cc Justin CT Rahil nronXGate Subject EOL Trademark Justin Apparently Dave Forster is keen to potentially register the domain name eolmanagercom currently available for purposes of our Third Par ty Access initiative I suggested to Justin Rostant that he check EOL trademark availability via Mark Palmer in the US but also said Id touch base with you Could we or Mark do a quick trademark avail search on EOL as opposed to EnronOnline proper Is it possible Clifford Chance Linklaters or SM already did this as part of the drive for EnronOnline trademarks The website eolcom is taken by a company called Entertainment Online but it looks like quite a small lottery entity of some kind so its possible they havent applied for TM but would still have established use From an EnronOnline marketing and legal standpoint to date we have deliberately avoided using EOL externally for fear of brand dilution and trademark infringement respectively However if in fact the trademark EOL or failing that EOL MANAGER is still available for the taking a t least in the context of online commodity trading perhaps we should apply for it for the appropriate goods and services classes As a follow on point if the trademark for EOL is indeed held by someone would we be infringing on their trademark if we registered EOLMANAGERCOM My personal opinion is that we would be free to do so hard to establis h wed be trying to pass off as Entertainment Online for example if we use d eolmanagercom to conduct our regular business Also It just occurred to me that Rahil did some quick checking on this a long while ago and I believe found there was a trademark holder out there possibly the same EOL Incorporated

team in London is now coordinating registration of all domain names Enronwide to ensure consistency and central tracking We are trying to ensure that prior to any new domain name registrations by

suggest you get back in touch with h im then I tend to agree with Mark Taylors view re perhaps best not to use EOL or EOL Manager and the like given our substantial existing investme nt in the brandtrademark EnronOnline At the same time the press are often referring to EnronOnline as EOL so if the trademark EOL is in fact still available Kal Shah and I are of th e view that it would make sense to apply for it for possible use and also t o preclude others in our market from securing it though at some stage we wou ld need to demonstrate use vs just applying for the trademark itself for it to afford us any legal protection My concern from a marketing standpoint is not to dilute the EnronOnline brand or logo by also using the term EOL However if we could secure t he trademark it would be nice to have the option of using it at our discretio n eg perhaps more so in interviews and press releases rather than creati ng a logobrand for EOL which I think we should avoid Clearly though if anyone else already has the EOL trademark for the same goods and services classes we would be looking for we would need to steer clear of this entirely to avoid infringing on that trademark Happy to discuss this further Paul x Forwarded by Paul GoddardEUEnron on Paul Goddard To Justin CT cc Justin CT Rahil nronXGate Subject EOL Trademark Justin Apparently Dave Forster is keen to potentially register the domain name eolmanagercom currently available for purposes of our Third Par ty Access initiative I suggested to Justin Rostant that he check EOL trademark availability via Mark Palmer in the US but also said Id touch base with you Could we or Mark do a quick trademark avail search on EOL as opposed to EnronOnline proper Is it possible Clifford Chance Linklaters or SM already did this as part of the drive for EnronOnline trademarks The website eolcom is taken by a company called Entertainment Online but it looks like quite a small lottery entity of some kind so its possible they havent applied for TM but would still have established use From an EnronOnline marketing and legal standpoint to date we have deliberately avoided using EOL externally for fear of brand dilution and trademark infringement respectively However if in fact the trademark EOL or failing that EOL MANAGER is still available for the taking a t least in the context of online commodity trading perhaps we should apply for it for the appropriate goods and services classes As a follow on point if the trademark for EOL is indeed held by someone would we be infringing on their trademark if we registered EOLMANAGERCOM My personal opinion is that we would be free to do so hard to establis h wed be trying to pass off as Entertainment Online for example if we use d eolmanagercom to conduct our regular business Also It just occurred to me that Rahil did some quick checking on this a long while ago and I believe found there was a trademark holder out there possibly the same EOL Incorporated

Action Under New RegulationsCommodity Online Energy Exchanges Spring Into Action Under New RegulationsCommodity Futures Modernization Act OnExchange Inc True Quote LLCBrief Article The Oil Daily ITEM Copyright Gale Group All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Energy Intelligence Group Online Energy Exchanges Spring Into Action Under New Regulations Electronic energy exchanges are moving quickly to take advantage of new US legislation that clarified rules for regulating futures and overthecounter OTC markets The reforms took effect late last month after the legislation was squeezed through Congress and signed by outgoing President Clinton One startup company Massachusettsbased OnExchange says it was the first exchange to be registered under the new legislation having applied to the regulatory Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC several months before OnExchange will start by trading futures on financial markets but also plans to act as a clearinghouse for energy transactions True Quote an electronic energy exchange has also received CFTC clarification of its status under the new rules The legislation comes at the end of a twoyear drive to reform derivatives markets But this long and twisted process is not quite over The CFTC has withdrawn its own set of similar reforms in order to bring them into full compliance with the new law The CFTC reforms had been due to take effect in midFebruary the agency said they will be revised promptly The legislation the Commodity Futures Modernization Act was pushed through Congress as part of an appropriations bill and signed into law Dec It loosens the rules for futures exchanges gives OTC contracts greater legal standing and encourages the development of electronic trading platforms As a result energy traders should enjoy a greater choice of products and venues while new exchanges will face lower barriers of entry and less regulation But the changes also point to a more complex energy market in the near term at least as well as greater challenges for price discovery The CFTCs revised proposals will include more detail for example on how exactly to apply for registration They also will adopt the legislations terminology such as the names of three new tiers of futures exchanges A top tier called designated contract markets will match current futures markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange Nymex which allow retail participation A second rank of registered derivatives transaction execution facilities will be largely limited to institutional trade and will require looser regulation The third tier which escapes most regulation will be known as exempt boards of trade Energy platforms will not qualify for this last category The CFTC also encourages the establishment of independent clearinghouses which act as a central counterparty to reduce financial risk but these must register with the agency The legislation encourages online activity by limiting CFTC jurisdiction over derivatives contracts for socalled exempt commodities essentially energy and metals when traded on electronic platforms This clause Section applies when contracts are traded between experienced institutional traders It effectively limits oversight to requirements preventing fraud and manipulation Exchanges may be required to disseminate data on prices and trading volumes if they have a significant influence on the wider market The reforms cover bilaterally traded instruments with multilateral activities still in something of a gray area Basically an electronic exchange handling multilateral trades of energy derivatives can apply to the CFTC for official status if it thinks this will bring credibility and legal standing However a derivatives exchange that does not register with the CFTC will not be pursued OnExchange has been classified by the CFTC as both a designated contract market and a recognized clearing organization The firm specializes in technology for trading and clearing commodity and financial derivatives It will start by trading futures contracts in US treasuries but plans to expand The firm recently agreed with another startup EnergyClear to develop electronic clearing services for the energy industry EnergyClear is a joint venture of the Bank of New York and energy brokers Amerex and Prebon Yamane True Quote a Kentuckybased electronic platform specializing in physical and financial energy trade recently completed development of its online platform It is now signing up users and plans to start trading North American contracts for natural gas electricity and coal in the first quarter True Quote will also activate an agreement with Enron connecting its system to the EnronOnline platform True Quote is looking to expand into European gas and
