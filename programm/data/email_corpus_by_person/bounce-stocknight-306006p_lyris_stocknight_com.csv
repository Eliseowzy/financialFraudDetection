Corporation has established a leading nationwide position in the interlocking paving stone installation industry The increase in our yearend and fourth quarter revenues reflect the ongoing implementation of our strategy to expand our national footprint while achieving operational efficiencies The Company plans to continue to expand its position in the marketplace through internal growth and the acquisition of quality independent businesses in strategic markets As a premier paver installation and design company in the country Paving Stone Corporation believes it is poised to capture a dominant market share in this expanding marketplace According to the Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute the industrys trade association while the annual installations of pavers has quadrupled in the US over the last years the US market of million square feet of annual installation is still a fraction of the annual installation rate in Europe Mr Sigouin continued We built this business on the foundation of quality work and customer satisfaction Our companys growth is indicative of our thousands of satisfied customers since Yet we realize there are a vast number of potential customers that have yet to learn about the cost advantages and convenience of interlocking paving stones for commercial and residential landscape and infrastructure applications We are already expanding our national footprint and bringing certain services inhouse By doing so we have the ability to generate up to three times the revenues on a per square foot basis as in a residential installation in locations other than our Florida base With this business model we expect to be able to substantially increase the revenues per job compared with jobs of similar size in our Florida base When one adds the components of geographic expansion increasing market share with large increases in revenues on a per square foot basis which result in higher revenue per job we have the potential for strong bottom line growth About Paving Stone Corporation Paving Stone Corporation enjoys the position of market leader in the interlocking concrete paver installation business nationwide and has received numerous

acquired legendary gun manufacturer Smith Wesson One of the pr oducts in development at that time was a gun made from a new lightweight exoticmetal alloy making the gun easier to carry and conceal Due to inter est in using this weapon for arming flight crews on commercial airliners t he dealer response has been tremendous IMAGE see article below IMAGE Business News Lightweight revolvers hot item for SW Wednes day October By WILLIAM FREEBAIRN A new line of ultralight re volvers in stores this month is proving a success for Smith Wesson which cant keep up with demand The new guns are among the first in the world t o use scandium a metal that has been used in Russian fighter jets and base ball bats They are being marketed under the AirLite Sc label and all are c apable of firing a powerful caliber Magnum round that had been previou sly unavailable in such a lightweight gun The smaller revolvers which weight just over ounces have been shipping for several weeks larger gu ns should reach dealers in the coming days Its a hot item said Herb A Belin handgun product manager for Smith Wesson Our constraint is ou r production rate The guns are more expensive than stainlesssteel revolv ers New guns carry a suggested price of between and each The lighter guns are likely to be purchased by people who want them for person al defense especially those with permits to carry concealed weapons Belin said Officials said developing the guns using the new metal took longer t han expected and taught them some lessons in metallurgy In highspeed vide o footage of the gun firing the frame and barrel moved dramatically due to the scandium alloys flexibility That gun does the rumba Belin said Designers increased the size of some parts of the gun to reduce flexing Titanium was used in the cylinder for strength but testing showed it was a lso needed in the center pin and other parts of the weapon Steel is used f or the hammer and trigger This taught us to make even stronger tougher g uns Belin said Scandium is a littleknown metal that occupies a place on the periodic table immediately before titanium Discovered in the late s it found use in the former Soviet Union which had a virtual monopol y on the supply from the Ukraine The Soviets used it in fighter jets and m issile parts When the Soviet Union broke up the metal began to see more w idespread use for example in aluminum baseball bats and mountain bike fram es Although scandium costs about a pound the amount needed to m ix with aluminum and other alloying agents is small Adding a little scandi um to aluminum strengthens the material more than twofold Belin said I ts weight will increase the number of people willing to carry it Belin sai d You dont need a holster You can carry it in your pocket The ligh test of the scandium guns is less than half of the weight of the lightest caliber Magnum the company made before Because of their light weight a nd flexible scandiumaluminum alloy frame the guns deliver a rapid kick to the hands of the person firing them Recoil is an issue Belin said The gun can fire lesspowerful rounds than the magnum for example t he special that can reduce recoil You really have to work at not fli nching when firing Belin said Smith Wesson officials believe ther e may be another market for the superlight guns They have developed a pro totype scandium alloy gun that could be carried by flight crews on commerci al airliners There have been calls for flight crews to be armed although no steps have been taken by the government in that direction The Smith Wesson prototypes are black with an internal hammer so they could be car ried in a trouser or jacket pocket without catching on the fabric The guns could be modified to fire a lowervelocity round which is less likely to cause damage to an aircraft officials said The prototype air crew guns have not been publicly revealed before Belin said A spokesman said the p rototypes are simply a design concept and will not necessarily be produced or be shared with people outside the company UNIONNEWS ABOU T SAFTHAMMER OTC BB SAFH IMAGE SafTHammer Corporation is a firea rm safety company focused on preventing
