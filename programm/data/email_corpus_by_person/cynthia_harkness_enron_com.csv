na CT James NRON Subject Re Bandwidth Products On EnronOnline Revised The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t he terms used in th GTCs that need to be defined elsewhere are covered Ill have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTCs I also have to point out I dont know much of anything about how bandwidth is traded but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long Descriptions Bandwidth Units This concept has been difficult for me its not entirel y clear to me where the definition of this comes from is it the reference i n the box at the top of the relevant Annex You are correct If so maybe we should add a line something to the effect of Bandwidth Units shall mean DS for this Transaction Or better yet you might consider a generic referenc e to the relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the sentence referring to the quality as well We have changed the first senten ce of the long description to read A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services LP EBS pursuant to which the Seller shall sell an d the Buyer shall buy the quantity of DS Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website Does DSO need to be defined somewhere DS is a term generally known in t he industry and is only used in the calculation of the Contract Price in the long description so we chose not to define it also the definition is incredibly long complex and technical If you feel strongly about it we can include it but since the long description tells you how many DSs you should include for calculation purposes we didnt think that it was necessary The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the GTC The formula in the long description differs from the formula in the G TC and in the Master Agreement in order to accomodate the way that the price is being quoted on EnronOnline The quote represents the variable component of the Unit Price in the GTCs and the Master Agreement In order not to confuse people we decided to include the formula in both the long description and the confirmation so that customers could know that the Unit Price was calculated using the price quoted Unless industry trading convention is to the contrary the site makes more intuitive sense when the volume quoted and the price quoted use the same units If the volume is Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number some counterparties or perhaps more likely their lawyers may be confused The GTC contains the defined term Unit Price which is in Bandwidth Unit It seems to me tha t if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the volume as Bandwidth Units we can ignore the number of DSOs per Bandwidth Unit and the number of DSO miles for the transaction Since they wont change from one product to the next the two sentences beginning with Any party entering into a Transaction could be moved to the GTC Since bandwidth is such a new product we really wanted to highlig ht to customers that if they intend to take physical delivery of bandwidth which is what we are offering they will need to establish connectivity wi th us This is already in the GTC but in an abundance of caution we wanted this fact highlighted especially since connectivity will entail further costs to the customer as well as signing documentation such as colocation agreements licenses etc this can be quite an involved process The term Contractual Currency is not used int he GTC Can the parenthetical reference come out The EnronOnline people may care about this more than I Agreed If the numbers of miles and DSOs need to stay in the Long Descriptions I would suggest that you change the references to make it DSOs per Bandwidth Unit both where the number is introduced and in the price formula and tha t the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be per DSO mile per month It is a quote for one DS mile of a Bandwidth Unit for a month Since the short description indicates the period for the contract being offered we felt like the quotation was pretty clear We are also a bit sensitive to using too many defined terms referring to each other in the lo ng description From a commercial perspective we are comfortable that the language used in the quote and the long description are clear and accurate Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number This needs to be clear from the Long Description If a Customer wanted to buy of the OC Bandwidth Units quoted for the period from July July the Customer would be entitled to OCs for the period from July July I hope that this is responsive to your question we werent entirely clear So for example if you follow all of my suggestions you might end up with something like this A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services LP EBS pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit y of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website The price shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website Annex A of th e General Terms and Conditions shall apply to this Transaction The term of the Transaction shall begin at am EST on the Effectiv e Date and continue to pm EST on the Termination Date The Effective Date is Start Date and the Termination Date is Termination Date The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling Point th Avenue Suite New York NY NPANXX CLLI NYCMNYH and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point W th Street Suite Los Angeles CA NPANXX CLLI LSAJCAWZH The price is quoted in US Dollars The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one Bandwidth Unit per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per month If quoting the price as a per Bandwidth Unit number doesnt work it would b e more like this A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services LP EBS pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit y of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website The number of DSOs per Bandwidth Unit is The price shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website Annex A of the General Terms and Condition s will apply to this Transaction The term of the Transaction shall begin at am EST on the Effectiv e Date and

Dollars The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one DS mile per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per mont h Therefore the Contract Price will be calculated as follows price x the number of DSs per Bandwidth Unit x the number of DS miles x the numbe r of Bandwidth Units Please let me know if you have any questions I will go ahead and approve

contemplated by the GTCs and it is consistent with our Master Bandwidth Purchase and Sale Agreement and other Master Bandwidth Documentation If there is an uproar about this I can revise the GTCs accordingly otherwise please use the Long Descriptions that Jeff Blumenthal prepared as he wrote them I have confirmed with the regulatory group that we dont have regulatory issues with this product
