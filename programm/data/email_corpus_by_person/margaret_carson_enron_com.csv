Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance The introduction of the Bcfd Alliance Pipeline into the North American gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western Canada than expected according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines PGE Gas Transmission and Alliance Extremely strong gas demand in the Pacific Northwest California and in the Midwest has produced continued high load factors on TransCanada and PGE GTNW despite the presence of their huge new rival for Western Canadian supply The contract picture changed significantly on TransCanada since the first of November and primarily at our Empress AB delivery point into the TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe but actual physical gas flows at about Bcfd have not changed correspondingly said Klaus Exner director of pipeline system operations at TransCanada The big picture overview that I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta through British Columbia and into the PGE systems That hasnt let up at all and we dont foresee that letting up PGE Gas Transmission Spokeswoman Sandra McDonough said PGE GTNW has been running full at Bcfd for some time and is delivering MMcfd to nonCalifornia load in the Pacific Northwest Were turning back demand right now Every power plant in this region is running full tilt Tuscarora Gas Transmission the Nevada pipeline is full Our Northwest deliveries are fixed Were delivering as much as we can deliver right now TransCanadas other major export route out of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin is the Foothills and Northern Border route into the Midwest It also continues to operate at high load factors We didnt see a huge dropoff in physical flows post Nov Weve seen the IT volumes come up considerably said Exner The one thing that has changed is the volatility of the flows Customers are making frequent intraday nomination changes and were seeing more up and down and daytoday variations according to the weather and the markets than we would have when we had a higher firm contract level The fluctuations are driven purely by the price differential between AECO and the Dawn Hub in Ontario which indicates whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not Alliance Pipeline spokesman Jack Crawford said the system has been running flat out at about Bcfd since the valves were opened for commercial service Dec He also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase flows on the system It has been estimated that Alliance could increase gas flows to Bcfd with existing compression The additional capacity would be divided up among existing shippers Crawford said We havent cranked up the system above the contract capacity yet We probably wont do that for a couple weeks until we get things ironed out Frankly though Im not sure Chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the Pacific Northwest and California

markets are responding to US power peaks this summer Forwarded by Margaret CarsonCorpEnron on AM on PM To cc Subject Weathering the Summer Price Volatility and HighsHow Will Retail Marketers Fare CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Thu July Title Weathering the Summer Price Volatility and HighsHow Will Retail Marketers Fare Author Biehl Behrens Reishus EMail Category Alert Product Line Retail Energy Forum URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientrefaltrefaltabhtml This summer retail marketers have been confronted with extraordinarily difficult market circumstances for both gas and power So far this summer average weekly power prices have risen above per megawatthour MWh in several marketsalmost double many of the standard offer levels This differential between market prices and standard offers has made it almost impossible for retail marketers to offer customers an attractive service proposition in many areas of the United States open to competition Similarly in the gas market this summer May through June prices at the Henry Hub have averaged per million British thermal units MMBtu well above the average of per MMBtu during the same period last year In some cases the volatile gas and power markets this summer are proving lethal to retail marketers that chose to ride the spot markets rather than properly hedge their purchases and who lack the balance sheet strength to carry the burden In addition som e retail marketers have experienced difficulty with contract fulfillment by their wholesale suppliers even when the retailer may have felt secure going into the summer As a result of these market conditions a few marketers have even relinquished their customers returning them to the utilities who are the default suppliers Retail marketers serving these difficult markets which include the West PJM and New England are approaching the current situation with a number of different strategies including selling either part or all of their customer base continuing to serve their existing customers but not renewing their contracts and planning to exit the market turning customers back on utility service continuing full steam ahead The irony of this situation is that high prices over the next few years may actually help increase consumer awareness about competitive energy supplies and may even cause utilities under unrecoverable price cap rates to question whether they should remain in the merchant business Uncertainties whether retail marketers can withstand these conditions and regulators and other interested parties will tolerate a sustained period of both high and volatile prices or if instead they will step in and adjust the rules in the name of protecting retail customers In this briefing CERA examines the question of whether one possible fallout from this summers high and volatile energy prices will be increased consolidation among retail marketers as retail customers andor businesses begin to be actively bought and sold We also examine the implications on retail markets of recent federal legislation supporting the legality of electronic contracts In addition we focus our first regional analysis on the regulatory developments and retail activity in the Northeast states and Canadian provincesone of the most dynamic regions in terms of retail energy activity Retail Metrics Trading Retail Customer Bases Avenue for Building Market Share Although the impact of volatile and high energy prices this summer may be bleak for many retail players for a new entrant andor contrarian buyer this could be an excellent time to pick up customers on the cheap and build market share In the past month there have been three notable cases of retail energy companies buying retail customer bases from other companiesin some cases just the retail customers have been purchased and in other cases whole retail energy businesses have been purchased Examples include North American market entry strategy Centrica an energy marketing business in the United Kingdom purchased Direct Energy an energy marketing business in Canada that also has a joint venture with Sempra called Energy America Through its acquisition of Direct Energy Centrica acquired Canadian gas customers and percent ownership interest in Energy America a US company that has gas and power customers see Table In addition to gaining access to the largest retail customer base in North America Centrica was able to buy a company with significant experience in various North American retail markets Gaining critical mass for an IPO The New Power Company a joint venture between Enron IBM and AOL recently acquired over gas and power customers from Columbia Energy Services as a way to quickly build market share before an initial public offering for which a request has recently been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Building market share Energy America acquired gas customers from Titan Energy an energy marketer in Georgia after the latter filed for bankruptcy In the two cases of bankruptcy massmarket gas customers were purchased in the range of per customer It appears that purchasing a base of retail customers is a cheaper form of buying market share than purchasing an entire company or division For example Centrica paid between and per customer in its purchase of Direct Energys business This metric is somewhat misleading however as the purchase of Direct Energy also included upstream gas assets The three recent transactions join the list of retail customer acquisitions over the past year or two see Table These transactions are generally occurring for three common reasons either as a result of a retail marketer bankruptcy eg Titan Energy and Peachtree Gas because companies are changing their strategic focus eg NiSourceColumbia Energy and PGE or as a market entry tool eg AES Centrica New Power CERA expects many more players to consolidate and exit the business this year particularly in the aftermath of the summer market The idea that the current climate might offer a good buying opportunity for retail customers has not been lost on the market While existing retail markets are struggling to make ends meet the number of marketers requesting certification has increased in some places such as Massachusetts where it is expected these new entrants will attempt to purchase other marketers businesses Table shows extreme differences in prices paid for retail customer bases on a totalcostpercustomer basis since a wide variety of factors contribute to the cost of a customer andor a retail business CERA does not suggest that this table provides an applestoapples comparison on the cost of a customer In terms of just pure customer acquisition costs there can be significant regional differences in the value of a customer owing to average use per customer and local market conditions For example a residential gas customer in Georgia will likely use far less gas than one in Michigan and should be valued differently as a result Other factors such as buying habits load size existing contracts and future potential growth in the market need to be evaluated to determine the proper valuation of customers In addition a myriad of factors can affect the value of a retail company including what other capabilities assets and other factors are part of the deal separat e from the customer base and underlying contracts Retail Market Share Consolidation Could Be the Trend over the Next Year Although the buying and selling of retail customers through aggregators was a common feature of Ontario gas restructuring this tactic has not been as prevalent in the United States for two reasons Marketers have been distrustful of the methods of acquisition of other players and are therefore skeptical about the loyalty of customers if they were to be acquired through a purchase Additionally many have felt that they could acquire customers at a much lower cost than by purchasing an existing customer base This historical reluctance to buy retail customer bases seems to be changing and will likely continue to change in the future Over the past few years there has already been a maturation of many of these marketers and of the rules that they must obey In addition as larger name companies enter the retail markets the risk associated with buying a customer base that had been acquired through questionable means has been drastically reduced With the emergence of significant players such as Enron Centrica and Shell into the retail market further customer buyouts will occur as these and other large players work to gain enough scale to make the retail business significant to their bottom line The new breed of retail marketers may be better capitalized to play the shortrun game of building market share as well as the longrun game As a result these players may be able to achieve scale in a market where no single company has achieved significant scale to date In addition many of these companies have strong wholesale marketing capabilities to support their retail marketing capabilities inform their contracting practices and help shield them from being on the wrong side of volatile markets Market Developments New Law Removes the Wet Signature Barrier but Lack of Uniform Rules Persists The regulatory requirement for retail energy marketers to obtain written wet signatures from end users wanting to switch their energy service provider has posed a major cost barrier to marketers that already face high customer acquisition costs As a result a number of competitive energy marketers have exited markets with wet signature requirements This cost barrier will be lowered in October when recently passed federal legislation takes effectsparking renewed interest in the affected markets as well as guaranteeing that in the states scheduled to open electronic customer signups and transactions will be legally binding In late June President Bill Clinton signed into law the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act which will take effect October This law overrides state regulatory rulings and laws that have required wet signatures However although the news is a step forward for marketers the issue is not entirely cut and dried The Act confirms the legality of electronic transactions while giving the states broad authority on how to implement and judge requirements for these transactions It stipulates that parties engaged in transactions must both agree to conduct commerce electronically This act neither mandates electronic commerce nor allows it to be mandated if not agreed to The Act follows on an earlier act titled the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act UETA which was proposed last year by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws For the states that adopted this earlier Act the latest Congressional legislation allows them to adhere to the UETA States that have not implemented the UETA will be under the jurisdiction of the new federal legislation which is slightly more open to interpretation than the UETA What does this legislation mean at the state level Unfortunately this Act did not come in time to have a significant impact on the states that have troubled marketers eg Arizona and New Jersey Prior to the passing of this new legislation Arizona adopted its own version of the UETA in April Almost concurrent with the federal legislation New Jersey recently approved an Internet pilot program to allow marketers to use electronic signatures to switch customers beginning in September The program will be open to customers percent of the market and will last for six months before reevaluation by the Board of Public Utilities BPU However in lieu of the federal legislation the BPU will vote in August on lifting the program cap It remains to be seen if either the pilot or new rules will be sufficient to lure back the marketers eg KeySpan DTE Conectiv that pulled out of New Jersey over the past year citing the states wet signature rules as one of the primary reasons for their exit Given the high use and ownship of personal computers in the residential market as well as customer interest in being able to shop for suppliers over the Internet about one third of customers surveyed in New Jersey supported Internet signup we expect this recent ruling could jumpstart marketing to the mass market this fall This legislation will have the most significant impact in states that have not opened to competition or ruled on wet signatures Although benefiting all marketers by increasing their options this Act benefits pure ecommerce players the most The cost of acquiring customers over the Internet can be substantially less than other forms of customer acquisition such as mail whose costs include paper and postage or doortodoor sales which involves high labor costs Since many consumers will continue to remain without Internet service for the midterm another implication of the ruling is that it will drive further customer segmentation by different types of marketers The implementation of the electronic signature law may signal the advent of the Internet as a favored marketing tool over the more traditional means of marketing to customer through paid advertising direct mail or doortodoor sales Since the Act does not require states to accept oral communication as legally binding many states will continue to require written or electronic signatures Slamming and cramming remain the concern of many state regulators resulting in rules that disallow oral transactions as a means of signing customers The cost of acquiring customers over the Internet can be substantially less than other forms of customer acquisition such as mail whose costs include paper and postage or doortodoor sales which involve high labor costs This will help divide the retail market into players serving different customer segments One set will continue to acquire customers that do not have Internet access through traditional methods whereas the other set of retail players will acquire and conduct business over the Internet typically gaining higher income customers Though there can be little question that states will eventually have to allow marketers to transact and acquire customers over the Internet the statebystate rules governing electronic transactions are likely to continue to be nonstandard Although the intent of the law as it is written is to nullify state wet signature legislation in all but a few cases there could be some confusion over its interpretation at the state level One area to watch will be how states interpret one of the laws few exceptionsthat customers must be notified in a nonelectronic format when their utility service is being terminated Some regulatory agencies may take that to mean that when consumers switch away from utility service some form of communication must be sent to the consumer and potentially a regulatory commission could require marketers to bear some or all of these costs For more information see the following hyperlinks Uniform Electronic Transactions Act promoted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws bllulculcframehtm Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act signed into law by President Clinton cgibinqueryzcSENR Regional AnalysisNortheast Market The attention being given to the highpriced summer market of is masking what could be seen as small steps forward for competition in the Northeast Despite headlines about retail players exiting some markets and customers being returned to system supplies state regulatory activity is proceeding apace this year and there continues to be a steady influx of new players that are waiting for certification in states such as Massachusetts and New Jersey Still this has not been a banner year for retail activity in the Northeast see Figure and Table Regulatory Front The region has more competitive retail power markets open than any other in the United States Of the nine states in the Northeast only New Hampshire and Vermont have not been opened to competition although both states are moving forward to break the political impasse there Maine and Connecticut have opened since January Although natural gas competition got off to an early start in the region it now lags electric access with only New York Pennsylvania and New Jersey technically open to gas competition to all customers Over the next year the only state that is expected to take any significant step forward on the gas front is Massachusetts as the Department of Telecommunications and Energy DTE is likely to rule in favor of opening the market to all customers by the end of the year There has been a decrease in the number of customers in some utility jurisdictions that are competitively buying gas and power in the Northeast since March particularly in Pennsylvania and New Jersey Since March the number of customers switched to retail marketers has dropped from to for gas and increased somewhat for power from customers to Although new competitors continue to petition for the right to serve in a number of northeastern states in a few of the newly opened access states retailers have been slow to step forward with competitive offers This is particularly true for offers directed to residential and small commercial customers Wholesale Volatility Market share of retail players in the Northeast has always remained highly fragmented and utility affiliates retain the bulk of deregulated market share This is poised to change over the next year as some of the early retail marketers experiencing difficulty under the current market conditions pull back leaving room for new entrants on the sidelines In many of the states wholesale prices this summer dramatically exceeded the level of competitive offers in the marketplace exceeding MWh in some cases in New England A few retailers caught without a secure supply of wholesale power were forced to return their customers to the provider of last resort service It will be important to watch these markets in the fall to see if customers return to these marketers andor whether the regulators adjust the rules to prohibit this kind of behavior andor fix the rules that perpetuate this discrepancy between the standard offer and market price Until the wave of new supply resources are built and brought online in these markets high and volatile prices are likely to be a characteristic of this market It remains to be seen if retailers will have learned the lessons from this past summer however and go into the next peak period with firm supply contracts as well as arm themselves with the marketing savvy to take advantage of customer aversion to high and fluctuating prices with offers of a stable price while providing the marketer with a significant margin above the wholesale price The story is similar for gas as CERA expects strong gas prices in the Northeast to continue for the new few years until increased supply comes into the market High prices will continue owing to tight storage inventories and increased demand for gas for power generation with last winters volatility likely to be repeated in upcoming winters Canada The largest Canadian market in the Northeast is Quebec as Ontario will be covered as part of our Midwest regional analysis The Quebec gas market is the only northeastern Canadian gas or power market fully open to competition There is no investigation into power competition in Quebec at this time It is likely that Quebec will wait and see how opening of the Ontario power market plays out next year before taking any action just as it watched and repeated the Ontario gas market experience Greenfield gas distribution companies are being built in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia which will be served by Sable Island gas supplies The regulatory focus there is to encourage hooking customers up to gas system supplies not necessarily to promote retail competition end Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables and graphic Account Changes To edit your personal account

jurisdiction of the new federal legislation which is slightly more open to interpretation than the UETA What does this legislation mean at the state level Unfortunately this Act did not come in time to have a significant impact on the states that have troubled marketers eg Arizona and New Jersey Prior to the passing of this new legislation Arizona adopted its own version of the UETA in April Almost concurrent with the federal legislation New Jersey recently approved an Internet pilot program to allow marketers to use electronic signatures to switch customers beginning in September The program will be open to customers percent of the market and will last for six months before reevaluation by the Board of Public Utilities BPU However in lieu of the federal legislation the BPU will vote in August on lifting the program cap It remains to be seen if either the pilot or new rules will be sufficient to lure back the marketers eg KeySpan DTE Conectiv that pulled out of New Jersey over the past year citing the states wet signature rules as one of the primary reasons for their exit Given the high use and ownship of personal computers in the residential market as well as customer interest in being able to shop for suppliers over the Internet about one third of customers surveyed in New Jersey supported Internet signup we expect this recent ruling could jumpstart marketing to the mass market this fall This legislation will have the most significant impact in states that have not opened to competition or ruled on wet signatures Although benefiting all marketers by increasing their options this Act benefits pure ecommerce players the most The cost of acquiring customers over the Internet can be substantially less than other forms of customer acquisition such as mail whose costs include paper and postage or doortodoor sales which involves high labor costs Since many consumers will continue to remain without Internet service for the midterm another implication of the ruling is that it will drive further customer segmentation by different types of marketers The implementation of the electronic signature law may signal the advent of the Internet as a favored marketing tool over the more traditional means of marketing to customer through paid advertising direct mail or doortodoor sales Since the Act does not require states to accept oral communication as legally binding many states will continue to require written or electronic signatures Slamming and cramming remain the concern of many state regulators resulting in rules that disallow oral transactions as a means of signing customers The cost of acquiring customers over the Internet can be substantially less than other forms of customer acquisition such as mail whose costs include paper and postage or doortodoor sales which involve high labor costs This will help divide the retail market into players serving different customer segments One set will continue to acquire customers that do not have Internet access through traditional methods whereas the other set of retail players will acquire and conduct business over the Internet typically gaining higher income customers Though there can be little question that states will eventually have to allow marketers to transact and acquire customers over the Internet the statebystate rules governing electronic transactions are likely to continue to be nonstandard Although the intent of the law as it is written is to nullify state wet signature legislation in all but a few cases there could be some confusion over its interpretation at the state level One area to watch will be how states interpret one of the laws few exceptionsthat customers must be notified in a nonelectronic format when their utility service is being terminated Some regulatory agencies may take that to mean that when consumers switch away from utility service some form of communication must be sent to the consumer and potentially a regulatory commission could require marketers to bear some or all of these costs For more information see the following hyperlinks Uniform Electronic Transactions Act promoted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws bllulculcframehtm Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act signed into law by President Clinton cgibinqueryzcSENR Regional AnalysisNortheast Market The attention being given to the highpriced summer market of is masking what could be seen as small steps forward for competition in the Northeast Despite headlines about retail players exiting some markets and customers being returned to system supplies state regulatory activity is proceeding apace this year and there continues to be a steady influx of new players that are waiting for certification in states such as Massachusetts and New Jersey Still this has not been a banner year for retail activity in the Northeast see Figure and Table Regulatory Front The region has more competitive retail power markets open than any other in the United States Of the nine states in the Northeast only New Hampshire and Vermont have not been opened to competition although both states are moving forward to break the political impasse there Maine and Connecticut have opened since January Although natural gas competition got off to an early start in the region it now lags electric access with only New York Pennsylvania and New Jersey technically open to gas competition to all customers Over the next year the only state that is expected to take any significant step forward on the gas front is Massachusetts as the Department of Telecommunications and Energy DTE is likely to rule in favor of opening the market to all customers by the end of the year There has been a decrease in the number of customers in some utility jurisdictions that are competitively buying gas and power in the Northeast since March particularly in Pennsylvania and New Jersey Since March the number of customers switched to retail marketers has dropped from to for gas and increased somewhat for power from customers to Although new competitors continue to petition for the right to serve in a number of northeastern states in a few of the newly opened access states retailers have been slow to step forward with competitive offers This is particularly true for offers directed to residential and small commercial customers Wholesale Volatility Market share of retail players in the Northeast has always remained highly fragmented and utility affiliates retain the bulk of deregulated market share This is poised to change over the next year as some of the early retail marketers experiencing difficulty under the current market conditions pull back leaving room for new entrants on the sidelines In many of the states wholesale prices this summer dramatically exceeded the level of competitive offers in the marketplace exceeding MWh in some cases in New England A few retailers caught without a secure supply of wholesale power were forced to return their customers to the provider of last resort service It will be important to watch these markets in the fall to see if customers return to these marketers andor whether the regulators adjust the rules to prohibit this kind of behavior andor fix the rules that perpetuate this discrepancy between the standard offer and market price Until the wave of new supply resources are built and brought online in these markets high and volatile prices are likely to be a characteristic of this market It remains to be seen if retailers will have learned the lessons from this past summer however and go into the next peak period with firm supply contracts as well as arm themselves with the marketing savvy to take advantage of customer aversion to high and fluctuating prices with offers of a stable price while providing the marketer with a significant margin above the wholesale price The story is similar for gas as CERA expects strong gas prices in the Northeast to continue for the new few years until increased supply comes into the market High prices will continue owing to tight storage inventories and increased demand for gas for power generation with last winters volatility likely to be repeated in upcoming winters Canada The largest Canadian market in the Northeast is Quebec as Ontario will be covered as part of our Midwest regional analysis The Quebec gas market is the only northeastern Canadian gas or power market fully open to competition There is no investigation into power competition in Quebec at this time It is likely that Quebec will wait and see how opening of the Ontario power market plays out next year before taking any action just as it watched and repeated the Ontario gas market experience Greenfield gas distribution companies are being built in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia which will be served by Sable Island gas supplies The regulatory focus there is to encourage hooking customers up to gas system supplies not necessarily to promote retail competition end Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables and graphic Account Changes To edit your personal account

markets are responding to US power peaks this summer Forwarded by Margaret CarsonCorpEnron on AM on PM To cc Subject Weathering the Summer Price Volatility and HighsHow Will Retail Marketers Fare CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Thu July Title Weathering the Summer Price Volatility and HighsHow Will Retail Marketers Fare Author Biehl Behrens Reishus EMail Category Alert Product Line Retail Energy Forum URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientrefaltrefaltabhtml This summer retail marketers have been confronted with extraordinarily difficult market circumstances for both gas and power So far this summer average weekly power prices have risen above per megawatthour MWh in several marketsalmost double many of the standard offer levels This differential between market prices and standard offers has made it almost impossible for retail marketers to offer customers an attractive service proposition in many areas of the United States open to competition Similarly in the gas market this summer May through June prices at the Henry Hub have averaged per million British thermal units MMBtu well above the average of per MMBtu during the same period last year In some cases the volatile gas and power markets this summer are proving lethal to retail marketers that chose to ride the spot markets rather than properly hedge their purchases and who lack the balance sheet strength to carry the burden In addition som e retail marketers have experienced difficulty with contract fulfillment by their wholesale suppliers even when the retailer may have felt secure going into the summer As a result of these market conditions a few marketers have even relinquished their customers returning them to the utilities who are the default suppliers Retail marketers serving these difficult markets which include the West PJM and New England are approaching the current situation with a number of different strategies including selling either part or all of their customer base continuing to serve their existing customers but not renewing their contracts and planning to exit the market turning customers back on utility service continuing full steam ahead The irony of this situation is that high prices over the next few years may actually help increase consumer awareness about competitive energy supplies and may even cause utilities under unrecoverable price cap rates to question whether they should remain in the merchant business Uncertainties whether retail marketers can withstand these conditions and regulators and other interested parties will tolerate a sustained period of both high and volatile prices or if instead they will step in and adjust the rules in the name of protecting retail customers In this briefing CERA examines the question of whether one possible fallout from this summers high and volatile energy prices will be increased consolidation among retail marketers as retail customers andor businesses begin to be actively bought and sold We also examine the implications on retail markets of recent federal legislation supporting the legality of electronic contracts In addition we focus our first regional analysis on the regulatory developments and retail activity in the Northeast states and Canadian provincesone of the most dynamic regions in terms of retail energy activity Retail Metrics Trading Retail Customer Bases Avenue for Building Market Share Although the impact of volatile and high energy prices this summer may be bleak for many retail players for a new entrant andor contrarian buyer this could be an excellent time to pick up customers on the cheap and build market share In the past month there have been three notable cases of retail energy companies buying retail customer bases from other companiesin some cases just the retail customers have been purchased and in other cases whole retail energy businesses have been purchased Examples include North American market entry strategy Centrica an energy marketing business in the United Kingdom purchased Direct Energy an energy marketing business in Canada that also has a joint venture with Sempra called Energy America Through its acquisition of Direct Energy Centrica acquired Canadian gas customers and percent ownership interest in Energy America a US company that has gas and power customers see Table In addition to gaining access to the largest retail customer base in North America Centrica was able to buy a company with significant experience in various North American retail markets Gaining critical mass for an IPO The New Power Company a joint venture between Enron IBM and AOL recently acquired over gas and power customers from Columbia Energy Services as a way to quickly build market share before an initial public offering for which a request has recently been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Building market share Energy America acquired gas customers from Titan Energy an energy marketer in Georgia after the latter filed for bankruptcy In the two cases of bankruptcy massmarket gas customers were purchased in the range of per customer It appears that purchasing a base of retail customers is a cheaper form of buying market share than purchasing an entire company or division For example Centrica paid between and per customer in its purchase of Direct Energys business This metric is somewhat misleading however as the purchase of Direct Energy also included upstream gas assets The three recent transactions join the list of retail customer acquisitions over the past year or two see Table These transactions are generally occurring for three common reasons either as a result of a retail marketer bankruptcy eg Titan Energy and Peachtree Gas because companies are changing their strategic focus eg NiSourceColumbia Energy and PGE or as a market entry tool eg AES Centrica New Power CERA expects many more players to consolidate and exit the business this year particularly in the aftermath of the summer market The idea that the current climate might offer a good buying opportunity for retail customers has not been lost on the market While existing retail markets are struggling to make ends meet the number of marketers requesting certification has increased in some places such as Massachusetts where it is expected these new entrants will attempt to purchase other marketers businesses Table shows extreme differences in prices paid for retail customer bases on a totalcostpercustomer basis since a wide variety of factors contribute to the cost of a customer andor a retail business CERA does not suggest that this table provides an applestoapples comparison on the cost of a customer In terms of just pure customer acquisition costs there can be significant regional differences in the value of a customer owing to average use per customer and local market conditions For example a residential gas customer in Georgia will likely use far less gas than one in Michigan and should be valued differently as a result Other factors such as buying habits load size existing contracts and future potential growth in the market need to be evaluated to determine the proper valuation of customers In addition a myriad of factors can affect the value of a retail company including what other capabilities assets and other factors are part of the deal separat e from the customer base and underlying contracts Retail Market Share Consolidation Could Be the Trend over the Next Year Although the buying and selling of retail customers through aggregators was a common feature of Ontario gas restructuring this tactic has not been as prevalent in the United States for two reasons Marketers have been distrustful of the methods of acquisition of other players and are therefore skeptical about the loyalty of customers if they were to be acquired through a purchase Additionally many have felt that they could acquire customers at a much lower cost than by purchasing an existing customer base This historical reluctance to buy retail customer bases seems to be changing and will likely continue to change in the future Over the past few years there has already been a maturation of many of these marketers and of the rules that they must obey In addition as larger name companies enter the retail markets the risk associated with buying a customer base that had been acquired through questionable means has been drastically reduced With the emergence of significant players such as Enron Centrica and Shell into the retail market further customer buyouts will occur as these and other large players work to gain enough scale to make the retail business significant to their bottom line The new breed of retail marketers may be better capitalized to play the shortrun game of building market share as well as the longrun game As a result these players may be able to achieve scale in a market where no single company has achieved significant scale to date In addition many of these companies have strong wholesale marketing capabilities to support their retail marketing capabilities inform their contracting practices and help shield them from being on the wrong side of volatile markets Market Developments New Law Removes the Wet Signature Barrier but Lack of Uniform Rules Persists The regulatory requirement for retail energy marketers to obtain written wet signatures from end users wanting to switch their energy service provider has posed a major cost barrier to marketers that already face high customer acquisition costs As a result a number of competitive energy marketers have exited markets with wet signature requirements This cost barrier will be lowered in October when recently passed federal legislation takes effectsparking renewed interest in the affected markets as well as guaranteeing that in the states scheduled to open electronic customer signups and transactions will be legally binding In late June President Bill Clinton signed into law the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act which will take effect October This law overrides state regulatory rulings and laws that have required wet signatures However although the news is a step forward for marketers the issue is not entirely cut and dried The Act confirms the legality of electronic transactions while giving the states broad authority on how to implement and judge requirements for these transactions It stipulates that parties engaged in transactions must both agree to conduct commerce electronically This act neither mandates electronic commerce nor allows it to be mandated if not agreed to The Act follows on an earlier act titled the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act UETA which was proposed last year by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws For the states that adopted this earlier Act the latest Congressional legislation allows them to adhere to the UETA States that have not implemented the UETA will be under the jurisdiction of the new federal legislation which is slightly more open to interpretation than the UETA What does this legislation mean at the state level Unfortunately this Act did not come in time to have a significant impact on the states that have troubled marketers eg Arizona and New Jersey Prior to the passing of this new legislation Arizona adopted its own version of the UETA in April Almost concurrent with the federal legislation New Jersey recently approved an Internet pilot program to allow marketers to use electronic signatures to switch customers beginning in September The program will be open to customers percent of the market and will last for six months before reevaluation by the Board of Public Utilities BPU However in lieu of the federal legislation the BPU will vote in August on lifting the program cap It remains to be seen if either the pilot or new rules will be sufficient to lure back the marketers eg KeySpan DTE Conectiv that pulled out of New Jersey over the past year citing the states wet signature rules as one of the primary reasons for their exit Given the high use and ownship of personal computers in the residential market as well as customer interest in being able to shop for suppliers over the Internet about one third of customers surveyed in New Jersey supported Internet signup we expect this recent ruling could jumpstart marketing to the mass market this fall This legislation will have the most significant impact in states that have not opened to competition or ruled on wet signatures Although benefiting all marketers by increasing their options this Act benefits pure ecommerce players the most The cost of acquiring customers over the Internet can be substantially less than other forms of customer acquisition such as mail whose costs include paper and postage or doortodoor sales which involves high labor costs Since many consumers will continue to remain without Internet service for the midterm another implication of the ruling is that it will drive further customer segmentation by different types of marketers The implementation of the electronic signature law may signal the advent of the Internet as a favored marketing tool over the more traditional means of marketing to customer through paid advertising direct mail or doortodoor sales Since the Act does not require states to accept oral communication as legally binding many states will continue to require written or electronic signatures Slamming and cramming remain the concern of many state regulators resulting in rules that disallow oral transactions as a means of signing customers The cost of acquiring customers over the Internet can be substantially less than other forms of customer acquisition such as mail whose costs include paper and postage or doortodoor sales which involve high labor costs This will help divide the retail market into players serving different customer segments One set will continue to acquire customers that do not have Internet access through traditional methods whereas the other set of retail players will acquire and conduct business over the Internet typically gaining higher income customers Though there can be little question that states will eventually have to allow marketers to transact and acquire customers over the Internet the statebystate rules governing electronic transactions are likely to continue to be nonstandard Although the intent of the law as it is written is to nullify state wet signature legislation in all but a few cases there could be some confusion over its interpretation

states such as Massachusetts and New Jersey Still this has not been a banner year for retail activity in the Northeast see Figure and Table Regulatory Front The region has more competitive retail power markets open than any other in the United States Of the nine states in the Northeast only New Hampshire and Vermont have not been opened to competition although both states are moving forward to break the political impasse there Maine and Connecticut have opened since January Although natural gas competition got off to an early start in the region it now lags electric access with only New York Pennsylvania and New Jersey technically open to gas competition to all customers Over the next year the only state that is expected to take any significant step forward on the gas front is Massachusetts as the Department of Telecommunications and Energy DTE is likely to rule in favor of opening the market to all customers by the end of the year There has been a decrease in the number of customers in some utility jurisdictions that are competitively buying gas and power in the Northeast since March particularly in Pennsylvania and New Jersey Since March the number of customers switched to retail marketers has dropped from to for gas and increased somewhat for power from customers to Although new competitors continue to petition for the right to serve in a number of northeastern states in a few of the newly opened access states retailers have been slow to step forward with competitive offers This is particularly true for offers directed to residential and small commercial customers Wholesale Volatility Market share of retail players in the Northeast has always remained highly fragmented and utility affiliates retain the bulk of deregulated market share This is poised to change over the next year as some of the early retail marketers experiencing difficulty under the current market conditions pull back leaving room for new entrants on the sidelines In many of the states wholesale prices this summer dramatically exceeded the level of competitive offers in the marketplace exceeding MWh in some cases in New England A few retailers caught without a secure supply of wholesale power were forced to return their customers to the provider of last resort service It will be important to watch these markets in the fall to see if customers return to these marketers andor whether the regulators adjust the rules to prohibit this kind of behavior andor fix the rules that perpetuate this discrepancy between the standard offer and market price Until the wave of new supply resources are built and brought online in these markets high and volatile prices are likely to be a characteristic of this market It remains to be seen if retailers will have learned the lessons from this past summer however and go into the next peak period with firm supply contracts as well as arm themselves with the marketing savvy to take advantage of customer aversion to high and fluctuating prices with offers of a stable price while providing the marketer with a significant margin above the wholesale price The story is similar for gas as CERA expects strong gas prices in the Northeast to continue for the new few years until increased supply comes into the market High prices will continue owing to tight storage inventories and increased demand for gas for power generation with last winters volatility likely to be repeated in upcoming winters Canada The largest Canadian market in the Northeast is Quebec as Ontario will be covered as part of our Midwest regional analysis The Quebec gas market is the only northeastern Canadian gas or power market fully open to competition There is no investigation into power competition in Quebec at this time It is likely that Quebec will wait and see how opening of the Ontario power market plays out next year before taking any action just as it watched and repeated the Ontario gas market experience Greenfield gas distribution companies are being built in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia which will be served by Sable Island gas supplies The regulatory focus there is to encourage hooking customers up to gas

markets are responding to US power peaks this summer Forwarded by Margaret CarsonCorpEnron on AM on PM To cc Subject Weathering the Summer Price Volatility and HighsHow Will Retail Marketers Fare CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Thu July Title Weathering the Summer Price Volatility and HighsHow Will Retail Marketers Fare Author Biehl Behrens Reishus EMail Category Alert Product Line Retail Energy Forum URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientrefaltrefaltabhtml This summer retail marketers have been confronted with extraordinarily difficult market circumstances for both gas and power So far this summer average weekly power prices have risen above per megawatthour MWh in several marketsalmost double many of the standard offer levels This differential between market prices and standard offers has made it almost impossible for retail marketers to offer customers an attractive service proposition in many areas of the United States open to competition Similarly in the gas market this summer May through June prices at the Henry Hub have averaged per million British thermal units MMBtu well above the average of per MMBtu during the same period last year In some cases the volatile gas and power markets this summer are proving lethal to retail marketers that chose to ride the spot markets rather than properly hedge their purchases and who lack the balance sheet strength to carry the burden In addition som e retail marketers have experienced difficulty with contract fulfillment by their wholesale suppliers even when the retailer may have felt secure going into the summer As a result of these market conditions a few marketers have even relinquished their customers returning them to the utilities who are the default suppliers Retail marketers serving these difficult markets which include the West PJM and New England are approaching the current situation with a number of different strategies including selling either part or all of their customer base continuing to serve their existing customers but not renewing their contracts and planning to exit the market turning customers back on utility service continuing full steam ahead The irony of this situation is that high prices over the next few years may actually help increase consumer awareness about competitive energy supplies and may even cause utilities under unrecoverable price cap rates to question whether they should remain in the merchant business Uncertainties whether retail marketers can withstand these conditions and regulators and other interested parties will tolerate a sustained period of both high and volatile prices or if instead they will step in and adjust the rules in the name of protecting retail customers In this briefing CERA examines the question of whether one possible fallout from this summers high and volatile energy prices will be increased consolidation among retail marketers as retail customers andor businesses begin to be actively bought and sold We also examine the implications on retail markets of recent federal legislation supporting the legality of electronic contracts In addition we focus our first regional analysis on the regulatory developments and retail activity in the Northeast states and Canadian provincesone of the most dynamic regions in terms of retail energy activity Retail Metrics Trading Retail Customer Bases Avenue for Building Market Share Although the impact of volatile and high energy prices this summer may be bleak for many retail players for a new entrant andor contrarian buyer this could be an excellent time to pick up customers on the cheap and build market share In the past month there have been three notable cases of retail energy companies buying retail customer bases from other companiesin some cases just the retail customers have been purchased and in other cases whole retail energy businesses have been purchased Examples include North American market entry strategy Centrica an energy marketing business in the United Kingdom purchased Direct Energy an energy marketing business in Canada that also has a joint venture with Sempra called Energy America Through its acquisition of Direct Energy Centrica acquired Canadian gas customers and percent ownership interest in Energy America a US company that has gas and power customers see Table In addition to gaining access to the largest retail customer base in North America Centrica was able to buy a company with significant experience in various North American retail markets Gaining critical mass for an IPO The New Power Company a joint venture between Enron IBM and AOL recently acquired over gas and power customers from Columbia Energy Services as a way to quickly build market share before an initial public offering for which a request has recently

these marketers andor whether the regulators adjust the rules to prohibit this kind of behavior andor fix the rules that perpetuate this discrepancy between the standard offer and market price Until the wave of new supply resources are built and brought online in these markets high and volatile prices are likely to be a characteristic of this market It remains to be seen if retailers will have learned the lessons from this past summer however and go into the next peak period with firm supply contracts as well as arm themselves with the marketing savvy to take advantage of customer aversion to high and fluctuating prices with offers of a stable price while providing the marketer with a significant margin above the wholesale price The story is similar for gas as CERA expects strong gas prices in the Northeast to continue for the new few years until increased supply comes into the market High prices will continue owing to tight storage inventories and increased demand for gas for

markets are responding to US power peaks this summer Forwarded by Margaret CarsonCorpEnron on AM on PM To cc Subject Weathering the Summer Price Volatility and HighsHow Will Retail Marketers Fare CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Thu July Title Weathering the Summer Price Volatility and HighsHow Will Retail Marketers Fare Author Biehl Behrens Reishus EMail Category Alert Product Line Retail Energy Forum URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientrefaltrefaltabhtml This summer retail marketers have been confronted with extraordinarily difficult market circumstances for both gas and power So far this summer average weekly power prices have risen above per megawatthour MWh in several marketsalmost double many of the standard offer levels This differential between market prices and standard offers has made it almost impossible for retail marketers to offer customers an attractive service proposition in many areas of the United States open to competition Similarly in the gas market this summer May through June prices at the Henry Hub have averaged per million British thermal units MMBtu well above the average of per MMBtu during the same period last year In some cases the volatile gas and power markets this summer are proving lethal to retail marketers that chose to ride the spot markets rather than properly hedge their purchases and who lack the balance sheet strength to carry the burden In addition som e retail marketers have experienced difficulty with contract fulfillment by their wholesale suppliers even when the retailer may have felt secure going into the summer As a result of these market conditions a few marketers have even relinquished their customers returning them to the utilities who are the default suppliers Retail marketers serving these difficult markets which include the West PJM and New England are approaching the current situation with a number of different strategies including selling either part or all of their customer base continuing to serve their existing customers but not renewing their contracts and planning to exit the market turning customers back on utility service continuing full steam ahead The irony of this situation is that high prices over the next few years may actually help increase consumer awareness about competitive energy supplies and may even cause utilities under unrecoverable price cap rates to question whether they should remain in the merchant business Uncertainties whether retail marketers can withstand these conditions and regulators and other interested parties will tolerate a sustained period of both high and volatile prices or if instead they will step in and adjust the rules in the name of protecting retail customers In this briefing CERA examines the question of whether one possible fallout from this summers high and volatile energy prices will be increased consolidation among retail marketers as retail customers andor businesses begin to be actively bought and sold We also examine the implications on retail markets of recent federal legislation supporting the legality of electronic contracts In addition we focus our first regional analysis on the regulatory developments and retail activity in the Northeast states and Canadian provincesone of the most dynamic regions in terms of retail energy activity Retail Metrics Trading Retail Customer Bases Avenue for Building Market Share Although the impact of volatile and high energy prices this summer may be bleak for many retail players for a new entrant andor contrarian buyer this could be an excellent time to pick up customers on the cheap and build market share In the past month there have been three notable cases of retail energy companies buying retail customer bases from other companiesin some cases just the retail customers have been purchased and in other cases whole retail energy businesses have been purchased Examples include North American market entry strategy Centrica an energy marketing business in the United Kingdom purchased Direct Energy an energy marketing business in Canada that also has a joint venture with Sempra called Energy America Through its acquisition of Direct Energy Centrica acquired Canadian gas customers and percent ownership interest in Energy America a US company that has gas and power customers see Table In addition to gaining access to the largest retail customer base in North America Centrica was able to buy a company with significant experience in various North American retail markets Gaining critical mass for an IPO The New Power Company a joint venture between Enron IBM and AOL recently acquired over gas and power customers from Columbia Energy Services as a way to quickly build market share before an initial public offering for which a request has recently been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Building market share Energy America acquired gas customers from Titan Energy an energy marketer in Georgia after the latter filed for bankruptcy In the two cases of bankruptcy massmarket gas customers were purchased in the range of per customer It appears that purchasing a base of retail customers is a cheaper form of buying market share than purchasing an entire company or division For example Centrica paid between and per customer in its purchase of Direct Energys business This metric is somewhat misleading however as the purchase of Direct Energy also included upstream gas assets The three recent transactions join the list of retail customer acquisitions over the past year or two see Table These transactions are generally occurring for three common reasons either as a result of a retail marketer bankruptcy eg Titan Energy and Peachtree Gas because companies are changing their strategic focus eg NiSourceColumbia Energy and PGE or as a market entry tool eg AES Centrica New Power CERA expects many more players to consolidate and exit the business this year particularly in the aftermath of the summer market The idea that the current climate might offer a good buying opportunity for retail customers has not been lost on the market While existing retail markets are struggling to make ends meet the number of marketers requesting certification has increased in some places such as Massachusetts where it is expected these new entrants will attempt to purchase other marketers businesses Table shows extreme differences in prices paid for retail customer bases on a totalcostpercustomer basis since a wide variety of factors contribute to the cost of a customer andor a retail business CERA does not suggest that this table provides an applestoapples comparison on the cost of a customer In terms of just pure customer acquisition costs there can be significant regional differences in the value of a customer owing to average use per customer and local market conditions For example a residential gas customer in Georgia will likely use far less gas than one in Michigan and should be valued differently as a result Other factors such as buying habits load size existing contracts and future potential growth in the market need to be evaluated to determine the proper valuation of customers In addition a myriad of factors can affect the value of a retail company including what other capabilities assets and other factors are part of the deal separat e from the customer base and underlying contracts Retail Market Share Consolidation Could Be the Trend over the Next Year Although the buying and selling of retail customers through aggregators was a common feature of Ontario gas restructuring this tactic has not been as prevalent in the United States for two reasons Marketers have been distrustful of the methods of acquisition of other players and are therefore skeptical about the loyalty of customers if they were to be acquired through a purchase Additionally many have felt that they could acquire customers at a much lower cost than by purchasing an existing customer base This historical reluctance to buy retail customer bases seems to be changing and will likely continue to change in the future Over the past few years there has already been a maturation of many of these marketers and of the rules that they must obey In addition as larger name companies enter the retail markets the risk associated with buying a customer base that had been acquired through questionable means has been drastically reduced With the emergence of significant players such as Enron Centrica and Shell into the retail market further customer buyouts will occur as these and other large players work to gain enough scale to make the retail business significant to their bottom line The new breed of retail marketers may be better capitalized to play the shortrun game of building market share as well as the longrun game As a result these players may be able to achieve scale in a market where no single company has achieved significant scale to date In addition many of these companies have strong wholesale marketing capabilities to support their retail marketing capabilities inform their contracting practices and help shield them from being on the wrong side of volatile markets Market Developments New Law Removes the Wet Signature Barrier but Lack of Uniform Rules Persists The regulatory requirement for retail energy marketers to obtain written wet signatures from end users wanting to switch their energy service provider has posed a major cost barrier to marketers that already face high customer acquisition costs As a result a number of competitive energy marketers have exited markets with wet signature requirements This cost barrier will be lowered in October when recently passed federal legislation takes effectsparking renewed interest in the affected markets as well as guaranteeing that in the states scheduled to open electronic customer signups and transactions will be legally binding In late June President Bill Clinton signed into law the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act which will take effect October This law overrides state regulatory rulings and laws that have required wet signatures However although the news is a step forward for marketers the issue is not entirely cut and dried The Act confirms the legality of electronic transactions while giving the states broad authority on how to implement and judge requirements for these transactions It stipulates that parties engaged in transactions must both agree to conduct commerce electronically This act neither mandates electronic commerce nor allows it to be mandated if not agreed to The Act follows on an earlier act titled the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act UETA which was proposed last year by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws For the states that adopted this earlier Act the latest Congressional legislation allows them to adhere to the UETA States that have not implemented the UETA will be under the jurisdiction of the new federal legislation which is slightly more open to interpretation than the UETA What does this legislation mean at the state level Unfortunately this Act did not come in time to have a significant impact on the states that have troubled marketers eg Arizona and New Jersey Prior to the passing of this new legislation Arizona adopted its own version of the UETA in April Almost concurrent with the federal legislation New Jersey recently approved an Internet pilot program to allow marketers to use electronic signatures to switch customers beginning in September The program will be open to customers percent of the market and will last for six months before reevaluation by the Board of Public Utilities BPU However in lieu of the federal legislation the BPU will vote in August on lifting the program cap It remains to be seen if either the pilot or new rules will be sufficient to lure back the marketers eg KeySpan DTE Conectiv that pulled out of New Jersey over the past year citing the states wet signature rules as one of the primary reasons for their exit Given the high use and ownship of personal computers in the residential market as well as customer interest in being able to shop for suppliers over the Internet about one third of customers surveyed in New Jersey supported Internet signup we expect this recent ruling could jumpstart marketing to the mass market this fall This legislation will have the most significant impact in states that have not opened to competition or ruled on wet signatures Although benefiting all marketers by increasing their options this Act benefits pure ecommerce players the most The cost of acquiring customers over the Internet can be substantially less than other forms of customer acquisition such as mail whose costs include paper and postage or doortodoor sales which involves high labor costs Since many consumers will continue to remain without Internet service for the midterm another implication of the ruling is that it will drive further customer segmentation by different types of marketers The implementation of the electronic signature law may signal the advent of the Internet as a favored marketing tool over the more traditional means of marketing to customer through paid advertising direct mail or doortodoor sales Since the Act does not require states to accept oral communication as legally binding many states will continue to require written or electronic signatures Slamming and cramming remain the concern of many state regulators resulting in rules that disallow oral transactions as a means of signing customers The cost of acquiring customers over the Internet can be substantially less than other forms of customer acquisition such as mail whose costs include paper and postage or doortodoor sales which involve high labor costs This will help divide the retail market into players serving different customer segments One set will continue to acquire customers that do not have Internet access through traditional methods whereas the other set of retail players will acquire and conduct business over the Internet typically gaining higher income customers Though there can be little question that states will eventually have to allow marketers to transact and acquire customers over the Internet the statebystate rules governing electronic transactions are likely to continue to be nonstandard Although the intent of the law as it is written is to nullify state wet signature legislation in all but a few cases there could be some confusion over its interpretation at the state level One area to watch will be how states interpret one of the laws few exceptionsthat customers must be notified in a nonelectronic format when their utility service is being terminated Some regulatory agencies may take that to mean that when consumers switch away from utility service some form of communication must be sent to the consumer and potentially a regulatory commission could require marketers to bear some or all of these costs For more information see the following hyperlinks Uniform Electronic Transactions Act promoted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws bllulculcframehtm Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act signed into law by President Clinton cgibinqueryzcSENR Regional AnalysisNortheast Market The attention being given to the highpriced summer market of is masking what could be seen as small steps forward for competition in the Northeast Despite headlines about retail players exiting some markets and customers being returned to system supplies state regulatory activity is proceeding apace this year and there continues to be a steady influx of new players that are waiting for certification in states such as Massachusetts and New Jersey Still this has not been a banner year for retail activity in the Northeast see Figure and Table Regulatory Front The region has more competitive retail power markets open than any other in the United States Of the nine states in the Northeast only New Hampshire and Vermont have not been opened to competition although both states are moving forward to break the political impasse there Maine and Connecticut have opened since January Although natural gas competition got off to an early start in the region it now lags electric access with only New York Pennsylvania and New Jersey technically open to gas competition to all customers Over the next year the only state that is expected to take any significant step forward on the gas front is Massachusetts as the Department of Telecommunications and Energy DTE is likely to rule in favor of opening the market to all customers by the end of the year There has been a decrease in the number of customers in some utility jurisdictions that are competitively buying gas and power in the Northeast since March particularly in Pennsylvania and New Jersey Since March the number of customers switched to retail marketers has dropped from to for gas and increased somewhat for power from customers to Although new competitors continue to petition for the right to serve in a number of northeastern states in a few of the newly opened access states retailers have been slow to step forward with competitive offers This is particularly true for offers directed to residential and small commercial customers Wholesale Volatility Market share of retail players in the Northeast has always remained highly fragmented and utility affiliates retain the bulk of deregulated market share This is poised to change over the next year as some of the early retail marketers experiencing difficulty under the current market conditions pull back leaving room for new entrants on the sidelines In many of the states wholesale prices this summer dramatically exceeded the level of competitive offers in the marketplace exceeding MWh in some cases in New England A few retailers caught without a secure supply of wholesale power were forced to return their customers to the provider of last resort service It will be important to watch these markets in the fall to see if customers return to these marketers andor whether the regulators adjust the rules to prohibit this kind of behavior andor fix the rules that perpetuate this discrepancy between the standard offer and market price Until the wave of new supply resources are built and brought online in these markets high and volatile prices are likely to be a characteristic of this market It remains to be seen if retailers will have learned the lessons from this past summer however and go into the next peak period with firm supply contracts as well as arm themselves with the marketing savvy to take advantage of customer aversion to high and fluctuating prices with offers of a stable price while providing the marketer with a significant margin above the wholesale price The story is similar for gas as CERA expects strong gas prices in the Northeast to continue for the new few years until increased supply comes into the market High prices will continue owing to tight storage inventories and increased demand for gas for

Energy report addresses Calif and Rockies SJB basis in the last percent of the documentfyi Margaret Forwarded by Margaret CarsonCorpEnron on AM on PM To cc Subject Midmonth Report Early Warning CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Wed November Title Midmonth Report Early Warning Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml After a warm October the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market Cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than per million British thermal units MMBtu over the past week This rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil assuring that dualfuel loads remain off of gas Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dualfuel end users to burn gas If this cold snap extends through the remainder of November a heavy earlywinter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter Though storage inventories have reached near the billion cubic feet Bcf level they remain at a record low heading into the heating season and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring This supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price near in the Gulf Coast and into a range potentially testing the next difficult level of demand resistance This resistance could come from switching to distillate oil but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above per MMBtu and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher Rather a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more pricesensitive end users may be required None of these measures comes easily or cheaply however and they can be overwhelmed by weatherdriven swings in demand As a result as cold weather settles in CERA expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts Under normal weather conditions CERA expects Henry Hub prices to average during December see Table which by itself would represent an all time high for December But even this estimate could prove low If the current cold snap extends through early December prices could easily climb into the per MMBtu range Gas StorageThe Record Low Maximum CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of Bcf as of the end of October a record low for that month by Bcf see Table Even this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent warmth through most of October The withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week however and in a strong way The cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month increasing the withdrawal rate this November to Bcf per day on average well above the Bcf per day average rate of the past two years By the end of this month the US inventory deficit is likely to have widened again to Bcf CERA estimates that normal December weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately Bcf per day which is above last years rate of Bcf per day This year however this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through December and beyond as it would keep inventories on a path to reach Bcf by the end of March just below the alltime endofMarch low of Bcf So long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by next fall Although the supply build will begin to help by late winter it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occurunless demand continues to be priced out of the market DemandKeeping Warm After last years warm winter CERA expects a strong rebound in heating demand and this weeks weather and forecast reinforce that expectation Weather last winter November through March was the warmest of the decade and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season Under normal weather conditions Average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day higher than last years Monthly average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day peaking at Bcf per day in January December heating demand would increase by Bcf per day relative to last December Weather percent colder than normal could further increase December demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather likewise a percent warmerthannormal scenario could decrease demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather Fuel Switching With natural gas markets this tight there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market Residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market This winter we expect all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so a loss of million cubic feet MMcf per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of MMcf per day off of gas gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices as much as resid will act as a floor for gas For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of Bcf per day relative to last December and a Bcf per day increase in demand relative to November with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching SupplyThe Rebound The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense but US supply is beginning to rebound The recent steep decline in US lower capacity is expected to reverse in late given the soaring gasrelated rig count The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of Mexico is related to the combination of the rampup of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf adding to the recent startup of the Muni field these fields could add over Bcf per day later in the response of the shallow water to the strong late turnaround in drilling activity Other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with Bcf per day in and and onshore led by the Bossier sand play in Freestone County Texas the Barnett Shale play in Wise County Texas and the Powder River Basin coal seam play Further increases in drilling are likely to slow New deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews Regional MarketsWild Winter in the West Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and Topock in the south Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to Topock differentials of over per MMBtu Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through February with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline Winter has arrived in earnest across North America but the startup of firm transportation service on Alliance is delayed once again this time until December Nonetheless flows on the pipeline are under way CERA estimates that flows during October averaged MMcf per day During November that total should climb to MMcf per day despite the later published start date With or without Alliance flows a weatherdriven rebound in midwestern demand relative to November and December last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant premium to Henry Hub prices In the Northeast differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter despite greater flows into the region from Atlantic Canada this year see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Very cold weather within the region has brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub prices A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East will likely widen the differentials but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price CERA expects a December average differential of per MMBtu however this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather A warm week in the Rockies could still push differentials toward per MMBtu San Juan San Juan prices will continue to hold close to Rockies prices through the winter with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions Heating loads in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub differential with extended cold weather in the Rockies pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price CERA expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin to average per MMBtu Permian and MidContinent Unlike prices within the rest of the West differentials between the Henry Hub and the MidContinent and Permian Basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west depending on regional weather CERA expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of per MMBtu and a MidContinent differential of per MMBtu for December Chicago Alliance flows into the Chicago market are now running close to MMcf per day However the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub despite delays in the completion of the Vector pipeline CERA expects the strong pricing at Chicago to continue and December differentials should average per MMBtu Northeast markets Assuming normal weather we expect to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub at per MMBtu New England will likely see prices higher depending on the pipeline Much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs For example with a percent retention rate from the Gulf Coast into New England last December would have seen retention costs of approximately at that same retention equates to Despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast from the Atlantic Canadian fields there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets and an additional MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity Because of this tightness should this months weather be colder than normal we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in January These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in January depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized Canadian MarketsWinter Begins The colderthannormal weather has increased demand in western Canada but is only now being felt in the East Storage peaked in the West in early October at approximately Bcf below last years level and Bcf below the fiveyear average Even with modest withdrawals since that time storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow pushing levels to over Bcf Bcf above last year and well above the fiveyear average With the eastward movement of the colder weather withdrawals are likely to begin This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal freezeup which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season Gas well completions are expected to reach for and will likely be even higher next year Further Delays for Alliance The commercial inservice date for Alliance has been delayed until December the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line delays in the completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant the delay of Vector and a lack of supply The pipeline has been flowing gas however with volumes building up since September It is estimated that flows for November will average MMcf per day TransCanada has taken the full brunt of the Alliance flows so far with Northern Border and PGT remaining strong December should see Alliance flows build to between and MMcf per day with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border and PGT Storage withdrawals will likely keep TransCanada reductions close to MMcf per day year overyear until Vector begins service to eastern Canada High Prices Strong Pull West The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also provided strength for AECO The AECOHenry differential has dropped to the high s and low s as a result of this increased pull For December the differential is expected to average per MMBtu for a resulting AECO average of C per gigajoule US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of this message with associated Tables CERAs Autumn Roundtable event dates and agendas are now

Energy report addresses Calif and Rockies SJB basis in the last percent of the documentfyi Margaret Forwarded by Margaret CarsonCorpEnron on AM on PM To cc Subject Midmonth Report Early Warning CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Wed November Title Midmonth Report Early Warning Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml After a warm October the first cold weather this year has provided an early warning of what winter could bring for the gas market Cold weather across much of the great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge in gas prices of more than per million British thermal units MMBtu over the past week This rebound in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply and moved the price of gas back above that of residual fuel oil assuring that dualfuel loads remain off of gas Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow most dualfuel end users to burn gas If this cold snap extends through the remainder of November a heavy earlywinter draw on storage could set the stage for unprecedented high prices through the winter Though storage inventories have reached near the billion cubic feet Bcf level they remain at a record low heading into the heating season and even a normal winter would reduce inventories to a near record or record absolute low by spring This supply tightness places the gas price playing field in the broad territory above the resid price near in the Gulf Coast and into a range potentially testing the next difficult level of demand resistance This resistance could come from switching to distillate oil but low distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean that switching would require a gas price above per MMBtu and any move to switch to distillate would likely drive prices of both commodities higher Rather a combination of some switching to resid in industrial boilers and a shutdown of a few more pricesensitive end users may be required None of these measures comes easily or cheaply however and they can be overwhelmed by weatherdriven swings in demand As a result as cold weather settles in CERA expects heightened price volatility at levels above the price of resid and extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather forecasts Under normal weather conditions CERA expects Henry Hub prices to average during December see Table which by itself would represent an all time high for December But even this estimate could prove low If the current cold snap extends through early December prices could easily climb into the per MMBtu range Gas StorageThe Record Low Maximum CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a maximum of Bcf as of the end of October a record low for that month by Bcf see Table Even this level was reached only through a fortunate combination of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent warmth through most of October The withdrawal season is likely to have begun this week however and in a strong way The cold weather now settling in is likely to offset warmth early this month increasing the withdrawal rate this November to Bcf per day on average well above the Bcf per day average rate of the past two years By the end of this month the US inventory deficit is likely to have widened again to Bcf CERA estimates that normal December weather would require storage withdrawals of approximately Bcf per day which is above last years rate of Bcf per day This year however this withdrawal rate would apply consistent pressure in the market through December and beyond as it would keep inventories on a path to reach Bcf by the end of March just below the alltime endofMarch low of Bcf So long as inventories remain on this path the pressure does not end even with the end of winter as a significant increase in injections next year would be required for inventories to reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by next fall Although the supply build will begin to help by late winter it is unlikely to be of the magnitude required both to offset power generation demand growth and to allow this increase in storage injections to occurunless demand continues to be priced out of the market DemandKeeping Warm After last years warm winter CERA expects a strong rebound in heating demand and this weeks weather and forecast reinforce that expectation Weather last winter November through March was the warmest of the decade and there will be a significant rebound in heating demand in the residential and commercial sectors as weather returns toward normal this heating season Under normal weather conditions Average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day higher than last years Monthly average heating demand through the winter would be Bcf per day peaking at Bcf per day in January December heating demand would increase by Bcf per day relative to last December Weather percent colder than normal could further increase December demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather likewise a percent warmerthannormal scenario could decrease demand by Bcf per day relative to normal weather Fuel Switching With natural gas markets this tight there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market Residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market This winter we expect all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so a loss of million cubic feet MMcf per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of MMcf per day off of gas gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices as much as resid will act as a floor for gas For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of Bcf per day relative to last December and a Bcf per day increase in demand relative to November with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching SupplyThe Rebound The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense but US supply is beginning to rebound The recent steep decline in US lower capacity is expected to reverse in late given the soaring gasrelated rig count The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of Mexico is related to the combination of the rampup of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf adding to the recent startup of the Muni field these fields could add over Bcf per day later in the response of the shallow water to the strong late turnaround in drilling activity Other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with Bcf per day in and and onshore led by the Bossier sand play in Freestone County Texas the Barnett Shale play in Wise County Texas and the Powder River Basin coal seam play Further increases in drilling are likely to slow New deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews Regional MarketsWild Winter in the West Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and Topock in the south Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to Topock differentials of over per MMBtu Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through February with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline Winter has arrived in earnest across North America but the startup of firm transportation service on Alliance is delayed once again this time until December Nonetheless flows on the pipeline are under way CERA estimates that flows during October averaged MMcf per day During November that total should climb to MMcf per day despite the later published start date With or without Alliance flows a weatherdriven rebound in midwestern demand relative to November and December last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant premium to Henry Hub prices In the Northeast differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter despite greater flows into the region from Atlantic Canada this year see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Very cold weather within the region has brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub prices A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East will likely widen the differentials but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price CERA expects a December average differential of per MMBtu however this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather A warm week in the Rockies could still push differentials toward per MMBtu San Juan San Juan prices will continue to hold close to Rockies prices through the winter with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions Heating loads in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub differential with extended cold weather in the Rockies pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price CERA expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin to average per MMBtu Permian and MidContinent Unlike prices within the rest of the West differentials between the Henry Hub and the MidContinent and Permian Basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west depending on regional weather CERA expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of per MMBtu and a MidContinent differential of per MMBtu for December Chicago Alliance flows into the Chicago market are now running close to MMcf per day However the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub despite delays in the completion of the Vector pipeline CERA expects the strong pricing at Chicago to continue and December differentials should average per MMBtu Northeast markets Assuming normal weather we expect to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub at per MMBtu New England will likely see prices higher depending on the pipeline Much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs For example with a percent retention rate from the Gulf Coast into New England last December would have seen retention costs of approximately at that same retention equates to Despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast from the Atlantic Canadian fields there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets and an additional MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity Because of this tightness should this months weather be colder than normal we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in January These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in January depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized Canadian MarketsWinter Begins The colderthannormal weather has increased demand in western Canada but is only now being felt in the East Storage peaked in the West in early October at approximately Bcf below last years level and Bcf below the fiveyear average Even with modest withdrawals since that time storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow pushing levels to over Bcf Bcf above last year and well above the fiveyear average With the eastward movement of the colder weather withdrawals are likely to begin This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal freezeup which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season Gas well completions are expected to reach for and will likely be even higher next year Further Delays for Alliance The commercial inservice date for Alliance has been delayed until December the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line delays in the completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant the delay of Vector and a lack of supply The pipeline has been flowing gas however with volumes building up since September It is estimated that flows for November will average MMcf per day TransCanada has taken the full brunt of the Alliance flows so far with Northern Border and PGT remaining strong December should see Alliance flows build to between and MMcf per day with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border and PGT Storage withdrawals will likely keep TransCanada reductions close to MMcf per day year overyear until Vector begins service to eastern Canada High Prices Strong Pull West The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also provided strength for AECO The AECOHenry differential has dropped to the high s and low s as a result of this increased pull For December the differential is expected to average per MMBtu for a resulting AECO average of C per gigajoule US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of this message with associated Tables CERAs Autumn Roundtable event dates and agendas are now
