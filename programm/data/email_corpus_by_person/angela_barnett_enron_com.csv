Wise To Ruth Anne Gray ALAXYINTERNETNET Sent Monday December AM Subject Fw FW Christmas Miracle Original Message From Mary Cleary To Sent Monday December AM Subject Fw FW Christmas Miracle Christmas miracle Great story great prayer at the end In September I woke up one morning with six hungry babies and just cents in my pocket Their father was gone The boys ranged from three months to seven years their sister was two Their Dad had never been much more than a presence they feared Whenever they heard his tires crunch on the gravel driveway they would scramble to hide under their beds He did manage to leave a week to buy groceries Now that he had decided to leave there would be no more beatings but no food either If there was a welfare system in effect in southern Indiana at that time I certainly knew nothing about it I scrubbed the kids until they looked brand new and then put on my best homemade dress I loaded them into the rusty old Chevy and drove off to find a job The seven of us went to every factory store and restaurant in our small town No luck The kids stayed crammed into the car and tried to be quiet while I tried to convince whomever would listen that I was willing to learn or do anything I had to have a job Still no luck The last place we went to just a few miles out of town was an old Root Beer Barrel drivein that had been converted to a truck stop It was called the Big Wheel An old lady named Granny owned the place and she peeked out of the window from time to time at all those kids She needed someone on the graveyard shift at night until seven in the morning She paid cents an hour and I could start that night I raced home and called the teenager down the street that babysat for people I bargained with her to come and sleep on my sofa for a dollar a night She could arrive with her pajamas on and the kids would already be asleep This seemed like a good arrangement to her so we made deal That night when the little ones and I knelt to say our prayers we all thanked God for finding Mommy a job And so I started at the Big Wheel When I got home in the mornings I woke the babysitter up and sent her home with one dollar of my tip moneyfully half of what I averaged every night As the weeks went by heating bills added another strain to my meager wage The tires on the old Chevy had the consistency of penny balloons and began to leak I had to fill them with air on the way to work and again every morning before I could go home One bleak fall morning I wagged myself to the car to go home and found four tires in the back seat New tires There was no note no nothing just those beautiful brand new tires Had angels taken up residence in Indiana I wondered I made a deal with the owner of the local service station In exchange for his mounting the new tires I would clean up his office I remember it took me a lot longer to scrub his floor than it did for him to do the tires I was now working six nights instead of five and it still wasnt enough Christmas was coming and I knew there would be no money for toys for the kids I found a can of red paint and started repairing and painting some old toys Then I hid them in the basement so there would be something for Santa to deliver on Christmas morning Clothes were a worry too I was sewing patches on top of patches on the boys pants and soon they would be too far gone to repair On Christmas Eve the usual customers were drinking coffee in the Big Wheel These were the truckers Les Frank and Jim and a state trooper named Joe A few musicians were hanging around after a gig at the Legion and were dropping nickels in the pinball machine The regulars all just sat around and talked through the wee hours of the morning and then left to get home before the sun came up When it was time for me to go home at seven oclock on Christmas morning I hurried to the car I was hoping the kids wouldnt wake up before I managed to get home and get the presents from the basement and place them under the tree We had cut down a small cedar tree by the side of the road down by the dump It was still dark and I couldnt see much but there appeared to be some dark shadows in the caror was that just a trick of the night Something certainly looked different but it was hard to tell what When I reached he car I peered warily into one of the side windows Then my jaw dropped in amazement My old battered Chevy was filled full to the top with boxes of all shapes and sizes I quickly opened the drivers side door scrambled inside and kneeled in the front facing the back seat Reaching backI pulled off the lid of the top box Inside was a whole case of little blue jeans sizes I looked inside another box It was full of shirts to go with the jeans Then I peeked inside some of the other boxes There were candy and nuts and bananas and bags of groceries There was an enormous ham for baking and canned vegetables and potatoes There was pudding and JellO and cookies pie filling and flour There was a whole bag of laundry supplies and cleaning items And there were five toy trucks and one beautiful little doll As I drove back through empty streets as the sun slowly rose on the most amazing Christmas Day of my life I was sobbing with gratitude And I will never forget the joy on the faces of my little ones that precious morning Yes there were angels in Indiana that longago December And they all hung out at the Big Wheel truck stop THE POWER OF PRAYER When you receive this say a prayer This prayer will do Thats all you have to do There is nothing attached This is powerful Just send this to four people and Do not break this please Prayer is one of the best free gifts we receive There is no cost but a lot of rewards Lets continue praying for one another Father I ask you to bless my friends reading this right now Lord show them a new revelation of Your love and power Holy Spirit I ask You to minister to their spirit at this very moment Where there is pain give them Your peace mercy Where there is self doubting release a renewed confidence in Your ability to work through them Where there is tirednessor exhaustion I ask You to give them understanding patience strength as they learn submission to Your leading Where there is spiritual stagnation I ask You to renew them by revealing Your nearness and by drawing them into greater intimacy with You Where there is fear reveal Your love and release to them Your courage Where there is a sin blocking them reveal it and break its hold over my friends life Bless their finances give them greater vision and raise up leaders and friends to support and encourage them Give each of them discernment to recognize the negative forces around them and reveal to them the power they have in You to defeat it I ask You to do these things in Jesus name Amen Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will bless you both Passing this on to one not considered a friend is something I know Christ would do FW Christmas

Wise To Ruth Anne Gray ALAXYINTERNETNET Sent Monday December AM Subject Fw FW Christmas Miracle Original Message From Mary Cleary To Sent Monday December AM Subject Fw FW Christmas Miracle Christmas miracle Great story great prayer at the end In September I woke up one morning with six hungry babies and just cents in my pocket Their father was gone The boys ranged from three months to seven years their sister was two Their Dad had never been much more than a presence they feared Whenever they heard his tires crunch on the gravel driveway they would scramble to hide under their beds He did manage to leave a week to buy groceries Now that he had decided to leave there would be no more beatings but no food either If there was a welfare system in effect in southern Indiana at that time I certainly knew nothing about it I scrubbed the kids until they looked brand new and then put on my best homemade dress I loaded them into the rusty old Chevy and drove off to find a job The seven of us went to every factory store and restaurant in our small town No luck The kids stayed crammed into the car and tried to be quiet while I tried to convince whomever would listen that I was willing to learn or do anything I had to have a job Still no luck The last place we went to just a few miles out of town was an old Root Beer Barrel drivein that had been converted to a truck stop It was called the Big Wheel An old lady named Granny owned the place and she peeked out of the window from time to time at all those kids She needed someone on the graveyard shift at night until seven in the morning She paid cents an hour and I could start that night I raced home and called the teenager down the street that babysat for people I bargained with her to come and sleep on my sofa for a dollar a night She could arrive with her pajamas on and the kids would already be asleep This seemed like a good arrangement to her so we made deal That night when the little ones and I knelt to say our prayers we all thanked God for finding Mommy a job And so I started at the Big Wheel When I got home in the mornings I woke the babysitter up and sent her home with one dollar of my tip moneyfully half of what I averaged every night As the weeks went by heating bills added another strain to my meager wage The tires on the old Chevy had the consistency of penny balloons and began to leak I had to fill them with air on the way to work and again every morning before I could go home One bleak fall morning I wagged myself to the car to go home and found four tires in the back seat New tires There was no note no nothing just those beautiful brand new tires Had angels taken up residence in Indiana I wondered I made a deal with the owner of the local service station In exchange for his mounting the new tires I would clean up his office I remember it took me a lot longer to scrub his floor than it did for him to do the tires I was now working six nights instead of five and it still wasnt enough Christmas was coming and I knew there would be no money for toys for the kids I found a can of red paint and started repairing and painting some old toys Then I hid them in the basement so there would be something for Santa to deliver on Christmas morning Clothes were a worry too I was sewing patches on top of patches on the boys pants and soon they would be too far gone to repair On Christmas Eve the usual customers were drinking coffee in the Big Wheel These were the truckers Les Frank and Jim and a state trooper named Joe A few musicians were hanging around after a gig at the Legion and were dropping nickels in the pinball machine The regulars all just sat around and talked through the wee hours of the morning and then left to get home before the sun came up When it was time for me to go home at seven oclock on Christmas morning I hurried to the car I was hoping the kids wouldnt wake up before I managed to get home and get the presents from the basement and place them under the tree We had cut down a small cedar tree by the side of the road down by the dump It was still dark and I couldnt see much but there appeared to be some dark shadows in the caror was that just a trick of the night Something certainly looked different but it was hard to tell what When I reached he car I peered warily into one of the side windows Then my jaw dropped in amazement My old battered Chevy was filled full to the top with boxes of all shapes and sizes I quickly opened the drivers side door scrambled inside and kneeled in the front facing the back seat Reaching backI pulled off the lid of the top box Inside was a whole case of little blue jeans sizes I looked inside another box It was full of shirts to go with the jeans Then I peeked inside some of the other boxes There were candy and nuts and bananas and bags of groceries There was an enormous ham for baking and canned vegetables and potatoes There was pudding and JellO and cookies pie filling and flour There was a whole bag of laundry supplies and cleaning items And there were five toy trucks and one beautiful little doll As I drove back through empty streets as the sun slowly rose on the most amazing Christmas Day of my life I was sobbing with gratitude And I will never forget the joy on the faces of my little ones that precious morning Yes there were angels in Indiana that longago December And they all hung out at the Big Wheel truck stop THE POWER OF PRAYER When you receive this say a prayer This prayer will do Thats all you have to do There is nothing attached This is powerful Just send this to four people and Do not break this please Prayer is one of the best free gifts we receive There is no cost but a lot of rewards Lets continue praying for one another Father I ask you to bless my friends reading this right now Lord show them a new revelation of Your love and power Holy Spirit I ask You to minister to their spirit at this very moment Where there is pain give them Your peace mercy Where there is self doubting release a renewed confidence in Your ability to work through them Where there is tirednessor exhaustion I ask You to give them understanding patience strength as they learn submission to Your leading Where there is spiritual stagnation I ask You to renew them by revealing Your nearness and by drawing them into greater intimacy with You Where there is fear reveal Your love and release to them Your courage Where there is a sin blocking them reveal it and break its hold over my friends life Bless their finances give them greater vision and raise up leaders and friends to support and encourage them Give each of them discernment to recognize the negative forces around them and reveal to them the power they have in You to defeat it I ask You to do these things in Jesus name Amen Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will bless you both Passing this on to one not considered a friend is something I know Christ would do FW Christmas

Wise To Ruth Anne Gray ALAXYINTERNETNET Sent Monday December AM Subject Fw FW Christmas Miracle Original Message From Mary Cleary To Sent Monday December AM Subject Fw FW Christmas Miracle Christmas miracle Great story great prayer at the end In September I woke up one morning with six hungry babies and just cents in my pocket Their father was gone The boys ranged from three months to seven years their sister was two Their Dad had never been much more than a presence they feared Whenever they heard his tires crunch on the gravel driveway they would scramble to hide under their beds He did manage to leave a week to buy groceries Now that he had decided to leave there would be no more beatings but no food either If there was a welfare system in effect in southern Indiana at that time I certainly knew nothing about it I scrubbed the kids until they looked brand new and then put on my best homemade dress I loaded them into the rusty old Chevy and drove off to find a job The seven of us went to every factory store and restaurant in our small town No luck The kids stayed crammed into the car and tried to be quiet while I tried to convince whomever would listen that I was willing to learn or do anything I had to have a job Still no luck The last place we went to just a few miles out of town was an old Root Beer Barrel drivein that had been converted to a truck stop It was called the Big Wheel An old lady named Granny owned the place and she peeked out of the window from time to time at all those kids She needed someone on the graveyard shift at night until seven in the morning She paid cents an hour and I could start that night I raced home and called the teenager down the street that babysat for people I bargained with her to come and sleep on my sofa for a dollar a night She could arrive with her pajamas on and the kids would already be asleep This seemed like a good arrangement to her so we made deal That night when the little ones and I knelt to say our prayers we all thanked God for finding Mommy a job And so I started at the Big Wheel When I got home in the mornings I woke the babysitter up and sent her home with one dollar of my tip moneyfully half of what I averaged every night As the weeks went by heating bills added another strain to my meager wage The tires on the old Chevy had the consistency of penny balloons and began to leak I had to fill them with air on the way to work and again every morning before I could go home One bleak fall morning I wagged myself to the car to go home and found four tires in the back seat New tires There was no note no nothing just those beautiful brand new tires Had angels taken up residence in Indiana I wondered I made a deal with the owner of the local service station In exchange for his mounting the new tires I would clean up his office I remember it took me a lot longer to scrub his floor than it did for him to do the tires I was now working six nights instead of five and it still wasnt enough Christmas was coming and I knew there would be no money for toys for the kids I found a can of red paint and started repairing and painting some old toys Then I hid them in the basement so there would be something for Santa to deliver on Christmas morning Clothes were a worry too I was sewing patches on top of patches on the boys pants and soon they would be too far gone to repair On Christmas Eve the usual customers were drinking coffee in the Big Wheel These were the truckers Les Frank and Jim and a state trooper named Joe A few musicians were hanging around after a gig at the Legion and were dropping nickels in the pinball machine The regulars all just sat around and talked through the wee hours of the morning and then left to get home before the sun came up When it was time for me to go home at seven oclock on Christmas morning I hurried to the car I was hoping the kids wouldnt wake up before I managed to get home and get the presents from the basement and place them under the tree We had cut down a small cedar tree by the side of the road down by the dump It was still dark and I couldnt see much but there appeared to be some dark shadows in the caror was that just a trick of the night Something certainly looked different but it was hard to tell what When I reached he car I peered warily into one of the side windows Then my jaw dropped in amazement My old battered Chevy was filled full to the top with boxes of all shapes and sizes I quickly opened the drivers side door scrambled inside and kneeled in the front facing the back seat Reaching backI pulled off the lid of the top box Inside was a whole case of little blue jeans sizes I looked inside another box It was full of shirts to go with the jeans Then I peeked inside some of the other boxes There were candy and nuts and bananas and bags of groceries There was an enormous ham for baking and canned vegetables and potatoes There was pudding and JellO and cookies pie filling and flour There was a whole bag of laundry supplies and cleaning items And there were five toy trucks and one beautiful little doll As I drove back through empty streets as the sun slowly rose on the most amazing Christmas Day of my life I was sobbing with gratitude And I will never forget the joy on the faces of my little ones that precious morning Yes there were angels in Indiana that longago December And they all hung out at the Big Wheel truck stop THE POWER OF PRAYER When you receive this say a prayer This prayer will do Thats all you have to do There is nothing attached This is powerful Just send this to four people and Do not break this please Prayer is one of the best free gifts we receive There is no cost but a lot of rewards Lets continue praying for one another Father I ask you to bless my friends reading this right now Lord show them a new revelation of Your love and power Holy Spirit I ask You to minister to their spirit at this very moment Where there is pain give them Your peace mercy Where there is self doubting release a renewed confidence in Your ability to work through them Where there is tirednessor exhaustion I ask You to give them understanding patience strength as they learn submission to Your leading Where there is spiritual stagnation I ask You to renew them by revealing Your nearness and by drawing them into greater intimacy with You Where there is fear reveal Your love and release to them Your courage Where there is a sin blocking them reveal it and break its hold over my friends life Bless their finances give them greater vision and raise up leaders and friends to support and encourage them Give each of them discernment to recognize the negative forces around them and reveal to them the power they have in You to defeat it I ask You to do these things in Jesus name Amen Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will bless you both Passing this on to one not considered a friend is something I know Christ would do FW Christmas
