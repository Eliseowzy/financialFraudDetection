take on Sooners The Sporting News OUNebraska headlines blockbuster weekend of games SoonerSportscom Stoops on Nebraska By Joe Wallace Date Oct Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops celebrates on the sideline as time runs out during the Sooners win over topranked Nebraska last season in Norman On Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch Great player Eric Crouch is an excellent player that has speed he has toughness he has power He is without question the nucleus and key member in their offensive attack Everything that happens in their offense hes a part of He has the ability to make plays Hes a great player On if Nebraska has as powerful of an offensive line this year as theyve had in the past I believe so Theyre big strong physical players that have been very productive so far this year I believe theyre consistent to what theyve had On Nebraskas option compared to the other option attacks OU has faced this year against Air Force and Kansas State Air Force is more a triple option and a doubleslot wishbonetype option Kansas State has many similar plays that Nebraska has along with different ones Its always hard to compare but there are similarities and there are differences On if Nebraskas tall tight ends and receivers pose any problem for OUs defense Theyve just got to jump higher when they throw them the ball Theyre big strong guysTheyre excellent blockers as well On Nebraska tight end Tracy Wistrom Tracy does a great job Hes got excellent speed for a tight end Excellent hands He is a big weapon in that you get so concentrated in stopping the run game they like to sneak him behind you or outside of you in different ways that as a player and as a defense we are very aware of and constantly keying On keeping the teams emotions down and not overpursuing plays on defense like they did last year in the first quarter against Nebraska Weve had a lot of big games since then as well and the experience in that game will help them I think at that time we were coming off an offweek that also may or may not have been a factor I think our players are much more seasoned in this type of atmosphere today then they were at that time last year On Nebraskas defense Nebraskas defense has been strong all year You look at the way theyve played the few points theyve given up the few yards theyve given up Theyve been strong Tech got some big plays and executed in some situations to create those plays Tech made some plays on them but I also no through the year their defense has been very strong On if Crouch is Nebraskas best runner Their tailbacks are very good as well They run so much quarterback run game be it options draws quarterback leads They have every quarterback run play thats been invented and they keep inventing more He carries the ball every bit as much as anybody on their offense and probably the most On if Crouch is a better passer this year Yes but I felt he was a good thrower last year He started off the game and threw some very good balls that worked us and one was a touchdown Weve respected his throwing ability last year I imagine like anybody with another year of experience hes better at it this year then he was a year ago On if playing at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln will be the most challenging environment his team has faced yet I dont know how you compare that Weve been in some challenging atmospheres and Im sure this will be as equal as any We understand that but I also think it has a way of exciting and has your team ready as well On Mike Stoops comments that Nebraskas offense is the toughest to prepare for in college football I wouldnt argue with him Ive said it a number of times Theyre as intricate at developing schemes to run the football as any dynamic pass offense Theyre very disciplined and thorough in how they create seams to run the football To stop them youve got to be equally as disciplined and be in position to read it out and then be physical when you get there to take it on and tackle Like I said they keep inventing new run plays and youve got to keep reading them out and figuring out ways to try and stop them On Nebraska staying at the top of college football on an annual basis Thats why everybody here has great respect for their program It is very impressive and a complement to their administration as well as their entire program the way theyve been able to sustain it and do things right On if he sees the OUNebraska as more of a rivalry of respect than the OUTexas rivalry I dont know I cant speak for them but we respect Texas This rivalry has always determined a conference champion not always but so many times has determined a conference champion between Nebraska and OU This game has not only determined the conference championship but you look at both these schools with national championships between them and so many times whoever has the conference championship has a chance to compete for the national championship I just think its being in the conference longer together is what the difference is On if he will use films from old OklahomaNebraska games to inspire the team like he did last year I think its important that our players truly understand the traditional and history of this game and respect it Respect the players that have been here before and how they played in those games I think its good that they know and understand as much about their program as they can I wanted our players to understand and know that being here at Oklahoma this is how we are supposed to play This is how traditionally our team has played And traditionally Oklahoma has stood there and played with anybody and played well And in fact has played well against Nebraska here at OU or in Lincoln I felt it was important that they understood that That was them that was their heritage Thats what it is and we needed to play at that level I wanted them to realize that they could I believe it gave us the attitude or it helped us with the attitude to go into the football game and feel confident that were ready for this On his memories of the OUNU series growing up I remember watching two of the best coached teams in the country play Both teams were always very wellcoached Watching great players on the field that the whole country knew about And watching exciting plays The breakaway plays on both sides I couldnt wait to watch this game as a young person I can remember back to Steve Owens and what a big strong guy this is thats running the ball I remember Johnny Rodgers and the great returns that he had Greg Pruitt and some of the games he had Im not smart enough to remember the details of them all but I can remember those players and the plays they made On if the loser of this game still has a realistic shot at the national title Probably so if both teams are able to win out and meet in the championship game I would imagine that would have a chance to happen Im sure theres a possibility On the possibility of scheduling Nebraska during the years OU does not play them in conference play I dont know how you could unless you want to change the league and how you play the games I dont know how the setup would work Theres no sense in me even worrying about it On how much Jason Whites experience playing in a big game against Texas will help against Nebraska I think it will help him greatly His experience in that game and his experience in the last two Experience is experience When youre out there playing you dont realize the setting you dont hear anybody It gets down to the experience of playing He gets better the more he plays I believe hell handle it well The bottom line is youre playing against a good team Youve got to outperform them or make more plays than they do Jason will go in there going after it like everybody else Thats what you feel good about On if he feels good about Nebraska having played in more big games this season I dont know if its an advantage They have guys that have been around awhile that have been in big games We understand what it takes to compete in these games but Im sure they do as well Coaches Corner The greatest rivalry in football By Merv Johnson Date Oct This week Coach Johnson gives his thoughts on why OUNU is the greatest rivalry in college football Finally the week the Sooners play the Cornhuskers has arrived Everyone can now talk openly about playing Nebraska without prefacing everything with an If Both teams have made it into the showdown undefeated and highly ranked The eyes of all of college football will be watching Things are finally back in order in this conference and in the national college football scene The OklahomaNebraska rivalry is in my mind the very best in all of football for all the right reasons Both teams coaching staffs and fans have the utmost respect for each other The hype leading up to the game and the media coverage after the game are complementary classy and fair No dirt no cheap shots and credit where credit is due The game itself has always been fiercely contested without the crap on the field or in the stands that marks far too many rivalries Plus except for and when we fell off the face of the earth it has been one great college football contest In my first ten years at Oklahoma the winner was conference champion played in the Orange Bowl and played there three times for the National Championship The entire nation eagerly awaited this game because they knew two of the countries best would go at it in a wellplayed football game The only real regret I have had with the Big XII is that the OUNebraska game was not played every year When the Southwest Conference split into two divisions they made sure all the old rivalry games were protected Surely some scheduling adjustment could have been made by the conference forefathers to have allowed this contest to be an exception It was the only big time rivalry affected by going to the NorthSouth divisions It would have been such a plus for the conference each year I know exactly what it will be like Saturday when the team arrives at the stadium There will be people everywhere dressed in red just like it is here except most of it will be that pale red Nebraska wears The dressing room is fairly spacious and old school traditional just like Notre Dame was Visiting teams have used those same quarters probably for seventy years When you leave the dressing room it is about an eightyyard walk right through the crowd A narrow corridor is roped through that mob of people who reach out to give you five as you walk by And they are nice Thats what I remember more than anything They dont yell obscenities etc and after the game win or lose they say good game good luck and generally defy what you come to expect from having been to many of the other places we play When you finally enter the playing field its like what it must have been for those gladiators centuries ago The stands surround you as the seats in the end zones occupy as much area as the sides The fans in red are crammed in everywhere and very close to the field Youd have to not be much of a competitor to go in there and not play your best In the twentythree seasons Ive been at Oklahoma I dont think weve ever gone to Lincoln as the favorite Consequently some of those victories there were remarkably fabulous experiences Likewise a couple of the losses were heartbreaking and a couple were downright embarrassing I truly felt in and we let the Nebraska fans down about as much as we did our Sooner fans because I know they expected so much more from Oklahoma Who will ever forget in JC Watts pitching the ball to Buster Rhymes who raced down the sideline in front of our bench that set up a short gamewinning pass to Bobby Grayson Or the two times our defense stuffed Nebraska on fourth and one to keep us in the game How about Brian Hall and the defense holding Nebraska for four downs inside the five in the fourth quarter to keep the score at Or Danny Bradleys ensuing yard scamper to win the game In the Sooners were yards away and appeared donein with very little time left Then Keith Jackson and Jamelle Holieway performed their version of Sooner Magic Jackson and some unbelievable plays and Tim Lasher kicked his second field goal as time ran out to create a victory It all happened in the last five minutes The following year the schedule change forced us to play in Lincoln again No one gave the Sooners much of a chance because our QB Holieway and FB Lydell Carr were out of the game with injuries Their respective replacements Charles Thompson and Rotnei Anderson and the Sooner running game have never been better as the good guys won Unbelievably our defense held the great Nebraska offense consecutive possessions without a first down One two three and out Neither team is going to go into the game to lose But someone will have to I hope though that it will be another of those great games for all the country to see And I hope too that we can have a rematch come December in Dallas In his years as an OU assistant coach he helped the Sooners build a record win a national championship and five Big Eight Conference titles and post seven bowl game victories

October AM To Watson Brad J Subject FW OUNU Locker Room Report All is not lost AP PhotoDave Weaver OUNU Locker Room Report All is not lost By James Hale Date Oct The streak is over but the season isnt James Hale talks with the Oklahoma coaches a day after their to Nebraska Make no bones about it Oklahoma is not down and out over their loss to Nebraska Sure they disappointed but Oklahoma is still Oklahoma and they know that it took everything that Nebraska had to beat them on their home field The Sooner coaches feel very good about how they played in the game They knew going in that it was going to be incredibly tough to win the game in Lincoln but without question felt they could have done so In fact now knowing what they know they felt they should have won the game The game was a tight fit so it turned on a couple of plays OU was very confident and very much alive with to play in the fourth quarter In fact OU Head Coach Bob Stoops was so confident in his defense that he decided to pooch kick a punt from Tim Duncan down inside the five instead of going for a yard field goal Now hindsight is twentytwenty but Stoops said he would do it again Considering how we were playing defensively I would probably pooch it again Stoops said Sunday afternoon following the game Now that I know what happened I keep wrestling with that decision but I like our defense so much that I am sure that nine times out of ten I would pooch it down there and tell our defense to go get the ball I have a lot of confidence in Tim Duncan and know that he can make a yarder but if he doesnt we lose field position and I just thought it was better we tried to pin them down Hey give them credit Eric Crouch makes a big play on the option and then they beat us on the trick play Things like that happen in a good football game Eric Crouchs yard gain was a gamesaver for the Huskers Crouch was totally held in check before he finally breaks one off the right tackle to get the Huskers off their goal line However at that point the Sooners were still in good shape before gamesaver number two occurred We have them stuffed right there at the Nebraska but we get called for the inadvertent facemask said codefensive coordinator Brent Venables That is just a bad break on our part We stuff the play just like we had stuffed him the whole game but we get a penalty and they keep the drive alive We played great defense on that series Think about it we let them off the goal line but we hold our poise and stuff them the next three downs Bingo we should be getting the football back with a little over five minutes remaining in fairly good field position As it is we get the penalty and then get burned on the trick play Thats football But because of the way it happened we are not discouraged how we played at all For percent of the game Oklahomas defense was outstanding Roy Williams and Rocky Calmus were flying around the ball and Brandon Everage was doing a great job in run and pass coverage It took two Cornhuskers on most plays to block freshman sensation Tommie Harris and in the fourth quarter Harris was stronger than any Husker offensive lineman Where the Sooners lost this game was in their lack of playmaking offensive on offense and special teams I cant believe I am saying the Sooners lost this game on special teams but on this rare occasion Nebraska had the better special team play They made more plays than us in the end than we did and that made the difference said Stoops We had our opportunities that we didnt come through and convert on The reverse pass is wide open and we have a chance to go ahead but again we throw a bad ball and dont convert Then we had some drops in the second half and missed some opportunities for some big plays on fade routes We have come up with those kinds of receptions before however we werent able to do it against Nebraska I felt in the kicking game that their punting game got the better of ours When both teams punt times there is a lot of exchanging there and I felt they had better field position in the end That coupled with two turnovers hurt us because in tight games that makes a difference Again they made more plays than us and won the game The lack of production out of the wide receivers continues to be the big story offensively Granted the quarterbacking has been up and down but if the Sooner wide receivers played like they did a year ago then the quarterbacks would look a lot better First let me point out that nothing has changed at the Sooner practices The wide receivers catch the same amount of footballs that they caught last year Wide receiver coach Steve Spurrier Jr is doing the same outstanding job he did a year ago and it is basically the same guys However you have to factor in they lost of Andre Woolfolk and the fact that Mark Clayton is the only wide receiver that is stepping up on a consistent basis Woolfolk did not play one snap on offense but did an outstanding job on defense Clayton once again played well coming up with yards on six catches Norman also had a solid game with four catches for yards However where is Curtis Fagan and Antwone Savage Savage had two catches for yards but both juniors are not getting open enough or making big plays We had some opportunities slip through our hands literally slip through our hands said Offensive Coordinator Mark Mangino Its obvious on the plays that we are talking about that we had our hands on the ball and just didnt haul them in We are not asking our wide receivers to make any plays they didnt make last year but right now we are not getting the same production However let me point out that they are not totally problem Our quarterbacks are not always finding the right receiver in their progressions and many times the quarterback is having a defender right in his face because our oline didnt do a good enough job It takes guys to make an offense work and to break it down At right tackle the Sooners alternated Jerod Fields and Jammal Brown and both gave a solid account of themselves They played right tackle by committee and I think we will keep it that way said Mangino Both played well enough to give us a chance to have success and that is about all we can hope for right now Right now both cant play an entire game by themselves so we are going to play both of them and both have potential to be very good offensive linemen Bob Stoops says that starting quarterback Jason White has a sprained knee and that he will miss the Tulsa game but he has a chance to be back for Texas AM White was getting Xrayed Sunday and reports indicate that the knee injury is a torn ACL and that White will attempt to play on it if he can stand the pain This situation is very similar to OU defensive back Terrance Simms knee injury that occurred early in the season Simms attempted to comeback after sitting out one game and and reinjured the knee in the fourth quarter of his first game back which has forced him to sit out the rest of the season What you hope is that there is nothing more to Whites knee injury and he can come back in two weeks Its another opportunity for Nate Hybl to get something going at quarterback The coaches seemed pleased with Hybls performance against Nebraska and he did look good in the first half In the second half he struggled against the Nebraska pressure and his wide receivers didnt catch the ball on some nicely thrown fades There is no question that the team has total confidence in White and they would like to feel the same way about Hybl For that to happen Hybl needs to deliver some big throws Most of the national media at the game believes that OU and Nebraska are two of the top four programs in the country All believe that Florida and Miami belong with the Big s top two big two All believe that OU and Nebraska will battle again in the Big Championship game and if the Sooners win they will still have a great shot to play for the national championship The projected BCS poll tomorrow is Nebraska Miami OU and Florida with Texas fifth One final point Bob Stoops and his football team handled the loss with great class Stoops was great at the postgame press conference and won over many national friends He was intelligent funny and right to the point with his answers Mike Stoops Brent Venables and Mark Mangino were the same All were dressed very well handled themselves very well and were total class The Sooner players answered every question and despite the fact they were hurting inside really won over the national media This OU program is all about doing things the right away and that was never more evident than in their first loss in games
