<3528934.1075844935903.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jeffrey.keeler@enron.com,2000-03-23 03:13:00,EPA principles for MTBE ban Cc is a copy of EPAs legislative principles for phasing out MTBE use These principles have been criticized by Members of Congress even oxygenate bill sponsor Brian Bilbray as being very vague and lacking any helpful information whatsoever At the House Commerce Committee hearing a few weeks ago EPA Assistant Administrator Perciasepe was blasted for not having submitted anything in detail that would help Congress solve the complex RFGMTBE issue These empty prinicples will not likely help EPA in moving forward with their regulatory plans LEGISLATIVE PRINCIPLES FOR PROTECTING DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES PRESERVING CLEAN AIR BENEFITS AND PROMOTING RENEWABLE FUELS The Federal Reformulated Gasoline Program RFG established in the Clean Air Act Amendments of has provided substantial reductions in the emissions of a number of air pollutants from motor vehicles most notably volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides precursors of ozone carbon monoxide and air toxics benzene butadiene and others In most cases these reductions have exceeded those required by law However the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE in our nations fuel supply has created a significant and unacceptable risk to drinking water and ground water resources As a result of these concerns last year EPA commissioned a Blue Ribbon Panel on MTBE and Oxygenates in Gasoline the Panel On July the Panel issued recommendations on ways to maintain air quality while protecting water quality from the risks associated with MTBE Significantly the Panel called for a substantial reduction in the use of MTBE as well as action by Congress to remove the current oxygenate requirement from the Clean Air Act EPA endorsed the Panels recommendations and committed to work with Congress to make targeted amendments to the Clean Air Act In the months since the Panel issued its recommendations detections of MTBE in water supplies have grown and Congress has not yet acted to address this issue It is of increasing importance to enact legislation that addresses this problem in an environmentally sound and costeffective way Such legislation should provide authority to phase out MTBE while avoiding gasoline supply shortages and ensuring price stability The following legislative principles taken together as a single package are designed to maintain air quality and enhance water quality protection while preserving the significant role of renewable fuels most importantly ethanol In addition it is the Administrations intention that the resulting legislation provide sufficient flexibility with respect to both time and range of technological choices so as to allow for continued adequate supplies of gasoline at reasonable prices for consumers Recommendation Amend the Clean Air Act to provide the authority to significantly reduce or eliminate the use of MTBE The rising number of MTBE detections in ground and surface water in some areas of the nation have increased the urgency for preventing further MTBE contamination In some cases communities have been forced to abandon their drinking water supply To effectively address this growing problem the Administration recommends that Congress amend the Clean Air Act to provide the authority to significantly reduce or eliminate the use of MTBE Recommendation As MTBE use is reduced or eliminated ensure that air quality gains are not diminished The clean burning Reformulated Gasoline Program has helped bring clean air to cities across the nation In many cases Americans have enjoyed air quality improvements that have exceeded expectations The Administration recommends that as Congress significantly reduces or eliminates MTBE it institute measures that maintain our air quality gains Recommendation Replace the existing oxygen requirement contained in the Clean Air Act with a renewable fuel standard for all gasoline Reducing or eliminating MTBE in no way diminishes the continued need for other oxygenates such as ethanol to control mobile source emissions In addition a significant role for renewable fuels is important to our nations energy supply see EO in which President Clinton sets a goal of tripling the use of renewable bioenergy by Thus the Administration recommends that Congress replace the oxygenate requirement in the Clean Air Act with a renewable fuel annual average content for all gasoline at a level that maintains the current level of renewable fuel of the gasoline supply and allows for sustained growth over the next decade Congressional action on these recommendations is essential if we are to continue to achieve the clean air public health benefits of cleaner burning gasoline while avoiding unacceptable risks to our nations water supplies The Administration urges Congress to address this request for legislation as quickly as possible We remain committed to working with Congress to provide a targeted legislative solution to this matter

Congress required in the Clean Air Act of that areas of the country with the worst ozone smog problems use reformulated gasoline RFG with an increased oxygen content of Seventeen states and the District of Columbia presently use reformulated gasoline RFG either because of the Congressional mandate or because some areas have voluntarily chosen to use RFG to help achieve their clean air goals Methyl tertiarybutyl ether MTBE is the oxygen additive most commonly used by the petroleum industry to satisfy the RFG mandate MTBE is used in approximately of RFG with ethanol being the second most commonly used additive Of those areas listed below only Milwaukee and Chicago use RFG that is primarily ethanol Areas Required to Use RFG Areas That Have Voluntarily Chosen to Use RFG Los Angeles CA San Diego CA Hartford CT New York City NYCTNJ Greater Philadelphia PANJDEMD Chicago ILWIIN Baltimore MD Houston TX Milwaukee WI Sacramento CA The State of Connecticut that portion not part of NYC The

Massachusetts St Louis MO New Hampshire Portion of Greater Boston The State of New Jersey that portion not part of NYC and Phil New York counties near NYC The State of Rhode Island Texas DallasFort Worth area Virginia DC suburbs Richmond NorfolkVirginia BeachNewport News Since the late s MTBE also has been used by the petroleum industry in much smaller amounts as an octane enhancer to replace lead Approximately billion gallons of MTBE are used each year in gasoline barrels per day out of a total of million barrelsday of gasoline an increase of more than times since Congresss mandate MTBE in Water Since MTBE is very soluble in water and does not cling to soil well it has a tendency to migrate much more quickly into water than other components of gasoline Recent testing by the United States Geological Survey show detections of MTBE in approximately of the ground water in RFG areas while there is only a detection rate in nonRFG areas Most of these detections are below the levels of public health concern and are within the range EPA has set for a taste and odor water advisory for MTBE at to parts per billion Small individual fuel spills more than million gallons of gasoline each year and storm water runoff contribute to low level detections of MTBE in water supplies MTBE detections at higher concentrations usually result from leaking underground or aboveground fuel storage tanks and pipelines Even though significant air quality gains have been made using RFG these air benefits can be maintained without using MTBE and without endangering the nations water resources MTBE Call to Action In response to the growing concerns regarding MTBE in water EPA Administrator Browner appointed an independent Blue Ribbon Panel of experts to investigate the use of oxygen additives in gasoline The Panel called for significant reduction in the use of MTBE in gasoline and recommended that Congress and EPA take action to lift the oxygen mandate and clean up MTBE contamination EPA fully supports the Panel recommendations and is taking steps to strengthen its underground storage tank safe drinking water remediation and research programs Upon release of the Panels report in September EPA immediately began working with and encouraging Congress to pass legislation that responded to the Panels recommendations To date legislation that would solve this problem has not moved forward EPA is now providing Congress with a framework for legislation that will give EPA the authority to significantly reduce or eliminate MTBE EPA is also taking action to control MTBE under the Toxic Substances Control Act TSCA as a backup to the needed Congressional action A TSCA rulemaking is procedurally burdensome and may take several years to complete Ethanol Use Will Expand Current annual ethanol production is about billion gallons Of this total about percent is used in RFG during the summer in Federally designated nonattainment areas About percent of ethanol production is used in the winter oxygenate program in Federally designated areas where carbon monoxide is a problem The remaining percent of production is used in conventional gasoline markets around the United States to enhance octane and extend fuel supplies With todays announcement by Secretary Glickman and Administrator Browner ethanol use is expected to continue to grow Provided air quality gains achieved to date are not reduced ethanol will continue to be used very much as it is used today In areas of the country where it is heavily used ethanol will continue to be favored based on its price availability and environmental benefits Other areas may also find ethanol to be an economic way to maintain air quality benefits that had been achieved with the use of MTBE Without the renewable fuels standard some petroleumbased substitutes for ethanol may emerge over time The proposed renewable fuels standard would ensure that the current market for ethanol would be maintained and expand over time The renewable fuels standard will be met through the use of fuels made from a variety of renewable feedstocks While most ethanol now is made from corn other crops such as wheat and sorghum have and could also be used In addition new conversion technologies now in development are expected to be available in the future for efficient conversion of cellulosic material to ethanol These technologies would make possible the broader use of a wide array of renewable feedstocks including agricultural waste and residue such as corn stalks and dedicated crops such as switchgrass The President has set a goal to triple US use of biobased products and bioenergy by The Administrations FY budget proposes an increase of million percent to support biobased products and bioenergy research and development demonstration and commercialization and outreach and education activities The President also directed USDAs Commodity Credit Corporation to provide up to million in FY and up to million in and in incentive payments to ethanol and other bioenergy producers to expand production of biobased fuels Payments will be made on a portion of the increase in agricultural commodities purchased for expanded bioenergy production with smaller and cooperativelyowned facilities receiving higher payment rates

and ethanol interests remain at odds as the Senate seeks to limit use of the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE making it uncertain whether the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will be able to craft an acceptable national solution to the problem of MTBE in water lobbyists told BNA April Despite fundamental differences however all sources interviewed for this storyincluding two oil industry officials three ethanol advocates and several other sources active in the legislative process on this issuesaid that it still appeared possible that national MTBE legislation satisfying multiple interests could be developed I dont think were at an impasse one oil industry official said echoing comments by others in the debate I just think its going to take time Whether this means that a compromise can be worked out during this legislative session remains to be seen this official and others said The committee chairman Sen Bob Smith RNH has made MTBE a priority saying that Congress must eliminate the threat of water contamination posed by the fuel oxygenate while being careful to preserve the air quality benefits associated with MTBEmixed gasoline The chairmans view of the issue however is contrary to the view held by the Clinton administration by ranking minority member Sen Max Baucus DMont and by Democratic and Republican agricultural interests in the Senate These forces hold that cornderived ethanol and possibly other renewable fuels should gain a wider market under any legislation addressing the threat of MTBE water contamination The oil industry and Smith disagree with that view Smith Rejects Renewables Linkage When the Clinton administration announced on March its support for a national renewable fuels mandate Smith said the issue of renewable fuels has absolutely nothing to do with eliminating MTBE from our drinking water He repeated this point in a newspaper opinion piece April In addition to gasoline and ethanol advocates several other interest groups maintain an active role in the ongoing debate and Senate committee staff ar continuing behindthescenes meetings with all sides sources said Generally comprehensive MTBE legislation is expected to slash use of the additive without necessarily eliminating it entirely A committee bill also is expected to provide states with the option of waiving the Clean Air Act mandate currently driving the use of MTBE and ethanol another fuel oxygenate At the same time such a bill is expected to include no backsliding language to ensure that air toxics reductions achieved in the eastern United States over the last several years are maintained even if states waive out of the air act mandate Sources said the committee also is weighing possible cleanup liability relief for MTBE producers and enhancements to fuel storage tank clean up programs Heavy Reliance on MTBE MTBE is a highoxygen highoctane gasoline additive that is one of the most heavily produced chemicals in the United States With roughly million gallons of MTBE mixed with gasoline each day in the United States the chemical makes up more than percent of gasoline by volume according to the oil industry MTBE use is driven mainly by the Clean Air Act requirement that all reformulated gasoline contain at least percent oxygen by weight Reformulated gasoline is sold in areas of the country with poor air quality According to the Environmental Protection Agency more than percent of reformulated gasoline production relies on MTBE to meet the oxygen requirement However MTBE smells somewhat like turpentine and has been detected in public water supplies rendering at least a few of those supplies undrinkable The health effects of drinking MTBE in water are little known but the chemical does taste and smell bad according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service RFG programs in Chicago and Milwaukee rely on ethanol for oxygen content in their reformulated gasoline Among other concerns in the legislative debate the ethanol industry fears losing this market if Congress eliminates the percent oxygen requirement in the Clean Air Act to address MTBE concerns one industry representative said There were billion gallons of ethanol mixed into gasoline in according to the US Department of Agriculture USDA chief economist Keith Collins said before the Senate Agricultural Committee April that there are ethanol plants in operation in nearly states Bill Would Ease Percent Oxygen Rule To address water quality concerns Smith has signed on to legislation S that would allow states to lift the percent mandate driving MTBE use Introduced by Inhofe and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif S would not ban or phase down MTBE outright However this is expected to change when and if the Environment and Public Works committee marks up more comprehensive legislation oil ethanol and other sources said I think theres a growing set of opinion that MTBE either needs to be phased down to historic levels or phased out entirely over a period of some years an oil industry source said Chemical companies that make MTBE disagree and continue to urge an overhaul of underground storage tank programs in order to mitigate water contamination According to one source familiar with the issue Senate committee staff members are considering several legislative ideas that might address concerns of MTBE interests Prospective liability relief from contamination cleanup costs is under consideration as is the idea that MTBE makers should get expedited review of required permits when switching to alternate chemical products In addition the committee may be considering more rigorous regulation of underground storage tanks as part of comprehensive MTBE legislation this source said Daschle Harkin Drafts At least bills have been introduced in the th Congress to address the problem of MTBE in water according to the Congressional Research Service report The report said most bills would either eliminate the Clean Air Act requirement driving oxygenate use or would explicitly ban MTBE Some of the bills would bolster the Environmental Protection Agencys underground storage tank program since leaking USTs are considered the main cause of water contamination This approach is supported by certain MTBE makers who told BNA that water contamination is caused by leaking tanks and not by the highquality fuel additive Additional draft bills are pending introduction including comprehensive legislation by Sen Tom Daschle DSD the Senate minority leader that would significantly curtail MTBE use by while letting states take action before then Daschles billsaid by Baucuss staff to be supported by the ranking EPW committee memberalso would bolster ethanol production through a national renewable fuels mandate expanding national average ethanol use to percent or more over the next years In addition the draft legislation would amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to get states the money they need to implement UST cleanup programs Ethanol supporter Sen Tom Harkin DIowa also is drafting MTBE legislation that he hopes to introduce soon after the Senates Easter recess a spokeswoman said Harkin is ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and supports a renewable fuels standard If crafted in the right way Harkin has said such a standard could result in far more ethanol use than current law Iowa ranks second after Illinois in total ethanol production capacity according to the US Department of Agriculture Nebraska ranks third and Minnesota ranks fourth RFG Market Despite calls for eliminating the percent oxygenate requirement in the reformulated gasoline program ethanol interests said they still support maintenance of the requirement combined with an MTBE ban Such a scenario would leave ethanol to fill the RFG market void doubling ethanol use over three to five years sources said If Congress were to eliminate the percent mandate but institute a national renewable fuels requirement ethanol use also is expected to at least double from current levels However it would do so over a longer period of about years one ethanol source said Oil industry officials as well as Northeast states and some environmental advocates oppose this simple MTBE ban because it would create a de facto ethanol mandate The oil industry also continues to oppose a national renewable fuels standard officials said A representative of Northeast states told a Senate panel April that Smith appeared to be exploring a compromise with ethanol interests considering a national average alternative fuel requirement that would benefit ethanol as well as natural gas electricity and other transportation fuels The Northeast representative Jason Grumet of Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management supports the national average alternative fuel approach since it would offer the ethanol industry market share without requiring the Northeast to use large quantities of Midwestderived ethanol However oil company interests reaffirmed April their longheld opposition to any new fuel mandates saying concerns over MTBE in water should be addressed by eliminating current statutory mandates and not by instituting any new mandates Oil companies are particularly firm in their position given that agricultural states are expected to play a key role in upcoming presidential elections a second oil industry official said It is not simply that the industry opposes new mandatesthough that is the casebut also that an ethanolmandate bidding war might erupt in a year when Republicans and Democrats are vying for Midwestern votes the official said Ethanol Supporters Want Expansion Meanwhile ethanol interests said they will continue to fight for expansion of their product in the RFG market and do not necessarily see a national renewable fuels mandate as a legislative compromise The Clinton administrations renewable standard would require ethanol use initially at current levels of about percent of gasoline The mandate would then expand over years administration officials have said Ethanol is more volatile than MTBE making it more difficult for oil refiners to produce summertime gasoline that meets low emissions requirements for volatile organic compounds This is one reason the de facto mandate is opposed by Northeast states and environmental interests Some of the renewables mandates under consideration in Congress would allow refiners to meet requirements over an annual average enabling them to avoid or reduce their ethanol use in summer No Markup Scheduled Smith staff confirmed only that discussions with oil ethanol environmental MTBE and state interests continue A spokesman said comprehensive MTBE legislation is something were trying to get done quickly but that a bill markup has not been scheduled Discussions leading to a full EPW committee markup of more comprehensive MTBE legislation are important to the legislative process sources said because a bill is not expected to weather floor debate without early support from Democrats and Republicans on the committee as well as from members of the Senate Agricultural Committee I just cant see this getting duked out on the floor said one ethanol lobbyist I think that we the MTBE folks the oil company folks and the environmentalists all recognize that there is mutually assured destruction on the floor According to one source a new version of the bill is expected to push MTBE use down to pre levels over about four years Before the air act amendments required the sale of reformulated gasoline MTBE was used mainly to enhance octane It is unclear whether the bill will somehow prove acceptable to both Democrats and Republicans ethanol and oil interests as well as to Northeast states the Midwest and California Things change day to day an oil industry official said I think the issue could be resolved without the ethanol piece but the ethanol piece is just so difficult he added I think right now the chairman is poking around in the mud to find somewhere with solid footing an ethanol industry source said

efforts and other developments EE Newsline Feb Volume II Issue AIR POLLUTIONWATER POLLUTION EPA FLOATS TWO PROPOSALS AFFECTING MTBE REFORMULATED GASOLINE The Environmental Protection Agency has advanced proposals dealing with the touchy issues of methyl tertiary butyl ether regulation and with the reformulated gasoline program to the White House Office of Management and Budget and although the two proposals are being kept under wraps they have already spurred controversy and debate Both items were forwarded to OMB Feb and both will appear in the Federal Register probably after days of OMB review the standard time allotted for such proposals With neither proposal having been made public speculation abounds about both The first item which is being reviewed by OMB as an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking ANPR aims to control MTBE a synthetic oxygenate added to gasoline to lower emissions of air pollutants The Clean Air Act mandates that certain urban areas with high levels of air pollution contain percentbyweight level of oxygenates in their gasoline in order to reduce emissions of ozoneforming hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide To comply with this reformulated gas RFG mandate MTBE is relied on for over percent of the gasoline ethanol is used in almost percent and other oxygenates make up for the remaining amount Although MTBE has been heralded for its role in reducing air emissions it is under attack because of environmental contamination particularly to groundwater In fact both the Senate and House have plans to move legislation to allow states to waive the oxygenate mandate and California has requested a waiver from the RFG requirements an issue that could induce other states that have problems with MTBE contamination to take similar action Now however EPA appears poised to take action of its own According to sources the EPA plan would seek to control MTBE under the Toxic Substances Control Act TSCA provides EPA the authority to prohibit certain chemicals or substances if the agency concludes it presents or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment MTBE clearly meets this test claimed Sen Barbara Boxer D Calif who has in the past fought to have MTBE phased out However Terry Wigglesworth executive director of the Oxygenated Fuels Association which represents MTBE producers argued otherwise TSCA is not a good technical choice she said of EPAs proposal Among the hurdles EPA will face with the proposal she predicted is that under TSCA EPA must look at the risks to human health and the environment but there are enormous air quality benefits due to MTBE use for example there have been significant reductions in ozone and air toxic emissions such as benzene Also under TSCA EPA must determine if the risk could be reduced by other federal laws already being administered she explained pointing specifically to the underground storage tank program which she said has not been complied with too well In a Feb letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner Boxer said Some critics of this approach argue that MTBE contamination may be controlled by upgrading our underground storage tanks This wont solve the MTBE problem however because we now know that even those new tanks leak She also said MTBE poses a more pervasive water contamination problem than the other harmful constituents of gasoline like benzene because it moves through water faster farther and persists longer than those constituents Whether EPAs proposal would entail banning phasing out or capping MTBE use is unclear and was disputed among various sources However one industry source said that EPA was not taking a stance on that issue and would first take public comment through the ANPR and proposed rule Although sources indicated that the ANPR would not typically be printed in the Federal Register until the day review period has expired We heard EPA asked OMB to fast track it one industry source said And a federal government source also hinted that the proposal would be reviewed very quickly The second proposal is shrouded in even more ambiguity What is certain is that the proposal would entail an adjustment to RFG as stated by an OMB source Environmental and industry sources said that the hints theyve gotten indicate that the proposal entails an offset for carbon monoxide According to these sources EPA has discussed this option with stakeholders in the past Under the proposal certain RFG provisions concerning emissions of volatile organic compounds would be loosened as long as there were significant reductions in CO emissions VOCs are blamed for ozone production and carbon monoxide also contributes to ozone According to an environmentalist this proposal would encourage increased reliance on ethanol by refineries Wigglesworth spoke against this proposal saying Any loosening of requirements to maintain actual air quality benefits that weve achieved through cleaner burning gasoline that would turn back the clock on cleaner air or air quality would be unacceptable

principles have been criticized by Members of Congress even oxygenate bill sponsor Brian Bilbray as being very vague and lacking any helpful information whatsoever At the House Commerce Committee hearing a few weeks ago EPA Assistant Administrator Perciasepe was blasted for not having submitted anything in detail that would help Congress solve the complex RFGMTBE issue These empty prinicples will not likely help EPA in moving forward with their regulatory plans LEGISLATIVE PRINCIPLES FOR PROTECTING DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES PRESERVING CLEAN AIR BENEFITS AND PROMOTING RENEWABLE FUELS The Federal Reformulated Gasoline Program RFG established in the Clean Air Act Amendments of has provided substantial reductions in the emissions of a number of air pollutants from motor vehicles most notably volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides precursors of ozone carbon monoxide and air toxics benzene butadiene and others In most cases these reductions have exceeded those required by law However the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE in our nations fuel supply has created a significant and unacceptable risk to drinking water and ground water resources As a result of these concerns last year EPA commissioned a Blue Ribbon Panel on MTBE and Oxygenates in Gasoline the Panel On July the Panel issued recommendations on ways to maintain air quality while protecting water quality from the risks associated with MTBE Significantly the Panel called for a substantial reduction in the use of MTBE as well as action by Congress to remove the current oxygenate requirement from the Clean Air Act EPA endorsed the Panels recommendations and committed to work with Congress to make targeted amendments to the Clean Air Act In the months since the Panel issued its recommendations detections of MTBE in water supplies have grown and Congress has not yet acted to address this issue It is of increasing importance to enact legislation that addresses this problem in an environmentally sound and costeffective way Such legislation should provide authority to phase out MTBE while avoiding gasoline supply shortages and ensuring price stability The following legislative principles taken together as a single package are designed to maintain air quality and enhance water quality protection while preserving the significant role of renewable fuels most importantly ethanol In addition it is the Administrations intention that the resulting legislation provide sufficient flexibility with respect to both time and range of technological choices so as to allow for continued adequate supplies of gasoline at reasonable prices for consumers Recommendation Amend the Clean Air Act to provide the authority to significantly reduce or eliminate the use of MTBE The rising number of MTBE detections in ground and surface water in some areas of the nation have increased the urgency for preventing further MTBE contamination In some cases communities have been forced to abandon their drinking water supply To effectively address this growing problem the Administration recommends that Congress amend the Clean Air Act to provide the authority to significantly reduce or eliminate the use of MTBE Recommendation As MTBE use is reduced or eliminated ensure that air quality gains are not diminished The clean burning Reformulated Gasoline Program has helped bring clean air to cities across the nation In many cases Americans have enjoyed air quality improvements that have exceeded expectations The Administration recommends that as Congress significantly reduces or eliminates MTBE it institute measures that maintain our air quality gains Recommendation Replace the existing oxygen requirement contained in the Clean Air Act with a renewable fuel standard for all gasoline Reducing or eliminating MTBE in no way diminishes the continued need for other oxygenates such as ethanol to control mobile source emissions In addition a significant role for renewable fuels is important to our nations energy supply see EO in which President Clinton sets a goal of tripling the use of renewable bioenergy by Thus the Administration recommends that Congress replace the oxygenate requirement in the Clean Air Act with a renewable fuel annual average content for all gasoline at a level that maintains the current level of renewable fuel of the gasoline supply and allows for sustained growth over the next decade Congressional action on these recommendations is essential if we are to continue to achieve the clean air public health benefits of cleaner burning gasoline while avoiding unacceptable risks to our nations water supplies The Administration urges Congress to address this request for legislation as quickly as possible We remain committed to working with Congress to provide a targeted legislative solution to this matter

Congress required in the Clean Air Act of that areas of the country with the worst ozone smog problems use reformulated gasoline RFG with an increased oxygen content of Seventeen states and the District of Columbia presently use reformulated gasoline RFG either because of the Congressional mandate or because some areas have voluntarily chosen to use RFG to help achieve their clean air goals Methyl tertiarybutyl ether MTBE is the oxygen additive most commonly used by the petroleum industry to satisfy the RFG mandate MTBE is used in approximately of RFG with ethanol being the second most

Worth area Virginia DC suburbs Richmond NorfolkVirginia BeachNewport News Since the late s MTBE also has been used by the petroleum industry in much smaller amounts as an octane enhancer to replace lead Approximately billion gallons of MTBE are used each year in gasoline barrels per day out of a total of million barrelsday of gasoline an increase of more than times since Congresss mandate MTBE in Water Since MTBE is very soluble in water and does not cling to soil well it has a tendency to migrate much more quickly into water than other components of gasoline Recent testing by the United States Geological Survey show detections of MTBE in approximately of the ground water in RFG areas while there is only a detection rate in nonRFG areas Most of these detections are below the levels of public health concern and are within the range EPA has set for a taste and odor water advisory for MTBE at to parts per billion Small individual fuel spills more than million gallons of gasoline each year and storm water runoff contribute to low level detections of MTBE in water supplies MTBE detections at higher concentrations usually result from leaking underground or aboveground fuel storage tanks and pipelines Even though significant air quality gains have been made using RFG these air benefits can be maintained without using MTBE and without endangering the nations water resources MTBE Call to Action In response to the growing concerns regarding MTBE in water EPA Administrator Browner appointed an independent Blue Ribbon Panel of experts to investigate the use of oxygen additives in gasoline The Panel called for significant reduction in the use of MTBE in gasoline and recommended that Congress and EPA take action to lift the oxygen mandate and clean up MTBE contamination EPA fully supports the Panel recommendations and is taking steps to strengthen its underground storage tank safe drinking water remediation and research programs Upon release of the Panels report in September EPA immediately began working with and encouraging Congress to pass legislation that responded to the Panels recommendations To date legislation that would solve this problem has not moved forward EPA is now providing Congress with a framework for legislation that will give EPA the authority to significantly reduce or eliminate MTBE EPA is also taking action to control MTBE under the Toxic Substances Control Act TSCA as a backup to the needed Congressional action A TSCA rulemaking is procedurally burdensome and may take several years to complete Ethanol Use Will Expand Current annual ethanol production is about billion gallons Of this total about percent is used in RFG during the summer in Federally designated nonattainment areas About percent of ethanol production is used in the winter oxygenate program in Federally designated areas where carbon monoxide is a problem The remaining percent of production is used in conventional gasoline markets around the United States to enhance octane and extend fuel supplies With todays announcement by Secretary Glickman and Administrator Browner ethanol use is expected to continue to grow Provided air quality gains achieved to date are not reduced ethanol will continue to be used very much as it is used today In areas of the country where it is heavily used ethanol will continue to be favored based on its price availability and environmental benefits Other areas may also find ethanol to be an economic way to maintain air quality benefits that had been achieved with the use of MTBE Without the renewable fuels standard some petroleumbased substitutes for ethanol may emerge over time The proposed renewable fuels standard would ensure that the current market for ethanol would be maintained and expand over time The renewable fuels standard will be met through the use of fuels made from a variety of renewable feedstocks While most ethanol now is made from corn other crops such as wheat and sorghum have and could also be used In addition new conversion technologies now in development are expected to be available in the future for efficient conversion of cellulosic material to ethanol These technologies would make possible the broader use of a wide array of renewable feedstocks including agricultural waste and residue such as corn stalks and dedicated crops such as switchgrass The President has set a goal to triple US use of biobased products and bioenergy by The Administrations FY budget proposes an increase of million percent to support biobased products and bioenergy research and development demonstration and commercialization and outreach and education activities The President also directed USDAs Commodity Credit Corporation to provide up to million in FY and up to million in and in incentive payments to ethanol and other bioenergy producers to expand production of biobased fuels Payments will be made on a portion of the increase in agricultural commodities purchased for expanded bioenergy production with smaller and cooperativelyowned facilities receiving higher payment rates

and ethanol interests remain at odds as the Senate seeks to limit use of the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE making it uncertain whether the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will be able to craft an acceptable national solution to the problem of MTBE in water lobbyists told BNA April Despite fundamental differences however all sources interviewed for this storyincluding two oil industry officials three ethanol advocates and several other sources active in the legislative process on this issuesaid that it still appeared possible that national MTBE legislation satisfying multiple interests could be developed I dont think were at an impasse one oil industry official said echoing comments by others in the debate I just think its going to take time Whether this means that a compromise can be worked out during this legislative session remains to be seen this official and others said The committee chairman Sen Bob Smith RNH has made MTBE a priority saying that Congress must eliminate the threat of water contamination posed by the fuel oxygenate while being careful to preserve the air quality benefits associated with MTBEmixed gasoline The chairmans view of the issue however is contrary to the view held by the Clinton administration by ranking minority member Sen Max Baucus DMont and by Democratic and Republican agricultural interests in the Senate These forces hold that cornderived ethanol and possibly other renewable fuels should gain a wider market under any legislation addressing the threat of MTBE water contamination The oil industry and Smith disagree with that view Smith Rejects Renewables Linkage When the Clinton administration announced on March its support for a national renewable fuels mandate Smith said the issue of renewable fuels has absolutely nothing to do with eliminating MTBE from our drinking water He repeated this point in a newspaper opinion piece April In addition to gasoline and ethanol advocates several other interest groups maintain an active role in the ongoing debate and Senate committee staff ar continuing behindthescenes meetings with all sides sources said Generally comprehensive MTBE legislation is expected to slash use of the additive without necessarily eliminating it entirely A committee bill also is expected to provide states with the option of waiving the Clean Air Act mandate currently driving the use of MTBE and ethanol another fuel oxygenate At the same time such a bill is expected to include no backsliding language to ensure that air toxics reductions achieved in the eastern United States over the last several years are maintained even if states waive out of the air act mandate Sources said the committee also is weighing possible cleanup liability relief for MTBE producers and enhancements to fuel storage tank clean up programs Heavy Reliance on MTBE MTBE is a highoxygen highoctane gasoline additive that is one of the most heavily produced chemicals in the United States With roughly million gallons of MTBE mixed with gasoline each day in the United States the chemical makes up more than percent of gasoline by volume according to the oil industry MTBE use is driven mainly by the Clean Air Act requirement that all reformulated gasoline contain at least percent oxygen by weight Reformulated gasoline is sold in areas of the country with poor air quality According to the Environmental Protection Agency more than percent of reformulated gasoline production relies on MTBE to meet the oxygen requirement However MTBE smells somewhat like turpentine and has been detected in public water supplies rendering at least a few of those supplies undrinkable The health effects of drinking MTBE in water are little known but the chemical does taste and smell bad according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service RFG programs in Chicago and Milwaukee rely on ethanol for oxygen content in their reformulated gasoline Among other concerns in the legislative debate the ethanol industry fears losing this market if Congress eliminates the percent oxygen requirement in the Clean Air Act to address MTBE concerns one industry representative said There were billion gallons of ethanol mixed into gasoline in according to the US Department of Agriculture USDA chief economist Keith Collins said before the Senate Agricultural Committee April that there are ethanol plants in operation in nearly states Bill Would Ease Percent Oxygen Rule To address water quality concerns Smith has signed on to legislation S that would allow states to lift the percent mandate driving MTBE use Introduced by Inhofe and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif S would not ban or phase down MTBE outright However this is expected to change when and if the Environment and Public Works committee marks up more comprehensive legislation oil ethanol and other sources said I think theres a growing set of opinion that MTBE either needs to be phased down to historic levels or phased out entirely over a period of some years an oil industry source said Chemical companies that make MTBE disagree and continue to urge an overhaul of underground storage tank programs in order to mitigate water contamination According to one source familiar with the issue Senate committee staff members are considering several legislative ideas that might address concerns of MTBE interests Prospective liability relief from contamination cleanup costs is under consideration as is the idea that MTBE makers should get expedited review of required permits when switching to alternate chemical products In addition the committee may be considering more rigorous regulation of underground storage tanks as part of comprehensive MTBE legislation this source said Daschle Harkin Drafts At least bills have been introduced in the th Congress to address the problem of MTBE in water according to the Congressional Research Service report The report said most bills would either eliminate the Clean Air Act requirement driving oxygenate use or would explicitly ban MTBE Some of the bills would bolster the Environmental Protection Agencys underground storage tank program since leaking USTs are considered the main cause of water contamination This approach is supported by certain MTBE makers who told BNA that water contamination is caused by leaking tanks and not by the highquality fuel additive Additional draft bills are pending introduction including comprehensive legislation by Sen Tom Daschle DSD the Senate minority leader that would significantly curtail MTBE use by while letting states take action before then Daschles billsaid by Baucuss staff to be supported by the ranking EPW committee memberalso would bolster ethanol production through a national renewable fuels mandate expanding national average ethanol use to percent or more over the next years In addition the draft legislation would amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to get states the money they need to implement UST cleanup programs Ethanol supporter Sen Tom Harkin DIowa also is drafting MTBE legislation that he hopes to introduce soon after the Senates Easter recess a spokeswoman said Harkin is ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and supports a renewable fuels standard If crafted in the right way Harkin has said such a standard could result in far more ethanol use than current law Iowa ranks second after Illinois in total ethanol production capacity according to the US Department of Agriculture Nebraska ranks third and Minnesota ranks fourth RFG Market Despite calls for eliminating the percent oxygenate requirement in the reformulated gasoline program ethanol interests said they still support maintenance of the requirement combined with an MTBE ban Such a scenario would leave ethanol to fill the RFG market void doubling ethanol use over three to five years sources said If Congress were to eliminate the percent mandate but institute a national renewable fuels requirement ethanol use also is expected to at least double from current levels However it would do so over a longer period of about years one ethanol source said Oil industry officials as well as Northeast states and some environmental advocates oppose this simple MTBE ban because it would create a de facto ethanol mandate The oil industry also continues to oppose a national renewable fuels standard officials said A representative of Northeast states told a Senate panel April that Smith appeared to be exploring a compromise with ethanol interests considering a national average alternative fuel requirement that would benefit ethanol as well as natural gas electricity and other transportation fuels The Northeast representative Jason Grumet of Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management supports the national average alternative fuel approach since it would offer the ethanol industry market share without requiring the Northeast to use large quantities of Midwestderived ethanol However oil company interests reaffirmed April their longheld opposition to any new fuel mandates saying concerns over MTBE in water should be addressed by eliminating current statutory mandates and not by instituting any new mandates Oil companies are particularly firm in their position given that agricultural states are expected to play a key role in upcoming presidential elections a second oil industry official said It is not simply that the industry opposes new mandatesthough that is the casebut also that an ethanolmandate bidding war might erupt in a year when Republicans and Democrats are vying for Midwestern votes the official said Ethanol Supporters Want Expansion Meanwhile ethanol interests said they will continue to fight for expansion of their product in the RFG market and do not necessarily see a national renewable fuels mandate as a legislative compromise The Clinton administrations renewable standard would require ethanol use initially at current levels of about percent of gasoline The mandate would then expand over years administration officials have said Ethanol is more volatile than MTBE making it more difficult for oil refiners to produce summertime gasoline that meets low emissions requirements for volatile organic compounds This is one reason the de facto mandate is opposed by Northeast states and environmental interests Some of the renewables mandates under consideration in Congress would allow refiners to meet requirements over an annual average enabling them to avoid or reduce their ethanol use in summer No Markup Scheduled Smith staff confirmed only that discussions with oil ethanol environmental MTBE and state interests continue A spokesman said comprehensive MTBE legislation is something were trying to get done quickly but that a bill markup has not been scheduled Discussions leading to a full EPW committee markup of more comprehensive MTBE legislation are important to the legislative process sources said because a bill is not expected to weather floor debate without early support from Democrats and Republicans on the committee as well as from members of the Senate Agricultural Committee I just cant see this getting duked out on the floor said one ethanol lobbyist I think that we the MTBE folks the oil company folks and the environmentalists all recognize that there is mutually assured destruction on the floor According to one source a new version of the bill is expected to push MTBE use down to pre levels over about four years Before the air act amendments required the sale of reformulated gasoline MTBE was used mainly to enhance octane It is unclear whether the bill will somehow prove acceptable to both Democrats and Republicans ethanol and oil interests as well as to Northeast states the Midwest and California Things change day to day an oil industry official said I think the issue could be resolved without the ethanol piece but the ethanol piece is just so difficult he added I think right now the chairman is poking around in the mud to find somewhere with solid footing an ethanol industry source said

MTBE They are also considering action on a request from the state of California to grant its request for an oxygenate waiver through regulatory means Taken in conjunction with the increased interest on Capitol Hill for moving oxygenate waiver or MTBE phase out legislation the future does not look very bright for MTBE We will continue to pursue on Capitol Hill our Enrondeveloped approach which proposes stranded cost recovery and liability protection for US MTBE producers The House and Senate will be moving forward with hearings and legislation shortly and we will keep you posted on our efforts and other developments EE Newsline Feb Volume II Issue AIR POLLUTIONWATER POLLUTION EPA FLOATS TWO PROPOSALS AFFECTING MTBE REFORMULATED GASOLINE The Environmental Protection Agency has advanced proposals dealing with the touchy issues of methyl tertiary butyl ether regulation and with the reformulated gasoline program to the White House Office of Management and Budget and although the two proposals are being kept under wraps they have already spurred controversy and debate Both items were forwarded to OMB Feb and both will appear in the Federal Register probably after days of OMB review the standard time allotted for such proposals With neither proposal having been made public speculation abounds about both The first item which is being reviewed by OMB as an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking ANPR aims to control MTBE a synthetic oxygenate added to gasoline to lower emissions of air pollutants The Clean Air Act mandates that certain urban areas with high levels of air pollution contain percentbyweight level of oxygenates in their gasoline in order to reduce emissions of ozoneforming hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide To comply with this reformulated gas RFG mandate MTBE is relied on for over percent of the gasoline ethanol is used in almost percent and other oxygenates make up for the remaining amount Although MTBE has been heralded for its role in reducing air emissions it is under attack because of environmental contamination particularly to groundwater In fact both the Senate and House have plans to move legislation to allow states to waive the oxygenate mandate and California has requested a waiver from the RFG requirements an issue that could induce other states that have problems with MTBE contamination to take similar action Now however EPA appears poised to take action of its own According to sources the EPA plan would seek to control MTBE under the Toxic Substances Control Act TSCA provides EPA the authority to prohibit certain chemicals or substances if the agency concludes it presents or will present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment MTBE clearly meets this test claimed Sen Barbara Boxer D Calif who has in the past fought to have MTBE phased out However Terry Wigglesworth executive director of the Oxygenated Fuels Association which represents MTBE producers argued otherwise TSCA is not a good technical choice she said of EPAs proposal Among the hurdles EPA will face with the proposal she predicted is that under TSCA EPA must look at the risks to human health and the environment but there are enormous air quality benefits due to MTBE use for example there have been significant reductions in ozone and air toxic emissions such as benzene Also under TSCA EPA must determine if the risk could be reduced by other federal laws already being administered she explained pointing specifically to the underground storage tank program which she said has not been complied with too well In a Feb letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner Boxer said Some critics of this approach argue that MTBE contamination may be controlled by upgrading our underground storage tanks This wont solve the MTBE problem however because we now know that even those new tanks leak She also said MTBE poses a more pervasive water contamination problem than the other harmful constituents of gasoline like benzene because it moves through water faster farther and persists longer than those constituents Whether EPAs proposal would entail banning phasing out or capping MTBE use is unclear and was disputed among various sources However one industry source said that EPA was not taking a stance on that issue and would first take public comment through the ANPR and proposed rule Although sources indicated that the ANPR would not typically be printed in the Federal Register until the day review period has expired We heard EPA asked OMB to fast track it one industry source said And a federal government source also hinted that the proposal would be reviewed very quickly The second proposal is shrouded in even more ambiguity What is certain is that the proposal would entail an adjustment to RFG as stated by an OMB source Environmental and industry sources said that the hints theyve gotten indicate that the proposal entails an offset for carbon monoxide According to these sources EPA has discussed this option with stakeholders in the past Under the proposal certain RFG provisions concerning emissions of volatile organic compounds would be loosened as long as there were significant reductions in CO emissions VOCs are blamed for ozone production and carbon monoxide also contributes to ozone According to an environmentalist this proposal would encourage increased reliance on ethanol by refineries Wigglesworth spoke against this proposal saying Any loosening of requirements to maintain actual air quality benefits that weve achieved through cleaner burning gasoline that would turn back the clock on cleaner air or air quality would be unacceptable

Government Affairs folks as well to share this information I am currently assessing the situation regarding pipeline safety legislation This week has been very quiet on Capitol Hill as all of the members are back in the states on August recess running for reelection and it is a big vacation week for staffbut heres what I am hearing As you may or may not know we have been been very active this year trying to temper pipeline safety legislation that was fairly reactionary in the wake of last summers liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham WA SENATE In June Senators John McCain RAZ and Slade Gorton RWA led the charge to pass a pipeline safety bill S out of the Senate Commerce Committee and that bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate Because of the hasty way in which S was drafted and passed there was a realization by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the bill could not make it to the floor for a vote until some serious changes were made mostly things that were deal breakers for industry Enron and El Paso were leading the charge and we had a number of Senators backing our efforts to negotiate changes including Majority Leader Trent Lott RMS Kay Bailey Hutchison RTX John Breaux DLA and Sam Brownback RKS From what Ive learned since the accident these Senators are not changing their strategy and are still asking for the same improvements Fortunately most of the changes we were looking to make were fairly technical and not the types of things that would be seriously compromised by the accident Industy was already in the position of having to accept a number of things they never would have if not for he Bellingham incidentthe El Paso incident just reinforces those The biggest potential effect I see from the El Paso accident is an increased effort to pass something before the Congress adjourns in early October The New Mexico Senators are already calling for a floor vote on the McCainGorton legislation and I there will certainly be greater pressure on leaders to wrap up negotiations get agreement from all sides on a bill and move it unanimously through a vote on the Senate floor HOUSE The House is moving a bit more slowly but again Id expect the El Paso situation to expedite things somewhat There were several bills introduced in the House that were not moving anywhere including an identical copy of the McCain legislation introduced by Rep Bob Franks RNJ Franks is now anxious to move legislation as he is running for Senate and would love to take credit for helping out on an issue of national visibility Before the accident House Tranportation Committee leaders on both the Democrat and Republican side were working on a consensus bill that they could introduce in early September and move quickly through the Committee and to the House floor Im told that negotiations on that legislation are moving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly Unlike our experience in the Senate we have had significant input into the bill in advance and expect something that we can live with and something more reasonable than the McCain bill With that said there may be an effort to expand the bill in a few areas because of the El Paso accident so well have to see what kind of hand were dealt in the next few weeks Overall Id expect pipeline safety legislation to be given higher priority when Congress returns after Labor Day In the absence of this accident I would have given it slim odds of passing in the few short weeks until adjournment with appropriations bills taking up most of Congress precious time Now there will be greater pressure to come to consensus and move bills through by an expedited process so that everyone running for election in November can show that theyve done something about this terrible tragedy With that said theres still not that much time to get legislation through so Id say that theres still a chance it may not get done this year If I had to attach a number to it Id say that the El Paso accident improves the chances of legislation going all the way to probably Gas supply to California Ill have to do some more checking in this area and get back to you All Ive heard so far is that the safety questions that remain may slow the speed of restarting flow on the line notwithstanding that El Paso thinks it can have things running again fairly quickly Im sure the power crunch in California will put some counterpressure on but I just dont have good intelligence on this yet With all this said Im on vacation this week and parts of next week finishing up some leave Ive taken for the birth of our new baby daughter so I may not have an additional report for you until early to mid next week If you have questions please respond by email or leave a message on my voice mail at

The federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority was put on the defensive at a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing last week as its adversaries mounted an offensive against the power agency for its huge billion debt and unaccountability With a bill S introduced by Sen Mitch McConnell RKy serving as the backdrop the need for changing TVAs role in an emerging competitiv e electricity market was reviewed TVA is one of the biggest power producers in the country and it enjoys certain unfair privileges according to investorowned utilities which are seeking changes to TVA to level the playing field in a competitive electricity market McConnells bill is touted as making TVA more accountable by subjecting the power agency to among other things antitrust laws and to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission McConnell who was present at the hearing questioned TVA on its claim of providing lowcost power and wh y it should not be brought under FERC authority Supporting the position of S Robert Hewett representing TVA Watch a coalition led by Duke Energy and other private utilities decried the privileges TVA is endowed with Hewett said TVA has the ability to set its own wholesale and retail rates is exempt from antitrust laws and makes on ly token payments in lieu of taxes to the local government No other entity in the country even comes close to having this type of authority or license said Hewett Hewett wants TVA to be subjected to antitrust laws and FERC jurisdiction I n addition TVA must be restricted from building new generation capacity and it should not have preferential access to power from other federal facilities at rates below fair market value Hewett recommended Richard Munson executive director NortheastMidwest Institute continued on the same stream as Hewett calling TVA a national problem Munson said TVA s inspector general in a recent report has highlighted TVAs most serious problem its unaccountability Decisions by TVAs board of director s are not reviewed by state regulators or federal agencies and the power agency enjoys a monopoly in its service territory so it is not accountable even to market forces according to Munson Stating that TVA has been propped up by enormous taxpayer subsidies Munson said The giant utility is exempt from hundreds of federal and state laws and regulations it pays no federal or state taxes and it obtains lowcost loans because of Washingtons i mplied support But Mark Medford TVA executive vice president cautioned that proposals su ch as S may risk compromising the lowcost reliable electricity availab le to the Tennessee Valley region Medford said S would place new restrictions on TVA and expand regulation of TVA activities which seems unusual in the context of a discussion of deregulation of the electricity industry Medford also argued against FERC and state regulation of TVA prices and FER C determination of the need for new generation capacity He said responsibili ty for fulfilling those missions is placed on the threemember TVA board nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate Superimposing a higher regulatory body such as FERC to pass judgment on the decision of the TVA board in these areas seems both duplicative and inappropriate Medford also did not think that antitrust laws should be applied to TVA because it would be unfair to TVA ratepayers When a private utility violates the antitrust laws its stockholders bear the cost However governmental entities like TVA have no stockholders and the financial cost s of such penalties have to be borne by the people who are supposed to be served said Medford Medford asserted that investors now hold all of TVAs debt that finances the power program He said TVA debt is neither backed by the federal government nor is it supported by mortgages on TVA plant property and equipment It is secured solely by the financial operation of TVA as well as bond covenants and the provisions of the TVA Act Medford said Also Medford said TVA has been on the path of debt reduction in the last three years bringing down the debt by billion Austin Caroll representing the Kentucky Managers Association a group of municipal and rural electric cooperative utilities did not totally agree with the principles of S though it did want some changes to be made to TVA Preceding the examination of S was a hearing on the nomination of TVA board members Skila Harris and Glenn McCullough Harris served until recently as the executive director of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board managing the work of the Tennessee Valley Advisory Committee which comprises of representatives from groups interested in the future of TVA McCullough previously served on the executive committee of the Mississippi Municipal League and as the director of the Mississippi office of the Appalachian Regional Commission The TVA board of directors has three members serving nine year staggered terms

legislation currently moving through Congress Pipeline safety reauthorization legislation Authorization for pipeline safety programs as administered by the US Dept of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety OPS is currently set to expire at the end of FY At the beginning of the th Congress industry was focused on securing a simple two year reauthorization bill that basically extends current pipeline safety programs with some modest increases in funding levels In fact the House Commerce Committee who shares jurisdiction over pipeline safety with the Transportation Infrastructure Committee acted early in to pass a simple two year reauthorization bill HR Unfortunately the issue became more complex from that point A serious liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham Washington that occurred last summer killing several children dramatically changed the debate over pipeline safety Members of the House and Senate from Washington state backed by the governor and numerous state and local officials moved swiftly to introduce legislation that they feel is designed to address some of the shortcomings in federal pipeline regulation that they believe may have allowed the Bellingham incident to occur In the Senate Senator Patty Murray DWA has introduced S which is designed to expand State authority over interstate pipelines in several new areas such as inspection and testing emergency response plans leak detection and operator training and qualification The bill also would authorize a large increase in OPS funding through pipeline user fees to increase the amount of grants to the States allow for hiring of additional inspectors and increase RD for inspection and leak detection technologies The current OPS budget is around million with million from user fees the Murray bill would authorize million in FY which would require a sizeable increase in user fees Senator Slade Gorton RWA has recently decided to cosposnor the Murray bill and will be actively involved in trying to gain Republican support for the bill On the House side Rep Jack Metcalf RWA has introduced a similar bill HR which a number of the Washington representatives have cosponsored Interstate natural gas pipelines have been placed in a very difficult situation The Bellingham incident was a liquid pipeline accident and liquids pipelines generally have less stringent regulatory requirements than natural gas pipelines The Washington delegation has highlighted the fact that deaths and injuries have occurred over the past years related to natural gas pipeline incidents but they fail to distinguish the fact that almost all of those incidents were on LDC systems which ironically are entirely State regulated Only fatalities in that period were naturalgas related and the majority of those accidents were caused by third party damage In short the INGAA crowd is being dragged down by the poor records of the LDCs and the liquid pipelines The calls for more state regulation of interstate pipeline are largely misguided based on the fact that the interstate pipelines under federal regulation have an exemplary safety record In addition OPS is already working on a Pipeline Integrity Rulemaking that would implement a number of additional measures to prevent accidents on federallyregulated pipelines As you mentioned INGAA has not been doing the best job representing us on these issues They have been working in a group effort with API AGA and the Association of Oil Pipelines AOPL to try and deflect the negative claims of the Murray and Metcalf legislation but have not been forceful enough in distinguishing interstate natural gas pipelines positive record from the liquids and LDCs Thus they have given the impression that INGAA companies might be willing to submit to additional regulation that liquids and LDC are under political pressure to submit to due to Bellingham We have been working with other major INGAA companies El Paso in particular to make sure that the perspective and positive record of our natural gas pipelines is heard clearly by the key legislators The odds of these measures S HR passing on their own is fairly slim They will get a great deal of attention however The Senate Commerce Committee held a field hearing in Bellingham Washington yesterday at which Senators Gorton and Murray testified along with OPS and the families of Bellingham victims the press coverage was not good ie USA Today cover story When Pipelines Are Time Bombs These bills or portions of them will likely be offered and considered as amendments to Pipeline Safety Reauthorization legislation as it comes before the House Transportation Infrastructure and Senate Commerce Committee later this year The increased controversy caused by these bills will likely doom efforts to pass a pipeline safety reauthorization bill this year The leadership of the House and Senate Committees will not likely want to face a bitter debate between safety advocates OPS States and industry in their committees in this tough election year While this is probably a good sign there is an increased risk that industry may face some large hurdles in the appropriations process Appropriations Legislation While Members of Congress push for their stand alone bills andor amendments to reauthorization bills the greater danger is that some of these issues will be dealt with in an appropriations context In particular the fact that Senator Slade Gorton is now actively engaged in pushing for extensive pipeline safety reforms is troubling he is a key member of the Senate Appropriations Committee is close to Republican leadership and has a tough reelection fight coming up Senator Murray is also on Senate Appropriations Both are on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee which funds OPS It is quite likely that the Senators will make a push to get increases in the OPS budget for FY that would enable the kinds of reforms contemplated by their standalone legislation more state funding more inspectors more RD Much of this increase would be funded through increases in user fees INGAA indicates that it expects we could be facing increases in the range of from FY There is also the possibility that an attempt will be made to add legislative riders to the OPS appropriations such as requiring OPS to mandate inspections increase operator qualifications or allow increased state authority I would predict that legislative riders can be prevented but it will be very difficult to avoid some kind of increases beyond mere adjustments for inflation in the OPS budget and user fees The reauthorization will indeed receive attention in but our advocacy efforts will clearly need to be focused on the appropriations process in order to minimize the impact on interstate pipeline user fees and prevent other harmful mandates We will continue to work with key members of the authorizing and appropriations committees to ensure that the interstate natural gas perspective is clearly heard and if possible we avoid being dragged down in attempts to impose more strict regulation on liquids and LDCs Please let me know if you have questions or require additional information Thank you

and ethanol interests remain at odds as the Senate seeks to limit use of the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE making it uncertain whether the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will be able to craft an acceptable national solution to the problem of MTBE in water lobbyists told BNA April Despite fundamental differences however all sources interviewed for this storyincluding two oil industry officials three ethanol advocates and several other sources active in the legislative process on this issuesaid that it still appeared possible that national MTBE legislation satisfying multiple interests could be developed I dont think were at an impasse one oil industry official said echoing comments by others in the debate I just think its going to take time Whether this means that a compromise can be worked out during this legislative session remains to be seen this official and others said The committee chairman Sen Bob Smith RNH has made MTBE a priority saying that Congress must eliminate the threat of water contamination posed by the fuel oxygenate while being careful to preserve the air quality benefits associated with MTBEmixed gasoline The chairmans view of the issue however is contrary to the view held by the Clinton administration by ranking minority member Sen Max Baucus DMont and by Democratic and Republican agricultural interests in the Senate These forces hold that cornderived ethanol and possibly other renewable fuels should gain a wider market under any legislation addressing the threat of MTBE water contamination The oil industry and Smith disagree with that view Smith Rejects Renewables Linkage When the Clinton administration announced on March its support for a national renewable fuels mandate Smith said the issue of renewable fuels has absolutely nothing to do with eliminating MTBE from our drinking water He repeated this point in a newspaper opinion piece April In addition to gasoline and ethanol advocates several other interest groups maintain an active role in the ongoing debate and Senate committee staff ar continuing behindthescenes meetings with all sides sources said Generally comprehensive MTBE legislation is expected to slash use of the additive without necessarily eliminating it entirely A committee bill also is expected to provide states with the option of waiving the Clean Air Act mandate currently driving the use of MTBE and ethanol another fuel oxygenate At the same time such a bill is expected to include no backsliding language to ensure that air toxics reductions achieved in the eastern United States over the last several years are maintained even if states waive out of the air act mandate Sources said the committee also is weighing possible cleanup liability relief for MTBE producers and enhancements to fuel storage tank clean up programs Heavy Reliance on MTBE MTBE is a highoxygen highoctane gasoline additive that is one of the most heavily produced chemicals in the United States With roughly million gallons of MTBE mixed with gasoline each day in the United States the chemical makes up more than percent of gasoline by volume according to the oil industry MTBE use is driven mainly by the Clean Air Act requirement that all reformulated gasoline contain at least percent oxygen by weight Reformulated gasoline is sold in areas of the country with poor air quality According to the Environmental Protection Agency more than percent of reformulated gasoline production relies on MTBE to meet the oxygen requirement However MTBE smells somewhat like turpentine and has been detected in public water supplies rendering at least a few of those supplies undrinkable The health effects of drinking MTBE in water are little known but the chemical does taste and smell bad according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service RFG programs in Chicago and Milwaukee rely on ethanol for oxygen content in their reformulated gasoline Among other concerns in the legislative debate the ethanol industry fears losing this market if Congress eliminates the percent oxygen requirement in the Clean Air Act to address MTBE concerns one industry representative said There were billion gallons of ethanol mixed into gasoline in according to the US Department of Agriculture USDA chief economist Keith Collins said before the Senate Agricultural Committee April that there are ethanol plants in operation in nearly states Bill Would Ease Percent Oxygen Rule To address water quality concerns Smith has signed on to legislation S that would allow states to lift the percent mandate driving MTBE use Introduced by Inhofe and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif S would not ban or phase down MTBE outright However this is expected to change when and if the Environment and Public Works committee marks up more comprehensive legislation oil ethanol and other sources said I think theres a growing set of opinion that MTBE either needs to be phased down to historic levels or phased out entirely over a period of some years an oil industry source said Chemical companies that make MTBE disagree and continue to urge an overhaul of underground storage tank programs in order to mitigate water contamination According to one source familiar with the issue Senate committee staff members are considering several legislative ideas that might address concerns of MTBE interests Prospective liability relief from contamination cleanup costs is under consideration as is the idea that MTBE makers should get expedited review of required permits when switching to alternate chemical products In addition the committee may be considering more rigorous regulation of underground storage tanks as part of comprehensive MTBE legislation this source said Daschle Harkin Drafts At least bills have been introduced in the th Congress to address the problem of MTBE in water according to the Congressional Research Service report The report said most bills would either eliminate the Clean Air Act requirement driving oxygenate use or would explicitly ban MTBE Some of the bills would bolster the Environmental Protection Agencys underground storage tank program since leaking USTs are considered the main cause of water contamination This approach is supported by certain MTBE makers who told BNA that water contamination is caused by leaking tanks and not by the highquality fuel additive Additional draft bills are pending introduction including comprehensive legislation by Sen Tom Daschle DSD the Senate minority leader that would significantly curtail MTBE use by while letting states take action before then Daschles billsaid by Baucuss staff to be supported by the ranking EPW committee memberalso would bolster ethanol production through a national renewable fuels mandate expanding national average ethanol use to percent or more over the next years In addition the draft legislation would amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to get states the money they need to implement UST cleanup programs Ethanol supporter Sen Tom Harkin DIowa also is drafting MTBE legislation that he hopes to introduce soon after the Senates Easter recess a spokeswoman said Harkin is ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and supports a renewable fuels standard If crafted in the right way Harkin has said such a standard could result in far more ethanol use than current law Iowa ranks second after Illinois in total ethanol production capacity according to the US Department of Agriculture Nebraska ranks third and Minnesota ranks fourth RFG Market Despite calls for eliminating the percent oxygenate requirement in the reformulated gasoline program ethanol interests said they still support maintenance of the requirement combined with an MTBE ban Such a scenario would leave ethanol to fill the RFG market void doubling ethanol use over three to five years sources said If Congress were to eliminate the percent mandate but institute a national renewable fuels requirement ethanol use also is expected to at least double from current levels However it would do so over a longer period of about years one ethanol source said Oil industry officials as well as Northeast states and some environmental advocates oppose this simple MTBE ban because it would create a de facto ethanol mandate The oil industry also continues to oppose a national renewable fuels standard officials said A representative of Northeast states told a Senate panel April that Smith appeared to be exploring a compromise with ethanol interests considering a national average alternative fuel requirement that would benefit ethanol as well as natural gas electricity and other transportation fuels The Northeast representative Jason Grumet of Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management supports the national average alternative fuel approach since it would offer the ethanol industry market share without requiring the Northeast to use large quantities of Midwestderived ethanol However oil company interests reaffirmed April their longheld opposition to any new fuel mandates saying concerns over MTBE in water should be addressed by eliminating current statutory mandates and not by instituting any new mandates Oil companies are particularly firm in their position given that agricultural states are expected to play a key role in upcoming presidential elections a second oil industry official said It is not simply that the industry opposes new mandatesthough that is the casebut also that an ethanolmandate bidding war might erupt in a year when Republicans and Democrats are vying for Midwestern votes the official said Ethanol Supporters Want Expansion Meanwhile ethanol interests said they will continue to fight for expansion of their product in the RFG market and do not necessarily see a national renewable fuels mandate as a legislative compromise The Clinton administrations renewable standard would require ethanol use initially at current levels of about percent of gasoline The mandate would then expand over years administration officials have said Ethanol is more volatile than MTBE making it more difficult for oil refiners to produce summertime gasoline that meets low emissions requirements for volatile organic compounds This is one reason the de facto mandate is opposed by Northeast states and environmental interests Some of the renewables mandates under consideration in Congress would allow refiners to meet requirements over an annual average enabling them to avoid or reduce their ethanol use in summer No Markup Scheduled Smith staff confirmed only that discussions with oil ethanol environmental MTBE and state interests continue A spokesman said comprehensive MTBE legislation is something were trying to get done quickly but that a bill markup has not been scheduled Discussions leading to a full EPW committee markup of more comprehensive MTBE legislation are important to the legislative process sources said because a bill is not expected to weather floor debate without early support from Democrats and Republicans on the committee as well as from members of the Senate Agricultural Committee I just cant see this getting duked out on the floor said one ethanol lobbyist I think that we the MTBE folks the oil company folks and the environmentalists all recognize that there is mutually assured destruction on the floor According to one source a new version of the bill is expected to push MTBE use down to pre levels over about four years Before the air act amendments required the sale of reformulated gasoline MTBE was used mainly to enhance octane It is unclear whether the bill will somehow prove acceptable to both Democrats and Republicans ethanol and oil interests as well as to Northeast states the Midwest and California Things change day to day an oil industry official said I think the issue could be resolved without the ethanol piece but the ethanol piece is just so difficult he added I think right now the chairman is poking around in the mud to find somewhere with solid footing an ethanol industry source said

Senator John McCains RAZ pipeline safety legislation S was approved The overall outcome was not unexpected the final legislation contained several provisions that went a little bit further than Enron and INGAA would have liked but there was rigorous debate over issues like States role and mandated integrity measures and close votes on several amendments Senator McCain and other bill proponents like Senator Slade Gorton realize those issues will need to be addressed before the legislation proceeds to the Senate floor The Committee considered several amendments to the legislation McCain substitute amendment Approved by voice vote The amendment substituted the revised Chairmans mark text that was developed over the last several days in place of the original version of S All further amendments at the markup were in the context of this substitute text McCain amendment to Section b on operator assistance investigations Approved by voice vote This amendment attempts to fix language in the substitute text that was problematic to just about everyone in industry and on the Hill because it unconstitutionally forced an operator to choose between exercising constitutional rights to protect himself in a criminal investigation or keeping his job The McCain amendment did not seem to improve things much and many Senators could not understand it Senator John Breaux DLA objected to it and asked that the entire section be deleted and there was some good debate on both sides of the issue In the end McCain asked that the amendment be passed with a promise that he would work with Breaux and others to fix it before Senate floor consideration Sen John Kerry DMA Amendment on Enforcement Approved by voice vote Another confusing vote in which many members did not understand the changes being made but agreed to it on the condition that clarifications be made before Senate floor action Late last night Enron led a group including companies from INGAA and AGA in providing comments to Senator Kerry which caused him to make substantial changes to his amendment before it was voted on at markup including dropping provisions allowing citizen suits and other troubling issues In the end the amendment that passed was acceptable to industry Sen Sam Brownback RKS amendment on Advisory Council Pilot Program Rejected to Brownbacks amendment would have replaced the Advisory Council Pilot Program as proposed in the substitute text with a requirement that already existing technical advisory committees to OPS be required to meet regionally There was a good debate on the issue but Senator Gorton made a strong plea to members that the new Advisory Councils would only be a pilot program and would not have any binding role He also agreed to work with industry on improvements such as representation of pipelines on the councils before Senate floor action Brownback amendment on State Role Rejected to This amendment was written by Enron and El Paso striking language from the bill that was overly broad in suggesting that a State had oversight authority over other activities beyond proper areas like accident investigation constructionrelated activities and inspection There was a heated debate with Brownback and Breaux making excellent arguments for us but in the end we were vote short In fact Democrats switched their votes at the last minute to tip the balance I have already had discussions with Senate staff after the markup indicating that this language will need to be fixed to our satisfaction before Senate floor action Sen Ron Wyden DOR amendment increasing public righttoknow requirements Approved by voice vote This amendment increases the kinds of information that need to be made widely available to the public Because of a state of confusion in which many of the Senators left the room to go vote on the Senate floor there was no opposition voiced to the amendment and it passed without much discussion Breaux amendment on Integrity Inspection Program Rejected by voice vote This was another written by Enron and El Paso that would have removed the bias of substitute text language toward internal inspections and pressure testing and broadened the range of tools that a pipeline could include in an integrity management plan It also would have removed a requirement that any state and local official would have the chance to comment on the plan and receive a response The debate was heated over this amendment with Senator Gorton indicating that he could accept the first part of the amendment removing the bias toward internal inspectionpressure testing but not the second which he felt weakened state and local opportunity to comment on pipleines integrity plans The committee agreed to reject the amendment but work to fix the second part before Senate floor action Procedurally it was a strange markup session A quorum of the Committee members needs to be present to vote on final passage of the bill A vote on the Senate floor came up as Senator Kerry was explaining his amendment and as Senators were leaving Senator McCain very quickly asked that the entire bill be passed on voice vote before a quorum left the room subject to consideration of amendments when they returned The bill was passed before many knew what was happening Of course only about members came back to the room for the rest of the markup so much of the voting was done without full everyones participation or by proxy which had serious effects on the outcome of several amendments As you can see from the notes on many of the amendments there will be an opportunity to fix the legislation before it moves any further Several Senators indicated after the markup that they had voted with Senator Gorton on several of the amendments as a courtesy to him but would not support the bills movement to the Senate floor without serious changes being made One key ally is Senator Trent Lott RMS who supported all industry amendments His control of the Senate floor schedule as Senate Majority Leader will be key in driving changes to the legislation If satisfactory changes are not made the bill will move no further There will also be an opportunity to provide comments for Committee Report language that will accompany the final bill that was passed The report will give explanations of several of the concerns that were raised and provide legislative history that will help clarify areas where there is uncertainty about the real effect of some of the provisions We did have several victories Many of the amendments that were expected worse language from the Administration or Patty Murray legislation were not even offered because of the advance work we were able to do with Republican and Democratic Commerce Committee members and staff We were able to affect a number of changes to the Chairmans mark or substitute amendment before the markup even occured Another interesting note Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison was a complete nonfactor in the markup She is the Subcommittee chair responsible for this issue yet she did not make an opening statement and she did not vote at all on several key amendments of concern to industry We will be working on the where do we go from here strategy in the coming weeks and will report as developments occur Thanks again to all who helped out in preparation for the markup in what was an amazing team effort The technical support of Dave Johnson Colleen Raker and Lou Soldano was extremely valuable Phil Lowrys and Dave Johnsons availability to do key meetings with Senators and staff was critical in our efforts And Dave and I can attest to the fact that Enron was in a leadership role leading up to the markup guiding the efforts of INGAA and others and directly influencing the direction this legislation will take in the coming weeks and months Jeff Keeler

It will likely take some time for EPA to develop these regulations the time frame is proposed rule by and final rule by but this is a significant step in that it now formally puts mercury on the radar screen for power generators in terms of planning for emissions controls It is a positive step that EPA included in its determination an intent to develop flexible compliance measures ie trading for mercury It also means that mercury will most likely be included in any efforts to develop multipollutant legislation in the next Congress Please call me if you have any questions THURSDAY DEC EPA DECIDES MERCURY EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS MUST BE REDUCED To protect public health and the environment EPA Administrator Carol M Browner today announced that the Clinton Administration will require reductions for the first time ever of harmful mercury emissions from coalfired power plants the largest source of such emissions in America After extensive study EPA determined mercury emissions from power plants pose significant hazards to public health and must be reduced The agency will propose regulations by and issue final rules by Mercury from power plants settles over waterways polluting rivers and lakes and contaminating fish Exposure to mercury poses real risks to public health especially to children and developing fetuses Browner said The greatest source of mercury emissions is power plants and they have never been required to control these emissions before now Todays decision to address this problem marks a major step forward in the Clinton Administrations ongoing efforts to protect public health and the environment Exposure to mercury has been associated with both neurological and developmental damage in humans The developing fetus is the most sensitive to mercurys effects which include damage to nervous system development People are exposed to mercury primarily through eating fish that have been contaminated when mercury from power plants and other sources is deposited to water bodies Once mercury enters water biological processes can transform it into methylmercury a highly toxic form of mercury that builds up in animal and human tissues EPA recommends that subsistence fisherman pregnant women and others should always heed state fishing advisories Under the Clean Air Act EPA is required to study toxic air pollution from power plants in order to determine if additional regulations are necessary in order to protect public health EPA reported its study to Congress in February That study concluded that of all toxic pollution examined mercury posed the greatest concern to public health An earlier study concluded that the largest source of humanmade mercury pollution in America was coalfired power plants After completion of the study the Clean Air Act required EPA to determine whether to proceed with the development of regulations Today EPA is announcing that it has affirmatively decided that mercury air emissions from power plants should be regulated because mercury poses the greatest hazards to public health EPA will propose regulations by December and will begin developing those regulations shortly Industry the public and state local and tribal governments will have an opportunity to participate in the process Then EPA will issue final regulations by December The Clinton Administration already has taken a number of aggressive actions to reduce mercury air pollution including significantly reducing allowable emissions from municipal waste combustors medical waste incinerators and hazardous waste combustors When fully implemented in the existing rules will reduce total humancaused mercury emissions by nearly percent from levels nationwide On November President Clinton called for a dramatic new approach to reduce air pollution from Americas power plants The President highlighted the benefits of adopting a combined strategy to address all of the major pollutants emitted by power plants including mercury sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide A comprehensive strategy that addresses all of these pollutants together will provide more certainty and flexibility to industry making it the most costeffective way to control the emissions that threaten public health and the environment As the Clean Air Act requires the regulatory process to control mercury will proceed under current law However at the same time the Administration encourages the Executive Branch and the Congress to work toward legislating a comprehensive four pollutant approach which will benefit the public health the environment and the economy Todays decision will appear soon in the Federal Register but is accessible immediately on EPAs mercury web site at wwwepagovmercury Also today EPA is posting on its website mercury emissions from every coalfired power plant in the country This is consistent with EPAs strong commitment to provide citizens with information about pollution in their communities Jeffrey

to Senators Gramm and Schumer concerning their provision on Environmental Conditionality Sorry this was thrown together very quickly on short notice but I hope it is helpful Section Environmental Conditionality In general as this provision attempts to close the loophole for grandfathered pre coal plants there would be an negative impact on coal trading particularly highsulfur and our equity positions in coal mines However there are opportunities to still profit by shortinghedging our positions if we have enough knowledge and information about when these changes are going to take place we will likely be able to seize opportunities from the resulting volatility The question in your email asked only about coal markets but on the whole Enron could find some benefits from this kind of provision because of our ability to trade more gas transport more gas and build merchant gascombined cycle capacity renewables etc I have not had the chance to get any analysis on electricity prices but I would suspect that our view would be that there may be some volatility due to the shift in fuels but it would level out with the right risk management in the longer term I can try to get more for you as this legislation evolves Specific comments on the drafting sectionbysection a the only comment I would raise is that how the term electric generating unit EGU is defined is controversial right now The EPA wants to make sure EGU includes industrial boilers this point is being litigated in the NOx SIP Call and Section cases right now Unless it was the intent to also capture industrial coal boilers in this Section it may be wise to clarify that you are targeting utilities Industrials will raise a great deal of opposition if this provision is construed to include them b It probably does not make a great deal of difference whether you are taking the average capacity factor for coal fired vs fossil averaging all fossil units will create an average capacity factor that makes it a little harder for coal to meet environmental performance standards I believe the average capacity factor for all fossilcoal plants would be around Large heavilyloaded coal plants are probably in the range so they would have to cut back substantially However some of the older interim load coal plants may only run at about or less in which case they may still emit a substantial amount of pollution but not be captured under this provision So in effect this section may not limit all grandfathered coal plants just the big ones c I dont know if this is a drafting oversight or an attempt to set the bar unreasonably high for coal but including the word ALL in the phrase average emission performance achieved by ALL electric generating units would mean including gas and other clean sources in looking at emissions averages which no coal unit could ever meet In the name of workability hopefully they will include something like achieved by all COAL FIRED electric generating units From Cynthia

REQUEST FOR COMMENT Jeff As we have discussed for some time now Senators Gramm RTX and Schumer DNY have been drafting federal electricity restructuring legislation with a datecertain approach The one holdup has been the environmental conditionality provision which we have also discussed at length in the past Just late last evening the two Senators reached initial agreement on this section and as such just late this morning both offices sent the language to us for our immediate comment and review Specifically they would like Enrons read on the practical impact of this language by pm EST as they intend to introduce the bill this evening before the Senate breaks for the July th holiday Im sorry for the short turn around but as you know this is the typical situation in DC The language in parenthesis indicates Gramms edits to substitute coalfired vs Shumers NRDCs preference for fossil What is our preference based upon what his means to coal markets and the ability for coal to ramp up or not to ramp up Please provide any written comments as soon as possible Many thanks and please let me know if you have any questions Section Environmental Conditionality a In this section a noncompliant unit means a coalfired electric energy generation unit for which construction was commenced prior to August that does not comply with requirements relating to emissions of air pollutants as determined in subparagraph c b It shall be unlawful for the owner of noncompliant unit to operate such unit in any year at a capacity factor that exceeds the lesser of the average capacity factor for fossil coalfired electric energy generation units in operation in the United States or the average capacity factor for such unit based on information reported to the Commission for the years through c Within six months of enactment of this section the Administrator shall publish emission levels equal to the average emission performance achieved by all electric generating units permitted pursuant to Section and Section of the Clean Air Act and prior to the date of enactment of this section d No later than six months of after enactment the Administrator shall promulgate a list of electric energy generation units for which construction was commenced prior to August e This section takes effect on the date that is years after the date of enactment of this Act

Government Affairs folks as well to share this information I am currently assessing the situation regarding pipeline safety legislation This week has been very quiet on Capitol Hill as all of the members are back in the states on August recess running for reelection and it is a big vacation week for staffbut heres what I am hearing As you may or may not know we have been been very active this year trying to temper pipeline safety legislation that was fairly reactionary in the wake of last summers liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham WA SENATE In June Senators John McCain RAZ and Slade Gorton RWA led the charge to pass a pipeline safety bill S out of the Senate Commerce Committee and that bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate Because of the hasty way in which S was drafted and passed there was a realization by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the bill could not make it to the floor for a vote until some serious changes were made mostly things that were deal breakers for industry Enron and El Paso were leading the charge and we had a number of Senators backing our efforts to negotiate changes including Majority Leader Trent Lott RMS Kay Bailey Hutchison RTX John Breaux DLA and Sam Brownback RKS From what Ive learned since the accident these Senators are not changing their strategy and are still asking for the same improvements Fortunately most of the changes we were looking to make were fairly technical and not the types of things that would be seriously compromised by the accident Industy was already in the position of having to accept a number of things they never would have if not for he Bellingham incidentthe El Paso incident just reinforces those The biggest potential effect I see from the El Paso accident is an increased effort to pass something before the Congress adjourns in early October The New Mexico Senators are already calling for a floor vote on the McCainGorton legislation and I there will certainly be greater pressure on leaders to wrap up negotiations get agreement from all sides on a bill and move it unanimously through a vote on the Senate floor HOUSE The House is moving a bit more slowly but again Id expect the El Paso situation to expedite things somewhat There were several bills introduced in the House that were not moving anywhere including an identical copy of the McCain legislation introduced by Rep Bob Franks RNJ Franks is now anxious to move legislation as he is running for Senate and would love to take credit for helping out on an issue of national visibility Before the accident House Tranportation Committee leaders on both the Democrat and Republican side were working on a consensus bill that they could introduce in early September and move quickly through the Committee and to the House floor Im told that negotiations on that legislation are moving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly Unlike our experience in the Senate we have had significant input into the bill in advance and expect something that we can live with and something more reasonable than the McCain bill With that said there may be an effort to expand the bill in a few areas because of the El Paso accident so well have to see what kind of hand were dealt in the next few weeks Overall Id expect pipeline safety legislation to be given higher priority when Congress returns after Labor Day In the absence of this accident I would have given it slim odds of passing in the few short weeks until adjournment with appropriations bills taking up most of Congress precious time Now there will be greater pressure to come to consensus and move bills through by an expedited process so that everyone running for election in November can show that theyve done something about this terrible tragedy With that said theres still not that much time to get legislation through so Id say that theres still a chance it may not get done this year If I had to attach a number to it Id say that the El Paso accident improves the chances of legislation going all the way to probably Gas supply to California Ill have to do some more checking in this area and get back to you All Ive heard so far is that the safety questions that remain may slow the speed of restarting flow on the line notwithstanding that El Paso thinks it can have things running again fairly quickly Im sure the power crunch in California will put some counterpressure on but I just dont have good intelligence on this yet With all this said Im on vacation this week and parts of next week finishing up some leave Ive taken for the birth of our new baby daughter so I may not have an additional report for you until early to mid next week If you have questions please respond by email or leave a message on my voice mail at

To Cynthia NRON cc Subject pipeline aftermath Hi Cynthia The commercial officers here are very concerned with the El Paso pipeline explosion in New Mexico We would love to get some input from your group on the following questions if possible What is the status of pipeline safety legislation on the Hill and what is the outlook for action between now and the end of the year What are people from

Senators Gramm and Schumer concerning their provision on Environmental Conditionality Sorry this was thrown together very quickly on short notice but I hope it is helpful Section Environmental Conditionality In general as this provision attempts to close the loophole for grandfathered pre coal plants there would be an negative impact on coal trading particularly highsulfur and our equity positions in coal mines However there are opportunities to still profit by shortinghedging our positions if we have enough knowledge and information about when these changes are going to take place we will likely be able to seize opportunities from the resulting volatility The question in your email asked only about coal markets but on the whole Enron could find some benefits from this kind of provision because of our ability to trade more gas transport more gas and build merchant gascombined cycle capacity renewables etc I have not had the chance to get any analysis on electricity prices but I would suspect that our view would be that there may be some volatility due to the shift in fuels but it would level out with the right risk management in the longer term I can try to get more for you as this legislation evolves Specific comments on the drafting sectionbysection a the only comment I would raise is that how the term electric generating unit EGU is defined is controversial right now The EPA wants to make sure EGU includes industrial boilers this point is being litigated in the NOx SIP Call and Section cases right now Unless it was the intent to also capture industrial coal boilers in this Section it may be wise to clarify that you are targeting utilities Industrials will raise a great deal of opposition if this provision is construed to include them b It probably does not make a great deal of difference whether you are taking the average capacity factor for coal fired vs fossil averaging all fossil units will create an average capacity factor that makes it a little harder for coal to meet environmental performance standards I believe the average capacity factor for all fossilcoal plants would be around Large heavilyloaded coal plants are probably in the range so they would have to cut back substantially However some of the older interim load coal plants may only run at about or less in which case they may still emit a substantial amount of pollution but not be captured under this provision So in effect this section may not limit all grandfathered coal plants just the big ones c I dont know if this is a drafting oversight or an attempt to set the bar unreasonably high for coal but including the word ALL in the phrase average emission performance achieved by ALL electric generating units would mean including gas and other clean sources in looking at emissions averages which no coal unit could ever meet In the name of workability hopefully they will include something like achieved by all COAL FIRED electric generating units From Cynthia Sandherr PM To Jeffrey NRON cc Michael NRON Richard ES Steven J ES Joe NRON Stacey ES Jim FallonEnron nron Communications Joe NRON Lisa ES Subject GrammSchumer federal Electricity Legislation URGENT REQUEST FOR COMMENT Jeff As we have discussed for some time now Senators Gramm RTX and Schumer DNY have been drafting federal electricity restructuring legislation with a datecertain approach The one holdup has been the environmental conditionality provision which we have also discussed at length in the past Just late last evening the two Senators reached initial agreement on this section and as such just late this morning both offices sent the language to us for our immediate comment and review Specifically they would like Enrons read on the practical impact of this language by pm EST as they intend to introduce the bill this evening before the Senate breaks for the July th holiday Im sorry for the short turn around but as you know this is the typical situation in DC The language in parenthesis indicates Gramms edits to substitute coalfired vs Shumers NRDCs preference for fossil What is our preference based upon what his means to coal markets and the ability for coal to ramp up or not to ramp up Please provide any written comments as soon as possible Many thanks and please let me know if you have any questions Section Environmental Conditionality a In this section a noncompliant unit means a coalfired electric energy generation unit for which construction was commenced prior to August that does not comply with requirements relating to emissions of air pollutants as determined in subparagraph c b It shall be unlawful for the owner of noncompliant unit to operate such unit in any year at a capacity factor that exceeds the lesser of the average capacity factor for fossil coalfired electric energy generation units in operation in the United States or the average capacity factor for such unit based on information reported to the Commission for the years through c Within six months of enactment of this section the Administrator shall publish emission levels equal to the average emission performance achieved by all electric generating units permitted pursuant to Section and Section of the Clean Air Act and prior to the date of enactment of this section d No later than six months of after enactment the Administrator shall promulgate a list of electric energy generation units for which construction was commenced prior to August e This section takes effect on the date that is years after the date of enactment of this Act

Senator John McCains RAZ pipeline safety legislation S was approved The overall outcome was not unexpected the final legislation contained several provisions that went a little bit further than Enron and INGAA would have liked but there was rigorous debate over issues like States role and mandated integrity measures and close votes on several amendments Senator McCain and other bill proponents like Senator Slade Gorton realize those issues will need to be addressed before the legislation proceeds to the Senate floor The Committee considered several amendments to the legislation McCain substitute amendment Approved by voice vote The amendment substituted the revised Chairmans mark text that was developed over the last several days in place of the original version of S All further amendments at the markup were in the context of this substitute text McCain amendment to Section b on operator assistance investigations Approved by voice vote This amendment attempts to fix language in the substitute text that was problematic to just about everyone in industry and on the Hill because it unconstitutionally forced an operator to choose between exercising constitutional rights to protect himself in a criminal investigation or keeping his job The McCain amendment did not seem to improve things much and many Senators could not understand it Senator John Breaux DLA objected to it and asked that the entire section be deleted and there was some good debate on both sides of the issue In the end McCain asked that the amendment be passed with a promise that he would work with Breaux and others to fix it before Senate floor consideration Sen John Kerry DMA Amendment on Enforcement Approved by voice vote Another confusing vote in which many members did not understand the changes being made but agreed to it on the condition that clarifications be made before Senate floor action Late last night Enron led a group including companies from INGAA and AGA in providing comments to Senator Kerry which caused him to make substantial changes to his amendment before it was voted on at markup including dropping provisions allowing citizen suits and other troubling issues In the end the amendment that passed was acceptable to industry Sen Sam Brownback RKS amendment on Advisory Council Pilot Program Rejected to Brownbacks amendment would have replaced the Advisory Council Pilot Program as proposed in the substitute text with a requirement that already existing technical advisory committees to OPS be required to meet regionally There was a good debate on the issue but Senator Gorton made a strong plea to members that the new Advisory Councils would only be a pilot program and would not have any binding role He also agreed to work with industry on improvements such as representation of pipelines on the councils before Senate floor action Brownback amendment on State Role Rejected to This amendment was written by Enron and El Paso striking language from the bill that was overly broad in suggesting that a State had oversight authority over other activities beyond proper areas like accident investigation constructionrelated activities and inspection There was a heated debate with Brownback and Breaux making excellent arguments for us but in the end we were vote short In fact Democrats switched their votes at the last minute to tip the balance I have already had discussions with Senate staff after the markup indicating that this language will need to be fixed to our satisfaction before Senate floor action Sen Ron Wyden DOR amendment increasing public righttoknow requirements Approved by voice vote This amendment increases the kinds of information that need to be made widely available to the public Because of a state of confusion in which many of the Senators left the room to go vote on the Senate floor there was no opposition voiced to the amendment and it passed without much discussion Breaux amendment on Integrity Inspection Program Rejected by voice vote This was another written by Enron and El Paso that would have removed the bias of substitute text language toward internal inspections and pressure testing and broadened the range of tools that a pipeline could include in an integrity management plan It also would have removed a requirement that any state and local official would have the chance to comment on the plan and receive a response The debate was heated over this amendment with Senator Gorton indicating that he could accept the first part of the amendment removing the bias toward internal inspectionpressure testing but not the second which he felt weakened state and local opportunity to comment on pipleines integrity plans The committee agreed to reject the amendment but work to fix the second part before Senate floor action Procedurally it was a strange markup session A quorum of the Committee members needs to be present to vote on final passage of the bill A vote on the Senate floor came up as Senator Kerry was explaining his amendment and as Senators were leaving Senator McCain very quickly asked that the entire bill be passed on voice vote before a quorum left the room subject to consideration of amendments when they returned The bill was passed before many knew what was happening Of course only about members came back to the room for the rest of the markup so much of the voting was done without full everyones participation or by proxy which had serious effects on the outcome of several amendments As you can see from the notes on many of the amendments there will be an opportunity to fix the legislation before it moves any further Several Senators indicated after the markup that they had voted with Senator Gorton on several of the amendments as a courtesy to him but would not support the bills movement to the Senate floor without serious changes being made One key ally is Senator Trent Lott RMS who supported all industry amendments His control of the Senate floor schedule as Senate Majority Leader will be key in driving changes to the legislation If satisfactory changes are not made the bill will move no further There will also be an opportunity to provide comments for Committee Report language that will accompany the final bill that was passed The report will give explanations of several of the concerns that were raised and provide legislative history that will help clarify areas where there is uncertainty about the real effect of some of the provisions We did have several victories Many of the amendments that were expected worse language from the Administration or Patty Murray legislation were not even offered because of the advance work we were able to do with Republican and Democratic Commerce Committee members and staff We were able to affect a number of changes to the Chairmans mark or substitute amendment before the markup even occured Another interesting note Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison was a complete nonfactor in the markup She is the Subcommittee chair responsible for this issue yet she did not make an opening statement and she did not vote at all on several key amendments of concern to industry We will be working on the where do we go from here strategy in the coming weeks and will report as developments occur Thanks again to all who helped out in preparation for the markup in what was an amazing team effort The technical support of Dave Johnson Colleen Raker and Lou Soldano was extremely valuable Phil Lowrys and Dave Johnsons availability to do key meetings with Senators and staff was critical in our efforts And Dave and I can attest to the fact that Enron was in a leadership role leading up to the markup guiding the efforts of INGAA and others and directly influencing the direction this legislation will take in the coming weeks and months Jeff Keeler

and ethanol interests remain at odds as the Senate seeks to limit use of the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE making it uncertain whether the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will be able to craft an acceptable national solution to the problem of MTBE in water lobbyists told BNA April Despite fundamental differences however all sources interviewed for this storyincluding two oil industry officials three ethanol advocates and several other sources active in the legislative process on this issuesaid that it still appeared possible that national MTBE legislation satisfying multiple interests could be developed I dont think were at an impasse one oil industry official said echoing comments by others in the debate I just think its going to take time Whether this means that a compromise can be worked out during this legislative session remains to be seen this official and others said The committee chairman Sen Bob Smith RNH has made MTBE a priority saying that Congress must eliminate the threat of water contamination posed by the fuel oxygenate while being careful to preserve the air quality benefits associated with MTBEmixed gasoline The chairmans view of the issue however is contrary to the view held by the Clinton administration by ranking minority member Sen Max Baucus DMont and by Democratic and Republican agricultural interests in the Senate These forces hold that cornderived ethanol and possibly other renewable fuels should gain a wider market under any legislation addressing the threat of MTBE water contamination The oil industry and Smith disagree with that view Smith Rejects Renewables Linkage When the Clinton administration announced on March its support for a national renewable fuels mandate Smith said the issue of renewable fuels has absolutely nothing to do with eliminating MTBE from our drinking water He repeated this point in a newspaper opinion piece April In addition to gasoline and ethanol advocates several other interest groups maintain an active role in the ongoing debate and Senate committee staff ar continuing behindthescenes meetings with all sides sources said Generally comprehensive MTBE legislation is expected to slash use of the additive without necessarily eliminating it entirely A committee bill also is expected to provide states with the option of waiving the Clean Air Act mandate currently driving the use of MTBE and ethanol another fuel oxygenate At the same time such a bill is expected to include no backsliding language to ensure that air toxics reductions achieved in the eastern United States over the last several years are maintained even if states waive out of the air act mandate Sources said the committee also is weighing possible cleanup liability relief for MTBE producers and enhancements to fuel storage tank clean up programs Heavy Reliance on MTBE MTBE is a highoxygen highoctane gasoline additive that is one of the most heavily produced chemicals in the United States With roughly million gallons of MTBE mixed with gasoline each day in the United States the chemical makes up more than percent of gasoline by volume according to the oil industry MTBE use is driven mainly by the Clean Air Act requirement that all reformulated gasoline contain at least percent oxygen by weight Reformulated gasoline is sold in areas of the country with poor air quality According to the Environmental Protection Agency more than percent of reformulated gasoline production relies on MTBE to meet the oxygen requirement However MTBE smells somewhat like turpentine and has been detected in public water supplies rendering at least a few of those supplies undrinkable The health effects of drinking MTBE in water are little known but the chemical does taste and smell bad according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service RFG programs in Chicago and Milwaukee rely on ethanol for oxygen content in their reformulated gasoline Among other concerns in the legislative debate the ethanol industry fears losing this market if Congress eliminates the percent oxygen requirement in the Clean Air Act to address MTBE concerns one industry representative said There were billion gallons of ethanol mixed into gasoline in according to the US Department of Agriculture USDA chief economist Keith Collins said before the Senate Agricultural Committee April that there are ethanol plants in operation in nearly states Bill Would Ease Percent Oxygen Rule To address water quality concerns Smith has signed on to legislation S that would allow states to lift the percent mandate driving MTBE use Introduced by Inhofe and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif S would not ban or phase down MTBE outright However this is expected to change when and if the Environment and Public Works committee marks up more comprehensive legislation oil ethanol and other sources said I think theres a growing set of opinion that MTBE either needs to be phased down to historic levels or phased out entirely over a period of some years an oil industry source said Chemical companies that make MTBE disagree and continue to urge an overhaul of underground storage tank programs in order to mitigate water contamination According to one source familiar with the issue Senate committee staff members are considering several legislative ideas that might address concerns of MTBE interests Prospective liability relief from contamination cleanup costs is under consideration as is the idea that MTBE makers should get expedited review of required permits when switching to alternate chemical products In addition the committee may be considering more rigorous regulation of underground storage tanks as part of comprehensive MTBE legislation this source said Daschle Harkin Drafts At least bills have been introduced in the th Congress to address the problem of MTBE in water according to the Congressional Research Service report The report said most bills would either eliminate the Clean Air Act requirement driving oxygenate use or would explicitly ban MTBE Some of the bills would bolster the Environmental Protection Agencys underground storage tank program since leaking USTs are considered the main cause of water contamination This approach is supported by certain MTBE makers who told BNA that water contamination is caused by leaking tanks and not by the highquality fuel additive Additional draft bills are pending introduction including comprehensive legislation by Sen Tom Daschle DSD the Senate minority leader that would significantly curtail MTBE use by while letting states take action before then Daschles billsaid by Baucuss staff to be supported by the ranking EPW committee memberalso would bolster ethanol production through a national renewable fuels mandate expanding national average ethanol use to percent or more over the next years In addition the draft legislation would amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to get states the money they need to implement UST cleanup programs Ethanol supporter Sen Tom Harkin DIowa also is drafting MTBE legislation that he hopes to introduce soon after the Senates Easter recess a spokeswoman said Harkin is ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and supports a renewable fuels standard If crafted in the right way Harkin has said such a standard could result in far more ethanol use than current law Iowa ranks second after Illinois in total ethanol production capacity according to the US Department of Agriculture Nebraska ranks third and Minnesota ranks fourth RFG Market Despite calls for eliminating the percent oxygenate requirement in the reformulated gasoline program ethanol interests said they still support maintenance of the requirement combined with an MTBE ban Such a scenario would leave ethanol to fill the RFG market void doubling ethanol use over three to five years sources said If Congress were to eliminate the percent mandate but institute a national renewable fuels requirement ethanol use also is expected to at least double from current levels However it would do so over a longer period of about years one ethanol source said Oil industry officials as well as Northeast states and some environmental advocates oppose this simple MTBE ban because it would create a de facto ethanol mandate The oil industry also continues to oppose a national renewable fuels standard officials said A representative of Northeast states told a Senate panel April that Smith appeared to be exploring a compromise with ethanol interests considering a national average alternative fuel requirement that would benefit ethanol as well as natural gas electricity and other transportation fuels The Northeast representative Jason Grumet of Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management supports the national average alternative fuel approach since it would offer the ethanol industry market share without requiring the Northeast to use large quantities of Midwestderived ethanol However oil company interests reaffirmed April their longheld opposition to any new fuel mandates saying concerns over MTBE in water should be addressed by eliminating current statutory mandates and not by instituting any new mandates Oil companies are particularly firm in their position given that agricultural states are expected to play a key role in upcoming presidential elections a second oil industry official said It is not simply that the industry opposes new mandatesthough that is the casebut also that an ethanolmandate bidding war might erupt in a year when Republicans and Democrats are vying for Midwestern votes the official said Ethanol Supporters Want Expansion Meanwhile ethanol interests said they will continue to fight for expansion of their product in the RFG market and do not necessarily see a national renewable fuels mandate as a legislative compromise The Clinton administrations renewable standard would require ethanol use initially at current levels of about percent of gasoline The mandate would then expand over years administration officials have said Ethanol is more volatile than MTBE making it more difficult for oil refiners to produce summertime gasoline that meets low emissions requirements for volatile organic compounds This is one reason the de facto mandate is opposed by Northeast states and environmental interests Some of the renewables mandates under consideration in Congress would allow refiners to meet requirements over an annual average enabling them to avoid or reduce their ethanol use in summer No Markup Scheduled Smith staff confirmed only that discussions with oil ethanol environmental MTBE and state interests continue A spokesman said comprehensive MTBE legislation is something were trying to get done quickly but that a bill markup has not been scheduled Discussions leading to a full EPW committee markup of more comprehensive MTBE legislation are important to the legislative process sources said because a bill is not expected to weather floor debate without early support from Democrats and Republicans on the committee as well as from members of the Senate Agricultural Committee I just cant see this getting duked out on the floor said one ethanol lobbyist I think that we the MTBE folks the oil company folks and the environmentalists all recognize that there is mutually assured destruction on the floor According to one source a new version of the bill is expected to push MTBE use down to pre levels over about four years Before the air act amendments required the sale of reformulated gasoline MTBE was used mainly to enhance octane It is unclear whether the bill will somehow prove acceptable to both Democrats and Republicans ethanol and oil interests as well as to Northeast states the Midwest and California Things change day to day an oil industry official said I think the issue could be resolved without the ethanol piece but the ethanol piece is just so difficult he added I think right now the chairman is poking around in the mud to find somewhere with solid footing an ethanol industry source said

legislation currently moving through Congress Pipeline safety reauthorization legislation Authorization for pipeline safety programs as administered by the US Dept of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety OPS is currently set to expire at the end of FY At the beginning of the th Congress industry was focused on securing a simple two year reauthorization bill that basically extends current pipeline safety programs with some modest increases in funding levels In fact the House Commerce Committee who shares jurisdiction over pipeline safety with the Transportation Infrastructure Committee acted early in to pass a simple two year reauthorization bill HR Unfortunately the issue became more complex from that point A serious liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham Washington that occurred last summer killing several children dramatically changed the debate over pipeline safety Members of the House and Senate from Washington state backed by the governor and numerous state and local officials moved swiftly to introduce legislation that they feel is designed to address some of the shortcomings in federal pipeline regulation that they believe may have allowed the Bellingham incident to occur In the Senate Senator Patty Murray DWA has introduced S which is designed to expand State authority over interstate pipelines in several new areas such as inspection and testing emergency response plans leak detection and operator training and qualification The bill also would authorize a large increase in OPS funding through pipeline user fees to increase the amount of grants to the States allow for hiring of additional inspectors and increase RD for inspection and leak detection technologies The current OPS budget is around million with million from user fees the Murray bill would authorize million in FY which would require a sizeable increase in user fees Senator Slade Gorton RWA has recently decided to cosposnor the Murray bill and will be actively involved in trying to gain Republican support for the bill On the House side Rep Jack Metcalf RWA has introduced a similar bill HR which a number of the Washington representatives have cosponsored Interstate natural gas pipelines have been placed in a very difficult situation The Bellingham incident was a liquid pipeline accident and liquids pipelines generally have less stringent regulatory requirements than natural gas pipelines The Washington delegation has highlighted the fact that deaths and injuries have occurred over the past years related to natural gas pipeline incidents but they fail to distinguish the fact that almost all of those incidents were on LDC systems which ironically are entirely State regulated Only fatalities in that period were naturalgas related and the majority of those accidents were caused by third party damage In short the INGAA crowd is being dragged down by the poor records of the LDCs and the liquid pipelines The calls for more state regulation of interstate pipeline are largely misguided based on the fact that the interstate pipelines under federal regulation have an exemplary safety record In addition OPS is already working on a Pipeline Integrity Rulemaking that would implement a number of additional measures to prevent accidents on federallyregulated pipelines As you mentioned INGAA has not been doing the best job representing us on these issues They have been working in a group effort with API AGA and the Association of Oil Pipelines AOPL to try and deflect the negative claims of the Murray and Metcalf legislation but have not been forceful enough in distinguishing interstate natural gas pipelines positive record from the liquids and LDCs Thus they have given the impression that INGAA companies might be willing to submit to additional regulation that liquids and LDC are under political pressure to submit to due to Bellingham We have been working with other major INGAA companies El Paso in particular to make sure that the perspective and positive record of our natural gas pipelines is heard clearly by the key legislators The odds of these measures S HR passing on their own is fairly slim They will get a great deal of attention however The Senate Commerce Committee held a field hearing in Bellingham Washington yesterday at which Senators Gorton and Murray testified along with OPS and the families of Bellingham victims the press coverage was not good ie USA Today cover story When Pipelines Are Time Bombs These bills or portions of them will likely be offered and considered as amendments to Pipeline Safety Reauthorization legislation as it comes before the House Transportation Infrastructure and Senate Commerce Committee later this year The increased controversy caused by these bills will likely doom efforts to pass a pipeline safety reauthorization bill this year The leadership of the House and Senate Committees will not likely want to face a bitter debate between safety advocates OPS States and industry in their committees in this tough election year While this is probably a good sign there is an increased risk that industry may face some large hurdles in the appropriations process Appropriations Legislation While Members of Congress push for their stand alone bills andor amendments to reauthorization bills the greater danger is that some of these issues will be dealt with in an appropriations context In particular the fact that Senator Slade Gorton is now actively engaged in pushing for extensive pipeline safety reforms is troubling he is a key member of the Senate Appropriations Committee is close to Republican leadership and has a tough reelection fight coming up Senator Murray is also on Senate Appropriations Both are on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee which funds OPS It is quite likely that the Senators will make a push to get increases in the OPS budget for FY that would enable the kinds of reforms contemplated by their standalone legislation more state funding more inspectors more RD Much of this increase would be funded through increases in user fees INGAA indicates that it expects we could be facing increases in the range of from FY There is also the possibility that an attempt will be made to add legislative riders to the OPS appropriations such as requiring OPS to mandate inspections increase operator qualifications or allow increased state authority I would predict that legislative riders can be prevented but it will be very difficult to avoid some kind of increases beyond mere adjustments for inflation in the OPS budget and user fees The reauthorization will indeed receive attention in but our advocacy efforts will clearly need to be focused on the appropriations process in order to minimize the impact on interstate pipeline user fees and prevent other harmful mandates We will continue to work with key members of the authorizing and appropriations committees to ensure that the interstate natural gas perspective is clearly heard and if possible we avoid being dragged down in attempts to impose more strict regulation on liquids and LDCs Please let me know if you have questions or require additional information Thank you

The federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority was put on the defensive at a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing last week as its adversaries mounted an offensive against the power agency for its huge billion debt and unaccountability With a bill S introduced by Sen Mitch McConnell RKy serving as the backdrop the need for changing TVAs role in an emerging competitiv e electricity market was reviewed TVA is one of the biggest power producers in the country and it enjoys certain unfair privileges according to investorowned utilities which are seeking changes to TVA to level the playing field in a competitive electricity market McConnells bill is touted as making TVA more accountable by subjecting the power agency to among other things antitrust laws and to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission McConnell who was present at the hearing questioned TVA on its claim of providing lowcost power and wh y it should not be brought under FERC authority Supporting the position of S Robert Hewett representing TVA Watch a coalition led by Duke Energy and other private utilities decried the privileges TVA is endowed with Hewett said TVA has the ability to set its own wholesale and retail rates is exempt from antitrust laws and makes on ly token payments in lieu of taxes to the local government No other entity in the country even comes close to having this type of authority or license said Hewett Hewett wants TVA to be subjected to antitrust laws and FERC jurisdiction I n addition TVA must be restricted from building new generation capacity and it should not have preferential access to power from other federal facilities at rates below fair market value Hewett recommended Richard Munson executive director NortheastMidwest Institute continued on the same stream as Hewett calling TVA a national problem Munson said TVA s inspector general in a recent report has highlighted TVAs most serious problem its unaccountability Decisions by TVAs board of director s are not reviewed by state regulators or federal agencies and the power agency enjoys a monopoly in its service territory so it is not accountable even to market forces according to Munson Stating that TVA has been propped up by enormous taxpayer subsidies Munson said The giant utility is exempt from hundreds of federal and state laws and regulations it pays no federal or state taxes and it obtains lowcost loans because of Washingtons i mplied support But Mark Medford TVA executive vice president cautioned that proposals su ch as S may risk compromising the lowcost reliable electricity availab le to the Tennessee Valley region Medford said S would place new restrictions on TVA and expand regulation of TVA activities which seems unusual in the context of a discussion of deregulation of the electricity industry Medford also argued against FERC and state regulation of TVA prices and FER C determination of the need for new generation capacity He said responsibili ty for fulfilling those missions is placed on the threemember TVA board nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate Superimposing a higher regulatory body such as FERC to pass judgment on the decision of the TVA board in these areas seems both duplicative and inappropriate Medford also did not think that antitrust laws should be applied to TVA because it would be unfair to TVA ratepayers When a private utility violates the antitrust laws its stockholders bear the cost However governmental entities like TVA have no stockholders and the financial cost s of such penalties have to be borne by the people who are supposed to be served said Medford Medford asserted that investors now hold all of TVAs debt that finances the power program He said TVA debt is neither backed by the federal government nor is it supported by mortgages on TVA plant property and equipment It is secured solely by the financial operation of TVA as well as bond covenants and the provisions of the TVA Act Medford said Also Medford said TVA has been on the path of debt reduction in the last three years bringing down the debt by billion Austin Caroll representing the Kentucky Managers Association a group of municipal and rural electric cooperative utilities did not totally agree with the principles of S though it did want some changes to be made to TVA Preceding the examination of S was a hearing on the nomination of TVA board members Skila Harris and Glenn McCullough Harris served until recently as the executive director of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board managing the work of the Tennessee Valley Advisory Committee which comprises of representatives from groups interested in the future of TVA McCullough previously served on the executive committee of the Mississippi Municipal League and as the director of the Mississippi office of the Appalachian Regional Commission The TVA board of directors has three members serving nine year staggered terms

It will likely take some time for EPA to develop these regulations the time frame is proposed rule by and final rule by but this is a significant step in that it now formally puts mercury on the radar screen for power generators in terms of planning for emissions controls It is a positive step that EPA included in its determination an intent to develop flexible compliance measures ie trading for mercury It also means that mercury will most likely be included in any efforts to develop multipollutant legislation in the next Congress Please call me if you have any questions THURSDAY DEC EPA DECIDES MERCURY EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS MUST BE REDUCED To protect public health and the environment EPA Administrator Carol M Browner today announced that the Clinton Administration will require reductions for the first time ever of harmful mercury emissions from coalfired power plants the largest source of such emissions in America After extensive study EPA determined mercury emissions from power plants pose significant hazards to public health and must be reduced The agency will propose regulations by and issue final rules by Mercury from power plants settles over waterways polluting rivers and lakes and contaminating fish Exposure to mercury poses real risks to public health especially to children and developing fetuses Browner said The greatest source of mercury emissions is power plants and they have never been required to control these emissions before now Todays decision to address this problem marks a major step forward in the Clinton Administrations ongoing efforts to protect public health and the environment Exposure to mercury has been associated with both neurological and developmental damage in humans The developing fetus is the most sensitive to mercurys effects which include damage to nervous system development People are exposed to mercury primarily through eating fish that have been contaminated when mercury from power plants and other sources is deposited to water bodies Once mercury enters water biological processes can transform it into methylmercury a highly toxic form of mercury that builds up in animal and human tissues EPA recommends that subsistence fisherman pregnant women and others should always heed state fishing advisories Under the Clean Air Act EPA is required to study toxic air pollution from power plants in order to determine if additional regulations are necessary in order to protect public health EPA reported its study to Congress in February That study concluded that of all toxic pollution examined mercury posed the greatest concern to public health An earlier study concluded that the largest source of humanmade mercury pollution in America was coalfired power plants After completion of the study the Clean Air Act required EPA to determine whether to proceed with the development of regulations Today EPA is announcing that it has affirmatively decided that mercury air emissions from power plants should be regulated because mercury poses the greatest hazards to public health EPA will propose regulations by December and will begin developing those regulations shortly Industry the public and state local and tribal governments will have an opportunity to participate in the process Then EPA will issue final regulations by December The Clinton Administration already has taken a number of aggressive actions to reduce mercury air pollution including significantly reducing allowable emissions from municipal waste combustors medical waste incinerators and hazardous waste combustors When fully implemented in the existing rules will reduce total humancaused mercury emissions by nearly percent from levels nationwide On November President Clinton called for a dramatic new approach to reduce air pollution from Americas power plants The President highlighted the benefits of adopting a combined strategy to address all of the major pollutants emitted by power plants including mercury sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide A comprehensive strategy that addresses all of these pollutants together will provide more certainty and flexibility to industry making it the most costeffective way to control the emissions that threaten public health and the environment As the Clean Air Act requires the regulatory process to control mercury will proceed under current law However at the same time the Administration encourages the Executive Branch and the Congress to work toward legislating a comprehensive four pollutant approach which will benefit the public health the environment and the economy Todays decision will appear soon in the Federal Register but is accessible immediately on EPAs mercury web site at wwwepagovmercury Also today EPA is posting on its website mercury emissions from every coalfired power plant in the country This is consistent with EPAs strong commitment to provide citizens with information about pollution in their communities Jeffrey

Government Affairs folks as well to share this information I am currently assessing the situation regarding pipeline safety legislation This week has been very quiet on Capitol Hill as all of the members are back in the states on August recess running for reelection and it is a big vacation week for staffbut heres what I am hearing As you may or may not know we have been been very active this year trying to temper pipeline safety legislation that was fairly reactionary in the wake of last summers liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham WA SENATE In June Senators John McCain RAZ and Slade Gorton RWA led the charge to pass a pipeline safety bill S out of the Senate Commerce Committee and that bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate Because of the hasty way in which S was drafted and passed there was a realization by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the bill could not make it to the floor for a vote until some serious changes were made mostly things that were deal breakers for industry Enron and El Paso were leading the charge and we had a number of Senators backing our efforts to negotiate changes including Majority Leader Trent Lott RMS Kay Bailey Hutchison RTX John Breaux DLA and Sam Brownback RKS From what Ive learned since the accident these Senators are not changing their strategy and are still asking for the same improvements Fortunately most of the changes we were looking to make were fairly technical and not the types of things that would be seriously compromised by the accident Industy was already in the position of having to accept a number of things they never would have if not for he Bellingham incidentthe El Paso incident just reinforces those The biggest potential effect I see from the El Paso accident is an increased effort to pass something before the Congress adjourns in early October The New Mexico Senators are already calling for a floor vote on the McCainGorton legislation and I there will certainly be greater pressure on leaders to wrap up negotiations get agreement from all sides on a bill and move it unanimously through a vote on the Senate floor HOUSE The House is moving a bit more slowly but again Id expect the El Paso situation to expedite things somewhat There were several bills introduced in the House that were not moving anywhere including an identical copy of the McCain legislation introduced by Rep Bob Franks RNJ Franks is now anxious to move legislation as he is running for Senate and would love to take credit for helping out on an issue of national visibility Before the accident House Tranportation Committee leaders on both the Democrat and Republican side were working on a consensus bill that they could introduce in early September and move quickly through the Committee and to the House floor Im told that negotiations on that legislation are moving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly Unlike our experience in the Senate we have had significant input into the bill in advance and expect something that we can live with and something more reasonable than the McCain bill With that said there may be an effort to expand the bill in a few areas because of the El Paso accident so well have to see what kind of hand were dealt in the next few weeks Overall Id expect pipeline safety legislation to be given higher priority when Congress returns after Labor Day In the absence of this accident I would have given it slim odds of passing in the few short weeks until adjournment with appropriations bills taking up most of Congress precious time Now there will be greater pressure to come to consensus and move bills through by an expedited process so that everyone running for election in November can show that theyve done something about this terrible tragedy With that said theres still not that much time to get legislation through so Id say that theres still a chance it may not get done this year If I had to attach a number to it Id say that the El Paso accident improves the chances of legislation going all the way to probably Gas supply to California Ill have to do some more checking in this area and get back to you All Ive heard so far is that the safety questions that remain may slow the speed of restarting flow on the line notwithstanding that El Paso thinks it can have things running again fairly quickly Im sure the power crunch in California will put some counterpressure on but I just dont have good intelligence on this yet With all this said Im on vacation this week and parts of next week finishing up some leave Ive taken for the birth of our new baby daughter so I may not have an additional report for you until early to mid next week If you have questions please respond by email or leave a message on my voice mail at

The federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority was put on the defensive at a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing last week as its adversaries mounted an offensive against the power agency for its huge billion debt and unaccountability With a bill S introduced by Sen Mitch McConnell RKy serving as the backdrop the need for changing TVAs role in an emerging competitiv e electricity market was reviewed TVA is one of the biggest power producers in the country and it enjoys certain unfair privileges according to investorowned utilities which are seeking changes to TVA to level the playing field in a competitive electricity market McConnells bill is touted as making TVA more accountable by subjecting the power agency to among other things antitrust laws and to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission McConnell who was present at the hearing questioned TVA on its claim of providing lowcost power and wh y it should not be brought under FERC authority Supporting the position of S Robert Hewett representing TVA Watch a coalition led by Duke Energy and other private utilities decried the privileges TVA is endowed with Hewett said TVA has the ability to set its own wholesale and retail rates is exempt from antitrust laws and makes on ly token payments in lieu of taxes to the local government No other entity in the country even comes close to having this type of authority or license said Hewett Hewett wants TVA to be subjected to antitrust laws and FERC jurisdiction I n addition TVA must be restricted from building new generation capacity and it should not have preferential access to power from other federal facilities at rates below fair market value Hewett recommended Richard Munson executive director NortheastMidwest Institute continued on the same stream as Hewett calling TVA a national problem Munson said TVA s inspector general in a recent report has highlighted TVAs most serious problem its unaccountability Decisions by TVAs board of director s are not reviewed by state regulators or federal agencies and the power agency enjoys a monopoly in its service territory so it is not accountable even to market forces according to Munson Stating that TVA has been propped up by enormous taxpayer subsidies Munson said The giant utility is exempt from hundreds of federal and state laws and regulations it pays no federal or state taxes and it obtains lowcost loans because of Washingtons i mplied support But Mark Medford TVA executive vice president cautioned that proposals su ch as S may risk compromising the lowcost reliable electricity availab le to the Tennessee Valley region Medford said S would place new restrictions on TVA and expand regulation of TVA activities which seems unusual in the context of a discussion of deregulation of the electricity industry Medford also argued against FERC and state regulation of TVA prices and FER C determination of the need for new generation capacity He said responsibili ty for fulfilling those missions is placed on the threemember TVA board nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate Superimposing a higher regulatory body such as FERC to pass judgment on the decision of the TVA board in these areas seems both duplicative and inappropriate Medford also did not think that antitrust laws should be applied to TVA because it would be unfair to TVA ratepayers When a private utility violates the antitrust laws its stockholders bear the cost However governmental entities like TVA have no stockholders and the financial cost s of such penalties have to be borne by the people who are supposed to be served said Medford Medford asserted that investors now hold all of TVAs debt that finances the power program He said TVA debt is neither backed by the federal government nor is it supported by mortgages on TVA plant property and equipment It is secured solely by the financial operation of TVA as well as bond covenants and the provisions of the TVA Act Medford said Also Medford said TVA has been on the path of debt reduction in the last three years bringing down the debt by billion Austin Caroll representing the Kentucky Managers Association a group of municipal and rural electric cooperative utilities did not totally agree with the principles of S though it did want some changes to be made to TVA Preceding the examination of S was a hearing on the nomination of TVA board members Skila Harris and Glenn McCullough Harris served until recently as the executive director of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board managing the work of the Tennessee Valley Advisory Committee which comprises of representatives from groups interested in the future of TVA McCullough previously served on the executive committee of the Mississippi Municipal League and as the director of the Mississippi office of the Appalachian Regional Commission The TVA board of directors has three members serving nine year staggered terms

legislation currently moving through Congress Pipeline safety reauthorization legislation Authorization for pipeline safety programs as administered by the US Dept of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety OPS is currently set to expire at the end of FY At the beginning of the th Congress industry was focused on securing a simple two year reauthorization bill that basically extends current pipeline safety programs with some modest increases in funding levels In fact the House Commerce Committee who shares jurisdiction over pipeline safety with the Transportation Infrastructure Committee acted early in to pass a simple two year reauthorization bill HR Unfortunately the issue became more complex from that point A serious liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham Washington that occurred last summer killing several children dramatically changed the debate over pipeline safety Members of the House and Senate from Washington state backed by the governor and numerous state and local officials moved swiftly to introduce legislation that they feel is designed to address some of the shortcomings in federal pipeline regulation that they believe may have allowed the Bellingham incident to occur In the Senate Senator Patty Murray DWA has introduced S which is designed to expand State authority over interstate pipelines in several new areas such as inspection and testing emergency response plans leak detection and operator training and qualification The bill also would authorize a large increase in OPS funding through pipeline user fees to increase the amount of grants to the States allow for hiring of additional inspectors and increase RD for inspection and leak detection technologies The current OPS budget is around million with million from user fees the Murray bill would authorize million in FY which would require a sizeable increase in user fees Senator Slade Gorton RWA has recently decided to cosposnor the Murray bill and will be actively involved in trying to gain Republican support for the bill On the House side Rep Jack Metcalf RWA has introduced a similar bill HR which a number of the Washington representatives have cosponsored Interstate natural gas pipelines have been placed in a very difficult situation The Bellingham incident was a liquid pipeline accident and liquids pipelines generally have less stringent regulatory requirements than natural gas pipelines The Washington delegation has highlighted the fact that deaths and injuries have occurred over the past years related to natural gas pipeline incidents but they fail to distinguish the fact that almost all of those incidents were on LDC systems which ironically are entirely State regulated Only fatalities in that period were naturalgas related and the majority of those accidents were caused by third party damage In short the INGAA crowd is being dragged down by the poor records of the LDCs and the liquid pipelines The calls for more state regulation of interstate pipeline are largely misguided based on the fact that the interstate pipelines under federal regulation have an exemplary safety record In addition OPS is already working on a Pipeline Integrity Rulemaking that would implement a number of additional measures to prevent accidents on federallyregulated pipelines As you mentioned INGAA has not been doing the best job representing us on these issues They have been working in a group effort with API AGA and the Association of Oil Pipelines AOPL to try and deflect the negative claims of the Murray and Metcalf legislation but have not been forceful enough in distinguishing interstate natural gas pipelines positive record from the liquids and LDCs Thus they have given the impression that INGAA companies might be willing to submit to additional regulation that liquids and LDC are under political pressure to submit to due to Bellingham We have been working with other major INGAA companies El Paso in particular to make sure that the perspective and positive record of our natural gas pipelines is heard clearly by the key legislators The odds of these measures S HR passing on their own is fairly slim They will get a great deal of attention however The Senate Commerce Committee held a field hearing in Bellingham Washington yesterday at which Senators Gorton and Murray testified along with OPS and the families of Bellingham victims the press coverage was not good ie USA Today cover story When Pipelines Are Time Bombs These bills or portions of them will likely be offered and considered as amendments to Pipeline Safety Reauthorization legislation as it comes before the House Transportation Infrastructure and Senate Commerce Committee later this year The increased controversy caused by these bills will likely doom efforts to pass a pipeline safety reauthorization bill this year The leadership of the House and Senate Committees will not likely want to face a bitter debate between safety advocates OPS States and industry in their committees in this tough election year While this is probably a good sign there is an increased risk that industry may face some large hurdles in the appropriations process Appropriations Legislation While Members of Congress push for their stand alone bills andor amendments to reauthorization bills the greater danger is that some of these issues will be dealt with in an appropriations context In particular the fact that Senator Slade Gorton is now actively engaged in pushing for extensive pipeline safety reforms is troubling he is a key member of the Senate Appropriations Committee is close to Republican leadership and has a tough reelection fight coming up Senator Murray is also on Senate Appropriations Both are on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee which funds OPS It is quite likely that the Senators will make a push to get increases in the OPS budget for FY that would enable the kinds of reforms contemplated by their standalone legislation more state funding more inspectors more RD Much of this increase would be funded through increases in user fees INGAA indicates that it expects we could be facing increases in the range of from FY There is also the possibility that an attempt will be made to add legislative riders to the OPS appropriations such as requiring OPS to mandate inspections increase operator qualifications or allow increased state authority I would predict that legislative riders can be prevented but it will be very difficult to avoid some kind of increases beyond mere adjustments for inflation in the OPS budget and user fees The reauthorization will indeed receive attention in but our advocacy efforts will clearly need to be focused on the appropriations process in order to minimize the impact on interstate pipeline user fees and prevent other harmful mandates We will continue to work with key members of the authorizing and appropriations committees to ensure that the interstate natural gas perspective is clearly heard and if possible we avoid being dragged down in attempts to impose more strict regulation on liquids and LDCs Please let me know if you have questions or require additional information Thank you

and ethanol interests remain at odds as the Senate seeks to limit use of the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE making it uncertain whether the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will be able to craft an acceptable national solution to the problem of MTBE in water lobbyists told BNA April Despite fundamental differences however all sources interviewed for this storyincluding two oil industry officials three ethanol advocates and several other sources active in the legislative process on this issuesaid that it still appeared possible that national MTBE legislation satisfying multiple interests could be developed I dont think were at an impasse one oil industry official said echoing comments by others in the debate I just think its going to take time Whether this means that a compromise can be worked out during this legislative session remains to be seen this official and others said The committee chairman Sen Bob Smith RNH has made MTBE a priority saying that Congress must eliminate the threat of water contamination posed by the fuel oxygenate while being careful to preserve the air quality benefits associated with MTBEmixed gasoline The chairmans view of the issue however is contrary to the view held by the Clinton administration by ranking minority member Sen Max Baucus DMont and by Democratic and Republican agricultural interests in the Senate These forces hold that cornderived ethanol and possibly other renewable fuels should gain a wider market under any legislation addressing the threat of MTBE water contamination The oil industry and Smith disagree with that view Smith Rejects Renewables Linkage When the Clinton administration announced on March its support for a national renewable fuels mandate Smith said the issue of renewable fuels has absolutely nothing to do with eliminating MTBE from our drinking water He repeated this point in a newspaper opinion piece April In addition to gasoline and ethanol advocates several other interest groups maintain an active role in the ongoing debate and Senate committee staff ar continuing behindthescenes meetings with all sides sources said Generally comprehensive MTBE legislation is expected to slash use of the additive without necessarily eliminating it entirely A committee bill also is expected to provide states with the option of waiving the Clean Air Act mandate currently driving the use of MTBE and ethanol another fuel oxygenate At the same time such a bill is expected to include no backsliding language to ensure that air toxics reductions achieved in the eastern United States over the last several years are maintained even if states waive out of the air act mandate Sources said the committee also is weighing possible cleanup liability relief for MTBE producers and enhancements to fuel storage tank clean up programs Heavy Reliance on MTBE MTBE is a highoxygen highoctane gasoline additive that is one of the most heavily produced chemicals in the United States With roughly million gallons of MTBE mixed with gasoline each day in the United States the chemical makes up more than percent of gasoline by volume according to the oil industry MTBE use is driven mainly by the Clean Air Act requirement that all reformulated gasoline contain at least percent oxygen by weight Reformulated gasoline is sold in areas of the country with poor air quality According to the Environmental Protection Agency more than percent of reformulated gasoline production relies on MTBE to meet the oxygen requirement However MTBE smells somewhat like turpentine and has been detected in public water supplies rendering at least a few of those supplies undrinkable The health effects of drinking MTBE in water are little known but the chemical does taste and smell bad according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service RFG programs in Chicago and Milwaukee rely on ethanol for oxygen content in their reformulated gasoline Among other concerns in the legislative debate the ethanol industry fears losing this market if Congress eliminates the percent oxygen requirement in the Clean Air Act to address MTBE concerns one industry representative said There were billion gallons of ethanol mixed into gasoline in according to the US Department of Agriculture USDA chief economist Keith Collins said before the Senate Agricultural Committee April that there are ethanol plants in operation in nearly states Bill Would Ease Percent Oxygen Rule To address water quality concerns Smith has signed on to legislation S that would allow states to lift the percent mandate driving MTBE use Introduced by Inhofe and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif S would not ban or phase down MTBE outright However this is expected to change when and if the Environment and Public Works committee marks up more comprehensive legislation oil ethanol and other sources said I think theres a growing set of opinion that MTBE either needs to be phased down to historic levels or phased out entirely over a period of some years an oil industry source said Chemical companies that make MTBE disagree and continue to urge an overhaul of underground storage tank programs in order to mitigate water contamination According to one source familiar with the issue Senate committee staff members are considering several legislative ideas that might address concerns of MTBE interests Prospective liability relief from contamination cleanup costs is under consideration as is the idea that MTBE makers should get expedited review of required permits when switching to alternate chemical products In addition the committee may be considering more rigorous regulation of underground storage tanks as part of comprehensive MTBE legislation this source said Daschle Harkin Drafts At least bills have been introduced in the th Congress to address the problem of MTBE in water according to the Congressional Research Service report The report said most bills would either eliminate the Clean Air Act requirement driving oxygenate use or would explicitly ban MTBE Some of the bills would bolster the Environmental Protection Agencys underground storage tank program since leaking USTs are considered the main cause of water contamination This approach is supported by certain MTBE makers who told BNA that water contamination is caused by leaking tanks and not by the highquality fuel additive Additional draft bills are pending introduction including comprehensive legislation by Sen Tom Daschle DSD the Senate minority leader that would significantly curtail MTBE use by while letting states take action before then Daschles billsaid by Baucuss staff to be supported by the ranking EPW committee memberalso would bolster ethanol production through a national renewable fuels mandate expanding national average ethanol use to percent or more over the next years In addition the draft legislation would amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to get states the money they need to implement UST cleanup programs Ethanol supporter Sen Tom Harkin DIowa also is drafting MTBE legislation that he hopes to introduce soon after the Senates Easter recess a spokeswoman said Harkin is ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and supports a renewable fuels standard If crafted in the right way Harkin has said such a standard could result in far more ethanol use than current law Iowa ranks second after Illinois in total ethanol production capacity according to the US Department of Agriculture Nebraska ranks third and Minnesota ranks fourth RFG Market Despite calls for eliminating the percent oxygenate requirement in the reformulated gasoline program ethanol interests said they still support maintenance of the requirement combined with an MTBE ban Such a scenario would leave ethanol to fill the RFG market void doubling ethanol use over three to five years sources said If Congress were to eliminate the percent mandate but institute a national renewable fuels requirement ethanol use also is expected to at least double from current levels However it would do so over a longer period of about years one ethanol source said Oil industry officials as well as Northeast states and some environmental advocates oppose this simple MTBE ban because it would create a de facto ethanol mandate The oil industry also continues to oppose a national renewable fuels standard officials said A representative of Northeast states told a Senate panel April that Smith appeared to be exploring a compromise with ethanol interests considering a national average alternative fuel requirement that would benefit ethanol as well as natural gas electricity and other transportation fuels The Northeast representative Jason Grumet of Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management supports the national average alternative fuel approach since it would offer the ethanol industry market share without requiring the Northeast to use large quantities of Midwestderived ethanol However oil company interests reaffirmed April their longheld opposition to any new fuel mandates saying concerns over MTBE in water should be addressed by eliminating current statutory mandates and not by instituting any new mandates Oil companies are particularly firm in their position given that agricultural states are expected to play a key role in upcoming presidential elections a second oil industry official said It is not simply that the industry opposes new mandatesthough that is the casebut also that an ethanolmandate bidding war might erupt in a year when Republicans and Democrats are vying for Midwestern votes the official said Ethanol Supporters Want Expansion Meanwhile ethanol interests said they will continue to fight for expansion of their product in the RFG market and do not necessarily see a national renewable fuels mandate as a legislative compromise The Clinton administrations renewable standard would require ethanol use initially at current levels of about percent of gasoline The mandate would then expand over years administration officials have said Ethanol is more volatile than MTBE making it more difficult for oil refiners to produce summertime gasoline that meets low emissions requirements for volatile organic compounds This is one reason the de facto mandate is opposed by Northeast states and environmental interests Some of the renewables mandates under consideration in Congress would allow refiners to meet requirements over an annual average enabling them to avoid or reduce their ethanol use in summer No Markup Scheduled Smith staff confirmed only that discussions with oil ethanol environmental MTBE and state interests continue A spokesman said comprehensive MTBE legislation is something were trying to get done quickly but that a bill markup has not been scheduled Discussions leading to a full EPW committee markup of more comprehensive MTBE legislation are important to the legislative process sources said because a bill is not expected to weather floor debate without early support from Democrats and Republicans on the committee as well as from members of the Senate Agricultural Committee I just cant see this getting duked out on the floor said one ethanol lobbyist I think that we the MTBE folks the oil company folks and the environmentalists all recognize that there is mutually assured destruction on the floor According to one source a new version of the bill is expected to push MTBE use down to pre levels over about four years Before the air

Senator John McCains RAZ pipeline safety legislation S was approved The overall outcome was not unexpected the final legislation contained several provisions that went a little bit further than Enron and INGAA would have liked but there was rigorous debate over issues like States role and mandated integrity measures and close votes on several amendments Senator McCain and other bill proponents like Senator Slade Gorton realize those issues will need to be addressed before the legislation proceeds to the Senate floor The Committee considered several amendments to the legislation McCain substitute amendment Approved by voice vote The amendment substituted the revised Chairmans mark text that was developed over the last several days in place of the original version of S All further amendments at the markup were in the context of this substitute text McCain amendment to Section b on operator assistance investigations Approved by voice vote This amendment attempts to fix language in the substitute text that was problematic to just about everyone in industry and on the Hill because it unconstitutionally forced an operator to choose between exercising constitutional rights to protect himself in a criminal investigation or keeping his job The McCain amendment did not seem to improve things much and many Senators could not understand it Senator John Breaux DLA objected to it and asked that the entire section be deleted and there was some good debate on both sides of the issue In the end McCain asked that the amendment be passed with a promise that he would work with Breaux and others to fix it before Senate floor consideration Sen John Kerry DMA Amendment on Enforcement Approved by voice vote Another confusing vote in which many members did not understand the changes being made but agreed to it on the condition that clarifications be made before Senate floor action Late last night Enron led a group including companies from INGAA and AGA in providing comments to Senator Kerry which caused him to make substantial changes to his amendment before it was voted on at markup including dropping provisions allowing citizen suits and other troubling issues In the end the amendment that passed was acceptable to industry Sen Sam Brownback RKS amendment on Advisory Council Pilot Program Rejected to Brownbacks amendment would have replaced the Advisory Council Pilot Program as proposed in the substitute text with a requirement that already existing technical advisory committees to OPS be required to meet regionally There was a good debate on the issue but Senator Gorton made a strong plea to members that the new Advisory Councils would only be a pilot program and would not have any binding role He also agreed to work with industry on improvements such as representation of pipelines on the councils before Senate floor action Brownback amendment on State Role Rejected to This amendment was written by Enron and El Paso striking language from the bill that was overly broad in suggesting that a State had oversight authority over other activities beyond proper areas like accident investigation constructionrelated activities and inspection There was a heated debate with Brownback and Breaux making excellent arguments for us but in the end we were vote short In fact Democrats switched their votes at the last minute to tip the balance I have already had discussions with Senate staff after the markup indicating that this language will need to be fixed to our satisfaction before Senate floor action Sen Ron Wyden DOR amendment increasing public righttoknow requirements Approved by voice vote This amendment increases the kinds of information that need to be made widely available to the public Because of a state of confusion in which many of the Senators left the room to go vote on the Senate floor there was no opposition voiced to the amendment and it passed without much discussion Breaux amendment on Integrity Inspection Program Rejected by voice vote This was another written by Enron and El Paso that would have removed the bias of substitute text language toward internal inspections and pressure testing and broadened the range of tools that a pipeline could include in an integrity management plan It also would have removed a requirement that any state and local official would have the chance to comment on the plan and receive a response The debate was heated over this amendment with Senator Gorton indicating that he could accept the first part of the amendment removing the bias toward internal inspectionpressure testing but not the second which he felt weakened state and local opportunity to comment on pipleines integrity plans The committee agreed to reject the amendment but work to fix the second part before Senate floor action Procedurally it was a strange markup session A quorum of the Committee members needs to be present to vote on final passage of the bill A vote on the Senate floor came up as Senator Kerry was explaining his amendment and as Senators were leaving Senator McCain very quickly asked that the entire bill be passed on voice vote before a quorum left the room subject to consideration of amendments when they returned The bill was passed before many knew what was happening Of course only about members came back to the room for the rest of the markup so much of the voting was done without full everyones participation or by proxy which had serious effects on the outcome of several amendments As you can see from the notes on many of the amendments there will be an opportunity to fix the legislation before it moves any further Several Senators indicated after the markup that they had voted with Senator Gorton on several of the amendments as a courtesy to him but would not support the bills movement to the Senate floor without serious changes being made One key ally is Senator Trent Lott RMS who supported all industry amendments His control of the Senate floor schedule as Senate Majority Leader will be key in driving changes to the legislation If satisfactory changes are not made the bill will move no further There will also be an opportunity to provide comments for Committee Report language that will accompany the final bill that was passed The report will give explanations of several of the concerns that were raised and provide legislative history that will help clarify areas where there is uncertainty about the real effect of some of the provisions We did have several victories Many of the amendments that were expected worse language from the Administration or Patty Murray legislation were not even offered because of the advance work we were able to do with Republican and Democratic Commerce Committee members and staff We were able to affect a number of changes to the Chairmans mark or substitute amendment before the markup even occured Another interesting note Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison was a complete nonfactor in the markup She is the Subcommittee chair responsible for this issue yet she did not make an opening statement and she did not vote at all on several key amendments of concern to industry We will be working on the where do we go from here strategy in the coming weeks and will report as developments occur Thanks again to all who helped out in preparation for the markup in what was an amazing team effort The technical support of Dave Johnson Colleen Raker and Lou Soldano was extremely valuable Phil Lowrys and Dave Johnsons availability to do key meetings with Senators and staff was critical in our efforts And Dave and I can attest to the fact that Enron was in a leadership role leading up to the markup guiding the efforts of INGAA and others and directly influencing the direction this legislation will take in the coming weeks and months Jeff Keeler

to Senators Gramm and Schumer concerning their provision on Environmental Conditionality Sorry this was thrown together very quickly on short notice but I hope it is helpful Section Environmental Conditionality In general as this provision attempts to close the loophole for grandfathered pre coal plants there would be an negative impact on coal trading particularly highsulfur and our equity positions in coal mines However there are opportunities to still profit by shortinghedging our positions if we have enough knowledge and information about when these changes are going to take place we will likely be able to seize opportunities from the resulting volatility The question in your email asked only about coal markets but on the whole Enron could find some benefits from this kind of provision because of our ability to trade more gas transport more gas and build merchant gascombined cycle capacity renewables etc I have not had the chance to get any analysis on electricity prices but I would suspect that our view would be that there may be some volatility due to the shift in fuels but it would level out with the right risk management in the longer term I can try to get more for you as this legislation evolves Specific comments on the drafting sectionbysection a the only comment I would raise is that how the term electric generating unit EGU is defined is controversial right now The EPA wants to make sure EGU includes industrial boilers this point is being litigated in the NOx SIP Call and Section cases right now Unless it was the intent to also capture industrial coal boilers in this Section it may be wise to clarify that you are targeting utilities Industrials will raise a great deal of opposition if this provision is construed to include them b It probably does not make a great deal of difference whether you are taking the average capacity factor for coal fired vs fossil averaging all fossil units will create an average capacity factor that makes it a little harder for coal to meet environmental performance standards I believe the average capacity factor for all fossilcoal plants would be around Large heavilyloaded coal plants are probably in the range so they would have to cut back substantially However some of the older interim load coal plants may only run at about or less in which case they may still emit a substantial amount of pollution but not be captured under this provision So in effect this section may not limit all grandfathered coal plants just the big ones c I dont know if this is a drafting oversight or an attempt to set the bar unreasonably high for coal but including the word ALL in the phrase average emission performance achieved by ALL electric generating units would mean including gas and other clean sources in looking at emissions averages which no coal unit could ever meet In the name of workability hopefully they will include something like achieved by all COAL FIRED electric generating units From Cynthia Sandherr PM To Jeffrey NRON cc Michael NRON Richard ES Steven J ES Joe NRON Stacey ES Jim FallonEnron nron Communications Joe NRON Lisa ES Subject GrammSchumer federal Electricity Legislation URGENT REQUEST FOR COMMENT Jeff As we have discussed for some time now Senators Gramm RTX and Schumer DNY have been drafting federal electricity restructuring legislation with a datecertain approach The one holdup has been the environmental conditionality provision which we have also discussed at length in the past Just late last evening the two Senators reached initial agreement on this section and as such just late this morning both offices sent the language to us for our immediate comment and review Specifically they would like Enrons read on the practical impact of this language by pm EST as they intend to introduce the bill this evening before the Senate breaks for the July th holiday Im sorry for the short turn around but as you know this is the typical situation in DC The language in parenthesis indicates Gramms edits to substitute coalfired vs Shumers NRDCs preference for fossil What is our preference based upon what his means to coal markets and the ability for coal to ramp up or not to ramp up Please provide any written comments as soon as possible Many thanks and please let me know if you have any questions Section Environmental Conditionality a In this section a noncompliant unit means a coalfired electric energy generation unit for which construction was commenced prior to August that does not comply with requirements relating to emissions of air pollutants as determined in subparagraph c b It shall be unlawful for the owner of noncompliant unit to operate such unit in any year at a capacity factor that exceeds the lesser of the average capacity factor for fossil coalfired electric energy generation units in operation in the United States or the average capacity factor for such unit based on information reported to the Commission for the years through c Within six months of enactment of this section the Administrator shall publish emission levels equal to the average emission performance achieved by all electric generating units permitted pursuant to Section and Section of the Clean Air Act and prior to the date of enactment of this section d No later than six months of after enactment the Administrator shall promulgate a list of electric energy generation units for which construction was commenced prior to August e This section takes effect on the date that is years after the date of enactment of this Act

It will likely take some time for EPA to develop these regulations the time frame is proposed rule by and final rule by but this is a significant step in that it now formally puts mercury on the radar screen for power generators in terms of planning for emissions controls It is a positive step that EPA included in its determination an intent to develop flexible compliance measures ie trading for mercury It also means that mercury will most likely be included in any efforts to develop multipollutant legislation in the next Congress Please call me if you have any questions THURSDAY DEC EPA DECIDES MERCURY EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS MUST BE REDUCED To protect public health and the environment EPA Administrator Carol M Browner today announced that the Clinton Administration will require reductions for the first time ever of harmful mercury emissions from coalfired power plants the largest source of such emissions in America After extensive study EPA determined mercury emissions from power plants pose significant hazards to public health and must be reduced The agency will propose regulations by and issue final rules by Mercury from power plants settles over waterways polluting rivers and lakes and contaminating fish Exposure to mercury poses real risks to public health especially to children and developing fetuses Browner said The greatest source of mercury emissions is power plants and they have never been required to control these emissions before now Todays decision to address this problem marks a major step forward in the Clinton Administrations ongoing efforts to protect public health and the environment Exposure to mercury has been associated with both neurological and developmental damage in humans The developing fetus is the most sensitive to mercurys effects which include damage to nervous system development People are exposed to mercury primarily through eating fish that have been contaminated when mercury from power plants and other sources is deposited to water bodies Once mercury enters water biological processes can transform it into methylmercury a highly toxic form of mercury that builds up in animal and human tissues EPA recommends that subsistence fisherman pregnant women and others should always heed state fishing advisories Under the Clean Air Act EPA is required to study toxic air pollution from power plants in order to determine if additional regulations are necessary in order to protect public health EPA reported its study to Congress in February That study concluded that of all toxic pollution examined mercury posed the greatest concern to public health An earlier study concluded that the largest source of humanmade mercury pollution in America was coalfired power plants After completion of the study the Clean Air Act required EPA to determine whether to proceed with the development of regulations Today EPA is announcing that it has affirmatively decided that mercury air emissions from power plants should be regulated because mercury poses the greatest hazards to public health EPA will propose regulations by December and will begin developing those regulations shortly Industry the public and state local and tribal governments will have an opportunity to participate in the process Then EPA will issue final regulations by December The Clinton Administration already has taken a number of aggressive actions to reduce mercury air pollution including significantly reducing allowable emissions from municipal waste combustors medical waste incinerators and hazardous waste combustors When fully implemented in the existing rules will reduce total humancaused mercury emissions by nearly percent from levels nationwide On November President Clinton called for a dramatic new approach to reduce air pollution from Americas power plants The President highlighted the benefits of adopting a combined strategy to address all of the major pollutants emitted by power plants including mercury sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide A comprehensive strategy that addresses all of these pollutants together will provide more certainty and flexibility to industry making it the most costeffective way to control the emissions that threaten public health and the environment As the Clean Air Act requires the regulatory process to control mercury will proceed under current law However at the same time the Administration encourages the Executive Branch and the Congress to work toward legislating a comprehensive four pollutant approach which will benefit the public health the environment and the economy Todays decision will appear soon in the Federal Register but is accessible immediately on EPAs mercury web site at wwwepagovmercury Also today EPA is posting on its website mercury emissions from every coalfired power plant in the country This is consistent with EPAs strong commitment to provide citizens with information about pollution in their communities Jeffrey

federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority was put on the defensive at a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing last week as its adversaries mounted an offensive against the power agency for its huge billion debt and unaccountability With a bill S introduced by Sen Mitch McConnell RKy serving as the backdrop the need for changing TVAs role in an emerging competitiv e electricity market was reviewed TVA is one of the biggest power producers in the country and it enjoys certain unfair privileges according to investorowned utilities which are seeking changes to TVA to level the playing field in a competitive electricity market McConnells bill is touted as making TVA more accountable by subjecting the power agency to among other things antitrust laws and to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission McConnell who was present at the hearing questioned TVA on its claim of providing lowcost power and wh y it should not be brought under FERC authority Supporting the position of S Robert Hewett representing TVA Watch a coalition led by Duke Energy and other private utilities decried the privileges TVA is endowed with Hewett said TVA has the ability to set its own wholesale and retail rates is exempt from antitrust laws and makes on ly token payments in lieu of taxes to the local government No other entity in the country even comes close to having this type of authority or license said Hewett Hewett wants TVA to be subjected to antitrust laws and FERC jurisdiction I n addition TVA must be restricted from building new generation capacity and it should not have preferential access to power from other federal facilities at rates below fair market value Hewett recommended Richard Munson executive director NortheastMidwest Institute continued on the same stream as Hewett calling TVA a national problem Munson said TVA s inspector general in a recent report has highlighted TVAs most serious problem its unaccountability Decisions by TVAs board of director s are not reviewed by state regulators or federal agencies and the power agency enjoys a monopoly in its service territory so it is not accountable even to market forces according to Munson Stating that TVA has been propped up by enormous taxpayer subsidies Munson said The giant utility is exempt from hundreds of federal and state laws and regulations it pays no federal or state taxes and it obtains lowcost loans because of Washingtons i mplied support But Mark Medford TVA executive vice president cautioned that proposals su ch as S may risk compromising the lowcost reliable electricity availab le to the Tennessee Valley region Medford said S would place new restrictions on TVA and expand regulation of TVA activities which seems unusual in the context of a discussion of deregulation of the electricity industry Medford also argued against FERC and state regulation of TVA prices and FER C determination of the need for new generation capacity He said responsibili ty for fulfilling those missions is placed on the threemember TVA board nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate Superimposing a higher regulatory body such as FERC to pass judgment on the decision of the TVA board in these areas seems both duplicative and inappropriate Medford also did not think that antitrust laws should be applied to TVA because it would be unfair to TVA ratepayers When a private utility violates the antitrust laws its stockholders bear the cost However governmental entities like TVA have no stockholders and the financial cost s of such penalties have to be borne by the people who are supposed to be served said Medford Medford asserted that investors now hold all of TVAs debt that finances the power program He said TVA debt is neither backed by the federal government nor is it supported by mortgages on TVA plant property and equipment It is secured solely by the financial operation of TVA as well as bond covenants and the provisions of the TVA Act Medford said Also Medford said TVA has been on the path of debt reduction in the last three years bringing down the debt by billion Austin Caroll representing the Kentucky Managers Association a group of municipal and rural electric cooperative utilities did not totally agree with the principles of S though it did want some changes to be made to TVA Preceding the examination of S was a hearing on the nomination of TVA board members Skila Harris and Glenn McCullough Harris served until recently as the executive director of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board managing the work of the Tennessee Valley Advisory Committee which comprises of representatives from groups interested in the future of TVA McCullough previously served on the executive committee of the Mississippi Municipal League and as the director of the Mississippi office of the Appalachian Regional Commission The TVA board of directors has three members serving nine year staggered terms

screen for power generators in terms of planning for emissions controls It is a positive step that EPA included in its determination an intent to develop flexible compliance measures ie trading for mercury It also means that mercury will most likely be included in any efforts to develop multipollutant legislation in the next Congress Please call me if you have any questions THURSDAY DEC EPA DECIDES MERCURY EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS MUST BE REDUCED To protect public health and the environment EPA Administrator Carol M Browner today announced that the Clinton Administration will require reductions for the first time ever of harmful mercury emissions from coalfired power plants the largest source of such emissions in America After extensive study EPA determined mercury emissions from power plants pose significant hazards to public health and must be reduced The agency will propose regulations by and issue final rules by Mercury from power plants settles over waterways polluting rivers and lakes and contaminating fish Exposure to mercury poses real risks to public health especially to children and developing fetuses Browner said The greatest source of mercury emissions is power plants and they have never been required to control these emissions before now Todays decision to address this problem marks a major step forward in the Clinton Administrations ongoing efforts to protect public health and the environment Exposure to mercury has been associated with both neurological and developmental damage in humans The developing fetus is the most sensitive to mercurys effects which include damage to nervous system development People are exposed to mercury primarily through eating fish that have been contaminated when mercury from power plants and other sources is deposited to water bodies Once mercury enters water biological processes can transform it into methylmercury a highly toxic form of mercury that builds up in animal and human tissues EPA recommends that subsistence fisherman pregnant women and others should always heed state fishing advisories Under the Clean Air Act EPA is required to study toxic air pollution from power plants in order to determine if additional regulations are necessary in order to protect public health EPA reported its study to Congress in February That study concluded that of all toxic pollution examined mercury posed the greatest concern to public health An earlier study concluded that the largest source of humanmade mercury pollution in America was coalfired power plants After completion of the study the Clean Air Act required EPA to determine whether to proceed with the development of regulations Today EPA is announcing that it has affirmatively decided that mercury air emissions from power plants should be regulated because mercury poses the greatest hazards to public health EPA will propose regulations by December and will begin developing those regulations shortly Industry the public and state local and tribal governments will have an opportunity to participate in the process Then EPA will issue final regulations by December The Clinton Administration already has taken a number of aggressive actions to reduce mercury air pollution including significantly reducing allowable emissions from municipal waste combustors medical waste incinerators and hazardous waste combustors When fully implemented in the existing rules will reduce total humancaused mercury emissions by nearly percent from levels nationwide On November President Clinton called for a dramatic new approach to reduce air pollution from Americas power plants The President highlighted the benefits of adopting a combined strategy to address all of the major pollutants emitted by power plants including mercury sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide A comprehensive strategy that addresses all of these pollutants together will provide more certainty and flexibility to industry making it the most costeffective way to control the emissions that threaten public health and the environment As the Clean Air Act requires the regulatory process to control mercury will proceed under current law However at the same time the Administration encourages the Executive Branch and the Congress to work toward legislating a comprehensive four pollutant approach which will benefit the public health the environment and the economy Todays decision will appear soon in the Federal Register but is accessible immediately on EPAs mercury web site at wwwepagovmercury Also today EPA is posting on its website mercury emissions from every coalfired power plant in the country This is consistent with EPAs strong commitment to provide citizens with information about pollution in their communities Jeffrey

<20910994.1075848078353.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jeffrey.keeler@enron.com,2000-03-14 05:29:00,Pipeline Safety Legislation Cc As you requested the following is a detailed update on pipeline safety legislation currently moving through Congress Pipeline safety reauthorization legislation Authorization for pipeline safety programs as administered by the US Dept of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety OPS is currently set to expire at the end of FY At the beginning of the th Congress industry was focused on securing a simple two year reauthorization bill that basically extends current pipeline safety programs with some modest increases in funding levels In fact the House Commerce Committee who shares jurisdiction over pipeline safety with the Transportation Infrastructure Committee acted early in to pass a simple two year reauthorization bill HR Unfortunately the issue became more complex from that point A serious liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham Washington that occurred last summer killing several children dramatically changed the debate over pipeline safety Members of the House and Senate from Washington state backed by the governor and numerous state and local officials moved swiftly to introduce legislation that they feel is designed to address some of the shortcomings in federal pipeline regulation that they believe may have allowed the Bellingham incident to occur In the Senate Senator Patty Murray DWA has introduced S which is designed to expand State authority over interstate pipelines in several new areas such as inspection and testing emergency response plans leak detection and operator training and qualification The bill also would authorize a large increase in OPS funding through pipeline user fees to increase the amount of grants to the States allow for hiring of additional inspectors and increase RD for inspection and leak detection technologies The current OPS budget is around million with million from user fees the Murray bill would authorize million in FY which would require a sizeable increase in user fees Senator Slade Gorton RWA has recently decided to cosposnor the Murray bill and will be actively involved in trying to gain Republican support for the bill On the House side Rep Jack Metcalf RWA has introduced a similar bill HR which a number of the Washington representatives have cosponsored Interstate natural gas pipelines have been placed in a very difficult situation The Bellingham incident was a liquid pipeline accident and liquids pipelines generally have less stringent regulatory requirements than natural gas pipelines The Washington delegation has highlighted the fact that deaths and injuries have occurred over the past years related to natural gas pipeline incidents but they fail to distinguish the fact that almost all of those incidents were on LDC systems which ironically are entirely State regulated Only fatalities in that period were naturalgas related and the majority of those accidents were caused by third party damage In short the INGAA crowd is being dragged down by the poor records of the LDCs and the liquid pipelines The calls for more state regulation of interstate pipeline are largely misguided based on the fact that the interstate pipelines under federal regulation have an exemplary safety record In addition OPS is already working on a Pipeline Integrity Rulemaking that would implement a number of additional measures to prevent accidents on federallyregulated pipelines As you mentioned INGAA has not been doing the best job representing us on these issues They have been working in a group effort with API AGA and the Association of Oil Pipelines AOPL to try and deflect the negative claims of the Murray and Metcalf legislation but have not been forceful enough in distinguishing interstate natural gas pipelines positive record from the liquids and LDCs Thus they have given the impression that INGAA companies might be willing to submit to additional regulation that liquids and LDC are under political pressure to submit to due to Bellingham We have been working with other major INGAA companies El Paso in particular to make sure that the perspective and positive record of our natural gas pipelines is heard clearly by the key legislators The odds of these measures S HR passing on their own is fairly slim They will get a great deal of attention however The Senate Commerce Committee held a field hearing in Bellingham Washington yesterday at which Senators Gorton and Murray testified along with OPS and the families of Bellingham victims the press coverage was not good ie USA Today cover story When Pipelines Are Time Bombs These bills or portions of them will likely be offered and considered as amendments to Pipeline Safety Reauthorization legislation as it comes before the House Transportation Infrastructure and Senate Commerce Committee later this year The increased controversy caused by these bills will likely doom efforts to pass a pipeline safety reauthorization bill this year The leadership of the House and Senate Committees will not likely want to face a bitter debate between safety advocates OPS States and industry in their committees in this tough election year While this is probably a good sign there is an increased risk that industry may face some large hurdles in the appropriations process Appropriations Legislation While Members of Congress push for their stand alone bills andor amendments to reauthorization bills the greater danger is that some of these issues will be dealt with in an appropriations context In particular the fact that Senator Slade Gorton is now actively engaged in pushing for extensive pipeline safety reforms is troubling he is a key member of the Senate Appropriations Committee is close to Republican leadership and has a tough reelection fight coming up Senator Murray is also on Senate Appropriations Both are on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee which funds OPS It is quite likely that the Senators will make a push to get increases in the OPS budget for FY that would enable the kinds of reforms contemplated by their standalone legislation more state funding more inspectors more RD Much of this increase would be funded through increases in user fees INGAA indicates that it expects we could be facing increases in the range of from FY There is also the possibility that an attempt will be made to add legislative riders to the OPS appropriations such as requiring OPS to mandate inspections increase operator qualifications or allow increased state authority I would predict that legislative riders can be prevented but it will be very difficult to avoid some kind of increases beyond mere adjustments for inflation in the OPS budget and user fees The reauthorization will indeed receive attention in but our advocacy efforts will clearly need to be focused on the appropriations process in order to minimize the impact on interstate pipeline user fees and prevent other harmful mandates We will continue to work with key members of the authorizing and appropriations committees to ensure that the interstate natural gas perspective is clearly heard and if possible we avoid being dragged down in attempts to impose more strict regulation on liquids and LDCs Please let me know if you have questions or require additional information Thank you

and ethanol interests remain at odds as the Senate seeks to limit use of the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE making it uncertain whether the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will be able to craft an acceptable national solution to the problem of MTBE in water lobbyists told BNA April Despite fundamental differences however all sources interviewed for this storyincluding two oil industry officials three ethanol advocates and several other sources active in the legislative process on this issuesaid that it still appeared possible that national MTBE legislation satisfying multiple interests could be developed I dont think were at an impasse one oil industry official said echoing comments by others in the debate I just think its going to take time Whether this means that a compromise can be worked out during this legislative session remains to be seen this official and others said The committee chairman Sen Bob Smith RNH has made MTBE a priority saying that Congress must eliminate the threat of water contamination posed by the fuel oxygenate while being careful to preserve the air quality benefits associated with MTBEmixed gasoline The chairmans view of the issue however is contrary to the view held by the Clinton administration by ranking minority member Sen Max Baucus DMont and by Democratic and Republican agricultural interests in the Senate These forces hold that cornderived ethanol and possibly other renewable fuels should gain a wider market under any legislation addressing the threat of MTBE water contamination The oil industry and Smith disagree with that view Smith Rejects Renewables Linkage When the Clinton administration announced on March its support for a national renewable fuels mandate Smith said the issue of renewable fuels has absolutely nothing to do with eliminating MTBE from our drinking water He repeated this point in a newspaper opinion piece April In addition to gasoline and ethanol advocates several other interest groups maintain an active role in the ongoing debate and Senate committee staff ar continuing behindthescenes meetings with all sides sources said Generally comprehensive MTBE legislation is expected to slash use of the additive without necessarily eliminating it entirely A committee bill also is expected to provide states with the option of waiving the Clean Air Act mandate currently driving the use of MTBE and ethanol another fuel oxygenate At the same time such a bill is expected to include no backsliding language to ensure that air toxics reductions achieved in the eastern United States over the last several years are maintained even if states waive out of the air act mandate Sources said the committee also is weighing possible cleanup liability relief for MTBE producers and enhancements to fuel storage tank clean up programs Heavy Reliance on MTBE MTBE is a highoxygen highoctane gasoline additive that is one of the most heavily produced chemicals in the United States With roughly million gallons of MTBE mixed with gasoline each day in the United States the chemical makes up more than percent of gasoline by volume according to the oil industry MTBE use is driven mainly by the Clean Air Act requirement that all reformulated gasoline contain at least percent oxygen by weight Reformulated gasoline is sold in areas of the country with poor air quality According to the Environmental Protection Agency more than percent of reformulated gasoline production relies on MTBE to meet the oxygen requirement However MTBE smells somewhat like turpentine and has been detected in public water supplies rendering at least a few of those supplies undrinkable The health effects of drinking MTBE in water are little known but the chemical does taste and smell bad according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service RFG programs in Chicago and Milwaukee rely on ethanol for oxygen content in their reformulated gasoline Among other concerns in the legislative debate the ethanol industry fears losing this market if Congress eliminates the percent oxygen requirement in the Clean Air Act to address MTBE concerns one industry representative said There were billion gallons of ethanol mixed into gasoline in according to the US Department of Agriculture USDA chief economist Keith Collins said before the Senate Agricultural Committee April that there are ethanol plants in operation in nearly states Bill Would Ease Percent Oxygen Rule To address water quality concerns Smith has signed on to legislation S that would allow states to lift the percent mandate driving MTBE use Introduced by Inhofe and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif S would not ban or phase down MTBE outright However this is expected to change when and if the Environment and Public Works committee marks up more comprehensive legislation oil ethanol and other sources said I think theres a growing set of opinion that MTBE either needs to be phased down to historic levels or phased out entirely over a period of some years an oil industry source said Chemical companies that make MTBE disagree and continue to urge an overhaul of underground storage tank programs in order to mitigate water contamination According to one source familiar with the issue Senate committee staff members are considering several legislative ideas that might address concerns of MTBE interests Prospective liability relief from contamination cleanup costs is under consideration as is the idea that MTBE makers should get expedited review of required permits when switching to alternate chemical products In addition the committee may be considering more rigorous regulation of underground storage tanks as part of comprehensive MTBE legislation this source said Daschle Harkin Drafts At least bills have been introduced in the th Congress to address the problem of MTBE in water according to the Congressional Research Service report The report said most bills would either eliminate the Clean Air Act requirement driving oxygenate use or would explicitly ban MTBE Some of the bills would bolster the Environmental Protection Agencys underground storage tank program since leaking USTs are considered the main cause of water contamination This approach is supported by certain MTBE makers who told BNA that water contamination is caused by leaking tanks and not by the highquality fuel additive Additional draft bills are pending introduction including comprehensive legislation by Sen Tom Daschle DSD the Senate minority leader that would significantly curtail MTBE use by while letting states take action before then Daschles billsaid by Baucuss staff to be supported by the ranking EPW committee memberalso would bolster ethanol production through a national renewable fuels mandate expanding national average ethanol use to percent or more over the next years In addition the draft legislation would amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to get states the money they need to implement UST cleanup programs Ethanol supporter Sen Tom Harkin DIowa also is drafting MTBE legislation that he hopes to introduce soon after the Senates Easter recess a spokeswoman said Harkin is ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and supports a renewable fuels standard If crafted in the right way Harkin has said such a standard could result in far more ethanol use than current law Iowa ranks second after Illinois in total ethanol production capacity according to the US Department of Agriculture Nebraska ranks third and Minnesota ranks fourth RFG Market Despite calls for eliminating the percent oxygenate requirement in the reformulated gasoline program ethanol interests said they still support maintenance of the requirement combined with an MTBE ban Such a scenario would leave ethanol to fill the RFG market void doubling ethanol use over three to five years sources said If Congress were to eliminate the percent mandate but institute a national renewable fuels requirement ethanol use also is expected to at least double from current levels However it would do so over a longer period of about years one ethanol source said Oil industry officials as well as Northeast states and some environmental advocates oppose this simple MTBE ban because it would create a de facto ethanol mandate The oil industry also continues to oppose a national renewable fuels standard officials said A representative of Northeast states told a Senate panel April that Smith appeared to be exploring a compromise with ethanol interests considering a national average alternative fuel requirement that would benefit ethanol as well as natural gas electricity and other transportation fuels The Northeast representative Jason Grumet of Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management supports the national average alternative fuel approach since it would offer the ethanol industry market share without requiring the Northeast to use large quantities of Midwestderived ethanol However oil company interests reaffirmed April their longheld opposition to any new fuel mandates saying concerns over MTBE in water should be addressed by eliminating current statutory mandates and not by instituting any new mandates Oil companies are particularly firm in their position given that agricultural states are expected to play a key role in upcoming presidential elections a second oil industry official said It is not simply that the industry opposes new mandatesthough that is the casebut also that an ethanolmandate bidding war might erupt in a year when Republicans and Democrats are vying for Midwestern votes the official said Ethanol Supporters Want Expansion Meanwhile ethanol interests said they will continue to fight for expansion of their product in the RFG market and do not necessarily see a national renewable fuels mandate as a legislative compromise The Clinton administrations renewable standard would require ethanol use initially at current levels of about percent of gasoline The mandate would then expand over years administration officials have said Ethanol is more volatile than MTBE making it more difficult for oil refiners to produce summertime gasoline that meets low emissions requirements for volatile organic compounds This is one reason the de facto mandate is opposed by Northeast states and environmental interests Some of the renewables mandates under consideration in Congress would allow refiners to meet requirements over an annual average enabling them to avoid or reduce their ethanol use in summer No Markup Scheduled Smith staff confirmed only that discussions with oil ethanol environmental MTBE and state interests continue A spokesman said comprehensive MTBE legislation is something were trying to get done quickly but that a bill markup has not been scheduled Discussions leading to a full EPW committee markup of more comprehensive MTBE legislation are important to the legislative process sources said because a bill is not expected to weather floor debate without early support from Democrats and Republicans on the committee as well as from members of the Senate Agricultural Committee I just cant see this getting duked out on the floor said one ethanol lobbyist I think that we the MTBE folks the oil company folks and the environmentalists all recognize that there is mutually assured destruction on the floor According to one source a new version of the bill is expected to push MTBE use down to pre levels over about four years Before the air act amendments required the sale of reformulated gasoline MTBE was used mainly to enhance octane It is unclear whether the bill will somehow prove acceptable to both Democrats and Republicans ethanol and oil interests as well as to Northeast states the Midwest and California Things change day to day an oil industry official said I think the issue could be resolved without the ethanol piece but the ethanol piece is just so difficult he added I think right now the chairman is poking around in the mud to find somewhere with solid footing an ethanol industry source said

Senator John McCains RAZ pipeline safety legislation S was approved The overall outcome was not unexpected the final legislation contained several provisions that went a little bit further than Enron and INGAA would have liked but there was rigorous debate over issues like States role and mandated integrity measures and close votes on several amendments Senator McCain and other bill proponents like Senator Slade Gorton realize those issues will need to be addressed before the legislation proceeds to the Senate floor The Committee considered several amendments to the legislation McCain substitute amendment Approved by voice vote The amendment substituted the revised Chairmans mark text that was developed over the last several days in place of the original version of S All further amendments at the markup were in the context of this substitute text McCain amendment to Section b on operator assistance investigations Approved by voice vote This amendment attempts to fix language in the substitute text that was problematic to just about everyone in industry and on the Hill because it unconstitutionally forced an operator to choose between exercising constitutional rights to protect himself in a criminal investigation or keeping his job The McCain amendment did not seem to improve things much and many Senators could not understand it Senator John Breaux DLA objected to it and asked that the entire section be deleted and there was some good debate on both sides of the issue In the end McCain asked that the amendment be passed with a promise that he would work with Breaux and others to fix it before Senate floor consideration Sen John Kerry DMA Amendment on Enforcement Approved by voice vote Another confusing vote in which many members did not understand the changes being made but agreed to it on the condition that clarifications be made before Senate floor action Late last night Enron led a group including companies from INGAA and AGA in providing comments to Senator Kerry which caused him to make substantial changes to his amendment before it was voted on at markup including dropping provisions allowing citizen suits and other troubling issues In the end the amendment that passed was acceptable to industry Sen Sam Brownback RKS amendment on Advisory Council Pilot Program Rejected to Brownbacks amendment would have replaced the Advisory Council Pilot Program as proposed in the substitute text with a requirement that already existing technical advisory committees to OPS be required to meet regionally There was a good debate on the issue but Senator Gorton made a strong plea to members that the new Advisory Councils would only be a pilot program and would not have any binding role He also agreed to work with industry on improvements such as representation of pipelines on the councils before Senate floor action Brownback amendment on State Role Rejected to This amendment was written by Enron and El Paso striking language from the bill that was overly broad in suggesting that a State had oversight authority over other activities beyond proper areas like accident investigation constructionrelated activities and inspection There was a heated debate with Brownback and Breaux making excellent arguments for us but in the end we were vote short In fact Democrats switched their votes at the last minute to tip the balance I have already had discussions with Senate staff after the markup indicating that this language will need to be fixed to our satisfaction before Senate floor action Sen Ron Wyden DOR amendment increasing public righttoknow requirements Approved by voice vote This amendment increases the kinds of information that need to be made widely available to the public Because of a state of confusion in which many of the Senators left the room to go vote on the Senate floor there was no opposition voiced to the amendment and it passed without much discussion Breaux amendment on Integrity Inspection Program Rejected by voice vote This was another written by Enron and El Paso that would have removed the bias of substitute text language toward internal inspections and pressure testing and broadened the range of tools that a pipeline could include in an integrity management plan It also would have removed a requirement that any state and local official would have the chance to comment on the plan and receive a response The debate was heated over this amendment with Senator Gorton indicating that he could accept the first part of the amendment removing the bias toward internal inspectionpressure testing but not the second which he felt weakened state and local opportunity to comment on pipleines integrity plans The committee agreed to reject the amendment but work to fix the second part before Senate floor action Procedurally it was a strange markup session A quorum of the Committee members needs to be present to vote on final passage of the bill A vote on the Senate floor came up as Senator Kerry was explaining his amendment and as Senators were leaving Senator McCain very quickly asked that the entire bill be passed on voice vote before a quorum left the room subject to consideration of amendments when they returned The bill was passed before many knew what was happening Of course only about members came back to the room for the rest of the markup so much of the voting was done without full everyones participation or by proxy which had serious effects on the outcome of several amendments As you can see from the notes on many of the amendments there will be an opportunity to fix the legislation before it moves any further Several Senators indicated after the markup that they had voted with Senator Gorton on several of the amendments as a courtesy to him but would not support the bills movement to the Senate floor without serious changes being made One key ally is Senator Trent Lott RMS who supported all industry amendments His control of the Senate floor schedule as Senate Majority Leader will be key in driving changes to the legislation If satisfactory changes are not made the bill will move no further There will also be an opportunity to provide comments for Committee Report language that will accompany the final bill that was passed The report will give explanations of several of the concerns that were raised and provide legislative history that will help clarify areas where there is uncertainty about the real effect of some of the provisions We did have several victories Many of the amendments that were expected worse language from the Administration or Patty Murray legislation were not even offered because of the advance work we were able to do with Republican and Democratic Commerce Committee members and staff We were able to affect a number of changes to the Chairmans mark or substitute amendment before the markup even occured Another interesting note Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison was a complete nonfactor in the markup She is the Subcommittee chair responsible for this issue yet she did not make an opening statement and she did not vote at all on several key amendments of concern to industry We will be working on the where do we go from here strategy in the coming weeks and will report as developments occur Thanks again to all who helped out in preparation for the markup in what was an amazing team effort The technical support of Dave Johnson Colleen Raker and Lou Soldano was extremely valuable Phil Lowrys and Dave Johnsons availability to do key meetings with Senators and staff was critical in our efforts And Dave and I can attest to the fact that Enron was in a leadership role leading up to the markup guiding the efforts of INGAA and others and directly influencing the direction this legislation will take in the coming weeks and months Jeff Keeler

multipollutant proposals I have attached several documents for your review Because this issue and the Administrations review of New Source Review NSR regulations have been receiving a lot of attention lately I thought I would provide a brief summary as well I also think it would be a good idea to have a meeting with you Rick and Linda at some point before September to make sure you all understand the proposal and our strategy Enrons Multipollutant Proposal Last year Enron led formation of the Clean Power Group coalition which currently includes NiSource Trigen El Paso and Calpine The group developed a proposal on multipollutant regulation for the power generation sector details attached and has been working to get the White House EPA and members of Congress to adopt this approach early on in the formative stages of legislation We have received strong interest on Capitol Hill from Moderate Republicans including House Science Chair Sherwood Boehlert Senate Environment Ranking Member Bob Smith and Democrats including Senate Energy Chair Jeff Bingaman and a number of House Center Democrats Also EPA has been very receptive to our proposal In recent statements Gov Whitman has expressed support for key elements of our approach national cap and trade programs for NOx SO and mercury in exchange for overhauls of Clean Air Act provisions and NSR A recent EPA memo outlining their plan contains many elements of our approach In addition as the White House has come under increasing pressure on environmental issues due to the wake of the Bonn climate change talks absence of a domestic or international strategy pressure from Hill Democrats and environmentalists we have had increasing discussions with advisors about how our proposal could help solve some of their current problems The Administrations consideration of New Source Review reform has been another driver behind activity on multipollutant and traction of proposals like ours but I will cover that subject in a separate memo Other Multipollutant Plans There are really only two leading industry multipollutant proposals on the table our Clean Power Groups and the Clean Energy Group plan Sempra KeySpan PSEG PGE Conectiv Consolidated Edison Exelon Northeast Utilities Key differences from our plan include CEGs plan explicitly supports carbon caps ours does not CEGs plan proposes drastic emissions cuts rather than our glideslope approach and CEGs plan for NSR reform is not as ambitious as ours Senate Environment Chair Jim Jeffords also has a multipollutant bill favored by most environmentalists but considered more of a placeholder bill Jeffords bill includes stringent carbon caps prohibits trading of mercury and leaves NSR and other Clean Air Act programs intact Jeffords plans to mark up this legislation this fall at which time our plan and CEGs plan will be given serious consideration It is also expected that EPA will come out with its formal proposal in the next few months so we are working hard to make sure as many elements of our plan as possible are included Enrons Strategy We have structured the EnronClean Power Group proposal to address numerous commercial concerns based on positions we have taken on behalf of commercial groups in advocacy on programs like the NOx SIP call and based on discussions with commercial groups about problems with Clean Air Act regulation or possible opportunities in structuring new programs We are in the process of having more detailed analysis done on impacts of our proposed legislation but here is an overview from an Enron perspective Note multipollutant legislation covers power generation sector only at this point but could be expanded to industrial pipeline sources in the future Generation Development ENA and EES replaces uncertainty cost and delay of NSR emissions offset programs with emissions trading programs that reward efficiency and new technology Provides a level playing field for competition with existing sources who have used environmental regulation to erect barriers to new entrants Emissions Trading Markets EGM replaces patchwork of regional programs different timelines different pollutants with a national capandtrade program for each pollutant Could provide increased volumes in SO NOx markets more players in system and more allowances traded nationwide create new markets mercury maybe CO and spawn derivative markets options forward contracts Origination EES ENA creates more regulatory certainty in NSR which has prevented customers from investing in plant improvements technologies Energy Efficiency and renewables EES EWC trading program allocates allowances for conservation activities and nonemitting generation sources to date most air regulations do not reward renewables or efficiency New Technology ENA EGM EES Xcelerator Principal Investments plan provides incentives to developing new efficient technologies power gen mulitemissions control either owned by Enron or under consideration for investment Cleaner Fuels ENA ETS EGM provides incentives for the use of gas in generation and for the use of cleaner coalnew coal technologies For commodity trading in general plan would provide greater regulatory certainty about the effects of environmental regulation on power markets Just to clarify whos doing what at Enron I have take the lead assisted by Lisa in working with commercial groups to form Enrons strategy working with the Coalition to structure our proposal develop strategy maintain contact with the EPA and Administration and perform outreach to environmental and industry groups Pat Shortridge has assisted on legislative advocacy Congress and White House outreach and political strategy related to our proposal and has worked with our Coalition to make sure its political activities and strategies are wellfocused If you have any questions please call me Ill be in touch shortly to see if we can arrange a brief focused meeting on this topic Documents I

It will likely take some time for EPA to develop these regulations the time frame is proposed rule by and final rule by but this is a significant step in that it now formally puts mercury on the radar screen for power generators in terms of planning for emissions controls It is a positive step that EPA included in its determination an intent to develop flexible compliance measures ie trading for mercury It also means that mercury will most likely be included in any efforts to develop multipollutant legislation in the next Congress Please call me if you have any questions THURSDAY DEC EPA DECIDES MERCURY EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS MUST BE REDUCED To protect public health and the environment EPA Administrator Carol M Browner today announced that the Clinton Administration will require reductions for the first time ever of harmful mercury emissions from coalfired power plants the largest source of such emissions in America After extensive study EPA determined mercury emissions from power plants pose significant hazards to public health and must be reduced The agency will propose regulations by and issue final rules by Mercury from power plants settles over waterways polluting rivers and lakes and contaminating fish Exposure to mercury poses real risks to public health especially to children and developing fetuses Browner said The greatest source of mercury emissions is power plants and they have never been required to control these emissions before now Todays decision to address this problem marks a major step forward in the Clinton Administrations ongoing efforts to protect public health and the environment Exposure to mercury has been associated with both neurological and developmental damage in humans The developing fetus is the most sensitive to mercurys effects which include damage to nervous system development People are exposed to mercury primarily through eating fish that have been contaminated when mercury from power plants and other sources is deposited to water bodies Once mercury enters water biological processes can transform it into methylmercury a highly toxic form of mercury that builds up in animal and human tissues EPA recommends that subsistence fisherman pregnant women and others should always heed state fishing advisories Under the Clean Air Act EPA is required to study toxic air pollution from power plants in order to determine if additional regulations are necessary in order to protect public health EPA reported its study to Congress in February That study concluded that of all toxic pollution examined mercury posed the greatest concern to public health An earlier study concluded that the largest source of humanmade mercury pollution in America was coalfired power plants After completion of the study the Clean Air Act required EPA to determine whether to proceed with the development of regulations Today EPA is announcing that it has affirmatively decided that mercury air emissions from power plants should be regulated because mercury poses the greatest hazards to public health EPA will propose regulations by December and will begin developing those regulations shortly Industry the public and state local and tribal governments will have an opportunity to participate in the process Then EPA will issue final regulations by December The Clinton Administration already has taken a number of aggressive actions to reduce mercury air pollution including significantly reducing allowable emissions from municipal waste combustors medical waste incinerators and hazardous waste combustors When fully implemented in the existing rules will reduce total humancaused mercury emissions by nearly percent from levels nationwide On November President Clinton called for a dramatic new approach to reduce air pollution from Americas power plants The President highlighted the benefits of adopting a combined strategy to address all of the major pollutants emitted by power plants including mercury sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide A comprehensive strategy that addresses all of these pollutants together will provide more certainty and flexibility to industry making it the most costeffective way to control the emissions that threaten public health and the environment As the Clean Air Act requires the regulatory process to control mercury will proceed under current law However at the same time the Administration encourages the Executive Branch and the Congress to work toward legislating a comprehensive four pollutant approach which will benefit the public health the environment and the economy Todays decision will appear soon in the Federal Register but is accessible immediately on EPAs mercury web site at wwwepagovmercury Also today EPA is posting on its website mercury emissions from every coalfired power plant in the country This is consistent with EPAs strong commitment to provide citizens with information about pollution in their communities Jeffrey

to Senators Gramm and Schumer concerning their provision on Environmental Conditionality Sorry this was thrown together very quickly on short notice but I hope it is helpful Section Environmental Conditionality In general as this provision attempts to close the loophole for grandfathered pre coal plants there would be an negative impact on coal trading particularly highsulfur and our equity positions in coal mines However there are opportunities to still profit by shortinghedging our positions if we have enough knowledge and information about when these changes are going to take place we will likely be able to seize opportunities from the resulting volatility The question in your email asked only about coal markets but on the whole Enron could find some benefits from this kind of provision because of our ability to trade more gas transport more gas and build merchant gascombined cycle capacity renewables etc I have not had the chance to get any analysis on electricity prices but I would suspect that our view would be that there may be some volatility due to the shift in fuels but it would level out with the right risk management in the longer term I can try to get more for you as this legislation evolves Specific comments on the drafting sectionbysection a the only comment I would raise is that how the term electric generating unit EGU is defined is controversial right now The EPA wants to make sure EGU includes industrial boilers this point is being litigated in the NOx SIP Call and Section cases right now Unless it was the intent to also capture industrial coal boilers in this Section it may be wise to clarify that you are targeting utilities Industrials will raise a great deal of opposition if this provision is construed to include them b It probably does not make a great deal of difference whether you are taking the average capacity factor for coal fired vs fossil averaging all fossil units will create an average capacity factor that makes it a little harder for coal to meet environmental performance standards I believe the average capacity factor for all fossilcoal plants would be around Large heavilyloaded coal plants are probably in the range so they would have to cut back substantially However some of the older interim load coal plants may only run at about or less in which case they may still emit a substantial amount of pollution but not be captured under this provision So in effect this section may not limit all grandfathered coal plants just the big ones c I dont know if this is a drafting oversight or an attempt to set the bar unreasonably high for coal but including the word ALL in the phrase average emission performance achieved by ALL electric generating units would mean including gas and other clean sources in looking at emissions averages which no coal unit could ever meet In the name of workability hopefully they will include something like achieved by all COAL FIRED electric generating units From Cynthia Sandherr PM To Jeffrey NRON cc Michael NRON Richard ES Steven J ES Joe NRON Stacey ES Jim FallonEnron nron Communications Joe NRON Lisa ES Subject GrammSchumer federal Electricity Legislation URGENT REQUEST FOR COMMENT Jeff As we have discussed for some time now Senators Gramm RTX and Schumer DNY have been drafting federal electricity restructuring legislation with a datecertain approach The one holdup has been the environmental conditionality provision which we have also discussed at length in the past Just late last evening the two Senators reached initial agreement on this section and as such just late this morning both offices sent the language to us for our immediate comment and review Specifically they would like Enrons read on the practical impact of this language by pm EST as they intend to introduce the bill this evening before the Senate breaks for the July th holiday Im sorry for the short turn around but as you know this is the typical situation in DC The language in parenthesis indicates Gramms edits to substitute coalfired vs Shumers NRDCs preference for fossil What is our preference based upon what his means to coal markets and the ability for coal to ramp up or not to ramp up Please provide any written comments as soon as possible Many thanks and please let me know if you have any questions Section Environmental Conditionality a In this section a noncompliant unit means a coalfired electric energy generation unit for which construction was commenced prior to August that does not comply with requirements relating to emissions of air pollutants as determined in subparagraph c b It shall be unlawful for the owner of noncompliant unit to operate such unit in any year at a capacity factor that exceeds the lesser of the average capacity factor for fossil coalfired electric energy generation units in operation in the United States or the average capacity factor for such unit based on information reported to the Commission for the years through c Within six months of enactment of this section the Administrator shall publish emission levels equal to the average emission performance achieved by all electric generating units permitted pursuant to Section and Section of the Clean Air Act and prior to the date of enactment of this section d No later than six months of after enactment the Administrator shall promulgate a list of

<8786652.1075846358094.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jeffrey.keeler@enron.com,2000-04-24 02:46:00,News clipEnvironment Reporter Oil Ethanol Industries Far From Deal On Pending Senate Bill to Limit MTBE Oil and ethanol interests remain at odds as the Senate seeks to limit use of the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE making it uncertain whether the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will be able to craft an acceptable national solution to the problem of MTBE in water lobbyists told BNA April Despite fundamental differences however all sources interviewed for this storyincluding two oil industry officials three ethanol advocates and several other sources active in the legislative process on this issuesaid that it still appeared possible that national MTBE legislation satisfying multiple interests could be developed I dont think were at an impasse one oil industry official said echoing comments by others in the debate I just think its going to take time Whether this means that a compromise can be worked out during this legislative session remains to be seen this official and others said The committee chairman Sen Bob Smith RNH has made MTBE a priority saying that Congress must eliminate the threat of water contamination posed by the fuel oxygenate while being careful to preserve the air quality benefits associated with MTBEmixed gasoline The chairmans view of the issue however is contrary to the view held by the Clinton administration by ranking minority member Sen Max Baucus DMont and by Democratic and Republican agricultural interests in the Senate These forces hold that cornderived ethanol and possibly other renewable fuels should gain a wider market under any legislation addressing the threat of MTBE water contamination The oil industry and Smith disagree with that view Smith Rejects Renewables Linkage When the Clinton administration announced on March its support for a national renewable fuels mandate Smith said the issue of renewable fuels has absolutely nothing to do with eliminating MTBE from our drinking water He repeated this point in a newspaper opinion piece April In addition to gasoline and ethanol advocates several other interest groups maintain an active role in the ongoing debate and Senate committee staff ar continuing behindthescenes meetings with all sides sources said Generally comprehensive MTBE legislation is expected to slash use of the additive without necessarily eliminating it entirely A committee bill also is expected to provide states with the option of waiving the Clean Air Act mandate currently driving the use of MTBE and ethanol another fuel oxygenate At the same time such a bill is expected to include no backsliding language to ensure that air toxics reductions achieved in the eastern United States over the last several years are maintained even if states waive out of the air act mandate Sources said the committee also is weighing possible cleanup liability relief for MTBE producers and enhancements to fuel storage tank clean up programs Heavy Reliance on MTBE MTBE is a highoxygen highoctane gasoline additive that is one of the most heavily produced chemicals in the United States With roughly million gallons of MTBE mixed with gasoline each day in the United States the chemical makes up more than percent of gasoline by volume according to the oil industry MTBE use is driven mainly by the Clean Air Act requirement that all reformulated gasoline contain at least percent oxygen by weight Reformulated gasoline is sold in areas of the country with poor air quality According to the Environmental Protection Agency more than percent of reformulated gasoline production relies on MTBE to meet the oxygen requirement However MTBE smells somewhat like turpentine and has been detected in public water supplies rendering at least a few of those supplies undrinkable The health effects of drinking MTBE in water are little known but the chemical does taste and smell bad according to a February report by the Congressional Research Service RFG programs in Chicago and Milwaukee rely on ethanol for oxygen content in their reformulated gasoline Among other concerns in the legislative debate the ethanol industry fears losing this market if Congress eliminates the percent oxygen requirement in the Clean Air Act to address MTBE concerns one industry representative said There were billion gallons of ethanol mixed into gasoline in according to the US Department of Agriculture USDA chief economist Keith Collins said before the Senate Agricultural Committee April that there are ethanol plants in operation in nearly states Bill Would Ease Percent Oxygen Rule To address water quality concerns Smith has signed on to legislation S that would allow states to lift the percent mandate driving MTBE use Introduced by Inhofe and Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif S would not ban or phase down MTBE outright However this is expected to change when and if the Environment and Public Works committee marks up more comprehensive legislation oil ethanol and other sources said I think theres a growing set of opinion that MTBE either needs to be phased down to historic levels or phased out entirely over a period of some years an oil industry source said Chemical companies that make MTBE disagree and continue to urge an overhaul of underground storage tank programs in order to mitigate water contamination According to one source familiar with the issue Senate committee staff members are considering several legislative ideas that might address concerns of MTBE interests Prospective liability relief from contamination cleanup costs is under consideration as is the idea that MTBE makers should get expedited review of required permits when switching to alternate chemical products In addition the committee may be considering more rigorous regulation of underground storage tanks as part of comprehensive MTBE legislation this source said Daschle Harkin Drafts At least bills have been introduced in the th Congress to address the problem of MTBE in water according to the Congressional Research Service report The report said most bills would either eliminate the Clean Air Act requirement driving oxygenate use or would explicitly ban MTBE Some of the bills would bolster the Environmental Protection Agencys underground storage tank program since leaking USTs are considered the main cause of water contamination This approach is supported by certain MTBE makers who told BNA that water contamination is caused by leaking tanks and not by the highquality fuel additive Additional draft bills are pending introduction including comprehensive legislation by Sen Tom Daschle DSD the Senate minority leader that would significantly curtail MTBE use by while letting states take action before then Daschles billsaid by Baucuss staff to be supported by the ranking EPW committee memberalso would bolster ethanol production through a national renewable fuels mandate expanding national average ethanol use to percent or more over the next years In addition the draft legislation would amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to get states the money they need to implement UST cleanup programs Ethanol supporter Sen Tom Harkin DIowa also is drafting MTBE legislation that he hopes to introduce soon after the Senates Easter recess a spokeswoman said Harkin is ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and supports a renewable fuels standard If crafted in the right way Harkin has said such a standard could result in far more ethanol use than current law Iowa ranks second after Illinois in total ethanol production capacity according to the US Department of Agriculture Nebraska ranks third and Minnesota ranks fourth RFG Market Despite calls for eliminating the percent oxygenate requirement in the reformulated gasoline program ethanol interests said they still support maintenance of the requirement combined with an MTBE ban Such a scenario would leave ethanol to fill the RFG market void doubling ethanol use over three to five years sources said If Congress were to eliminate the percent mandate but institute a national renewable fuels requirement ethanol use also is expected to at least double from current levels However it would do so over a longer period of about years one ethanol source said Oil industry officials as well as Northeast states and some environmental advocates oppose this simple MTBE ban because it would create a de facto ethanol mandate The oil industry also continues to oppose a national renewable fuels standard officials said A representative of Northeast states told a Senate panel April that Smith appeared to be exploring a compromise with ethanol interests considering a national average alternative fuel requirement that would benefit ethanol as well as natural gas electricity and other transportation fuels The Northeast representative Jason Grumet of Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management supports the national average alternative fuel approach since it would offer the ethanol industry market share without requiring the Northeast to use large quantities of Midwestderived ethanol However oil company interests reaffirmed April their longheld opposition to any new fuel mandates saying concerns over MTBE in water should be addressed by eliminating current statutory mandates and not by instituting any new mandates Oil companies are particularly firm in their position given that agricultural states are expected to play a key role in upcoming presidential elections a second oil industry official said It is not simply that the industry opposes new mandatesthough that is the casebut also that an ethanolmandate bidding war might erupt in a year when Republicans and Democrats are vying for Midwestern votes the official said Ethanol Supporters Want Expansion Meanwhile ethanol interests said they will continue to fight for expansion of their product in the RFG market and do not necessarily see a national renewable fuels mandate as a legislative compromise The Clinton administrations renewable standard would require ethanol use initially at current levels of about percent of gasoline The mandate would then expand over years administration officials have said Ethanol is more volatile than MTBE making it more difficult for oil refiners to produce summertime gasoline that meets low emissions requirements for volatile organic compounds This is one reason the de facto mandate is opposed by Northeast states and environmental interests Some of the renewables mandates under consideration in Congress would allow refiners to meet requirements over an annual average enabling them to avoid or reduce their ethanol use in summer No Markup Scheduled Smith staff confirmed only that discussions with oil ethanol environmental MTBE and state interests continue A spokesman said comprehensive MTBE legislation is something were trying to get done quickly but that a bill markup has not been scheduled Discussions leading to a full EPW committee markup of more comprehensive MTBE legislation are important to the legislative process sources said because a bill is not expected to weather floor debate without early support from Democrats and Republicans on the committee as well as from members of the Senate Agricultural Committee I just cant see this getting duked out on the floor said one ethanol lobbyist I think that we the MTBE folks the oil company folks and the environmentalists all recognize that there is mutually assured destruction on the floor According to one source a new version of the bill is expected to push MTBE use down to pre levels over about four years Before the air act amendments required the sale of reformulated gasoline MTBE was used mainly to enhance octane It is unclear whether the bill will somehow prove acceptable to both Democrats and Republicans ethanol

<1730748.1075846367764.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jeffrey.keeler@enron.com,2000-08-23 08:44:00,Re pipeline aftermath Cc Here are some preliminary answers to your questions and I have copied GPG and Government Affairs folks as well to share this information I am currently assessing the situation regarding pipeline safety legislation This week has been very quiet on Capitol Hill as all of the members are back in the states on August recess running for reelection and it is a big vacation week for staffbut heres what I am hearing As you may or may not know we have been been very active this year trying to temper pipeline safety legislation that was fairly reactionary in the wake of last summers liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham WA SENATE In June Senators John McCain RAZ and Slade Gorton RWA led the charge to pass a pipeline safety bill S out of the Senate Commerce Committee and that bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate Because of the hasty way in which S was drafted and passed there was a realization by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the bill could not make it to the floor for a vote until some serious changes were made mostly things that were deal breakers for industry Enron and El Paso were leading the charge and we had a number of Senators backing our efforts to negotiate changes including Majority Leader Trent Lott RMS Kay Bailey Hutchison RTX John Breaux DLA and Sam Brownback RKS From what Ive learned since the accident these Senators are not changing their strategy and are still asking for the same improvements Fortunately most of the changes we were looking to make were fairly technical and not the types of things that would be seriously compromised by the accident Industy was already in the position of having to accept a number of things they never would have if not for he Bellingham incidentthe El Paso incident just reinforces those The biggest potential effect I see from the El Paso accident is an increased effort to pass something before the Congress adjourns in early October The New Mexico Senators are already calling for a floor vote on the McCainGorton legislation and I there will certainly be greater pressure on leaders to wrap up negotiations get agreement from all sides on a bill and move it unanimously through a vote on the Senate floor HOUSE The House is moving a bit more slowly but again Id expect the El Paso situation to expedite things somewhat There were several bills introduced in the House that were not moving anywhere including an identical copy of the McCain legislation introduced by Rep Bob Franks RNJ Franks is now anxious to move legislation as he is running for Senate and would love to take credit for helping out on an issue of national visibility Before the accident House Tranportation Committee leaders on both the Democrat and Republican side were working on a consensus bill that they could introduce in early September and move quickly through the Committee and to the House floor Im told that negotiations on that legislation are moving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly Unlike our experience in the Senate we have had significant input into the bill in advance and expect something that we can live with and something more reasonable than the McCain bill With that said there may be an effort to expand the bill in a few areas because of the El Paso accident so well have to see what kind of hand were dealt in the next few weeks Overall Id expect pipeline safety legislation to be given higher priority when Congress returns after Labor Day In the absence of this accident I would have given it slim odds of passing in the few short weeks until adjournment with appropriations bills taking up most of Congress precious time Now there will be greater pressure to come to consensus and move bills through by an expedited process so that everyone running for election in November can show that theyve done something about this terrible tragedy With that said theres still not that much time to get legislation through so Id say that theres still a chance it may not get done this year If I had to attach a number to it Id say that the El Paso accident improves the chances of legislation going all the way to probably Gas supply to California Ill have to do some more checking in this area and get back to you All Ive heard so far is that the safety questions that remain may slow the speed of restarting flow on the line notwithstanding that El Paso thinks it can have things running again fairly quickly Im sure the power crunch in California will put some counterpressure on but I just dont have good intelligence on this yet With all this said Im on vacation this week and parts of next week finishing up some leave Ive taken for the birth of our new baby daughter so I may not have an additional report for you until early to mid next week If you have questions please respond by email or leave a message on my voice mail at

To Cynthia NRON cc Subject pipeline aftermath Hi Cynthia The commercial officers here are very concerned with the El Paso pipeline explosion in New Mexico We would love to get some input from your group on the following questions if possible What is the status of pipeline safety legislation on the Hill and what is the outlook for action between now and the end of the year What are people from California saying about the added pressure on gas supplies and what are people from New Mexico saying about restarting the flow of gas while safety questions remain These questions come straight from the top and any information you could provide would be very helpful Please write me back or call and let me know ifwhen you think we might be able to get some initial answers Thanks very much Clay

Senator John McCains RAZ pipeline safety legislation S was approved The overall outcome was not unexpected the final legislation contained several provisions that went a little bit further than Enron and INGAA would have liked but there was rigorous debate over issues like States role and mandated integrity measures and close votes on several amendments Senator McCain and other bill proponents like Senator Slade Gorton realize those issues will need to be addressed before the legislation proceeds to the Senate floor The Committee considered several amendments to the legislation McCain substitute amendment Approved by voice vote The amendment substituted the revised Chairmans mark text that was developed over the last several days in place of the original version of S All further amendments at the markup were in the context of this substitute text McCain amendment to Section b on operator assistance investigations Approved by voice vote This amendment attempts to fix language in the substitute text that was problematic to just about everyone in industry and on the Hill because it unconstitutionally forced an operator to choose between exercising constitutional rights to protect himself in a criminal investigation or keeping his job The McCain amendment did not seem to improve things much and many Senators could not understand it Senator John Breaux DLA objected to it and asked that the entire section be deleted and there was some good debate on both sides of the issue In the end McCain asked that the amendment be passed with a promise that he would work with Breaux and others to fix it before Senate floor consideration Sen John Kerry DMA Amendment on Enforcement Approved by voice vote Another confusing vote in which many members did not understand the changes being made but agreed to it on the condition that clarifications be made before Senate floor action Late last night Enron led a group including companies from INGAA and AGA in providing comments to Senator Kerry which caused him to make substantial changes to his amendment before it was voted on at markup including dropping provisions allowing citizen suits and other troubling issues In the end the amendment that passed was acceptable to industry Sen Sam Brownback RKS amendment on Advisory Council Pilot Program Rejected to Brownbacks amendment would have replaced the Advisory Council Pilot Program as proposed in the substitute text with a requirement that already existing technical advisory committees to OPS be required to meet regionally There was a good debate on the issue but Senator Gorton made a strong plea to members that the new Advisory Councils would only be a pilot program and would not have any binding role He also agreed to work with industry on improvements such as representation of pipelines on the councils before Senate floor action Brownback amendment on State Role Rejected to This amendment was written by Enron and El Paso striking language from the bill that was overly broad in suggesting that a State had oversight authority over other activities beyond proper areas like accident investigation constructionrelated activities and inspection There was a heated debate with Brownback and Breaux making excellent arguments for us but in the end we were vote short In fact Democrats switched their votes at the last minute to tip the balance I have already had discussions with Senate staff after the markup indicating that this language will need to be fixed to our satisfaction before Senate floor action Sen Ron Wyden DOR amendment increasing public righttoknow requirements Approved by voice vote This amendment increases the kinds of information that need to be made widely available to the public Because of a state of confusion in which many of the Senators left the room to go vote on the Senate floor there was no opposition voiced to the amendment and it passed without much discussion Breaux amendment on Integrity Inspection Program Rejected by voice vote This was another written by Enron and El Paso that would have removed the bias of substitute text language toward internal inspections and pressure testing and broadened the range of tools that a pipeline could include in an integrity management plan It also would have removed a requirement that any state and local official would have the chance to comment on the plan and receive a response The debate was heated over this amendment with Senator Gorton indicating that he could accept the first part of the amendment removing the bias toward internal inspectionpressure testing but not the second which he felt weakened state and local opportunity to comment on pipleines integrity plans The committee agreed to reject the amendment but work to fix the second part before Senate floor action Procedurally it was a strange markup session A quorum of the Committee members needs to be present to vote on final passage of the bill A vote on the Senate floor came up as Senator Kerry was explaining his amendment and as Senators were leaving Senator McCain very quickly asked that the entire bill be passed on voice vote before a quorum left the room subject to consideration of amendments when they returned The bill was passed before many knew what was happening Of course only about members came back to the room for the rest of the markup so much of the voting was done without full everyones participation or by proxy which had serious effects on the outcome of several amendments As you can see from the notes on many of the amendments there will be an opportunity to fix the legislation before it moves any further Several Senators indicated after the markup that they had voted with Senator Gorton on several of the amendments as a courtesy to him but would not support the bills movement to the Senate floor without serious changes being made One key ally is Senator Trent Lott RMS who supported all industry amendments His control of the Senate floor schedule as Senate Majority Leader will be key in driving changes to the legislation If satisfactory changes are not made the bill will move no further There will also be an opportunity to provide comments for Committee Report language that will accompany the final bill that was passed The report will give explanations of several of the concerns that were raised and provide legislative history that will help clarify areas where there is uncertainty about the real effect of some of the provisions We did have several victories Many of the amendments that were expected worse language from the Administration or Patty Murray legislation were not even offered because of the advance work we were able to do with Republican and Democratic Commerce Committee members and staff We were able to affect a number of changes to the Chairmans mark or substitute amendment before the markup even occured Another interesting note Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison was a complete nonfactor in the markup She is the Subcommittee chair responsible for this issue yet she did not make an opening statement and she did not vote at all on several key amendments of concern to industry We will be working on the where do we go from here strategy in the coming weeks and will report as developments occur Thanks again to all who helped out in preparation for the markup in what was an amazing team effort The technical support of Dave Johnson Colleen Raker and Lou Soldano was extremely valuable Phil Lowrys and Dave Johnsons availability to do key meetings with Senators and staff was critical in our efforts And Dave and I can attest to the fact that Enron was in a leadership role leading up to the markup guiding the efforts of INGAA and others and directly influencing the direction this legislation will take in the coming weeks and months Jeff Keeler

legislation currently moving through Congress Pipeline safety reauthorization legislation Authorization for pipeline safety programs as administered by the US Dept of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety OPS is currently set to expire at the end of FY At the beginning of the th Congress industry was focused on securing a simple two year reauthorization bill that basically extends current pipeline safety programs with some modest increases in funding levels In fact the House Commerce Committee who shares jurisdiction over pipeline safety with the Transportation Infrastructure Committee acted early in to pass a simple two year reauthorization bill HR Unfortunately the issue became more complex from that point A serious liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham Washington that occurred last summer killing several children dramatically changed the debate over pipeline safety Members of the House and Senate from Washington state backed by the governor and numerous state and local officials moved swiftly to introduce legislation that they feel is designed to address some of the shortcomings in federal pipeline regulation that they believe may have allowed the Bellingham incident to occur In the Senate Senator Patty Murray DWA has introduced S which is designed to expand State authority over interstate pipelines in several new areas such as inspection and testing emergency response plans leak detection and operator training and qualification The bill also would authorize a large increase in OPS funding through pipeline user fees to increase the amount of grants to the States allow for hiring of additional inspectors and increase RD for inspection and leak detection technologies The current OPS budget is around million with million from user fees the Murray bill would authorize million in FY which would require a sizeable increase in user fees Senator Slade Gorton RWA has recently decided to cosposnor the Murray bill and will be actively involved in trying to gain Republican support for the bill On the House side Rep Jack Metcalf RWA has introduced a similar bill HR which a number of the Washington representatives have cosponsored Interstate natural gas pipelines have been placed in a very difficult situation The Bellingham incident was a liquid pipeline accident and liquids pipelines generally have less stringent regulatory requirements than natural gas pipelines The Washington delegation has highlighted the fact that deaths and injuries have occurred over the past years related to natural gas pipeline incidents but they fail to distinguish the fact that almost all of those incidents were on LDC systems which ironically are entirely State regulated Only fatalities in that period were naturalgas related and the majority of those accidents were caused by third party damage In short the INGAA crowd is being dragged down by the poor records of the LDCs and the liquid pipelines The calls for more state regulation of interstate pipeline are largely misguided based on the fact that the interstate pipelines under federal regulation have an exemplary safety record In addition OPS is already working on a Pipeline Integrity Rulemaking that would implement a number of additional measures to prevent accidents on federallyregulated pipelines As you mentioned INGAA has not been doing the best job representing us on these issues They have been working in a group effort with API AGA and the Association of Oil Pipelines AOPL to try and deflect the negative claims of the Murray and Metcalf legislation but have not been forceful enough in distinguishing interstate natural gas pipelines positive record from the liquids and LDCs Thus they have given the impression that INGAA companies might be willing to submit to additional regulation that liquids and LDC are under political pressure to submit to due to Bellingham We have been working with other major INGAA companies El Paso in particular to make sure that the perspective and positive record of our natural gas pipelines is heard clearly by the key legislators The odds of these measures S HR passing on their own is fairly slim They will get a great deal of attention however The Senate Commerce Committee held a field hearing in Bellingham Washington yesterday at which Senators Gorton and Murray testified along with OPS and the families of Bellingham victims the press coverage was not good ie USA Today cover story When Pipelines Are Time Bombs These bills or portions of them will likely be offered and considered as amendments to Pipeline Safety Reauthorization legislation as it comes before the House Transportation Infrastructure and Senate Commerce Committee later this year The increased controversy caused by these bills will likely doom efforts to pass a pipeline safety reauthorization bill this year The leadership of the House and Senate Committees will not likely want to face a bitter debate between safety advocates OPS States and industry in their committees in this tough election year While this is probably a good sign there is an increased risk that industry may face some large hurdles in the appropriations process Appropriations Legislation While Members of Congress push for their stand alone bills andor amendments to reauthorization bills the greater danger is that some of these issues will be dealt with in an appropriations context In particular the fact that Senator Slade Gorton is now actively engaged in pushing for extensive pipeline safety reforms is troubling he is a key member of the Senate Appropriations Committee is close to Republican leadership and has a tough reelection fight coming up Senator Murray is also on Senate Appropriations Both are on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee which funds OPS It is quite likely that the Senators will make a push to get increases in the OPS budget for FY that would enable the kinds of reforms contemplated by their standalone legislation more state funding more inspectors more RD Much of this increase would be funded through increases in user fees INGAA indicates that it expects we could be facing increases in the range of from FY There is also the possibility that an attempt will be made to add legislative riders to the OPS appropriations such as requiring OPS to mandate inspections increase operator qualifications or allow increased state authority I would predict that legislative riders can be prevented but it will be very difficult to avoid some kind of increases beyond mere adjustments for inflation in the OPS budget and user fees The reauthorization will indeed receive attention in but our advocacy efforts will clearly need to be focused on the appropriations process in order to minimize the impact on interstate pipeline user fees and prevent other harmful mandates We will continue to work with key members of the authorizing and appropriations committees to ensure that the interstate natural gas perspective is clearly heard and if possible we avoid being dragged down in attempts to impose more strict regulation on liquids and LDCs Please let me know if you have questions or require additional information Thank you

The federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority was put on the defensive at a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing last week as its adversaries mounted an offensive against the power agency for its huge billion debt and unaccountability With a bill S introduced by Sen Mitch McConnell RKy serving as the backdrop the need for changing TVAs role in an emerging competitiv e electricity market was reviewed TVA is one of the biggest power producers in the country and it enjoys certain unfair privileges according to investorowned utilities which are seeking changes to TVA to level the playing field in a competitive electricity market McConnells bill is touted as making TVA more accountable by subjecting the power agency to among other things antitrust laws and to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission McConnell who was present at the hearing questioned TVA on its claim of providing lowcost power and wh y it should not be brought under FERC authority Supporting the position of S Robert Hewett representing TVA Watch a coalition led by Duke Energy and other private utilities decried the privileges TVA is endowed with Hewett said TVA has the ability to set its own wholesale and retail rates is exempt from antitrust laws and makes on ly token payments in lieu of taxes to the local government No other entity in the country even comes close to having this type of authority or license said Hewett Hewett wants TVA to be subjected to antitrust laws and FERC jurisdiction I n addition TVA must be restricted from building new generation capacity and it should not have preferential access to power from other federal facilities at rates below fair market value Hewett recommended Richard Munson executive director NortheastMidwest Institute continued on the same stream as Hewett calling TVA a national problem Munson said TVA s inspector general in a recent report has highlighted TVAs most serious problem its unaccountability Decisions by TVAs board of director s are not reviewed by state regulators or federal agencies and the power agency enjoys a monopoly in its service territory so it is not accountable even to market forces according to Munson Stating that TVA has been propped up by enormous taxpayer subsidies Munson said The giant utility is exempt from hundreds of federal and state laws and regulations it pays no federal or state taxes and it obtains lowcost loans because of Washingtons i mplied support But Mark Medford TVA executive vice president cautioned that proposals su ch as S may risk compromising the lowcost reliable electricity availab le to the Tennessee Valley region Medford said S would place new restrictions on TVA and expand regulation of TVA activities which seems unusual in the context of a discussion of deregulation of the electricity industry Medford also argued against FERC and state regulation of TVA prices and FER C determination of the need for new generation capacity He said responsibili ty for fulfilling those missions is placed on the threemember TVA board nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate Superimposing a higher regulatory body such as FERC to pass judgment on the decision of the TVA board in these areas seems both duplicative and inappropriate Medford also did not think that antitrust laws should be applied to TVA because it would be unfair to TVA ratepayers When a private utility violates the antitrust laws its stockholders bear the cost However governmental entities like TVA have no stockholders and the financial cost s of such penalties have to be borne by the people who are supposed to be served said Medford Medford asserted that investors now hold all of TVAs debt that finances the power program He said TVA debt is neither backed by the federal government nor is it supported by mortgages on TVA plant property and equipment It is secured solely by the financial operation of TVA as well as bond covenants and the provisions of the TVA Act Medford said Also Medford said TVA has been on the path of debt reduction in the last three years bringing down the debt by billion Austin Caroll representing the Kentucky Managers Association a group of municipal and rural electric cooperative utilities did not totally agree with the principles of S though it did want some changes to be made to TVA Preceding the examination of S was a hearing on the nomination of TVA board members Skila Harris and Glenn McCullough Harris served until recently as the executive director of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board managing the work of the Tennessee Valley Advisory Committee which comprises of representatives from groups interested in the future of TVA McCullough previously served on the executive committee of the Mississippi Municipal League and as the director of the Mississippi office of the Appalachian Regional Commission The TVA board of directors has three members serving nine year staggered terms

action on New Source Review NSR regulation and multipollutant legislation so I wanted to summarize some of the important current developments New Source Review EPA was asked to conduct a day review of NSR and come up with recommenda tions for the larger Bush National Energy Plan EPA held several public h earings and solicited public comments which closed July Enron submit ted comments which I sent by email on EPA has indicated that it will report to the President only on impacts of NSR on the power sector on August and delay any specific recommendations for NSR reform until midSeptember Stories in the past few days have suggested that EPAs findings will ease emissions standards on coal utilities Such characterizations are somewhat slanted as they are based on information coming from environmental groups who oppose any NSR reform but there is some substantive merit behind th ese reports as well NSR enforcement over plant modifications has been an extremely contentious issue for electric utilities and many industry sources have been lobbying hard to relax EPA enforcement policy From an administrative perspective this is a relatively easy reform for EPA to tackle it would only requir e a change in guidance and not a lengthy regulatory process or legislatio n As you can see from the attached stories environmental groups are ext remely opposed to this type of action and are using the media very effecti vely to put pressure on EPA against such loosening of NSR enforcement stand ards EPA will likely recommend a number of broader administrative and legislativ e changes to NSR most requiring a longer trip through the legislative or r egulatory process Such changes could include reforms to BACTLAER analys is for new or existing sources relief for cleaner sources or standardizat ion of some of the more arbitrary provisions of NSR Given the longerter m effort required these proposed reforms may be newsworthy but less likel y to have an impact on the power sector in the shortterm Some of the recent complicating issues have been calls from other industry sectors manufacturers refining industrial boilers gas pipelines for N SR relief EPA would prefer to address power sector issues only but may b e politically forced to make recommendations in other sectors as well It is not yet clear what sectors or what issues they will address Possible OutcomesImpacts Large coal utilities have spent a great deal of resources putting pressure on the Administration on the modification enf orcement issues The issue is the easiest shortterm solution to offer fro m a regulatory standpoint so despite environmental group opposition it is likely that EPA will recommend immediate action in this area along with l ongerterm reforms For Enron businesses this means that coal emissions a nd power trading should expect renewed strength in the coal generation sect or as older assets would face less barriers to extending their life Orig ination opportunities plant upgrades capacity increases may increase as customers fears about enforcement actions subside Industrial and gas pipe line sectors may see relief in the modification area as well if EPA decide s to tackle sectors outside just power Particularly on gas pipeline issue s turbine maintenance issues may be clearcut enough for EPA to make a sim ple short term recommendation Multipollutant Legislation Also making news lately were statements by EPA Administrator Christine Whit man indicating that EPA plans to release a proposal to scrap existing emis sions regulations NOx SIP Call Rule Regional Haze SOAcid Rain for a more streamlined multipollutant plan Multipollutant strategies have been discussed for some time but are becoming more newsworthy lately becau se they were included as possible options under the Bush Energy Plan and o ffer potential solutions to NSR reform problems EPAs proposed elimination of existing air programs is not as drastic as it sounds in fact it offers the opportunity to replace confusing overlap ping programs on multiple pollutants that are currently regulated or will s oon be regulated by EPA with a more certain and flexible system Prospects for development of a multipollutant trading plan that reforms NSR are much less predictable however and will require a longerterm legislative effo rt In September we expect to see release of EPAs plan as well as congr essional consideration of several pieces of multipollutant legislation We are working closely with EPA the White House and Congress on these issue s and will continue to keep commercial and corporate groups informed on the progress of multipollutant strategies Unless political dynamics change drastically we would not expect final action on multipollutant legislation this year As the issue evolves we will be in touch with more specifics on the legislation and Enrons strategy If you have questions or would like more information please contact me Jeffrey Keeler Director

in the past few days have suggested that EPAs findings will ease emissions standards on coal utilities Such characterizations are somewhat slanted as they are based on information coming from environmental groups who oppose any NSR reform but there is some substantive merit behind th ese reports as well NSR enforcement over plant modifications has been an extremely contentious issue for electric utilities and many industry sources have been lobbying hard to relax EPA enforcement policy From an administrative perspective this is a relatively easy reform for EPA to tackle it would only requir e a change in guidance and not a lengthy regulatory process or legislatio n As you can see from the attached stories environmental groups are ext remely opposed to this type of action and are using the media very effecti vely to put pressure on EPA against such loosening of NSR enforcement stand ards EPA will likely recommend a number of broader administrative and legislativ e changes to NSR most requiring a longer trip through the legislative or r egulatory process Such changes could include reforms to BACTLAER analys is for new or existing sources relief for cleaner sources or standardizat ion of some of the more arbitrary provisions of NSR Given the longerter m effort required these proposed reforms may be newsworthy but less likel y to have an impact on the power sector in the shortterm Some of the recent complicating issues have been calls from other industry sectors manufacturers refining industrial boilers gas pipelines for N SR relief EPA would prefer to address power sector issues only but may b e politically forced to make recommendations in other sectors as well It is not yet clear what sectors or what issues they will address Possible OutcomesImpacts Large coal utilities have spent a great deal of resources putting pressure on the Administration on the modification enf orcement issues The issue is the easiest shortterm solution to offer fro m a regulatory standpoint so despite environmental group opposition it is likely that EPA will recommend immediate action in this area along with l ongerterm reforms For Enron businesses this means that coal emissions a nd power trading should expect renewed strength in the coal generation sect or as older assets would face less barriers to extending their life Orig ination opportunities plant upgrades capacity increases may increase as customers fears about enforcement actions subside Industrial and gas pipe line sectors may see relief in the modification area as well if EPA decide s to tackle sectors outside just power Particularly on gas pipeline issue s turbine maintenance issues may be clearcut enough for EPA to make a sim ple short term recommendation Multipollutant Legislation Also making news lately were statements by EPA Administrator Christine Whit man indicating that EPA plans to release a proposal to scrap existing emis sions regulations NOx SIP Call Rule Regional Haze SOAcid Rain for a more streamlined multipollutant plan Multipollutant strategies have been discussed for some time but are becoming more newsworthy lately becau se they were included as possible options under the Bush Energy Plan and o ffer potential solutions to NSR reform problems EPAs proposed elimination of existing air programs is not as drastic as it sounds in fact it offers the opportunity to replace confusing overlap ping programs on multiple pollutants that are currently regulated or will s oon be regulated by EPA with a more certain and flexible system Prospects for development of a multipollutant trading plan that reforms NSR are much less predictable however and will require a longerterm legislative effo rt In September we expect to see release of EPAs plan as well as congr essional consideration of several pieces of multipollutant legislation We are working closely with EPA the White House and Congress on these issue s and will continue to keep commercial and corporate groups informed on the progress of multipollutant strategies Unless political dynamics change drastically we would not expect final action on multipollutant legislation this year As the issue evolves we will be in touch with more specifics on the legislation and Enrons strategy If you have questions or would like more information please contact me Jeffrey Keeler Director

any recommendations on New Source Review reform until September when it releases a more complete package of Clean AirMultipollutant reform legislation NSRmultipollutant issues will be in the forefront in September with the release of EPAs plan and congressional consideration of these issues in hearings and stakeholder meetings Enron will remain closely involved in these efforts we have been invited to participate in Senate Environment Committee stakeholder meetings on the topic and we are in close contact with EPA and the White House as they develop their plan Consideration of these issues in a larger package will present an opportunity for reform not only for limited segments of the power sector but for all sources existing and new NSR reform will always be criticized by environmentalists but adding NSR to the debate with multipollutant emission reductions could open avenues for some interesting deals to be cut over NSR revisions and various pollutant cap levels Jeffrey Keeler Director Environmental Strategies Enron CT Office Washington DC office Cell Phone Fearing Backlash EPA To Package NSR Study As Part Of Utility Emissions Reduction Plan Fearing a backlash of criticism EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman has announced that the agency is delaying release of its longawaited study on its new source review NSR program so that it can package the study as part of the Bush administrations proposed threepollutant emissions reduction plan for power plants which is scheduled for release next month Whitmans Aug announcement which came following consultations with President Bush came just three days before EPA was scheduled to release the results of its day review of NSR the Clean Air Act program that requires facilities to obtain permits when installing new or modified emissions sources Our review of the NSR regulation is part of our larger effort to craft a new comprehensive strategy to combat air pollution and I am not prepared to come to any conclusions about one isolated issue before we finish work on our entire proposal Whitman said In recent weeks administration officials have faced a slew of criticism from state attorney generals environmentalists and other critics who have charged that the review would recommend scaling back the program and allow the Bush administration to pardon polluters Whitman has previously said that the administrations proposal to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide SO nitrogen oxide NOx and mercury would set sufficiently strict limits to make NSR and other Clean Air Act requirements unnecessary Whitman pointed to a recent National Governors Association policy calling for NSR reform as justification for the administrations forthcoming effort This bipartisan action by the nations governors provides a firm foundation for consensus and action this fall on this major environmental goal of the administration she said However Whitmans announcement drew strong criticism from environmentalists who charged that the administration was seeking to hide the NSR reforms in its overall emissions reduction plan The administration should not expect that it can hide the rollback of these important clean air protections into an emissions reduction package That would be as obvious as putting a cheap frame on an ugly picture according to the environmental group Clear the Air The group said the NSR program was safe for now adding that the Bush administration should acknowledge that a host of favorable comments submitted to EPA as part of the review should force the agency to admit that the NSR program is an essential element of the Clean Air Act Excerpt from EPA Press Release US Environmental Protection Agency EPA Administrator Christie Whitman announced today that EPA will propose a comprehensive strategy to significantly reduce air pollution and protect public health that will be released in September EPA will incorporate its review of the New Source Review NSR program into this comprehensive strategy and as a result will not release its NSR report this week Whitman spoke with President Bush today about this important proposal Our top priority is protecting public health and the environment and we are in the final stages of developing a comprehensive strategy that will allow us to take the next step forward into a new generation of air pollution controls for the st century Whitman said This fall we will put forward an ambitious proposal that will reduce air pollution from power plants significantly more than the existing system Subsequently we will release the NSR report called for by the National Energy Policy EPA and the White House are working to finalize the details of an ambitious legislative proposal that will set strict limits on utility emissions of the three major air pollutants that affect public health nitrogen oxides NOx sulfur dioxide SO and mercury through the use of an innovative and effective marketbased approach In addition the air pollution reduction strategy will address concerns about the NSR programs effect on energy efficiency and capacity The Administrations proposal will maintain stringent healthbased standards and establish firm mandatory caps on levels of pollution while providing industry with the flexibility to find the most costeffective means of meeting those standards This approach would also significantly reduce the administrative burden on state and federal environmental agencies allowing them to devote limited resources to other programs
