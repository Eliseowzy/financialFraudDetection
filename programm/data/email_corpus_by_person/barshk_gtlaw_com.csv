to whether there are any unacceptable provisions in the draft draft permit or the need for any modifications I also agree with Steve that we should anticipate an administrative challenge to the permit

Raimund Subject RE Draft Notice of Intent Draft Permit and Notice Deerfield B each ERP Steve the document we have received is a draft draft provided for our review prior to FDEP officially sending us the draft for public notice So we have not officially received it and the day clock has not yet started FDEP is reviewing the draft internally and may issue it to us as soon as this week but likely no later than next week The opposition may has difficulty meeting the sufficiency requirement if they file for hearing against this permit in other words if a petition is filed then FDEP may not find it sufficient and may dismiss it accordingly without an administrative hearing The ERP is more difficult than the air permit for a petitioner to show that they may be an affected party with sufficient cause to petition against the permit issuance Based on these considerations the ERP may not be successfully challenged by petition for an administrative hearing There is no wetland dredge and fill activity required at the Deerfield Beach site so a permit from the US Army Corps is not required for the development of this site Sincerely Rand Original Message From mailto Sent Monday August PM To Edelstein Rand Cc Subject RE Draft Notice of Intent Draft Permit and Notice Deerfield Beach ERP Good stuff A few comments The Notice of Intent requires the issuance of public notice within days of receipt of this intent When did we officially receive this Given the administrative hearing for the air permit we will want to issue public notice at the opportune time What newspapers do you recommend for the public notice What newspapers do the DEP recommend Does the US Army Corps of Engineers require a separate permit as mentioned on page of the Permit If so what does this entail Can we accept the General Specific Conditions delineated in the Permit Kerri it appears we need to issue public notice before mid September when do you recommend we do so given the DOAH proceedings Given the track record its fair to assume this permit will be contested and most likely will require an administrative hearing Regards Steve Original Message From Edelstein Rand ENRON

authorization given the relatively short time frame until the Pompano Beach hearing Kay wants to discuss the discovery proposal and I expect that we will be doing so sometime very soon Kay I am

From mailto Sent Monday November PM To Mann Kay Krimsky Steven Jacoby Ben TLAWcom Cc Subject Pompano Beach and Deerfield BeachAir Permitting Update Kay Steve Ben and Debbie I spoke with Martha Nebelsiek today and she indicated that DEP is intending to file a motion for consolidation of the two air proceedings into a single proceeding To that end Martha believes that the proceedings should be heard sometime in January depending upon which of the cases is consolidated into the other Martha believes that consolidation is appropriate now because the permit conditions recommended by DEP are consistent and that for evaluation purposes the DEP considered the sites as one Martha will be filing a motion for consolidation and wanted our position on the proposed consolidation I told her that we would likely oppose such a motion but that I would check with you before finalizing our position Consolidation has its advantages and disadvantages The cases if consolidated may be less expensive to try Yet the hearing in December may be at risk if consolidation occurs In addition the parties are not exactly the same in each proceeding Margate is not a participant in the Deerfield proceeding I need to get back to Martha as soon as possible with Enrons position on the proposed consolidation If she does not hear back from me soon then Martha will likely file the motion and indicate that Enron objects to the consolidation Ryan and I also need to get approval to submit Enrons response to DEPs Change of Position on the Pompano Beach air permit I promised not to file any response last week given the pending settlement negotiations but we need to respond to the Change in the next few days Please advise me of your thoughts on the consolidation Kerri The information contained in this

<4119818.1075861737107.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,barshk@gtlaw.com,2001-11-08 09:33:04,RE DEP Air PermitsConversation w Martha Nebelsiek re Consolidation Related Matters Cc Kay I agree with your comments on the selection of the ALJ The following is our response to your two questions Ryan and I believe that we can set forth a number of differences between the two cases such as the site specific air quality impact analysis required under the applicable regulations the differences in parties to the proceedings the different impacts to the various petitioning local governments depending upon their distance from the facility in question the different phases of discovery that the cases are presently in and the like Nevertheless the foregoing may not be sufficient grounds to preclude the consolidation based upon a minimal delay in the proceedings as we understand that DEP is proposing More importantly we previously expressed our concern with the companys current position in the Deerfield proceeding relative to the proposed Nox limitation of ppm Because DEP has not been persuaded to date to increase the permit limitation to ppm and because Enron did not legally oppose such a condition in the Deerfield permit then Enrons ability to raise such an objection at this point appears to be impaired There may be an argument that Enron noted its objection within the permit comment period which terminated after the deadline for filing any legal objection and therefore Enron noted its objection on the record and no one is prejudiced by asserting its objection within the pending proceeding at this stage since discovery has only just been initiated In light of these circumstances we could advise DEP that Enrons position is that it does not object to the consolidation as long as the trial date is in January and as long as the parties recognize that Enron will challenge the proposed Nox limitation of ppm under backup fuel use conditions with respect to both permits in a consolidated proceeding Please advise me of your thoughts Kerri Original Message From Mann Kay mailtoKay NRONcom Sent Thursday November AM To Krimsky Steven Jacoby Ben Cc Subject RE DEP Air

can get a hearing in January On the consolidation what would we use as a basis for the objection If we dont have a decent basis I dont think we should object On a related issue assuming we are going forward with the fuel oil option on Deerfield how are we going to put the vs issue in play Thanks Kay Original Message From Sent Wed PM To Mann Kay Krimsky Steven Jacoby Ben Cc Subject DEP Air PermitsConversation w Martha Nebelsiek re Consolidation Related Matters Kay Steve Ben and Ryan I spoke with Martha today on the subject referred to above and she advised me of the following DEP is not contemplating a single consolidated permit but an air permit for each of the Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach facilities The petitioning local governments have no objection to the consolidation proposed by DEP no surprises there Martha wants our input as to which ALJ we would prefer to hear the case should DEPs request for consolidation be granted The upside to suggesting Judge Alexander is that we know that he have already reserved his time for a day hearing in January Otherwise we might choose Judge Stampelos based upon the prior comments that we have received from our Tallahassee attorneys although both Judges were considered to be good Martha indicated previously that she is looking for a hearing in January depending upon which ALJ hears the case and his particular schedule Martha advised me that she will file her request for consolidation late tomorrow afternoon I told her as we discussed in our conference call that if she does not hear from me to the contrary then we oppose the consolidation at this time Martha agreed to provide us with the permit language that DEP is proposing in connection with its Notice of Change of Agency Position on the Pompano Beach proceeding as soon as Al Linero completes the drafting and she reviews the proposed permit conditions with him Martha expects to provide us with the proposed permit language next Monday or Tuesday The petitioning local governments have served DEP with discovery I have yet to receive a copy of the discovery but Martha intends to meet with Al Linero this Friday to discuss DEPs response Based upon the foregoing please advise me if you want me to convey any further message to Martha prior to her filing of the motion for consolidation tomorrow afternoon Specifically I am interested in your thoughts on our preference on the Judge that will hear the proceeding if consolidated and whether we have any objection to DEPs filing the motion for consolidation in which she will note our objection As we discussed in our conference call we can assert our position more fully in a subsequent response to the motion for consolidation and can withdraw our objection if we change our mind Thanks Kerri The
