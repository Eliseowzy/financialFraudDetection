<9687774.1075845690746.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mreuter@kslaw.com,2001-04-10 09:49:00,RE FW Comments to Turbine Purchase Documents Cc Ben Since Kay is tied up on a conference call she asked me to summarize the issues raised by Marguerites latest markups The issues are as follows In Section h regarding the Change Order Marguerite has added a rider pursuant to which ENA would be required to cause the Original Purchaser andor the Agent to use commercially reasonable efforts to afford NorSub or its agent or representative upon request of NorSub such opportunity or opportunities to discuss with GE or to consult with GE concerning such matters pertaining to the Turbines andor the Original Turbine Contract as NorSub desires to discuss with GE or to consult with GE concerning and which GE is obligated under the Original Turbine Contract to discuss with or concerning which GE is obligated under the Original Turbine Contract to consult with the Purchaser andor Agent thereunder provided however that each of ENA the Original Purchaser and the Agent shall have the right to be present at and to participate in each such discussion or consultation According to Jerry DeBerry Michael Young raised this concept with Ben and Ben accepted it in principle Please confirm if you are okay with this rider going into the Letter Agreement In Section a Marguerite has added a clause whereby ENA agrees to be responsible for and to pay GE when due and to hold the LLC and NorSub harmless from any damages or indemnification payments which become due and payable to GE on and after the Closing Date as a result of any event occurring or any circumstance arising prior to the Closing Date Since this provision effectively shifts the Change Order risk onto ENA Kay suggests that we only accept the provision if a reciprocal provision is included that allows ENA to terminate the agreement as a result of any event or circumstance that increases the Purchase Amount Do you agree Finally with respect to the LLC Agreement NorthWestern would like to be able to exercise its call rights with relative freedom while forcing ENA to wait until Takeover or before being able to exercise its put rights Neither Jerry nor Marguerite understands why ENA cares when NorthWestern takes ENA out Jerry and Marguerite were working on scheduling a conference call for sometime tomorrow so I will send you an email confirming the details as soon as I hear back from them Best regards Marisa Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday April AM To Young Michael Cc Subject Re FW Comments to Turbine Purchase

that upon the advise of our tax counsel we have adjusted the amounts of the promissory notes to be issued in connection with the transaction in order to maximize the LLCs basis in the Turbines We believe this is consistent with your initial draft of the Letter Agreement Also please note that we have included additional language in Section of the Letter Agreement which provides NorthWestern with the opportunity to consult with GE on matters relating to the Turbines This reflects our understanding of an agreement that had been reached among the parties With respect to the LLC Agreement we would like to discuss with you the following i the timing of the exercise of the Call Right and ii the intent of your proposed language in Section relating to the rights of each Member to act in its own best interests with respect to the Call and Put Rights To that end we propose scheduling a conference call on Tuesday afternoon April Please contact me as soon as possible with a time that is
