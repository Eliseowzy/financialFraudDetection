<12770887.1075843503730.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,burkee@cts.com,2001-05-18 00:46:00,Re Commission OII Hearings Cc with WHP management yesterday and we are still supporting the Comprehensive Settlement of course We have not reserved any time on Tuesday to speak though There is a possibility that could change at the last minute but as some of you might know WHP is currently negotiating the sale of its California assets Things are in limbo to say the least It would be a short terse message from WHP if any I think Mikes suggestion that some of the details have another look should focus towards the Interim Settlement or more specifically the PD provisions as opposed to anything in the CS Even though we can all express our support of the CS it is not being voted on and there is no alternate decision that would even allow that for now But as Mike suggests maybe the Commission can be persuaded that the status quo needs to change in light of todays environment which means the PD has to be changed John Burkholder Original Message From To Cc MSSRcom Tom Beach Sent Thursday May PM Subject Re Commission OII Hearings I have just asked the CPUC for time to speak on Edisons behalf I am still drafting our response just got permissioninstructions from my management We intend to support the settlement but suggest that in light of the delays which have occurred in implementation and the drastic changes which have occurred in Californias energy markets and the infrastructure proceeding that is ongoing in particular how much additional takeaway capacity is required to support the proposed interstate pipeline expansions it may be appropriate to renegotiate some of the details of the settlement andor for the Commission to take additional testimonyevidence Michael S Alexander Southern California Edison Energy Supply and Management ESM fax JeffDasovich enroncom To Tom Beach cc MSSRcom AM Subject Re Commission OII Hearings Enron will very vigorously support the CS and I would hope that we could get as many people as possible to do the same Lets face it Californias gas industry is a mess for the same reasons the electricity industry is a mess despite and perhaps contrary to the substantially more narrow reasoning offered by the Brattle Group The CS is a wellthoughtout welldesigned program for moving forward unlike the interim which takes two steps back Can we split up the names of all the people who signed on and call them and try to get them to show up in support Best Jeff Tom Beach rossbordere To nergycom MSSRcom PM cc Subject Re Commission OII Hearings Watson has asked for time to speak Im planning to continue to support the CS It brings some greater stability and certainty to SoCalGas noncore rates The allocation of backbone capacity might improve shippers certainty of being able to move gas through Topock and Wheeler Ridge In the short term its hard to say how much that might help prices but I doubt that it would make them worse In the longer term if new generation on the PGE and Kern Mojave systems plus the North Baja and Questar lines actually reduce SoCalGas throughput then a SoCalGas citygate market might be pretty competitive Finally the CS removes SoCalGas favorite argument in favor of the peaking rate So what are Edison and Enron going to do Tom Original Message From To MSSRcom Sent Monday May PM Subject Commission OII Hearings I was just wondering what any of you guys are thinking about doing at the Gas OII meeting next Tuesday Are any of you planning on making a presentation If so do you intend to support the settlement as filed or are there modifications you think are appropriate given the way SoCalGas has handled its system in the past few months Michael PS FYI I am out of town so I am not available by phone until Monday Michael S Alexander Southern California Edison Energy Supply and Management ESM fax

<28466152.1075843146395.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,burkee@cts.com,2000-11-13 07:03:00,RequestJeff Hope you survived Halloween up there what a great scene For some reason I didnt get your original memo from last Thursday so I didnt get the attachment Mikes proposal Could you forward that to me please Thanks I hope we can get the same results with PGE That coalition was awesome with SoCal Hopefully I can get WHP as involved again Theyve been low key lately as theyre gearing up Lodi John BETA Consulting Voice FAX Original Message From Amirault Paul To Davies Phil Amirault Paul Sent Monday November AM Subject RE I like the idea in concept but unsure of two things What the right time is to get involved as a group Serious settlement discussion has not started yet and wont before PGE lays out its first proposal expected in December What common banner we would join up under With SoCal the cause was clearly real unbundling For Gas Accord II I dont think a common cause is as obvious Paul Amirault VP Marketing Wild Goose Storage Inc Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday November AM To Subject Greetings Folks As you know the Gas Accord is coming to an end and PGEs trying to figure out where to go from here I would argue that what happens with PGE is equally if not more important as what happens with SoCal As you also know were faced with a retrograde PUC that by all accounts longs for the halcyon days of commandandcontrol regulation As such I think it would be very useful and costeffective to pull together the effective coalition we established in the SoCalGas settlement In that coalition some of us contributed dollars and some contributed experts I think we should employ that approach again I asked Mike Day who I think most agree did a pretty good job of representing us in the SoCal settlement to make a proposal for representing us in the PGE case Mikes proposal is attached Finally if theres anyone else you think we ought to include in our coalition please let me know Let me know what you think Hope all is well with you and yours Best Jeff Jeff Goodin MacBride is willing and able to represent a coalition of endusers marketers and other interested parties in the PGE Gas Accord II proceeding in much the same fashion that it represented multiple parties in the GRI proceeding in both PGE and SoCalGas settlements We would propose to split our monthly billings for legal fees and expenses equally between the parties who agree to join such a coalition In exchange for joining the coalition parties would receive frequent updates on the status of settlement talks and other proceedings participate in conference calls to reach decisions on coalition positions and have the ability to call on the GMSRD lawyers on the case in order to answer specific questions or provide any other useful information I envision using several attorneys for various portions of the proceeding including using associates and paralegals for research and other GMSRD partners with gas experience for preparation of pleadings etc However most of the face to face negotiating including working with Commissioners and advisors as necessary would be done by myself as lead partner on the case I have attached a fee schedule for the GMSRD attorneys who would likely have some involvement in the case Because the majority of this work will be done in these rates reflect our new hourly fees However in an effort to encourage participation in the coalition and because several potential members of the coalition are past or existing clients we propose to reduce our standard fees with a discount for all participants in the coalition With this discount these would be the lowest fees available to any of our clients in the coming year I have not made any type of estimate of legal expenses for this proceeding as it is exceedingly difficult to forecast how protracted the proceedings will be Once we begin participating in the proceeding and we collectively decide how best to proceed in terms of actual participation in the case we can provide frequent budget reports and make more useful budgetary estimates If you require some type of estimation sooner than that please let me know Thank you for your interest in using our services Please contact me directly at if you have any questions Mike Day partner Goodin MacBride Squeri Ritchie Day GMSRD Fee Schedule for Gas Accord II proceedings Michael Day James McTarnaghan Jeanne Bennett Alexandra Ozols Heather Patrick paralegal
