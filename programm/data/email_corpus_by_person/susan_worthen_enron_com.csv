wa s defeated in the House of Representatives on Tuesday The bill was brought up under suspension of the rules in order to avoid possible amendments a procedure which required a twothirds vote for passage The bill fell short by votes with voting for and against Althou gh the McCain legislation imposed a number of new requirements on pipelines t he pipeline industry supported S as the best achievable legislation giv en recent accidents and the possible political climate next year The legislation was defeated in a last minute effort by House Democrats on mor e political than substantive grounds With only a few days remaining in the congressional session the debate will now turn to efforts to possibly atta ch some form of legislation to a fastmoving appropriations bill Industry c an not likely support movement of any legislation other than the Senate bill anything suggested by House Democrats at this point to make the legislation stronger would likely be deal breakers for industry Jeff Keeler will remain active in the legislative process until the issue is resolved MTBE Senate MTBE legislation S which passed the Environment Committee several weeks ago is not expected to move on a standalone basis but we are watching to see if efforts to move all or portions of the bill such as a simple MTBE ban will take place in the various appropriations efforts While we have commitments from various House and Senate leaders that an antiMTBE measure will not be included the powerful ethanol forces are working hard to find a way to pass legislation this year We have avoided inclusion in Agriculture and VAHUD EPA appropriations bills so f ar which were the most likely targets for inclusion We are prepared to counter any last minute antiMTBE amendments with amendments providing transition funding for MTBE producers which a number of Senators includin g ethanol proponents like Tom Daschle have indicated they would not oppose It is most likely that action on this legislation will take place in the ne xt Congress Competitive Intelligence Climate Change Jeff Keeler continues to participate in activities leading up to the COP meeting in November in the Hague The

MTBE Legislation Draft legislation has been released by the Senate Environment Committee that would eliminate the fuel oxygen mandate and phase out MTBE subject to maintaining similar environmental benefits and mandate use of renewable fuels to get the support of ethanol We are working to have provisions included for MTBE producers most likely in the form of some kind of incentives for converting to production of other additives The only possible date that the legislation could be marked up in the Senate Environment Committee is next Wednesday July that is not very likely so consideration of the legislation may slip to September Pipeline Safety There has been a great deal of activity in the Senate and House trying to negotiate solutions that would allow the legislation to move forward this year In the Senate the McCain legislation that passed out of the Senate Commerce Committee must be fixed to industrys satisfaction in several ways before Majority Leader Trent Lott will allow the bill to be taken up on the Senate floor In the House we are working with House Transportation Committee Democrats and Republicans on development of bipartisan legislation which will be much less onerous than the Senate bill that can be introduced and quickly moved through the House Action on both sides will likely take place in September Clean Air State Implementation Plans for NOx

wa s defeated in the House of Representatives on Tuesday The bill was brought up under suspension of the rules in order to avoid possible amendments a procedure which required a twothirds vote for passage The bill fell short by votes with voting for and against Althou gh the McCain legislation imposed a number of new requirements on pipelines t he pipeline industry supported S as the best achievable legislation giv en recent accidents and the possible political climate next year The legislation was defeated in a last minute effort by House Democrats on mor e political than substantive grounds With only a few days remaining in the congressional session the debate will now turn to efforts to possibly atta ch some form of legislation to a fastmoving appropriations bill Industry c an not likely support movement of any legislation other than the Senate bill anything suggested by House Democrats at this point to make the legislation stronger would likely be deal breakers for industry Jeff Keeler will remain active in the legislative process until the issue is resolved MTBE Senate MTBE legislation S which passed the Environment Committee several weeks ago is not expected to move on a standalone basis but we are watching to see if efforts to move all or portions of the bill such as a simple MTBE ban will take place in the various appropriations efforts While we have commitments from various House and Senate leaders that an antiMTBE measure will not be included the powerful ethanol forces are working hard to find a way to pass legislation this year We have avoided inclusion in Agriculture and VAHUD EPA appropriations bills so f ar which were the most likely targets for inclusion We are prepared to counter any last minute antiMTBE amendments with amendments providing transition funding for MTBE producers which a number of Senators includin g ethanol proponents like Tom Daschle have indicated they would not oppose It is most likely that action on this

achievable legislation giv en recent accidents and the possible political climate next year The legislation was defeated in a last minute effort by House Democrats on mor e political than substantive grounds With only a few days remaining in the congressional session the debate will now turn to efforts to possibly atta ch some form of legislation to a fastmoving appropriations bill Industry c an not likely support movement of any legislation other than the Senate bill anything suggested by House Democrats at this point to make the legislation stronger would likely be deal breakers for industry Jeff Keeler will remain active in the legislative process until the issue is resolved MTBE Senate MTBE legislation S which passed the Environment Committee several weeks ago is not expected to move on a standalone basis but we are watching to see if efforts to move all or portions of the bill such as a simple MTBE ban will take place in the various appropriations efforts While we have commitments from various House and Senate leaders that an antiMTBE measure will not be included the powerful ethanol forces are working hard to find a way to pass legislation this year We have avoided inclusion in Agriculture and VAHUD EPA appropriations bills so f ar which were the most likely targets for inclusion We are prepared to counter any last minute antiMTBE amendments with amendments

going forward and a project to assist ENA in a detailed analysis of the effects on power plants and markets in the NOx SIP Call states Kevin Presto who is also responsible for running the peakers indicated that it may be more preferable to sacrifice some of our peaker interests and develop a strategy that supports state and EPA efforts that increase costs as much as possible on our competitors This will be an ongoing strategic effort to add value to ENA Texas Renewable Energy Credit Comments Enron led a group of companies that generate trade and market renewable energy and environmental advocates in filing joint comments on issues related to the implementation of a Renewable Energy Credit REC trading program in Texas Stacey Bolton led drafting efforts on behalf of the group and worked within Enron to coordinate our positions The program is consistent with positions weve taken in that attributes of energy can be traded separately from its energy source The group recommended changes that would lead to consistency and adaptability including comments about what information should be included on the credits label and a recommendation that any environmental disclosure requirements be developed in conjunction with the REC trading protocol Pipeline Safety We continue to monitor the legislative climate following the tragic El Paso pipeline eruption and fire in Carlsbad NM in which people were killed While the widelyheld perception among industry is that the accident will have a negative effect on the legislation information from Capitol Hill continues to indicate that the legislation will not likely become more burdensome there is just a greater likelihood that it will receive attention and an effort will be made to pass something this Congress It is expected that the full Senate may act in the two weeks after Labor Day weekend but that the House still may not be ready to move legislation through committee and to the House floor until later in September INGAA is recommending hiring an outside lobbying firm to assist in efforts going forward due to the thought that many companies will not want to be active or visible in lobbying this issue because of the El Paso accident Jeff Keeler will investigate the climate on Capitol Hill further before Enron signs off on this strategy In addition Stan Horton will be in DC the week of to attend

attendance Mary Schoen pulled the presentation together and addressed financial impacts of the regulations on power markets Jeff Keeler gave background history and future timelines regarding NOx and other air regulation Gus Egnheim and Marc Phillips assisted with technical questions related to control technologies The meeting concluded with a discussion of strategy going forward and a project to assist ENA in a detailed analysis of the effects on power plants and markets in the NOx SIP Call states Kevin Presto who is also responsible for running the peakers indicated that it may be more preferable to sacrifice some of our peaker interests and develop a strategy that supports state and EPA efforts that increase costs as much as possible on our competitors This will be an ongoing strategic effort to add value to ENA Texas Renewable Energy Credit Comments Enron led a group of companies that generate trade and market renewable energy and environmental advocates in filing joint comments on issues related to the implementation of a Renewable Energy Credit REC trading program in Texas Stacey Bolton led drafting efforts on behalf of the group and worked within Enron to coordinate our positions The program is consistent with positions weve taken in that attributes of energy can be traded separately from its energy source The group recommended changes that would lead to consistency and adaptability including comments about what information should be included on the credits label and a recommendation that any environmental disclosure requirements be developed in conjunction with the REC trading protocol Pipeline Safety We continue to monitor the legislative climate following the tragic El Paso pipeline eruption and fire in Carlsbad NM in which people were killed While the widelyheld perception among industry is that the accident will have a negative effect on the legislation information from Capitol Hill continues to indicate that the legislation will not likely become more burdensome there is just a greater likelihood that it will receive attention and an effort will be made to pass something this Congress It is expected that the full Senate may act in the two weeks after Labor Day weekend but that the House still may not be ready to move legislation through committee and to the House floor until later in September INGAA is recommending hiring an outside lobbying firm to assist in efforts going forward due to the thought that many companies will not want to be active or visible in lobbying this issue because of the El Paso accident Jeff Keeler will investigate the climate on Capitol Hill further before Enron signs off on this strategy In addition Stan Horton will be in DC the week of to attend meetings at DOE and Dept of Treasury to talk about the possible impacts of the accident on energy markets and the economy In addition to advising GPG we have been providing information and analysis to ENA Competitive Analysis

wa s defeated in the House of Representatives on Tuesday The bill was brought up under suspension of the rules in order to avoid possible amendments a procedure which required a twothirds vote for passage The bill fell short by votes with voting for and against Althou gh the McCain legislation imposed a number of new requirements on pipelines t he pipeline industry supported S as the best achievable legislation giv en recent accidents and the possible political climate next year The legislation was defeated in a last minute effort by House Democrats on mor e political than substantive grounds With only a few days remaining in the congressional session the debate will now turn to efforts to possibly atta ch some form of legislation to a fastmoving appropriations bill Industry c an not likely support movement of any legislation other than the Senate bill anything suggested by House Democrats at this point to make the legislation stronger would likely be deal breakers for industry Jeff Keeler will remain active in the legislative process until the issue is resolved MTBE Senate MTBE legislation S which passed the Environment Committee several weeks ago is not expected to move on a standalone basis but we are watching to see if efforts to move all or portions of the bill such as a simple MTBE ban will take place in the various appropriations efforts While we have commitments from various House and Senate leaders that an antiMTBE measure will not be included the powerful ethanol forces are working hard to find a way to pass legislation this year We have avoided inclusion in Agriculture and VAHUD EPA appropriations bills so f ar which were the most likely targets for inclusion We are prepared to counter any last minute antiMTBE amendments with amendments providing transition funding for MTBE producers which a number of Senators includin g ethanol proponents like Tom Daschle have indicated they would not oppose It is most likely that action on this

conducted approximately weeks ago Donnie Willmann is meeting with Rene Van Horde BLM Plant Manager to discuss ambient air quality impacts and needed modifications should we purchase the PEP facility MTBE Legislation Draft legislation has been released by the Senate Environment Committee that would eliminate the fuel oxygen mandate and phase out MTBE subject to maintaining similar environmental benefits and mandate use of renewable fuels to get the support of ethanol We are working to have provisions included for MTBE producers most likely in the form of some kind of incentives for converting to production of other additives The only possible date that the legislation could be marked up in the Senate Environment Committee is next Wednesday July that is not very likely so consideration of the legislation may slip to September Pipeline Safety There has been a great deal of activity in the Senate and House trying to negotiate solutions that would allow the legislation to move forward this year In the Senate the McCain legislation that passed out of the Senate Commerce Committee must be fixed to industrys satisfaction in several ways before Majority Leader Trent Lott will allow the bill to be taken up on the Senate floor In the House we are working with House Transportation Committee Democrats and Republicans on development of bipartisan legislation which will be much less onerous than the Senate bill that can be introduced and quickly moved through the House Action on both sides will likely take place in September Clean Air State Implementation Plans for NOx

wa s defeated in the House of Representatives on Tuesday The bill was brought up under suspension of the rules in order to avoid possible amendments a procedure which required a twothirds vote for passage The bill fell short by votes with voting for and against Althou gh the McCain legislation imposed a number of new requirements on pipelines t he pipeline industry supported S as the best achievable legislation giv en recent accidents and the possible political climate next year The legislation was defeated in a last minute effort by House Democrats on mor e political than substantive grounds With only a few days remaining in the congressional session the debate will now turn to efforts to possibly atta ch some form of legislation to a fastmoving appropriations bill Industry c an not likely support movement of any legislation other than the Senate bill anything suggested by House Democrats at this point to make the legislation stronger would likely be deal breakers for industry Jeff Keeler will remain active in the legislative process until the issue is resolved MTBE Senate MTBE legislation S which passed the Environment Committee several weeks ago is not expected to move on a standalone basis but we are watching to see if efforts to move all or portions of the bill such as a simple MTBE ban will take place in the various appropriations efforts While we have commitments from various House and Senate leaders that an antiMTBE measure will not be included the powerful ethanol forces are working hard to find a way to pass legislation this year We have avoided inclusion in Agriculture and VAHUD EPA appropriations bills so f ar which were the most likely targets for inclusion We are prepared to counter any last minute antiMTBE amendments with amendments providing transition funding for MTBE producers which a number of Senators includin g ethanol proponents like Tom Daschle have indicated they would not oppose It is most likely that action on this
