everyone the purpose of CTS Hot Today Futures is to help you prepare for the trading day ahead Nicks Trading Tip of the Day What I wished I knew before trading my first account Trading is more about consistency and money management than method Having a structured trading method helps reduce emotional decision making and that helps you be more consistent Most of the time markets are not trending Therefore having a dynamic portfolio based on a some sort of trend or breakout criteria is essential Winning on a high percentage of trades is important because it lowers your risk of ruin Having a low percentage of winners like most position trading systems have leads to higher risk and a higher degree of difficulty to trade You can make money swing trading and having a profitloss ratio near to It was my belief that I needed a profitloss ratio of to or better that cost me my first account There is no way to predict which markets will be next years big winners Therefore having a dynamic portfolio method like the CTS Futures Selector is key to catching the big moves with a smaller account I wish somebody would have told me about the risk per trade rule and that it can work with a small account You must trade Midams spreads and options but it does work and you must figure out how to keep losses small The rule says that you should keep trade losses to of your account balance For example a account should keep losses to Thats right You can do this through the use of trading the smaller markets with Midam contracts or with spreads in the bigger markets For example you can trade interest rate futures using Midam Notes Eurodollar calls or the MIDAM Nob spread ten year year bonds and get plenty of staying power These are all serious strategies that can pay off handsomely During my first account I was trading full size bonds and currencies and losing per tradeno surpirse the account did not last long I hope you can learn from my mistakes and leverage this wisdom into your

presense of greatness last month Tom Bierovic and I had lunch at my favorite restaurant Sailfish Marina Tom is a futures trader advisor and educator with loads of experience His most recent endeavor was to create systems for Omega Research Over the past three years he has created hundreds of systems and has learned the statistics behind most commonly used indicators Heres what I gleaned from our hour conversation Purely Mechanical trading systems as a group do not work very well over the long term He personally has had more success with using a combination of system inputs with discretion for timing entry and exit He believes strongly in the trend confirmation concept and is writing about it in his new book due out later this year We agreed on the importance of profitloss ratios and balancing our desire for profits with our respect for risk Tom was quoted in Trader Profile in Futures Magazine saying a to profit loss ratio is his target Tom believes that interest rates and currencies are superior trending markets and that trendfollowing systems are likely to do the best in those sectors He commented that the Yen and Swiss were better vehicles than the Pound Tom believes strongly in chart based analysis and classical chart patterns One of his favorite books is still the classic by Edwards and Magee on price patterns In addition to being very knowledgeable I was

everyone the purpose of CTS Hot Today Futures is to help you prepare for the trading day ahead Nicks Trading Tip of the Day What I learned in Islamorada this weekend This past weekend I took a trip to the beautiful Florida Keys After working hard to launch the new website this was just what the doctor ordered The fishing boating and diving were extraordinary and I took away some interesting thoughts that I will share with you The fishing was productive however all my strikes occurred in two distinct locations The first area is called the hump and it is located nmiles SouthEast of our resort Check this outThe hump is located in feet of water and is the size of a football field The bottom comes up hump to just feet in many places Because of the massive upwelling current created the food chain is alive and well Baitfish feed on plankton and the pelagics feed on baitfish and fishermen like me prey on the pelagics Thank God nothing is higher on the food chain atleast while you stay in the boat We caught one lb dolphin on the hump and a couple of other smaller fish is just two hours of trolling The other location is called the East Wall The East wall is located n Miles from shore and is in feet of water They call it the wall because the bottom drops another feet within a couple of miles We caught dolphin highlighted by a lb bull dolphin at the wall in just a couple of hours So what lesson did I learn I caught all these fish by narrowing my focus What I didnt tell you was that I spent about total hours fishing nonproductive water and caught no other fish I think trading is often the same way you need to put yourself in positionin the right market opportunities to profit and then everything else comes easier This is exactly the principle behind the CTS Futures Selector

everyone the purpose of CTS Hot Today Futures is to help you prepare for the trading day ahead Nicks Trading Tip of the Day CTS Hot Today Special Edition Football analogy Wisdom from a CTS customer Every day I read emails from subscribers A typical day will yield several comments about our services All in all it is typically the best part of my day Sometimes I get a comment that also offers personal observations These are often loaded with wisdom directly from a trader CTS Hot Today is meant to convey a little wisdom every day and it doesnt always have to be my own Yesterday a good customer of CTS wrote an excellent testimonial about his experience and then elaborated on his approach with an analogy to the great game of football We asked and he agreed to let us publish his comments and I hope you will enjoy reading a fellow traders wisdom in todays special edition From David Breen Jr CTS customer since In this business its rare to find someone selling subscriptions and services that are worth the money I must say that your service is honest and excellent In addition to your total professionalism I also admire your companies image and style I always look forward to receiving your daily emails I appreciate your bits of wisdom and nononsense approach Some traders may not want to hear about the personal or psychological side of trading which you sometimes write about but its just as if not more important than any other aspect of trading The information strategies methods and wisdom you provide are obviously based on the truth of the markets and not hype or BS Most people dont seem to realize that trading to win is about strategy and trade management Its not about being right or wrong regarding price direction Its not about the best indicator system or method The only thing we have control of as traders is our decisions about trades and capital We cannot predict or control the price line we can only identify high probability setups and then call and execute a play I sometimes compare it to football Smart coaches know the basic keys to winning a championship are a solid running game short consistent swing profits and a great defense always always use stops Winning football teams practice hard backtest and paper trade new theories When theyre in a real game they call plays execute trades based on field position price down time yardstogo volatility and opponent commodity Although they do have their favorite high percentage plays patternsindicatorssystems they dont call the same play every time in every situation against every opponent Winning teams know when to settle for less points and kick a field goal never let a gain turn to a loss and they know when to punt scratch a trade when its going nowhere But most important they never go for it on th down in their own territory violate stops Plays dont work every time win every trade but some plays break out for a touchdown quick windfall profit while other plays result in a loss happens all the time and sometimes they even result in a fumbleinterception for a touchdown gaps or limits But in the end if they have solid coaching trade management skills and use the best players to execute the plays broker with good fills they will win most of their games and have a winning season profitable weekmonthyear Keep up the excellent service and information Best Regards David Breen Jr Much thanks to David Breen Jr for letting us publish his comments I would welcome anyone to write down their words of wisdom and send them in Our CTS community is based on the credo of Traders

everyone the purpose of CTS Hot Today Futures is to help you prepare for the trading day ahead Nicks Trading Tip of the Day Patience Pays One of the most important lessons I have learned in trading is that of being patient Sometimes being patient means stalking a market opportunity for several weeks waiting for a breakout or special criteria to be met Other times patience means letting a stop order work instead of running prematurely Other times it means sitting on your hands with open positions and letting your profits run As many of you know Ive been probing the short side of the British Pound for the last three months Finally all the patience and attention to detail is paying off We are short a full British Pound contract from in the CTS Bond and currency trader and long July put in the

everyone the purpose of CTS Hot Today Futures is to help you prepare for the trading day ahead Nicks Trading Tip of the Day Trade interest rates and currencies different than tangible commodity markets Ever since interest rate and currency futures were launched back in the early eighties and late seventies respectively they have proven themselves to be superior trending vehicles Why is this Is there a rational explanation that makes good sense In my opinion its because of the broad universe of decisionmaking minds and the slave role the futures play to a much larger cash market Think about it the whole world participates in the pricing of currencies hours a day days a week When a new trend emerges you have individuals companies and governments that are impacted and it may take months to unfold before a trend pauses significantly The same can be said for interest rate futures Compare them to tangible commodity markets and youll quickly see a huge fundamental difference For example take the grains for instance Youve got a handful of big commercial players like Cargill ADM GPC and a several large commodity funds and then thousands of small speculators The funds and speculators react to price trends and momentum and pretty much see the same things within a one to two day period The commercials all have access to the same fundamental data and act quickly move in concert to hedge News such as weather forecasts and technical factors are quickly discounted and then theres nothing left to drive the trend You then get some profit taking or light hedging coming in and you get a volatile market that oscillates above and below its day ma I recommend trading the currencies and interest rates on a longer term position trading basis utilizing some form of a lagging exit The CTS TrendSetter has proven this technique effective over the past years And by the way CTS TrendSetter is now included in our new GOLD package on ctsTradercom On the other hand when trading other markets I like to use a swing trading approach designed to take profits at targets The other dimension thats critical is aiming for a high percentage of winners Since these markets rarely sustain big tradeable moves it pays to take profits after short term swings which leads to a high percentage of winners This inturn lowers the risk of having a large consecutive losing streak and that leads to longevity I like this approach so much that we built a dedicated Swing Trader advisory service just for Bond Currency Trading Food for thought Lets get ready for a great week N PS Have you

everyone the purpose of CTS Hot Today Futures is to help you prepare for the trading day ahead Nicks Trading Tip of the Day Develop your own favorite Indicators Every trader has his or her favorite indicators much like a bass pro has favorite lures and color combinations In my opinion it is very important to develop confidence and a mastery of a few good indicators before attempting to learn too many A powerful lesson Ive learned is the importance of keeping my trading method simple When I keep things simple it makes it easier to understand my results Theres nothing better than to completely understand your method to a point of mastery Many positive things including a deeper conviction in your trading will start to emerge I have complete confidence in this approach Utilize the CTS Futures Selector as a trend condition to select the futures markets to trade I trade all three categories Utilize daily and hourly stochastics for setting up the trade I look for trend confirmation signals as a primary setup condition Elliott wave counts are utilized for timing entries and establishing price targets The wave counts are done by me personally and give me a road map structure to follow for the day period hourly week period daily N Key Technical Developments close of Wow talk about a dead cat bounce Have you seen what Gold has done lately A break below support near opens the door for a
