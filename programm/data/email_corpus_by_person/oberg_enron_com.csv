together under the tutelage of Dr Peter Bishop Chair Studies of the Future Program University of Houston to create scenarios of possible futures and their impacts on Enron You once said I guarantee that if there is one thing Enron thinks about it is what well do in the future ESpeak With that in mind you might find the following of interest our ideas and thoughts about Enron and the future The context created for envisioning possible futures for Enron was based upon our opinion of Enrons core capability our ability to effectively exploit discontinuities in the marketplace Enron has successfully exploited discontinuities created by pipeline deregulation resulting in the creation of Enron the Internet resulting in electronic trading and online business activitiesportalsexchanges and telecom deregulation resulting in bandwidth trading Since Enron is so adept at this we focused our activity specifically on identifying potential future discontinuities and their implications to Enron These are our conclusions Future Rock Around the Clock Description Anytime you want it anywhere you want it capability to transact businessto do work DiscontinuityTrends Builds on discontinuities created by the Internet and current technology trends of convergence increased ubiquity wireless and miniaturization Enron In This Future Is fully and entirely networked primary revenue generation occurs via the communication wires Business ops rock around the clock hours a day seven days a week days a year Employees are fully networked and fully connected giving employees the choice of when and where to work Office space is no longer an issue because the employee IS the office Employee uncertainties exist about privacy lack of interpersonal relationships and wireless chains Wildcards Major information systems disruption global completely shuts down business ops Enron wires unknowingly become facility for international wire fraud and money laundering Future Not in My Region You Dont Description The return of regional protectionism and increased government interference Globalization is seen as too overpowering prompting regions to fight for a return of power and local sovereignty The result is strong regional trading and political blocks that wield much influence Their first action restrictions on international business activities DiscontinuityTrends Contrary to discontinuities created by the fall of communism and trends related to globalization and eroding boundaries corresponds with current trend related to increasing numbers of regional economic unions EU CIS ASEAN Mercosur NAFTA etc Enron In This Future Is ordered by international authorities to dispose of nonUS based assets at a loss and is forced to vacate foreign countries Retrenching back into the US occurs Enrons competition becomes increasingly intense and vicious as other multinationals retrench as well This increased competitiveness occurs at the same time collective groupindustry action is needed to counteract the action of the regional blocks leaving Enron and others struggling to find a balance Future Regulation Rerun Description Power and telecom reregulation occurs DiscontinuitiesTrends Contradictory to current global trends toward privatization of government services supported by social and political reaction to CA style market failures perceived decline of competition due to provider consolidation perceived supply issues with water gas oil Enron In This Future Goes incognito taking on a new identity Governments seek to nationalize our assets Wildcard propelled and facilitated by increased regionalism and protectionism Not in My Region You Dont Future The Taxman Cometh Even to Cyberspace Description Internet commerce has become so big taxing authorities can no longer resist taxes are levied on all Internet transactions DiscontinuitiesTrends Corresponds with current discussion by US and others regarding Internet taxing corresponds with the increasing power of the Internet as a purchasing mechanism Enron In This Future All of Enrons online transactions are now being taxed The volume of transactions still remains high record keeping becomes a nightmare Wildcards Tax imposed is retroactive government cannot track flow of funds and ability to tax accurately is ineffective Future Enrons New Corporate DNA Description rapid advances in biotech solutions lead to trading opportunities in biological commodities DiscontinuitiesTrends Corresponds with recent technological advancements in genome mapping and sequencing and cloning increased politicalsocial discussion regarding bioethics increased businesssocialpolitical discussion regarding biobased intellectual property rights Uncertainties exist regarding the effect of biotech on human raceevolution Enron In This Future Is the first biological commodities trader in the world Focus is shifted from energy into the biotech realm Move clearly positions Enron as a company of the BioTech Century Enron structures the new biomarket and creates new types of biocommodities paper Biotech trading requires a new type of trader with life sciences background Enron forms relationships with medical nursing and other biobased programs for recruitment Wildcards biotech terrorism worldwide epidemics social opposition Historically discontinuities such as these favor smaller companies because they are inherently quicker to respond As Enron grows we become more vulnerable to rapid market changes because it takes longer for us to sense them and to react While none of these discontinuities is certain of course there is merit in understanding they may occur so Enron can sense them and be prepared to respond early to the new opportunities they may offer Of the futures this group constructed Enrons New Corporate DNA is our most interesting and merits further flushing for details Im sure this group could do that well should you be interested There could be significant opportunity for Enron in the biotech trading future Regards Amy Oberg EES Mgr CI Future Foresight MS Studies of the Future Contributors Adams Gerald EECC Odenthal Laura EBS Cruz Magdalena
