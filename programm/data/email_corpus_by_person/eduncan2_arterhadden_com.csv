user assumed to be UCCSU and direct access provider ENRON which was sent earlier today to Susan Mara EWD Inline attachment follows From EDuncanArterHaddencom To Mara Susan OENRONOUNACNRECIPIENTSCNSMARA Date Monday September GMT Subject Will do EWD Mara Susan SusanJ NRONcom PM Can you please email the people on the list I sent you so I dont have to keep forwrding your messages Thanks Original Message From Ed Duncan mailtoEDuncanArterHaddencom Sent Monday September PM To Mara Susan MSSRcom Cc Lin Meyer Subject RE Revised Petition and Points and Authorities I am attaching the Joint Petition which assumes that a direct access customer joins Enron The draft is considerably improved over the draft sent yesterday but it does not take in the comments below These will be reviewed and integrated into the next draft I am very concerned about the exhaustion of remedies problem The jurisdictional statute is PUC section a This provision suggests that an aggrieved party must seek a rehearing before the PUC before seeking review by the Supreme Court A request for rehearing must be made within days after the PUC acts but there is no time within which the PUC must act If the PUC agreed to stay the Order then it seems clear that a rehearing must be sought before applying to the Supreme Court If the PUC refuses the stay request then there is a good argument that one of the exceptions to the exhaustion of remedies would apply This will require that one or all of the Petitioners request a stay by the PUC Douglass indicates that a stay would be unusual and that such requests normally are not made In this case it is probably necessary to circumvent the exhaustion issue EWD JBennett MSSRcom AM Sue I have reviewed the Petition and associated Memorandum A couple of general comments We make the point throughout page is the first time that the Commissions action retroactive suspension will result in a windfall to the UDCs as they will be paid for services provided by Enron and other ESPs It is not clear to me that we can make this argument The commissions order does not indicate that the ESPs have to pay the UDCs the amounts that they have received from their direct access customers for the past two months for energy procurement The commission could just as easily decide that although customers who entered into DA contracts after July are no longer allowed to continue on DA they will not go back and undo transactions that have already occurred In the section of the memorandum discussing why the petition is properly before the court Section IV we are discussing why an application for rehearing is unnecessary We state that in this case a rehearing would be superfluous and unnecessary as there are no new legal arguments and no additional evidence to be presented Such argument appears to run counter to our contentions that because of the lack of hearing in this proceeding the Commissions decision lacks the support it needs or on the flip side denied us the opportunity to put on evidence to show the suspension of direct access was unnecessary In section VI e of the Memorandum arguing that the impairment of contracts ordered by the Commission is not reasonable or appropriate we state that the Commissions motive is not the announced purpose that its purpose instead is malevolent as illustrated by the rhetoric directed at out of state energy companies I dont think such an argument adds anything and although it maybe true at this stage it probably is not a good idea to assert that the Commission is purposely hurting the state to get back at the out of state energy companies Jeanne Original Message From Mara Susan mailtoSusanJ NRONcom Sent Monday September AM To Kaufman Paul Subject FW Revised Petition and

Authorities Attached is the revised Petition and Points and Authorities the Sept Draft This draft has not been redlined because the changes and additions are extensive Future revisions will be redlined This draft will be revised to clarify the arguments toi nclude page references to the exhibits to include missing authorities and to eliminate typos etc The argument is that the Commission
