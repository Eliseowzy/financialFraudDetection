<21784827.1075853923368.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bjackson@sswpc.com,2000-12-13 01:08:00,FW The Gospel in a nutshellbut truthful Subject The Gospel in a nutshell The day is over you are driving home You tune in your radio You hear a little blurb about a little village in India where some villagers have died suddenly strangely of a flu that has never been seen before Its not influenza but three of four people are dead and its kind of interesting and they are sending some doctors over there to investigate it You dont think much about it but on Sunday coming home from church you hear another radio spot Only they say its not three villagers its villagers in the back hills of this particular area of India and its on TV that night CNN runs a little blurb people are heading there from the disease control center in Atlanta because this disease strain has never been seen before By Monday morning when you get up its the lead story For its not just India its Pakistan Iran Afghanistan and before you know it youre hearing this story everywhere and they have coined it the mystery flu The President has made some comment that he and everyone are praying and hoping that all will go well over there But everyone is wondering How are we going to contain it Thats when the President of France makes an announcement that shocks Europe He is closing their borders No flights from India Pakistan or any of the countries where this thing has been seen And thats why that night you are watching a little bit of CNN before going to bed Your jaw hits your chest when a weeping woman is translated from a French news program into English Theres a man lying in a hospital in Paris dying of the mystery flu It has come to Europe Panic strikes As best they can tell once you get it you have it for a week before you know it Then you have four days of unbelievable symptoms And then you die Britain closes its borders but its too late South Hampton Liverpool North Hampton and its Tuesday morning when the President of the United States makes the following announcement Due to a national security risk all flights to and from Europe and Asia have been canceled If your loved ones are overseas Im sorry They cannot come back until we find a cure for this thing Within four days our nation has been plunged into an unbelievable fear People are talking about What if it comes to this country And preachers on Tuesday are saying Its the scourge of God Its Wednesday night and you are at a church prayer meeting when somebody runs in from the parking lot and says Turn on a radio turn on a radio And while the church listens to a little transistor radio with a microphone stuck up to it the announcement is made Two women are lying in a Long Island hospital dying from the mystery flu Within hours it seems this thing just sweeps across the country People are working around the clock trying to find an antidote Nothing is working California Oregon Arizona Florida Massachusetts Its as though its just sweeping in from the borders And then all of a sudden the news comes out The code has been broken A cure can be found A vaccine can be made Its going to take the blood of somebody who hasnt been infected and so sure enough all through the Midwest through all those channels of emergency broadcasting everyone is asked to do one simple thing Go to your local hospital and have your blood type taken Thats all we ask of you When you hear the sirens go off in your neighborhood please make your way quickly quietly and safely to the hospitals Sure enough when you and your family get down there late on that Friday night there is a long line and theyve got nurses and doctors coming out and pricking fingers and taking blood and putting labels on it Your spouse and your kids are out there and they take your blood type and they say Wait here in the parking lot and if we call your name you can be dismissed and go home You stand around scared with your neighbors wondering what in the world is going on and if this is the end of the world Suddenly a young man comes running out of the hospital screaming Hes yelling a name and waving a clipboard What He yells it again And your son tugs on your jacket and says Daddy thats me Before you know it they have grabbed your boy Wait a minute Hold on And they say Its okay his blood is clean His blood is pure We want to make sure he doesnt have the disease We think he has got the right type Five tense minutes later out come the doctors and nurses crying and hugging one another some are even laughing Its the first time you have seen anybody laugh in a week and an old doctor walks up to you and says Thank you sir Your sons blood type is perfect Its clean it is pure and we can make the vaccine As the word begins to spread all across that parking lot full of folks people are screaming and praying and laughing and crying But then the grayhaired doctor pulls you and your wife aside and says May we see you for a moment We didnt realize that the donor would be a minor and we needwe need you to sign a consent form You begin to sign and then you see that the number of pints of blood to be taken is empty Hhhow many pints you ask And that is when the old doctors smile fades We had no idea it would be a little child We werent prepared We need it all But but I dont understand Hes my only son We are talking about the world here Please sign We we need it all But cant you give him a transfusion If we had clean blood we would Please will you please sign In numb silence you do Then they say Would you like to have a moment with him before we begin Could you walk back Could you walk back to that room where he sits on a table saying Daddy Mommy Whats going on Could you take his hands and say Son your mommy and I love you and we would never ever let anything happen to you that didnt just have to be Do you understand that And when that old doctor comes back in and says Im sorry weve got to get started People all over the world are dying Could you leave Could you walk out while he is saying Dad Mom Dad Why why have you forsaken me Why have you left me And then next week when they have the ceremony to honor your son for the sacrifice of ONE life in order that the world may live and some folks sleep through it other folks dont even show up because they have better things to do and some folks come with a pretentious smile and just pretend to care and do not truly value the height and weight of such a great sacrifice Worst some even come in protest of the great sacrifice that the Father has made in giving the life of His only SON Would you want to jump up and say EXCUSE ME MY SON DIED FOR YOU DONT YOU EVEN CARE OR EVEN UNDERSTAND THE SACRIFICE THAT HAS BEEN MADE FOR YOU DOES IT MEAN NOTHING TO YOU DOES HIS LIFE AND HIS DEATH MEAN NOTHING TO YOU I wonder is that what GOD IS SAYING TO ALL OF US MY SON DIED FOR YOU DOES IT MEAN NOTHING TO YOU DONT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I CARE FOR YOU TO HAVE MADE SUCH A GREAT SACRIFICE THAT YOU MAY LIVE Father GOD seeing it from Your eyes should break our hearts and cause us to turn and repent Maybe now we can begin to comprehend the great love you have for us So thats the gospel in a nutshell You have a choice You can either spread it or delete it MERRY CHRISTmas PLEASE REMEMBER THE LIFE DEATH AND RESURECTION OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST JESUS DIED FOR YOU AND HE ROSE AGAIN THAT YOU MAY LIVE IN HIMTHE CHOICE TO ACCEPT HIS LIFE DEATH AND RESURRECTION IS YOURSAND YOURS ALONE

tune in your radio You hear a little blurb about a little village in India where some villagers have died suddenly strangely of a flu that has never been seen before Its not influenza but three of four people are dead and its kind of interesting and they are sending some doctors over there to investigate it You dont think much about it but on Sunday coming home from church you hear another radio spot Only they say its not three villagers its villagers in the back hills of this particular area of India and its on TV that night CNN runs a little blurb people are heading there from the disease control center in Atlanta because this disease strain has never been seen before By Monday morning when you get up its the lead story For its not just India its Pakistan Iran Afghanistan and before you know it youre hearing this story everywhere and they have coined it the mystery flu The President has made some comment that he and everyone are praying and hoping that all will go well over there But everyone is wondering How are we going to contain it Thats when the President of France makes an announcement that shocks Europe He is closing their borders No flights from India Pakistan or any of the countries where this thing has been seen And thats why that night you are watching a little bit of CNN before going to bed Your jaw hits your chest when a weeping woman is translated from a French news program into English Theres a man lying in a hospital in Paris dying of the mystery flu It has come to Europe Panic strikes As best they can tell once you get it you have it for a week before you know it Then you have four days of unbelievable symptoms And then you die Britain closes its borders but its too late South Hampton Liverpool North Hampton and its Tuesday morning when the President of the United States makes the following announcement Due to a national security risk all flights to and from Europe and Asia have been canceled If your loved ones are overseas Im sorry They cannot come back until we find a cure for this thing Within four days our nation has been plunged into an unbelievable fear People are talking about What if it comes to this country And preachers on Tuesday are saying Its the scourge of God Its Wednesday night and you are at a church prayer meeting when somebody runs in from the parking lot and says Turn on a radio turn on a radio And while the church listens to a little transistor radio with a microphone stuck up to it the announcement is made Two women are lying in a Long Island hospital dying from the mystery flu Within hours it seems this thing just sweeps across the country People are working around the clock trying to find an antidote Nothing is working California Oregon Arizona Florida Massachusetts Its as though its just sweeping in from the borders And then all of a sudden the news comes out The code has been broken A cure can be found A vaccine can be made Its going to take the blood of somebody who hasnt been infected and so sure enough all through the Midwest through all those channels of emergency broadcasting everyone is asked to do one simple thing Go to your local hospital and have your blood type taken Thats all we ask of you When you hear the sirens go off in your neighborhood please make your way quickly quietly and safely to the hospitals Sure enough when you and your family get down there late on that Friday night there is a long line and theyve got nurses and doctors coming out and pricking fingers and taking blood and putting labels on it Your spouse and your kids are out there and they take your blood type and they say Wait here in the parking lot and if we call your name you can be dismissed and go home You stand around scared with your neighbors wondering what in the world is going on and if this is the end of the world Suddenly a young man comes running out of the hospital screaming Hes yelling a name and waving a clipboard What He yells it again And your son tugs on your jacket and says Daddy thats me Before you know it they have grabbed your boy Wait a minute Hold on And they say Its okay his blood is clean His blood is pure We want to make sure he doesnt have the disease We think he has got the right type Five tense minutes later out come the doctors and nurses crying and hugging one another some are even laughing Its the first time you have seen anybody laugh in a week and an old doctor walks up to you and says Thank you sir Your sons blood type is perfect Its clean it is pure and we can make the vaccine As the word begins to spread all across that parking lot full of folks people are screaming and praying and laughing and crying But then the grayhaired doctor pulls you and your wife aside and says May we see you for a moment We didnt realize that the donor would be a minor and we needwe need you to sign a consent form You begin to sign and then you see that the number of pints of blood to be taken is empty Hhhow many pints you ask And that is when the old doctors smile fades We had no idea it would be a little child We werent prepared We need it all But but I dont understand Hes my only son We are talking about the world here Please sign We we need it all But cant you give him a transfusion If we had clean blood we would Please will you please sign In numb silence you do Then they say Would you like to have a moment with him before we begin Could you walk back Could you walk back to that room where he sits on a table saying Daddy Mommy Whats going on Could you take his hands and say Son your mommy and I love you and we would never ever let anything happen to you that didnt just have to be Do you understand that And when that old doctor comes back in and says Im sorry weve got to get started People all over the world are dying Could you leave Could you walk out while he is saying Dad Mom Dad Why why have you forsaken me Why have you left me And then next week when they have the ceremony to honor your son for the sacrifice of ONE life in order that the world may live and some folks sleep through it other folks dont even show up because they have better things to do and some folks come with a pretentious smile and just pretend to care and do not truly value the height and weight of such a great sacrifice Worst some even come in protest of the great sacrifice that the Father has made in giving the life of His only SON Would you want to jump up and say EXCUSE ME MY SON DIED FOR YOU DONT YOU EVEN CARE OR EVEN UNDERSTAND THE SACRIFICE THAT HAS BEEN MADE FOR YOU DOES IT MEAN NOTHING TO
