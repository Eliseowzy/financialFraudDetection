should reduce the number of names from a global standpoint now while we can The routing portion of the workspace seems to work well I agree but the major issues lie with the confirmation side of it On another note it seems I am duplicating work here ie I am using buildroute transferring to excel to get the fontcolors etc then back to the workspace Well seeIll hit it again next week Thanks for all your documented inputit sure helps CB Original Message From Semperger Cara Sent Friday July PM To Atta Asem Smith Will Cc Bentley Corry Poston David Williams III Bill Subject Continuing testing of Preschedule Workspace Path Confirmation and Path Cut software I am working in the target date of June th Today I added schedules from Palo Verde and the entire MidC sheet to the testing group Once COB is added we will have pretty much an average daily volume Here is my attached worksheet for Mid C File MidCJunepsc In Preschedule Workspace I added Palo Verde to the group of deals imported and ran a total of lines into the Path confirmation The rest of the sheet was all bookouts and so I marked them for routing only I do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation This will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for Real Time and Settlements I would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up as the lists can be long and I have to make notes on what is wrong Also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time We currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths This would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet instead of cleaning up afterwards Routing functionality question If we change a delivery point in scheduling BPA NW delivered gets moved and changed every day do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point These types of deals route now I would like to duplicate that existing functionality I did get an error message on those lines Capability not supported deal has multiple delivery points Please see the attached sheet there is a batch of them line thru but it is all deals that are our BPA Northwest Delivered The routing speed is EXCELLENT One second per line or less all the way in Portland on Local Enpower The megawatts also appear to split properly between mismatched deal amounts this is very encouraging My Palo data was corrupted so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points My plan is to attack the Alias stuff from a different angle We are going to work with the team that sets the Enpower short name to something that is workable I would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that Enpower short name In Path Confirmation The early sorting looks good things look very versatile and useable Yesterday I identified several problems The entire path needs to be shown in Both counterparty paths Currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp The Alias list is not functioning properly The Enpower Long name needs to be shown in the Collapsed counterparty view along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp Confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch not pulling up each deal line by line Today I am finding the following When a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view the system blows away the schedule term and the Delivery point These fields have to be repopulated before saving can occur I am not allowed to sort by Global ID even though global IDs are populated there My idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section no globals go in another section and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers just like the phys vs non phys Pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over minutes This is to long to be practical in production for real time I would like to see this time go to seconds or less All paths are showing up as being cut cut checkbox checked even though none have been cut yet The grey on grey color scheme is not going to work but that is a little thing Lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable Variations of the beige color are easier to read The path cut button and dialog boxes I think are going to need alot of work It looks like I will have to do all the Enpower work first and then populate the cut This is a bit different than we discussed My plan is to take this as far as I can and then hand it over to Bill Williams III and his group for final tweaking I also cannot sort by tag number We need that Thank you all for your work on this it is really looking good I have to schedule on Monday but will jump right back in when I am finished with daily tasks Cara
