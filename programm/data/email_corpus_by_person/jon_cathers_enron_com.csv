<8147472.1075857270748.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jon.cathers@enron.com,2000-12-04 03:13:00,Question Cc What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups and are there limitations during startups Normally there is a short period during startup when the NOx goes to approximately ppm This is very short in duration and occurs while the gas turbine is loading Our site is permitted to normally operate between turbine load These emissions have subsided within the few minutes required to attain load Our permit constraints require that we do not exceed our emissions limits on a hour rolling avarage Therefore these shortterm startup emissions are not an issue CO is a calculated value I do not have shortterm CO numbers at present However I dont believe they are at issue since they are related to excess air which is pretty high during startup There is a condition called leanlean firing which can and has occured from time to time A transition takes place above MW when the nozzle gas arrangement normally goes to a firing state called premix steady state If this transition fails for some reason the machine goes into a leanlean state and the NOx level can rise to ppm The turbine activates and operator alarm when this happens We can count the number of occurances that this has happened on one hand at Caledonia When this conditions occurs the operators correct the condition by reducing the load to about MW and then increase the load again Typically this resolves the faulty transition and it configures the nozzles correctly on the second attempt Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site No industrial stormwater permit is required at Caledonia In Caledonia what is the custom fuel sampling schedule The fuel sampling schedule for both sulphur content and heating value at Caledonia is once per month Regards Pat Cathers Forwarded by Jon CathersCorpEnron on AM Benjamin CT AM To Jon nron cc Subject Question Jon Here are some more questions regarding the Caledonia plant Your assistance with these questions would be greatly appreciated Please send your answers back to me when completed Again thank you for your help Regards Ben Forwarded by Benjamin RogersHOUECT on AM Don Miller AM To Benjamin CT cc Subject Question Forwarded by Don MillerHOUECT on AM Tang David inergycom on PM To cc Whitehead Robert inergycom Hoyos Sergio Chaney Tom inergycom Vivar Art inergycom Subject Question More Questions Both Plants What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups and are there limitations during startups Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site Caledonia In Caledonia what is the custom fuel sampling schedule Brownsville What is the agencys response to the Enron letter regarding the nd stormwater NOV Has there been any further action by the agency since the st stormwater NOV was never responded to One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland Was that during construction only or is it ongoing Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping issue
