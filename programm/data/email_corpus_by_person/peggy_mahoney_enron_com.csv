BDeregulationB Aug Dow Jones Online News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc CHICAGO Dow Jones BElectricityB BderegulationB has suffered a setback in California as the state grapples with short supply and rising prices But other states are pushing ahead with opening their BpowerB markets to competition saying their approach should avoid the problems plaguing the state which led the nation down the BderegulationB path four years ago California has seen its BpowerB market roiled by heat waves that left the state scrambling to meet demand and by soaring prices in San Diego and southern Orange County the first region of the country to have its BpowerB market completely BderegulatedB California is giving deregulation a bad name said Texas state Sen David Sibley a Republican who helped craft the bill to deregulate that states power industry But I still feel good about the bill we passed I feel even better about it Deregulation backers outside of California said that states experience has been sullied by two basic shortcomings insufficient power generation to cover the states demand and the exposure of retail customers to market rates before a competitive retail market had emerged By contrast Texas expects to have plenty of power generation on hand when it opens its retail power markets to competition on Jan Unlike California where uncertain market conditions local opposition and until recently insufficient power prices have kept power plant developers waiting in the wings Texas has attracted billions of dollars in new powerplant investment More than megawatts will be added to the Texas grid before competition begins according to reports on new power plants Thats an increase of about over the states current generating capacity The bill they passed did not send the right signals to the market Sibley said of California a Texas legislators visited before addressing the issue in We learned from California what we did not want to do Like Texas Michigan hopes its success in attracting powerplant developers to the state will help it avoid Californias problems when it allows customers to start choosing their power providers on Jan According to Gary Kitts chief administrative officer at the Michigan Public Service Commission attracting independent power producers is a key element for creating healthy competition and prices at the retail level Michigan is only in the early stages of writing the rules that will restructure its power markets but major developers already have begun to show interest in building new plants in the state Only days after the state passed its restructuring bills this spring Dallasbased Panda Energy International Inc a privately held company announced plans to build a megawatt plant by late Two new merchant plants already have broken ground and three more are in the planning stage Kitts said Likewise Ohio regulators are hoping new power plant development will spark healthy competition at the wholesale and retail level when competition debuts Jan We have quite a bit of generation going in the next year said Ed Hess chief of the electricity division at the Ohio Public Utility Commission Ohio companies like Cinergy Corp CIN and FirstEnergy Corp FE are either planning new Ohio generators or have recently brought new plants on line Like Michigan Ohio companies wont have to sell off their plants as a condition of deregulation and expose themselves to wholesale price spikes as California utilities have had to do Also the state probably wont see wholesale price caps similar to a per megawatthour cap approved last week by Californias grid operator Hess said While caps can protect consumers from bloated wholesale power prices in the short term they can worsen the problem ultimately by deterring development of the new power plants needed to correct supply shortages said Sam Rendazzo a lawyer who represents an Ohio industrial users group Youre basically damping the pricing that developers are looking for he said California is perhaps the most dramatic evidence of a market thats not functioning In addition to counting on new generation deregulation advocates outside California also plan to insulate consumers from wholesale price swings until competitive retail markets exist Under the Texas restructuring law utility rates are frozen until the debut of competition At that time rates will drop and hold there for three years or until a utility has shed of its customers to competing retail suppliers There will be no authority to change rates until competition exists said a Texas Public Utilities Commission spokeswoman Michigan will also freeze its rates Kitts said for three or five years depending on the customer in hopes giving competitive markets time to develop Nevertheless Californias highprofile woes are making it harder to push deregulation elsewhere Oklahoma for example has set a target of mid for the start of retail competition But the state has yet to work out the details in legislation The Oklahoma House of Representatives defeated a bill in the final hour of this years session and a lawmaker said Californias problems will make deregulation a tougher sell in Compiled

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDD ConsultRCIcom IssueAlert August A Return to Regulation California Problems Spark National Trend By Will McNamara DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDD With state power reserves falling below percent for the second straight day and the demand for electricity continuing to increase the California Independent System Operator CAISO issued a Stage Two electrical emergen cy on Tuesday A Stage Two Emergency is a serious occurrence as it signals that electric operating reserves in the state have fallen below percent The CalISO has issued over Stage Two emergencies this summer leaving little doubt that the power supply problem in California has reached disastrous proportions Other states and foreign countries such as Japan that have deregulated their energy marketsor are about to do sohave kept a cl ose eye on the problems in California These problems have sparked a national debate over whether returning to or maintaining a regulated energy market is a better option ANALYSIS Ive been tracking the chronic problems facing California in RCIs IssueAlerts for several months so for further background please visit our archives at the link offered below Yet generally speaking its fairly obvious that the promises of deregulation in California have not materialized Limited transmission lines the fact that no new power plants have been built in almost two decades and a percent increase in demand have driven costs up in California instead of down On Tuesday approximately MW of power was consumed topping Mondays peak of MW Exacerbating the already tight supplies is the fact that some MW of generation mostly in Southern California are unavailable due to power plant mechanical failures However perhaps even more pertinent is a movement that I am seeing develop both within California and other states that arguably is a direct result of the problems weve seen on the West Coast This movement is founded on a platform that suggests deregulated energy markets should become regula ted once again and those states that havent adopted a restructuring plan should take a timeout and reconsider if competition truly offers more benefits than headaches Not surprisingly California lawmakers and consumer advocatesblaming deregulation for the high rates that customers of San Diego Gas Electric are now payin g suggested that the California market should become reregulated Proposals included imposing more governmental control over energy prices which led to the recent lowering of the price cap in the state to MW to having utility companies buy back all the power plants they were forced to sell only two years ago But the discussion of reregulation has not been limited to California The New York City Council for instance has posted a bill that would give the City authority to regulate the output of lead into the atmosphere As lead is a small part of the pollution generated by power plants if this bill passes the City would have a handle on power generation that it does not now have Even more striking is the coalition of lowcost energy states that have petitioned Congress to exempt them from participating in deregulation The LowCost Electricity States Initiative LCESI actually has been in existence for over a year but is gaining momentum again now that it can use California as an example of all that is wrong with deregulation Some of these states only want to open their wholesale markets to competition but not their retail markets Others want to avoid deregulation altogether As a lobbying group the LCESI has tried to convince Congress that any federal restructuring law should be secondary to state plans and that any mandate regarding state participation in deregulation will be appealed Other lowcost states have started to drag their heels regarding deregulati on even if they have not officially joined LCESI Iowa for instance recently decided that it wont even pursue the issue of deregulation during the session of its legislature upon the urging of the states largest utility MidAmerican Energy New Mexico which had previously approved a start date of Jan for electric competition now has delayed that start date until Jan to further investigate the impact that competition will have on the state On the other hand two states that are moving forward with their Jan start datesIllinois and Ohiocontinue to watch California closely bu t think such problems will be averted in their own states Ohio points to the fact that its rate freeze wont be lifted for five years which will protect residents from the kind of price spikes now hurting customers in San Diego Illinois customers also will benefit from a longer rate freeze and the fact that regulators in the statehaving watched problems regard ing supply materialize in Californiaallowed for incumbent utilities to dive st of their power plants but did not mandate it Thus importing power from the wholesale market wont be as necessary in Illinois as it is in Californ ia However between the members of LCESI and the approximately states that have adopted some form of a restructuring plan the United States is almost evenly divided with regard to states that would or would not be participating in deregulation But realistically would states even be allowed to optout from electric competition Perhaps this might work on the wholesale market but ultimately I cannot see half of the US state s retreating from retail competition if the other half is participating When educated properly about the true benefits of competition electric customersespecially industrial and commercial customerswill push fo r competition within their states or go to states where they can choose their energy provider In addition because of the way the nations transmission grid is structured it would be near impossible to transport power any great distance if states along the way refuse to grant access to their transmission lines Moreover perhaps it is not entirely wise to use California as a test examp le for how deregulation will work nationally as the LCESI is now attempting to do First California clearly made some mistakes in its own restructurin g plan not the least of which was the combination of mandating divestiture and not allowing new plants to be built ultimately leaving the state with power supply problems But other states are learning from these mistakes and developing better restructuring plans Second states such as Pennsylva nia have adopted longer periods for rate freezes and stranded cost recovery thus protecting customers from price spikes for a longer period Third deregulation in California has only been in effect for two and half years To write it off as a failure

Industry News Headlines Duplicity and demagoguery on electricity OPINION Duplicity and demagoguery on electricity Richard Nemec Nemec is a Los Angelesbased writer who covers the energy industry Aug San Diego UnionTribune Page B B Copyright The current brouhaha surrounding San Diego BelectricityB bills is a poignant reminder of just how politicized an issue can become under the rubric of fostering the public good In this case Californias sevenyear BelectricB industry BderegulationB effort with complete support and crafting from the Democraticcontrolled state Legislature is being made the whipping boy for the current price spikes The truth is anything but Nevertheless facts have never stopped elected officials politically appointed regulators or consumer advocates as they try to elbow one another out of the way to be seen by consumers as their patron saint In the debate over this summers high power bills it is the very folks who are screaming the loudest who have contributed the most to the crisis Among the culprits Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon the Legislature Public Utilities Commission member Carl Wood and San Diego GasElectric Co each has contributed to the bills going through the roof But having said that it never has been nor does it need to be a crisis for the state or for San Diego County California will survive the current electrical bumps and grinds but it may not survive the political fallout It is now clear that two Gov Gray Davis appointees Wood and CPUC President Loretta Lynch want to reregulate the electric industry as does Sen Peace SDGE unfortunately was dumb enough to help establish the climate that has allowed them to demagogue the issue and escalate its importance way out of proportion Start with a recent assault by Wood to declare that a radical deregulation policy driven by ideology rather than economic soundness has created a crisis The cornerstone of the problem as Wood sees it is that there havent been any major power plants built in the state in more than a decade It is also true that when Californias electric restructuring law was unanimously passed four years ago there was an oversupply of generation capacity within the state Wood wants to turn that around by mandating utilitybuilt power plants Wood knows all too well that more than a dozen major generation plants are under construction or in the states lethargic approval process right now If magically they could all be built by next summer California would be awash in electrons They cant but there is the prospect for getting ahead of the curve by the summer of if the state Gov Davis most specifically does something to accelerate the current siting approval process Earlier this month the governor set in motion work to streamline the siting process Regulatory intervention some call it reregulation is what Peace has had on his mind at least since winter when at an energy discussion held in San Diego he sounded the drumbeat for the government to try to correct what he perceives as failings in the market At the same time he and his colleagues in the Legislature for the past couple of years have stymied CPUC moves to step up the deregulation process for both natural gas and electricity Most notably Peace engineered a bipartisan rider in this years budget bill that prevented the states utilities from buying some of their power supplies outside the statecreated power exchange That move and SDGEs passive financial management helped eliminate one means of lessening the current electric bill shock There are further design flaws in Californias restructured electricity market initiated by Peace to buffer San Diego from having the highest priced power in the state that have complicated the newly developing market and for which politicians take no responsibility Finally there is SDGE which clings to its own selfproclaimed fiction that it is only an energy delivery service and holds no responsibility for what has happened to the million households and businesses using the juice it delivers In fact however the utility company could have taken some steps in the spring in terms of financial riskmanagement instruments offered through the California power exchange that would have lowered the price spike It also could have been more aggressive in promoting conservation by customers Subsequently SDGE has been tripping all over itself making emergency filings to the CPUC seeking authorizations it could have aggressively pursued before the crisis The regulators granted everything it asked for finally on Aug But SDGE does have a generating role it still has a percent interest in the San Onofre nuclear plant and a corporate affiliate operates a new power plant in Nevada And guess where that plant sold all of its power

Interactive R Server Software Folder Industry News Headlines Consumers Grow More Anxious As They Are Cut Loose In BElectricitysB New Free Market Metropolitan Desk Section Feeling Powerless In Consumers Grow More Anxious As They Are Cut Loose In BElectricitysB New Free Market By KIRK JOHNSON Aug New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Over the last years a dogma has taken root in America that says people would be happier and better off if they were all continually shopping for the best deals Consumers according to this theory should be empowered and freed from the old business monopolies and the dictates of fussy bureaucrats So airlines were deregulated and telephone service and then the Internet arrived giving people the ability to choose from different sellers of the same merchandise The bull market on Wall Street brought mutual funds begging for attention Having more choices became an end in itself But for millions of people especially in New York and California the doctrine of the sovereign consumer has come into question this summer around a commodity that most had taken completely for granted BelectricityB A recently deregulated BenergyB market which was supposed to increase choices and reduce prices has for most residents done nothing of the kind Many community leaders and politicians calling for investigations and caps on rising BelectricityB bills up percent to percent from those of last August in many areas have denounced BenergyB BderegulationB as either a failure or a fraud Some social scientists say that the anxiety over BenergyB is exposing something even deeper in the human wiring At a time when protesters have railed in Seattle and Washington against chain stores and global branding and prominent social critics have denounced the intrusion of endless choice into every corner of life a phenomenon that Barry Schwartz a psychologist at Swarthmore College calls the tyranny of freedom the publics worries about BelectricityB may say more about human nature than about kilowatts Perhaps this alternative theory says there is a point at which people no longer wish to be autonomous rational consumers at all Maybe they would just as soon delegate their decisions regarding some transactions as they did when Consolidated Edison was the only game in town and government was assigned to make sure that the company played by the rules Maybe when it comes to BelectricityB a mysterious and dangerous thing that is also the foundation of modern living Americans are just a little afraid to be alone In the past we trusted that state regulators who were appointed by our elected officials were watching out for us which may or may not have been true said Edward A Smeloff a former utility industry official who runs a research group on BelectricityB at Pace University The new model is Figure it out for yourself Some economists and BenergyB industry experts say the sense of powerlessness and confusion that many people feel is perhaps as much a source of anxiety and anger as higher BelectricityB bills The players have all changed and no one seems to be in charge The old Brooklyn Union Gas Company for example still remembered by many New York residents for the fuzzy feelgood images of its advertising has become the cool and metallicsounding KeySpan BEnergyB The old Con Ed on the other hand was like a crotchety grandfather who sometimes had to be prodded and yelled at but who nonetheless presided over the system The company now throws up its hands and says it is not responsible for recent price increases Con Eds wires are simply a delivery mechanism for the unregulated corporations that own generating plants Con Eds chairman said at a recent hearing at City Hall Opinion poll takers say anxiety about deregulation may also have something to do with a contradiction in the American psyche that they say has opened up in recent years a contradiction about what people really want Surveys conducted by Yankelovich Partners a research and consulting firm based in Norwalk Conn have said for example that a majority of people want more control over the details of their lives but a majority also want to simplify their lives a result that Barbara R Caplan a partner at the firm has called the paradox of our time Deregulated BenergyB arrived right in the middle of those conflicting goals because only a handful of BenergyB competitors have been attracted to the New York market most people still do not have much choice in their BelectricityB and yet it all seems more complicated than ever as well as more expensive Another factor some researchers say may be a result of timing People have had experience with deregulation and they have seen that it did not always unfold to their benefit The hubandspoke system developed by the airline industry for example has given airlines nearmonopoly power at many airports around the country resulting in less competition not more Consumers have also seen that although tools like the Internet have made buyers more powerful in getting good prices corporations on the other side of the transaction have become more powerful too in gathering information about them Years ago you went into an auto dealership and had to negotiate to buy a car but only the corporate side had knowledge of what the real costs were said Mark L Gillenson a professor of management information systems at the University of Memphis Now you go into the Internet and lots of places will give you that information for free On the other hand Professor Gillenson said the data that corporations are collecting about people are creating what the old car dealer could never have imagined knowledge about what people want before they even ask Lurking behind all those forces some psychologists say is the growing sense that people are simply being asked to decide too much Economic deregulation has accompanied what may be called social deregulation as issues that were not even considered decisions in the past have become issues of conscious choice whether to get married and have children or how to express oneself sexually as gay straight or somewhere in between And the more choices there are the more it can seem possible to achieve an ideal result in every case leading to a doomed treadmill kind of behavior often seen in people who continually change their longdistance telephone service as they endlessly seek an incremental price advantage Over what domains in life are you supposed to have control said Professor Schwartz the Swarthmore College psychologist Nobody gets depressed when you cant control the weather and years ago nobody got depressed because they couldnt control your telecommunications or BelectricityB either because those things couldnt be controlled he said But now you can or youre told that you can and so youre going to be continually frustrated And BelectricityB is also just different Unlike a telephone call or an airline ticket nobody ever really wants to buy BelectricityB itself rather people buy its expression and result a cold beer in the fridge a light to read by By the standards of American marketing it is barely a product at all People want to make choices about clothes and restaurants and what houses they live in but a lot of us would rather not be bothered with having to make a choice about BelectricityB said Wendy Kaminer a public policy fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Cambridge Mass Its not a desire to be disempowered Ms Kaminer added Its a desire not to be bothered Finally some experts think that the long bull market for stocks in which share prices mostly just go up has made people forget a fundamental truth about how markets work they are genuinely fair only over the long run while at any given time there are likely to be as many losers as winners Deregulation and privatization were sold implicitly on the assumption that everybody can win from this but Im hard pressed to find an example in the real world where that has happened said Willis Emmons a professor in the strategy public policy and ethics department at Georgetown Universitys business school Right now Professor Emmons added maybe somebody is winning but it isnt the consumer NYTF To view all headlines in the folder Industry News go to browsearticlesaspfolderid To go to the

illustrate flaws in the system As the states booming economy taxes the ability to meet electricity demands a federal investigation is underway CHRIS KRAUL TIMES STAFF WRITER Aug Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page A Copyright The Times Mirror Company With Southern Californians reeling from skyrocketing electric bills critics charge that fewer than a dozen power suppliers are reaping far greater profits than are justified by the recent surge in wholesale prices of the natural gas they use to create electricity Their behavior is a major focus of a formal investigation announced last week by federal regulators Among those under scrutiny are power merchants including BDukeB BEnergyB BDynegyB BReliantB BEnergyB Calpine Southern Co and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Critics say the companies are earning huge windfalls selling energy to the two state agencies charged with distributing power in California The power merchants themselves deny any profiteering describing their market moves as legal business practices and welcoming the investigation The underlying cause of Californias energy turmoil is a severe shortage of powergenerating capacity to meet the soaring energy demands of the states booming economy This summer the state at times has had to import more than of its energy needs a shortfall equal to the output of about mediumsize power plants No plants of any size have been built in the state in years But the problem goes beyond a supplyanddemand imbalance The socalled merchant power companies ability to bend the market to their advantageusing what appear to be legal strategiesillustrates what many say are serious flaws in the states deregulated energy market One major flaw is that sellers do not have to participate in the states main electricity auctionthe socalled day forward sale held one day before electricity is delivered to the states residences and businesses Instead generators are withholding power until the day of delivery when desperate state agencies are willing to pay steep prices to keep the power flowing The upshot has been a doubling of electric bills for the million customers in San Diego GasElectrics coverage area and Southern California Edison and Pacific GasElectric customers may be facing higher prices once their rates are unfrozen in There is little prospect for shortterm relief with no additional power generation due for a year the prices of natural gas and crude oil are still rising In fact state officials expect the market to become tighter over the next year as demand and fuel prices rise In pointing the finger at the power merchants Gov Gray Davis some academics and utility executives charge that California consumers are being victimized by sophisticated trading techniques that take advantage of the market system to extract huge profits Deregulation only works if people act responsibly It wont work if people say their only goal is to make as much money as humanly possible Davis said last week This brokering takes place on the California Power Exchange and the Independent System Operator two agencies created by the legislation that ostensibly opened up of the states power marketrepresented by the PGE SCE and SDGE service areasto competition To create that competition lawmakers ordered the utilities to sell power plants to independent companies which now are selling electricity to the state The Power Exchange is a clearinghouse for the bulk of energy trading that is completed a day in advance of delivery which normally fills most of the states energy needs The ISO the nominal traffic cop arranging deliveries over the power grid also has the authority to hold sameday power auctions for immediate delivery in the event of unexpectedly high demand The Power Exchange is subject to a price cap of per megawatthour a ceiling imposed earlier this summer as prices began to soar But the ISO has the authority to pay as much as it has to for supplementary power if the previousday purchases prove insufficient to keep the states lights on And it is the secondary ISO market where power suppliers leveraging a sellers market are holding sway By withholding their energy from the Power Exchange and opting instead to bid their supply to the ISO they are betting that sameday shortages will generate prices as close to the price cap as possible possibly even above it Its apparently working On some days the ISO has ended up buying onefifth of the states energy needs not the to maximum originally envisioned In the process desperate to meet demand the ISO is paying premium prices and those prices are being passed along to consumers The problem with the market apparently defies easy solutions At an emergency meeting Friday to discuss ways of dealing with the crisis the ISO board rejected a staff proposal to force energy merchants to allocate at least of the electricity they intend to sell in the day forward auction held by the Power Exchange instead of holding back until the day of delivery Although ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure would restore some market order the board rejected it on fears that it might create unforeseen ramifications possibly even power suppliers abandoning the state altogether As the market stands now independent power companies have been able to exploit the power shortages and the markets quirks to charge the state higher rates than the increases in the price of natural gas would seem to warrant said Severin Borenstein a UC Berkeley professor and energy specialist With fellow UC Berkeley professor James Bushnell and Stanfords Frank Wolak Borenstein studied the Power Exchange over a month period ended in September and found evidence of market power or the power generators ability to raise prices above competitive levels for sustained periods Unless there is collusion among two or more power providers the exercise of market power is not illegal experts say But if prolonged it is a symptom of a seriously dysfunctional market I think market power has probably gotten worse this year There are players big enough to move the price and move it a lot Prices are clearly way above their costs Borenstein said Edison CEO John Bryson and Stephen Baum head of SDGE parent Sempra Energy have similar criticisms Their claims will be investigated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the latest of five probes underway into Californias worsening energy predicament Well see whether there are alternative market rules that should be adopted to have a better functioning more efficient market said Daniel Larcamp FERCs director of market tariffs and rates Looking at market power issues is an important focus of our investigation Power suppliers Duke Energy and Calpine denied any market manipulation saying the bulk of their energy is sold on longterm contracts and is not used to unduly sway dayahead prices on the Power Exchange or sameday sales on the ISO No way are we manipulating the market and we have welcomed investigation into our business practices said Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energys California regional office in Morro Bay Its easy to point fingers at someone who controls only of the market much of which has already been sold in the forward market months ago Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander said the high prices are simply a case of demand far outstripping the states ability to meet it Ten years ago you had more supply than demand Now you have a skyrocketing demand from population growth a robust economy and Internetfed additions to demand Highlander said Charles Cicchetti a USC professor of government business and the economy agrees and said the market is performing exactly as expected given supply shortages He objects to the limited price ceilings opposed by state officials The choice should be to either regulate the whole thing go back to where we were or let the market work Cicchetti said This hybrid is causing problems to get worse But something appears to be worsening an already bad pricing situation and critics believe it is market manipulation In the FERC order initiating its investigation the agency noted that Californias wholesale electricity costs on June were milliona sevenfold increase over the same date in Over the same period natural gas prices only doubled FERC will look at other aspects of the states energy deregulation as wellat the fact that utilities have no choice but to purchase power from the central power exchange and have only limited power to hedge or make bilateral deals on their own with outside firms In an interview last week the FERCs Larcamp said his agency is reserving the right to roll back rates order refunds or even impose a new market framework to replace the Power Exchange and ISO Larcamp said the FERCs probe will contrast Californias troubled power market with the PennsylvaniaMarylandNew Jersey system which gives end users more freedom to cut their own deals with suppliers The result is that Pennsylvania has more than power suppliers competing for the states business versus no more than in California Times staff writers Nancy Vogel and Nancy Rivera Brooks

I believe each and every person that reviewed and approved Californias deregulation should be required to go back to school and take Economics I dont believe the AG in California will find any manipulation unless the generators have figured a way to control the weather and raise temperatures degrees above normal There is no significant baseline power in California The consumers regulators and politicians in California that have been pushing for deregulation are experiencing first hand the effects the flawed legislation California enacted and the reality of economics The regulators in California the NE part of the country and elsewhere created imbalanced markets in the s and early s We now are asking the same agencies if not the same individuals that created the mess to fix it Talk about the fox watching the hen house but its even better The fox built a hen house and is being asked to fix the problem now that were noticing chickens are missing Spot market prices for ANY commodity will skyrocket when demand increases dramatically and supply is limited If you cap prices youll almost certainly create shortages I would have hoped we would have learned something from the seventy years of Communist rule in Russia Can you say RATIONING Almost everyone has been misled to believe electric prices will decline under competition without examining the underlying capital and operating realities of the electric industry compared to other deregulated industries If you want your power at prices below those a free market will support be prepared to go without your electricity at times After an accurate comparison of the electric industry to other deregulated industries you will discover that in a fully deregulated electric industry retail electric prices will average from to percent higher than existing prices And prices will reach from five to ten times above current prices at times during demand spikes David L Robbins NA NA David ellsFargoCOM The answer is Yes and No Tremendous price increases for the cost of energy over the last months have an inevitable impact on the cost of generating electricity However those price increases do not cover the full extent of the increased cost for electricity for San Diego Gas and Electric My sources tell me that there has been some collusion among the major IPPs servicing SDGE which accounts for some of the other increases SDGEs mismanagement accounts for the rest Carl R Clark President Energetech Corp Was any assistance offered recently when the price of gas increased Would any assistance be offered in any substantive way if the price of sugar or rice increased The increase in electricity prices is a function of a mismatch between supply and demand The consumers concerns about this issue should be heard by suppliers in the form of new peaking power units cogeneration combinedcycle technology or improvements to the efficiency of existing generating plants If local suppliers are unwilling or unable to address the issue new suppliers will do so Market forces work well enough in other sectors they will work in CA given time David Whitehead VP Sales GENTRACK Sanderson Computers The generators are closely following the rules set by the independent system operator The solution would be to have the consumers educated enough to demand and pay for a service that provides them consistent pricing this would be a niche for a service provider to go to the generators and capture enough generation capacity at a given rate to meet the customer demands One thing that is not discussed in any of these articles is the average price of electricity over a longer period say the entire year In addition as I recall during the transition period the ratepayers received quite a reduction in rates Gary Hilberg Vice President Business Development The PIC Energy Group Competition is as competition does usually with little thinking or planning involved Some of us in California tried to bring various forms of planning and scenario forecasting to management and public eyes on thoughts on the future But scenarios of belief in the growandbuild era of the ss tended to overforecast load growth for nuclear power a year just as it was logical for management to believe in low forecasts for the s a year in the deregulation era The reality of growth cycles is a bit like saying feet in ice and hand in fire ie the average temperature is pretty comfortable Was AB a good thing No value judgement it was a political deal for billion Remember Diablo Canyon Some CEOs and public officials made their careers on this sort of thinking Best wishes California hopefully there will be light in the night skies Place blame appropriately NA NA NA Is this question a joke Of course they are This behavior will continue as long as the PR fog that has been created by the IOUs shameful campaigns while they have had their hands in our pockets These managements know they will not be fit to compete in a competitive market and will do anything to keep the fat dumb and happy mindset promoted they think that blaming their shortage exploitation on deregulation Randy Castleberry CEO Tempulse Information Management Whether or not individual generators are trying to manipulate is not the question and price caps are certainly not the answer The main problem is that the press has been led to believe that the situation is the result of years of deregulation not the years of regulation that led to shortages of both generation and transmission In addition one must remember that the vast majority of generation remains under regulatory andor legislated prices only about is actually bid and cleared no wonder the market thinness has lead to volatility Second price auction certainly doesnt help since everybody gets paid whatever the one manipulating is the highest bidders bid Price caps will only stifle the construction of new supply and new supply is half of the answer to price volatility The other half is meaningful demand responsive behavior price caps will hide true costs from consumers and stifle that too A little more patience is whats needed Tom Tanton NA California Energy Commission Oh sure why not it worked for the phone companies right well didnt it Okay Admittedly theyre making over twentypercent returns on investments but youve never heard about a phone brownout have you David Draper Regulatory Analyst Florida Public Commission SCSTATEFLUS Power marketers and utilities with generating capacity to sell and traders to sell it are not manipulating the market just taking advantage of the opportunities it is offering Thats what a market unfettered by regulation is about The answer to your second question then is that price caps are clearly reregulation and antifree market We either deregulate or reregulate the electric industry Reginald Ankrom President EnNova Energy Solutions You reap what you sow CA rushed into deregulation without a complete review of the impact Market value means profit and any company to remain in business looks at the profit motive as the primary driving force Putting a cap on prices is going back to the old system of guaranteeing a profit without regard to efficiency and conservation The current system like all systems in the past will eventually self correct Users and suppliers will reach a common plateau It may take some time and may hurt financially but eventually we will work it out The United States has historically swung in large amplitudes in everything we have done From complete isolationism prior to WWII to complete globalization in the s and s from no environmental controls to what some people may consider excessive tight controls I wish us a happy future Signed Someone who has been in the power business longer than he would like to NA NA NA NA If coal is the least expensive fuel install two used coalfired steam generators boilers each capable of supplying turbo generators adequate for the entire San Diego County load As an alternative install used boilers capable of burning waste fuel to supply the turbogenerators free fuel is a very good price San Diego can surely issue the various permits Sell any surplus power so the residents of San Diego can enjoy free electricity ie generate for centsKWh and sell it for I understand a large quantity of used equipment is available Fifty years associated with power generation in USA and overseas NA NA NA Market manipulation no Taking advantage of a somewhat silly demandsupply imbalance situation yes The analogy that comes to mind is that of a farmer whose crops in the midst of a drought are doing okay so he can charge more for them We should remember that this same farmer at other times will suffer through lean times where supply exceeds demand A few additional points The current focus in the press is on summer price spikes What about the generally lower energy commodity prices that SDGE ratepayers got in the winter and spring Until a bunch of merchant plant capacity comes online to serve the California market things may get uglier before they get better Then again maybe Mr Greenspans interest rate hikes finally will begin to take effect Summer price spikes in California seem to be lower than spot market situations that occasionally occur in the Midwest and in the New York area How about getting the CEC off its duff and getting some additional generating and transmission capacity approved Dont count out DSM completely yet at least for peakshaving Phil Sisson NA Sisson and Associates Inc Price spikes in California as in other parts of the country are a sign of electricity markets that are not entirely efficient or competitive In the specific case of California the reasons for this can be found in the way that the state has deregulated the market and the subsequent actions they have taken in an attempt to control it CalISOs creation of the governmentgranted monopoly known as the PX or power exchange helped to ensure that Californias market could never truly be efficient Many of Californias generators are forced to buy and sell from this power pool which discourages the development of a true robust bilateral market for wholesale electricity The introduction of further price caps not only discourages power marketers from shortterm sales into the state in times of need but also creates an atmosphere that will discourage longterm entry as well as the development of independent generation California needs real robust competition not another step deeper into the regulatory morass that they have created Kevin ODonovan Director Government Affairs Industry Networks I live in the Pacific Northwest yet we are paying prices as high and at times higher than southern California Generators are withholding power until pricing reaches acceptable levels in markets where they can sell not in local service areas Why else would generation be reduced for economic reasons Once again opportunists have twisted a good idea into a profitable venture for a very small group The concept of deregulation was to enhance competition through freedom of choice of the end user NOT THE SUPPLIER We are a captive audience Try to get by for just one day without use of electricity When price controls were removed generators and marketers were allowed to set pricing at whatever level they wanted There is not one single fuel source used by medium to large generators that costs an equivalent of per MWh A solution would be to cap prices not at a fixed level but at a cost of service fuels maintenance labor etc plus a maximum allowable profit margin Also require generators to run regardless of economics Under the must run would be a requirement to satisfy native loads and contract obligations before selling power outside of local service territories Lets get away from pricing based on whatever the market will bear and get back to pricing based on cost of service Let the electric industry face the same economic problems as the rest of industry David Michaelson PE Electrical Engineer Industrial Energy Manager NA NA I believe that the current deregulated marketing infrastructure invites manipulation and artificially inflated rates simply because the new laissezfaire market has no real constraints The new arbitrage trading has created multiple layers of parasites who are living well by adding no value to the commodityonly extra cost to the end user The trend of abuse is clear and I think price ceilings are inevitable Roy Chip Burton Project Engineer MultiLevel Technologies Inc As a market moves up the supply curve on peak there is no doubt that there is more supplier concentration and the potential for market manipulation However price caps are not a satisfactory longterm solution to high prices They will inevitably lead to blackouts A better longterm solution will be encourage more competition by identifying and removing barriers to new peaking and base load generation particularly distributed generation that can be located in load centers to serve peak loads Peter Evans Senior Vice President Catalytica Combustion Systems The twopart question goes first to motive then to solution No one can prove THAT the generators are gaming the system versus the system is working as it should The fact is that the result of operating the open market system as presently designed is unacceptable It is totally unacceptable that the competitive market in California is supposed to and attempting to operate in a condition of supplydemandprice equilibrium that does not exist That Californians should pay many billions of extra dollars to support an ineffective market system imposed upon them by regulators and legislators in the name of lower costs is sane only to those currently lining their pockets That price caps are needed in this ineffective or as some people laughingly call it imperfect market goes without question That generators or marketers cannot make a buck at a per MWh cap is laughable This is five times more than consumers ever paid for energy The only issue that needs resolving is how long the price caps should remain in effect That answer should depend on when the promised marketinequilibrium can be brought to bear and when a workable western RTO can guarantee economic transmission rates for California consumers Otherwise reregulate At any cost it will be cheaper than where were heading Joe Bongiovanni General Manager Hardwick Electric Department I believe that the people in San Diego are not able to see the full picture regarding deregulation of electric rates They were proposed as a means of overall rate reduction because of competition and on a yearly basis this is still possible Electricity was already high in California because of the environmental controls and difficulty of building new plants Very few new plants are being built and a perfectly good plant at San Onofre Unit was shut down reducing our resource margins Californians were not told that price volatility will be high in a free market as the price charged will be the price of the most expensive unit on line Today no one is talking about what happens during the low demand periods when the competition for selling power will be very high driving the price down to the point that some plants will probably want to pay you to use power so that they can stay on line Thus the situation of a free market system for electricity is not good for either a public that wants consistent bills or the power producers that can make money only when demand is very high It will take several years of bumpy conditions to iron out the competitive market for electricity Bill Hannaman PE Senior Staff Engineer DSS Dont blame this situation on the market players a utility without generation is like a race car without tires Until investors customers and employees stand as one against utilities selling off all their generation this situation will continue to be one of simple market economics supply vs demand The only winners are the executives of these utilities as they get rewarded for the high sale prices of the plants while customers are exposed to higher prices and lower reliability and sadly employees lose jobs pay level and seniority that are hard if not impossible to replace Frank Richards Technical Sales Rep Austin Energy IF there is manipulation of prices price caps are not the way to penalize the criminals because price caps affect every single seller not the individual or handful of individuals who are restraining the market and acting against the public interest I do tend to believe that price runups in California today arent due to market manipulators so much as they are due to the regulatory neglect and complacency bordering on hubris CA has labored under for the past years with no new plants being built while domestic demand grew and regional available importable supply shrank Returning to price caps isnt it fairly simple to illustrate that the California caps have served to do the following normal sellers of power sell at x Lets say there are nefarious actors who withhold power to later sell it at artificially inflated prices of x rather than the market rate of x that would have arisen as demand increased and supply tightened This is crude but bear with me In high dudgeon the politicians intervene and impose a cap of x which captures the bad actors but also unfortunately penalizes all of the other actors in the market slam dunking them in order to stop the few bad actors Results All the investors who put money into the market in good faith that the rules would allow them to make an adequate return on their investment are now penalized by caps that shave off money from their profitmaking times in the market for what is so far an unproven allegation against other unspecified bad actors So how many will want to build in this market with this new and highly volatile form of risk And what California accomplished for fifteen years through regulatory neglect it will now persist to accomplish through political intemperance Putting caps onto the market will not solve shortages it will not solve price problems more plants will not be built transmission wont be built reliability will get worse California is in for many more years of problems if they dont put their energy problems in order What is with California and price controls First President Richard Nixon who imposed national wage and price controls which failed miserably had to be pulled off because they only hid not solved problems that continued to fester and contributed greatly to the inflation of the later s Now price caps which will do about the same William Jordahl Manager FederalState Relations Alliant Energy The Electric Wholesale Market and Deregulation in general is primarily in name only One of the regional issues is the allowance of existing monopolistic participants to divest wholesale production in their own service territory and to ultimately repurchase wholesale production under nonregulated entities in the same electrical region Allowing the same entities to have monopolistic ownership of the transportation and distribution of the product while also owning nonregulated regional wholesale production of the product begs for market problems Placing caps on the wholesale price of the product not only masks the real issues but also could prevent the entrance of new participants Anonymous Senior Domestic Marketing Manager NA NA Are power generators deliberately manipulating the market to obtain higher profits in San Diego Of course they are the bidding rules for selling power into the PX require that all producers receive the price asked for by the most expensive producer selected Thus there is a tremendous profitmaking incentive to withhold power until the price goes up But the bidding rules are only a part of the problem The whole premise that electric power can be delivered competitively is a big lie Why As economist Eugene Coyle explains in Price Discrimination Electronic Redlining And Price Fixing in Deregulated Electric Power Washington DC American Public Power Association a commodity product with high fixed costs will force producers to discriminate between customers to collude with each other to maintain profits and to merge to eliminate competitors The best examples are the airlines which charge different prices between leisure and business customers who collude through their ticketing computers and who have merged into four or so major carriers and they are exploring joint ventures to reduce it to about two or three The same is now happening in deregulated electricity Many will argue that electricity competition hasnt been given a fair chance However even if you believe that competition can somehow develop in a commodity market with high fixed costs who will have the political muscle to create more competitive wholesale markets which will require true open access to the transmission system Enron the loudest promoter of open access just got its butt kicked by the big investorowned utilities which have proved their strength on Capitol Hill by killing open access legislation And the big forprofit holding companies are very strong at the state level as well So just as we have been saying for more than four years deregulation will only lead to unregulated monopolies because of the physical and economic nature of the electric power itself and because no one has the political power to enact the structural reforms needed to overcome the power of the forprofit holding companies that still completely dominate this industry Charlie Higley Energy Research Director Public Citizen I believe the answer to the question is NO The problem is lack of supply during peak demand periods The cry for reregulation is ludicrous Part of what FERC intended with the implementation of wholesale deregulation was for the market to send accurate price signals to the supply side so they would be motivated to develop and innovate new forms of supply and demand side management And this is precisely what is occurring Politicians are ignoring the fact that the price of natural gas has at least doubled in the last several months the electric supply from the Pacific Northwest is reduced because of reduced summer runoffs that supply the extensive hydro system an unplanned nuclear plant outage as well as very hot weather covering the entire West Coast All of the combined events have contributed to the current problems faced in the West and more specifically southern California Is anyone complaining when during light load periods the price of power is low and at times almost zero Would regulation have changed any of this I fail to see how As long as consumption goes unchecked and the not in my backyard NIMBY prevails when companies propose additional new generation and transmission facilities we will continue to have high prices during peak demand While the above is a simplification of the problems being faced in the West these are some of the basic issues that need to be addressed whether wholesale deregulation had been implemented or not The opinions expressed above are my own and do not represent any official position of my company David F Perrino Director Market Development West Automated Power Exchange Grid Management Services Hot weather and lack of surplus capacity caused the price spikes and price caps now just prolong the pain The state of Californias actions in imposing wholesale price caps is a simple issue of politically motivated interference in the free market that will ultimately harm consumers The price caps tarnish the allure of investing in new generating capacity and the incentive for electricity buyers to plan ahead more effectively How many lotto tickets would a state sell if the politicos decided that a million prize is too extravagant Would reducing lotto winnings to make it a better producer of state revenue There are marketbased forwards derivatives and other mechanisms for buyers and retailers to protect themselves from price spikes caused by summer supply shortages The longterm answer is to let the market provide financial rewards To those who take risk to build generating capacity When enough new generators join in the market will reach equilibrium Eric C Williams Market Solutions Analyst EPRI Market Solutions Assuming that the excess demand in the wholesale market is based on capacity limits then capping market rates confuses the situation by encouraging consumption and discouraging conservation and the availability of alternative supply sources The de facto vertically integrated electric utility system with its comprehensive regulatory oversight has been in place since circa Transition to a restructured system is going to take more than a few years In the meantime dealing with system peak loads is where attention should be focused Reregulation and wholesale market caps on prices harken back to the old system Its time to begin figuring out how to deal with these system peaks more creatively Ken

Business Heats Up With Dereg Under FireEnron Calif Elec Business Heats Up By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones While federal regulators try to find a way to stabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California Enron Corp ENE has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities to sell them fixedprice power at a lower rate In the past month the Houstonbased electricity service provider entered into longterm fixedrate contracts with the city of Roseville and is negotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista Both of those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas Electric Co a unit of Sempra Energy Inc SRE and pay market rates for electricity Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels Resorts Worldwide Inc HOT one of the worlds largest hospitality companies to sell the company electricity at a fixed rate for the next years The company has four hotels in California three of which buy their power from SDGE Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel power at about cents per kilowatthour compared with the centsKWh Starwood said it was charged by SDGE in August Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal But Starwood said it expects to reduce its energy costs by more than million over the next years Enron the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the US will purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its experience to manage the risks while paying a fee to utilities like SDGE for use of their distribution networks That really is our core strength said Harold Buchanan chief operating officer for Enron Energy Services North America We understand how to manage those risks High Rates Driving Industrial Customers Cities To Switch The growing interest in fixedprice supply contracts is fueling a comeback of sorts for Enron The Houstonbased company had tried to break into Californias retail power market just after deregulation even spending nearly million to advertise the venture during the Super Bowl But Enron gave up trying to win residential customers in citing disappointing response and lowerthanexpected profits That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of promise Oddly enough now that deregulation is coming under attack in California soaring power prices are building demand for Enrons services The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are interested in signing longterm fixedrate contracts Buchanan said Overall what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego thats written in stone Buchanan said Its far cheaper than what theyre paying now with the utilities A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to comment The city of Roseville near Sacramento entered into a million contract with Enron last month to purchase megawatts of electricity for five years at per megawatthour Furthermore the city has started talks with Enron about building and operating a megawatt natural gasfired power plant that city officials expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price spikes that have plagued customers of SDGE since June San Marcos in San Diego County is proposing to switch electricity service for its residents to Enron from SDGE a move the City Council said could shave about million a year off the citys power bill Enron has said it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville An SDGE spokesman said last week that the utility supports such arrangements saying theyre one way deregulation is supposed to work Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDGE itself for four years at a fixed rate of centsKWh but the utility said the price was too high California Gov Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap electricity rates for SDGEs customers at centsKWh By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Folder Name Enron Energy

Assistance for Customers DATELINE SAN DIEGO July BODY To provide its customers with additional assistance this summer and next San Diego Gas Electric SDGE has requested from the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC million over the next two years to increase funding for energyefficiency programs Our customers need assistance today in lowering their energy costs and todays proposal will bring an additional million funding to encourage energy conservation in our region said Edwin A Guiles president of SDGE This money can be used to help replace old inefficient appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators which will result in reduced electric bills and less strain on our states electricsupply system Of the million SDGE would allocate an additional million exclusively for lowincome energyefficiency assistance programs over the next two years Under the proposal filed Friday the lowincome assistance funds will be used to expand existing programs such as refrigerator and evaporative cooler replacements while introducing new programs including room airconditioner replacements and evaporative cooler maintenance and repair The program also includes incentives for landlords to replace refrigerators and air conditioners in rental units The rest of the money would go into other energyefficiency programs to provide incentives for removal and recycling of operating second refrigerators refrigerator and room airconditioner replacement replacement of inefficient pool pumps and increased incentives for a variety of programs to benefit small businesses Funds for these additional incentives come from programs that did not draw as much customer participation as expected For instance large customers requested less than half the amount budgeted for a program designed to provide energyefficiency incentives to them Details on the programs are still being developed but they should be in place in early September The CPUC is expected to act on SDGEs filing in late August In Californias newly created competitive energy marketplace SDGE is a deliveryservice provider For those customers who have not chosen another energy service provider SDGE buys electricity from the California Power Exchange CalPX and passes that cost directly onto its customers with no markup The price of power is now a function of supply and demand in the open market Over the last several weeks SDGE customers have seen their electric bills rise sharply due to the significant increase in commodity costs as a result of power demand in California and surrounding states Fridays proposal marks the latest in a series of actions SDGE has taken recently to help customers grapple with high electric prices On July SDGE and the CalPX proposed a new marketbased power bidding solution to the CPUC that would allow SDGE to procure power for customers with less price volatility over the next five to nine months On July SDGE filed a request with the CPUC to accelerate the return of million in customer money from a CPUCcontrolled account The CPUCs approval of SDGEs request would release of money acquired from powergenerating benefits of San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and other assets would decrease the August and September residential electric bills by or a month That proposal combined with the deregulationdividend checks most SDGE customers will receive next month will result in a total of about million benefit to them in August and September nearly for the typical residential customer helping to ease cashflow problems from higher electricity prices The company is actively promoting a levelpay program to all customers which enables them to even out their bill payments over the course of the year so they can manage better against their monthly

wholesale market have caused electric bills to soar for San Diego Gas Electric customers this summer Are power generators deliberately manipulating the market to obtain higher profits and if so should price caps be imposed to protect ratepayers WHAT IS THIS The Deregulation Watch Public Forum is a free interactive service provided by Energy Central Every three weeks we address an issue related to the deregulation and restructuring of the electric power industry It is designed to provide a platform for the intelligent examination of issues a forum where industry professionals can share their pro con and middleoftheroad views on a variety of issues SEE THE END OF THIS MESSAGE FOR SUBSCRIBEUNSUBSCRIBE INFORMATION SUBMITTING YOUR OPINION AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THIS SERVICE SELECTED RESPONSES I have been following the California story for some time I have consulted with CA utilities over the past years and have spent considerable time examining the recent events and their history I believe each and every person that reviewed and approved Californias deregulation should be required to go back to school and take Economics I dont believe the AG in California will find any manipulation unless the generators have figured a way to control the weather and raise temperatures degrees above normal There is no significant baseline power in California The consumers regulators and politicians in California that have been pushing for deregulation are experiencing first hand the effects the flawed legislation California enacted and the reality of economics The regulators in California the NE part of the country and elsewhere created imbalanced markets in the s and early s We now are asking the same agencies if not the same individuals that created the mess to fix it Talk about the fox watching the hen house but its even better The fox built a hen house and is being asked to fix the problem now that were noticing chickens are missing Spot market prices for ANY commodity will skyrocket when demand increases dramatically and supply is limited If you cap prices youll almost certainly create shortages I would have hoped we would have learned something from the seventy years of Communist rule in Russia Can you say RATIONING Almost everyone has been misled to believe electric prices will decline under competition without examining the underlying capital and operating realities of the electric industry compared to other deregulated industries If you want your power at prices below those a free market will support be prepared to go without your electricity at times After an accurate comparison of the electric industry to other deregulated industries you will discover that in a fully deregulated electric industry retail electric prices will average from to percent higher than existing prices And prices will reach from five to ten times above current prices at times during demand spikes David L Robbins NA NA David ellsFargoCOM The answer is Yes and No Tremendous price increases for the cost of energy over the last months have an inevitable impact on the cost of generating electricity However those price increases do not cover the full extent of the increased cost for electricity for San Diego Gas and Electric My sources tell me that there has been some collusion among the major IPPs servicing SDGE which accounts for some of the other increases SDGEs mismanagement accounts for the rest Carl R Clark President Energetech Corp Was any assistance offered recently when the price of gas increased Would any assistance be offered in any substantive way if the price of sugar or rice increased The increase in electricity prices is a function of a mismatch between supply and demand The consumers concerns about this issue should be heard by suppliers in the form of new peaking power units cogeneration combinedcycle technology or improvements to the efficiency of existing generating plants If local suppliers are unwilling or unable to address the issue new suppliers will do so Market forces work well enough in other sectors they will work in CA given time David Whitehead VP Sales GENTRACK Sanderson Computers The generators are closely following the rules set by the independent system operator The solution would be to have the consumers educated enough to demand and pay for a service that provides them consistent pricing this would be a niche for a service provider to go to the generators and capture enough generation capacity at a given rate to meet the customer demands One thing that is not discussed in any of these articles is the average price of electricity over a longer period say the entire year In addition as I recall during the transition period the ratepayers received quite a reduction in rates Gary Hilberg Vice President Business Development The PIC Energy Group Competition is as competition does usually with little thinking or planning involved Some of us in California tried to bring various forms of planning and scenario forecasting to management and public eyes on thoughts on the future But scenarios of belief in the growandbuild era of the ss tended to overforecast load growth for nuclear power a year just as it was logical for management to believe in low forecasts for the s a year in the deregulation era The reality of growth cycles is a bit like saying feet in ice and hand in fire ie the average temperature is pretty comfortable Was AB a good thing No value judgement it was a political deal for billion Remember Diablo Canyon Some CEOs and public officials made their careers on this sort of thinking Best wishes California hopefully there will be light in the night skies Place blame appropriately NA NA NA Is this question a joke Of course they are This behavior will continue as long as the PR fog that has been created by the IOUs shameful campaigns while they have had their hands in our pockets These managements know they will not be fit to compete in a competitive market and will do anything to keep the fat dumb and happy mindset promoted they think that blaming their shortage exploitation on deregulation Randy Castleberry CEO Tempulse Information Management Whether or not individual generators are trying to manipulate is not the question and price caps are certainly not the answer The main problem is that the press has been led to believe that the situation is the result of years of deregulation not the years of regulation that led to shortages of both generation and transmission In addition one must remember that the vast majority of generation remains under regulatory andor legislated prices only about is actually bid and cleared no wonder the market thinness has lead to volatility Second price auction certainly doesnt help since everybody gets paid whatever the one manipulating is the highest bidders bid Price caps will only stifle the construction of new supply and new supply is half of the answer to price volatility The other half is meaningful demand responsive behavior price caps will hide true costs from consumers and stifle that too A little more patience is whats needed Tom Tanton NA California Energy Commission Oh sure why not it worked for the phone companies right well didnt it Okay Admittedly theyre making over twentypercent returns on investments but youve never heard about a phone brownout have you David Draper Regulatory Analyst Florida Public Commission SCSTATEFLUS Power marketers and utilities with generating capacity to sell and traders to sell it are not manipulating the market just taking advantage of the opportunities it is offering Thats what a market unfettered by regulation is about The answer to your second question then is that price caps are clearly reregulation and antifree market We either deregulate or reregulate the electric industry Reginald Ankrom President EnNova Energy Solutions You reap what you sow CA rushed into deregulation without a complete review of the impact Market value means profit and any company to remain in business looks at the profit motive as the primary driving force Putting a cap on prices is going back to the old system of guaranteeing a profit without regard to efficiency and conservation The current system like all systems in the past will eventually self correct Users and suppliers will reach a common plateau It may take some time and may hurt financially but eventually we will work it out The United States has historically swung in large amplitudes in everything we have done From complete isolationism prior to WWII to complete globalization in the s and s from no environmental controls to what some people may consider excessive tight controls I wish us a happy future Signed Someone who has been in the power business longer than he would like to NA NA NA NA If coal is the least expensive fuel install two used coalfired steam generators boilers each capable of supplying turbo generators adequate for the entire San Diego County load As an alternative install used boilers capable of burning waste fuel to supply the turbogenerators free fuel is a very good price San Diego can surely issue the various permits Sell any surplus power so the residents of San Diego can enjoy free electricity ie generate for centsKWh and sell it for I understand a large quantity of used equipment is available Fifty years associated with power generation in USA and overseas NA NA NA Market manipulation no Taking advantage of a somewhat silly demandsupply imbalance situation yes The analogy that comes to mind is that of a farmer whose crops in the midst of a drought are doing okay so he can charge more for them We should remember that this same farmer at other times will suffer through lean times where supply exceeds demand A few additional points The current focus in the press is on summer price spikes What about the generally lower energy commodity prices that SDGE ratepayers got in the winter and spring Until a bunch of merchant plant capacity comes online to serve the California market things may get uglier before they get better Then again maybe Mr Greenspans interest rate hikes finally will begin to take effect Summer price spikes in California seem to be lower than spot market situations that occasionally occur in the Midwest and in the New York area How about getting the CEC off its duff and getting some additional generating and transmission capacity approved Dont count out DSM completely yet at least for peakshaving Phil Sisson NA Sisson and Associates Inc Price spikes in California as in other parts of the country are a sign of electricity markets that are not entirely efficient or competitive In the specific case of California the reasons for this can be found in the way that the state has deregulated the market and the subsequent actions they have taken in an attempt to control it CalISOs creation of the governmentgranted monopoly known as the PX or power exchange helped to ensure that Californias market could never truly be efficient Many of Californias generators are forced to buy and sell from this power pool which discourages the development of a true robust bilateral market for wholesale electricity The introduction of further price caps not only discourages power marketers from shortterm sales into the state in times of need but also creates an atmosphere that will discourage longterm entry as well as the development of independent generation California needs real robust competition not another step deeper into the regulatory morass that they have created Kevin ODonovan Director Government Affairs Industry Networks I live in the Pacific Northwest yet we are paying prices as high and at times higher than southern California Generators are withholding power until pricing reaches acceptable levels in markets where they can sell not in local service areas Why else would generation be reduced for economic reasons Once again opportunists have twisted a good idea into a profitable venture for a very small group The concept of deregulation was to enhance competition through freedom of choice of the end user NOT THE SUPPLIER We are a captive audience Try to get by for just one day without use of electricity When price controls were removed generators and marketers were allowed to set pricing at whatever level they wanted There is not one single fuel source used by medium to large generators that costs an equivalent of per MWh A solution would be to cap prices not at a fixed level but at a cost of service fuels maintenance labor etc plus a maximum allowable profit margin Also require generators to run regardless of economics Under the must run would be a requirement to satisfy native loads and contract obligations before selling power outside of local service territories Lets get away from pricing based on whatever the market will bear and get back to pricing based on cost of service Let the electric industry face the same economic problems as the rest of industry David Michaelson PE Electrical Engineer Industrial Energy Manager NA NA I believe that the current deregulated marketing infrastructure invites manipulation and artificially inflated rates simply because the new laissezfaire market has no real constraints The new arbitrage trading has created multiple layers of parasites who are living well by adding no value to the commodityonly extra cost to the end user The trend of abuse is clear and I think price ceilings are inevitable Roy Chip Burton Project Engineer MultiLevel Technologies Inc As a market moves up the supply curve on peak there is no doubt that there is more supplier concentration and the potential for market manipulation However price caps are not a satisfactory longterm solution to high prices They will inevitably lead to blackouts A better longterm solution will be encourage more competition by identifying and removing barriers to new peaking and base load generation particularly distributed generation that can be located in load centers to serve peak loads Peter Evans Senior Vice President Catalytica Combustion Systems The twopart question goes first to motive then to solution No one can prove THAT the generators are gaming the system versus the system is working as it should The fact is that the result of operating the open market system as presently designed is unacceptable It is totally unacceptable that the competitive market in California is supposed to and attempting to operate in a condition of supplydemandprice equilibrium that does not exist That Californians should pay many billions of extra dollars to support an ineffective market system imposed upon them by regulators and legislators in the name of lower costs is sane only to those currently lining their pockets That price caps are needed in this ineffective or as some people laughingly call it imperfect market goes without question That generators or marketers cannot make a buck at a per MWh cap is laughable This is five times more than consumers ever paid for energy The only issue that needs resolving is how long the price caps should remain in effect That answer should depend on when the promised marketinequilibrium can be brought to bear and when a workable western RTO can guarantee economic transmission rates for California consumers Otherwise reregulate At any cost it will be cheaper than where were heading Joe Bongiovanni General Manager Hardwick Electric Department I believe that the people in San Diego are not able to see the full picture regarding deregulation of electric rates They were proposed as a means of overall rate reduction because of competition and on a yearly basis this is still possible Electricity was already high in California because of the environmental controls and difficulty of building new plants Very few new plants are being built and a perfectly good plant at San Onofre Unit was shut down reducing our resource margins Californians were not told that price volatility will be high in a free market as the price charged will be the price of the most expensive unit on line Today no one is talking about what happens during the low demand periods when the competition for selling power will be very high driving the price down to the point that some plants will probably want to pay you to use power so that they can stay on line Thus the situation of a free market system for electricity is not good for either a public that wants consistent bills or the power producers that can make money only when demand is very high It will take several years of bumpy conditions to iron out the competitive market for electricity Bill Hannaman PE Senior Staff Engineer DSS Dont blame this situation on the market players a utility without generation is like a race car without tires Until investors customers and employees stand as one against utilities selling off all their generation this situation will continue to be one of simple market economics supply vs demand The only winners are the executives of these utilities as they get rewarded for the high sale prices of the plants while customers are exposed to higher prices and lower reliability and sadly employees lose jobs pay level and seniority that are hard if not impossible to replace Frank Richards Technical Sales Rep Austin Energy IF there is manipulation of prices price caps are not the way to penalize the criminals because price caps affect every single seller not the individual or handful of individuals who are restraining the market and acting against the public interest I do tend to believe that price runups in California today arent due to market manipulators so much as they are due to the regulatory neglect and complacency bordering on hubris CA has labored under for the past years with no new plants being built while domestic demand grew and regional available importable supply shrank Returning to price caps isnt it fairly simple to illustrate that the California caps have served to do the following normal sellers of power sell at x Lets say there are nefarious actors who withhold power to later sell it at artificially inflated prices of x rather than the market rate of x that would have arisen as demand increased and supply tightened This is crude but bear with me In high dudgeon the politicians intervene and impose a cap of x which captures the bad actors but also unfortunately penalizes all of the other actors in the market slam dunking them in order to stop the few bad actors Results All the investors who put money into the market in good faith that the rules would allow them to make an adequate return on their investment are now penalized by caps that shave off money from their profitmaking times in the market for what is so far an unproven allegation against other unspecified bad actors So how many will want to build in this market with this new and highly volatile form of risk And what California accomplished for fifteen years through regulatory neglect it will now persist to accomplish through political intemperance Putting caps onto the market will not solve shortages it will not solve price problems more plants will not be built transmission wont be built reliability will get worse California is in for many more years of problems if they dont put their energy problems in order What is with California and price controls First President Richard Nixon who imposed national wage and price controls which failed miserably had to be pulled off because they only hid not solved problems that continued to fester and contributed greatly to the inflation of the later s Now price caps which will do about the same William Jordahl Manager FederalState Relations Alliant Energy The Electric Wholesale Market and Deregulation in general is primarily in name only One of the regional issues is the allowance of existing monopolistic participants to divest wholesale production in their own service territory and to ultimately repurchase wholesale production under nonregulated entities in the same electrical region Allowing the same entities to have monopolistic ownership of the transportation and distribution of the product while also owning nonregulated regional wholesale production of the product begs for market problems Placing caps on the wholesale price of the product not only masks the real issues but also could prevent the entrance of new participants Anonymous Senior Domestic Marketing Manager NA NA Are power generators deliberately manipulating the market to obtain higher profits in San Diego Of course they are the bidding rules for selling power into the PX require that all producers receive the price asked for by the most expensive producer selected Thus there is a tremendous profitmaking incentive to withhold power until the price goes up But the bidding rules are only a part of the problem The whole premise that electric power can be delivered competitively is a big lie Why As economist Eugene Coyle explains in Price Discrimination Electronic Redlining And Price Fixing in Deregulated Electric Power Washington DC American Public Power Association a commodity product with high fixed costs will force producers to discriminate between customers to collude with each other to maintain profits and to merge to eliminate competitors The best examples are the airlines which charge different prices between leisure and business customers who collude through their ticketing computers and who have merged into four or so major carriers and they are exploring joint ventures to reduce it to about two or three The same is now happening in deregulated electricity Many will argue that electricity competition hasnt been given a fair chance However even if you believe that competition can somehow develop in a commodity market with high fixed costs who will have the political muscle to create more competitive wholesale markets which will require true open access to the transmission system Enron the loudest promoter of open access just got its butt kicked by the big investorowned utilities which have proved their strength on Capitol Hill by killing open access legislation And the big forprofit holding companies are very strong at the state level as well So just as we have been saying for more than four years deregulation will only lead to unregulated monopolies because of the physical and economic nature of the electric power itself and because no one has the political power to enact the structural reforms needed to overcome the power of the forprofit holding companies that still completely dominate this industry Charlie Higley Energy Research Director Public Citizen I believe the answer to the question is NO The problem is lack of supply during peak demand periods The cry for reregulation is ludicrous Part of what FERC intended with the implementation of wholesale deregulation was for the market to send accurate price signals to the supply side so they would be motivated to develop and innovate new forms of supply and demand side management And this is precisely what is occurring Politicians are ignoring the fact that the price of natural gas has at least doubled in the last several months the electric supply from the Pacific Northwest is reduced because of reduced summer runoffs that supply the extensive hydro system an unplanned nuclear plant outage as well as very hot weather covering the entire West Coast All of the combined events have contributed to the current problems faced in the West and more specifically southern California Is anyone complaining when during light load periods the price of power is low and at times almost zero Would regulation have changed any of this I fail to see how As long as consumption goes unchecked and the not in my backyard NIMBY prevails when companies propose additional new generation and transmission facilities we will continue to have high prices during peak demand While the above is a simplification of the problems being faced in the West these are some of the basic issues that need to be addressed whether wholesale deregulation had been implemented or not The opinions expressed above are my own and do not represent any official position of my company David F Perrino Director Market Development West Automated Power Exchange Grid Management Services Hot weather and lack of surplus capacity caused the price spikes and price caps now just prolong the pain The state of Californias actions in imposing wholesale price caps is a simple issue of politically motivated interference in the free market that will ultimately harm consumers The price caps tarnish the allure of investing in new generating capacity and the incentive for electricity buyers to plan ahead more effectively How many lotto tickets would a state sell if the politicos decided that a million prize is too extravagant Would reducing lotto winnings to make it a better producer of state revenue There are marketbased forwards derivatives and other mechanisms for buyers and retailers to protect themselves from price spikes caused by summer supply shortages The longterm answer is to let the market provide financial rewards To those who take risk to build generating capacity When enough new generators join in the market will reach equilibrium Eric C Williams Market Solutions Analyst EPRI Market Solutions Assuming that the excess demand in the wholesale market is based on capacity limits then capping market rates confuses the situation by encouraging consumption and discouraging conservation and the availability of alternative supply sources The de facto vertically integrated electric utility system with its comprehensive regulatory oversight has been in place since circa Transition to a restructured system is going to take more than a few years In the meantime dealing with system peak loads is where attention should be focused Reregulation and wholesale market caps on prices harken back to the old system Its time to begin figuring out how to deal with these system peaks more creatively Ken

illustrate flaws in the system As the states booming economy taxes the ability to meet electricity demands a federal investigation is underway CHRIS KRAUL TIMES STAFF WRITER Aug Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page A Copyright The Times Mirror Company With Southern Californians reeling from skyrocketing electric bills critics charge that fewer than a dozen power suppliers are reaping far greater profits than are justified by the recent surge in wholesale prices of the natural gas they use to create electricity Their behavior is a major focus of a formal investigation announced last week by federal regulators Among those under scrutiny are power merchants including BDukeB BEnergyB BDynegyB BReliantB BEnergyB Calpine Southern Co and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Critics say the companies are earning huge windfalls selling energy to the two state agencies charged with distributing power in California The power merchants themselves deny any profiteering describing their market moves as legal business practices and welcoming the investigation The underlying cause of Californias energy turmoil is a severe shortage of powergenerating capacity to meet the soaring energy demands of the states booming economy This summer the state at times has had to import more than of its energy needs a shortfall equal to the output of about mediumsize power plants No plants of any size have been built in the state in years But the problem goes beyond a supplyanddemand imbalance The socalled merchant power companies ability to bend the market to their advantageusing what appear to be legal strategiesillustrates what many say are serious flaws in the states deregulated energy market One major flaw is that sellers do not have to participate in the states main electricity auctionthe socalled day forward sale held one day before electricity is delivered to the states residences and businesses Instead generators are withholding power until the day of delivery when desperate state agencies are willing to pay steep prices to keep the power flowing The upshot has been a doubling of electric bills for the million customers in San Diego GasElectrics coverage area and Southern California Edison and Pacific GasElectric customers may be facing higher prices once their rates are unfrozen in There is little prospect for shortterm relief with no additional power generation due for a year the prices of natural gas and crude oil are still rising In fact state officials expect the market to become tighter over the next year as demand and fuel prices rise In pointing the finger at the power merchants Gov Gray Davis some academics and utility executives charge that California consumers are being victimized by sophisticated trading techniques that take advantage of the market system to extract huge profits Deregulation only works if people act responsibly It wont work if people say their only goal is to make as much money as humanly possible Davis said last week This brokering takes place on the California Power Exchange and the Independent System Operator two agencies created by the legislation that ostensibly opened up of the states power marketrepresented by the PGE SCE and SDGE service areasto competition To create that competition lawmakers ordered the utilities to sell power plants to independent companies which now are selling electricity to the state The Power Exchange is a clearinghouse for the bulk of energy trading that is completed a day in advance of delivery which normally fills most of the states energy needs The ISO the nominal traffic cop arranging deliveries over the power grid also has the authority to hold sameday power auctions for immediate delivery in the event of unexpectedly high demand The Power Exchange is subject to a price cap of per megawatthour a ceiling imposed earlier this summer as prices began to soar But the ISO has the authority to pay as much as it has to for supplementary power if the previousday purchases prove insufficient to keep the states lights on And it is the secondary ISO market where power suppliers leveraging a sellers market are holding sway By withholding their energy from the Power Exchange and opting instead to bid their supply to the ISO they are betting that sameday shortages will generate prices as close to the price cap as possible possibly even above it Its apparently working On some days the ISO has ended up buying onefifth of the states energy needs not the to maximum originally envisioned In the process desperate to meet demand the ISO is paying premium prices and those prices are being passed along to consumers The problem with the market apparently defies easy solutions At an emergency meeting Friday to discuss ways of dealing with the crisis the ISO board rejected a staff proposal to force energy merchants to allocate at least of the electricity they intend to sell in the day forward auction held by the Power Exchange instead of holding back until the day of delivery Although ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure would restore some market order the board rejected it on fears that it might create unforeseen ramifications possibly even power suppliers abandoning the state altogether As the market stands now independent power companies have been able to exploit the power shortages and the markets quirks to charge the state higher rates than the increases in the price of natural gas would seem to warrant said Severin Borenstein a UC Berkeley professor and energy specialist With fellow UC Berkeley professor James Bushnell and Stanfords Frank Wolak Borenstein studied the Power Exchange over a month period ended in September and found evidence of market power or the power generators ability to raise prices above competitive levels for sustained periods Unless there is collusion among two or more power providers the exercise of market power is not illegal experts say But if prolonged it is a symptom of a seriously dysfunctional market I think market power has probably gotten worse this year There are players big enough to move the price and move it a lot Prices are clearly way above their costs Borenstein said Edison CEO John Bryson and Stephen Baum head of SDGE parent Sempra Energy have similar criticisms Their claims will be investigated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the latest of five probes underway into Californias worsening energy predicament Well see whether there are alternative market rules that should be adopted to have a better functioning more efficient market said Daniel Larcamp FERCs director of market tariffs and rates Looking at market power issues is an important focus of our investigation Power suppliers Duke Energy and Calpine denied any market manipulation saying the bulk of their energy is sold on longterm contracts and is not used to unduly sway dayahead prices on the Power Exchange or sameday sales on the ISO No way are we manipulating the market and we have welcomed investigation into our business practices said Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energys California regional office in Morro Bay Its easy to point fingers at someone who controls only of the market much of which has already been sold in the forward market months ago Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander said the high prices are simply a case of demand far outstripping the states ability to meet it Ten years ago you had more supply than demand Now you have a skyrocketing demand from population growth a robust economy and Internetfed additions to demand Highlander said Charles Cicchetti a USC professor of government business and the economy agrees and said the market is performing exactly as expected given supply shortages He objects to the limited price ceilings opposed by state officials The choice should be to either regulate the whole thing go back to where we were or let the market work Cicchetti said This hybrid is causing problems to get worse But something appears to be worsening an already bad pricing situation and critics believe it is market manipulation In the FERC order initiating its investigation the agency noted that Californias wholesale electricity costs on June were milliona sevenfold increase over the same date in Over the same period natural gas prices only doubled FERC will look at other aspects of the states energy deregulation as wellat the fact that utilities have no choice but to purchase power from the central power exchange and have only limited power to hedge or make bilateral deals on their own with outside firms In an interview last week the FERCs Larcamp said his agency is reserving the right to roll back rates order refunds or even impose a new market framework to replace the Power Exchange and ISO Larcamp said the FERCs probe will contrast Californias troubled power market with the PennsylvaniaMarylandNew Jersey system which gives end users more freedom to cut their own deals with suppliers The result is that Pennsylvania has more than power suppliers competing for the states business versus no more than in California Times staff writers Nancy Vogel and Nancy Rivera Brooks

interesting perspective Forwarded by Peggy MahoneyHOUEES on PM on AM To cc Subject Industry News Consumers Grow More Anxious As They Are Cut Loose In BElectricitys fyi from Emailed by Dow Jones Interactive R Server Software Folder Industry News Headlines Consumers Grow More Anxious As They Are Cut Loose In BElectricitysB New Free Market Metropolitan Desk Section Feeling Powerless In Consumers Grow More Anxious As They Are Cut Loose In BElectricitysB New Free Market By KIRK JOHNSON Aug New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Over the last years a dogma has taken root in America that says people would be happier and better off if they were all continually shopping for the best deals Consumers according to this theory should be empowered and freed from the old business monopolies and the dictates of fussy bureaucrats So airlines were deregulated and telephone service and then the Internet arrived giving people the ability to choose from different sellers of the same merchandise The bull market on Wall Street brought mutual funds begging for attention Having more choices became an end in itself But for millions of people especially in New York and California the doctrine of the sovereign consumer has come into question this summer around a commodity that most had taken completely for granted BelectricityB A recently deregulated BenergyB market which was supposed to increase choices and reduce prices has for most residents done nothing of the kind Many community leaders and politicians calling for investigations and caps on rising BelectricityB bills up percent to percent from those of last August in many areas have denounced BenergyB BderegulationB as either a failure or a fraud Some social scientists say that the anxiety over BenergyB is exposing something even deeper in the human wiring At a time when protesters have railed in Seattle and Washington against chain stores and global branding and prominent social critics have denounced the intrusion of endless choice into every corner of life a phenomenon that Barry Schwartz a psychologist at Swarthmore College calls the tyranny of freedom the publics worries about BelectricityB may say more about human nature than about kilowatts Perhaps this alternative theory says there is a point at which people no longer wish to be autonomous rational consumers at all Maybe they would just as soon delegate their decisions regarding some transactions as they did when Consolidated Edison was the only game in town and government was assigned to make sure that the company played by the rules Maybe when it comes to BelectricityB a mysterious and dangerous thing that is also the foundation of modern living Americans are just a little afraid to be alone In the past we trusted that state regulators who were appointed by our elected officials were watching out for us which may or may not have been true said Edward A Smeloff a former utility industry official who runs a research group on BelectricityB at Pace University The new model is Figure it out for yourself Some economists and BenergyB industry experts say the sense of powerlessness and confusion that many people feel is perhaps as much a source of anxiety and anger as higher BelectricityB bills The players have all changed and no one seems to be in charge The old Brooklyn Union Gas Company for example still remembered by many New York residents for the fuzzy feelgood images of its advertising has become the cool and metallicsounding KeySpan BEnergyB The old Con Ed on the other hand was like a crotchety grandfather who sometimes had to be prodded and yelled at but who nonetheless presided over the system The company now throws up its hands and says it is not responsible for recent price increases Con Eds wires are simply a delivery mechanism for the unregulated corporations that own generating plants Con Eds chairman said at a recent hearing at City Hall Opinion poll takers say anxiety about deregulation may also have something to do with a contradiction in the American psyche that they say has opened up in recent years a contradiction about what people really want Surveys conducted by Yankelovich Partners a research and consulting firm based in Norwalk Conn have said for example that a majority of people want more control over the details of their lives but a majority also want to simplify their lives a result that Barbara R Caplan a partner at the firm has called the paradox of our time Deregulated BenergyB arrived right in the middle of those conflicting goals because only a handful of BenergyB competitors have been attracted to the New York market most people still do not have much choice in their BelectricityB and yet it all seems more complicated than ever as well as more expensive Another factor some researchers say may be a result of timing People have had experience with deregulation and they have seen that it did not always unfold to their benefit The hubandspoke system developed by the airline industry for example has given airlines nearmonopoly power at many airports around the country resulting in less competition not more Consumers have also seen that although tools like the Internet have made buyers more powerful in getting good prices corporations on the other side of the transaction have become more powerful too in gathering information about them Years ago you went into an auto dealership and had to negotiate to buy a car but only the corporate side had knowledge of what the real costs were said Mark L Gillenson a professor of management information systems at the University of Memphis Now you go into the Internet and lots of places will give you that information for free On the other hand Professor Gillenson said the data that corporations are collecting about people are creating what the old car dealer could never have imagined knowledge about what people want before they even ask Lurking behind all those forces some psychologists say is the growing sense that people are simply being asked to decide too much Economic deregulation has accompanied what may be called social deregulation as issues that were not even considered decisions in the past have become issues of conscious choice whether to get married and have children or how to express oneself sexually as gay straight or somewhere in between And the more choices there are the more it can seem possible to achieve an ideal result in every case leading to a doomed treadmill kind of behavior often seen in people who continually change their longdistance telephone service as they endlessly seek an incremental price advantage Over what domains in life are you supposed to have control said Professor Schwartz the Swarthmore College psychologist Nobody gets depressed when you cant control the weather and years ago nobody got depressed because they couldnt control your telecommunications or BelectricityB either because those things couldnt be controlled he said But now you can or youre told that you can and so youre going to be continually frustrated And BelectricityB is also just different Unlike a telephone call or an airline ticket nobody ever really wants to buy BelectricityB itself rather people buy its expression and result a cold beer in the fridge a light to read by By the standards of American marketing it is barely a product at all People want to make choices about clothes and restaurants and what houses they live in but a lot of us would rather not be bothered with having to make a choice about BelectricityB said Wendy Kaminer a public policy fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Cambridge Mass Its not a desire to be disempowered Ms Kaminer added Its a desire not to be bothered Finally some experts think that the long bull market for stocks in which share prices mostly just go up has made people forget a fundamental truth about how markets work they are genuinely fair only over the long run while at any given time there are likely to be as many losers as winners Deregulation and privatization were sold implicitly on the assumption that everybody can win from this but Im hard pressed to find an example in the real world where that has happened said Willis Emmons a professor in the strategy public policy and ethics department at Georgetown Universitys business school Right now Professor Emmons added maybe somebody is winning but it isnt the consumer NYTF To view all headlines in the folder Industry News go to browsearticlesaspfolderid To go to the

Industry News Headlines Duplicity and demagoguery on electricity OPINION Duplicity and demagoguery on electricity Richard Nemec Nemec is a Los Angelesbased writer who covers the energy industry Aug San Diego UnionTribune Page B B Copyright The current brouhaha surrounding San Diego BelectricityB bills is a poignant reminder of just how politicized an issue can become under the rubric of fostering the public good In this case Californias sevenyear BelectricB industry BderegulationB effort with complete support and crafting from the Democraticcontrolled state Legislature is being made the whipping boy for the current price spikes The truth is anything but Nevertheless facts have never stopped elected officials politically appointed regulators or consumer advocates as they try to elbow one another out of the way to be seen by consumers as their patron saint In the debate over this summers high power bills it is the very folks who are screaming the loudest who have contributed the most to the crisis Among the culprits Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon the Legislature Public Utilities Commission member Carl Wood and San Diego GasElectric Co each has contributed to the bills going through the roof But having said that it never has been nor does it need to be a crisis for the state or for San Diego County California will survive the current electrical bumps and grinds but it may not survive the political fallout It is now clear that two Gov Gray Davis appointees Wood and CPUC President Loretta Lynch want to reregulate the electric industry as does Sen Peace SDGE unfortunately was dumb enough to help establish the climate that has allowed them to demagogue the issue and escalate its importance way out of proportion Start with a recent assault by Wood to declare that a radical deregulation policy driven by ideology rather than economic soundness has created a crisis The cornerstone of the problem as Wood sees it is that there havent been any major power plants built in the state in more than a decade It is also true that when Californias electric restructuring law was unanimously passed four years ago there was an oversupply of generation capacity within the state Wood wants to turn that around by mandating utilitybuilt power plants Wood knows all too well that more than a dozen major generation plants are under construction or in the states lethargic approval process right now If magically they could all be built by next summer California would be awash in electrons They cant but there is the prospect for getting ahead of the curve by the summer of if the state Gov Davis most specifically does something to accelerate the current siting approval process Earlier this month the governor set in motion work to streamline the siting process Regulatory intervention some call it reregulation is what Peace has had on his mind at least since winter when at an energy discussion held in San Diego he sounded the drumbeat for the government to try to correct what he perceives as failings in the market At the same time he and his colleagues in the Legislature for the past couple of years have stymied CPUC moves to step up the deregulation process for both natural gas and electricity Most notably Peace engineered a bipartisan rider in this years budget bill that prevented the states utilities from buying some of their power supplies outside the statecreated power exchange That move and SDGEs passive financial management helped eliminate one means of lessening the current electric bill shock There are further design flaws in Californias restructured electricity market initiated by Peace to buffer San Diego from having the highest priced power in the state that have complicated the newly developing market and for which politicians take no responsibility Finally there is SDGE which clings to its own selfproclaimed fiction that it is only an energy delivery service and holds no responsibility for what has happened to the million households and businesses using the juice it delivers In fact however the utility company could have taken some steps in the spring in terms of financial riskmanagement instruments offered through the California power exchange that would have lowered the price spike It also could have been more aggressive in promoting conservation by customers Subsequently SDGE has been tripping all over itself making emergency filings to the CPUC seeking authorizations it could have aggressively pursued before the crisis The regulators granted everything it asked for finally on Aug But SDGE does have a generating role it still has a percent interest in the San Onofre nuclear plant and a corporate affiliate operates a new power plant in Nevada And guess where that plant sold all of its power

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDD ConsultRCIcom IssueAlert August A Return to Regulation California Problems Spark National Trend By Will McNamara DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDD With state power reserves falling below percent for the second straight day and the demand for electricity continuing to increase the California Independent System Operator CAISO issued a Stage Two electrical emergen cy on Tuesday A Stage Two Emergency is a serious occurrence as it signals that electric operating reserves in the state have fallen below percent The CalISO has issued over Stage Two emergencies this summer leaving little doubt that the power supply problem in California has reached disastrous proportions Other states and foreign countries such as Japan that have deregulated their energy marketsor are about to do sohave kept a cl ose eye on the problems in California These problems have sparked a national debate over whether returning to or maintaining a regulated energy market is a better option ANALYSIS Ive been tracking the chronic problems facing California in RCIs IssueAlerts for several months so for further background please visit our archives at the link offered below Yet generally speaking its fairly obvious that the promises of deregulation in California have not materialized Limited transmission lines the fact that no new power plants have been built in almost two decades and a percent increase in demand have driven costs up in California instead of down On Tuesday approximately MW of power was consumed topping Mondays peak of MW Exacerbating the already tight supplies is the fact that some MW of generation mostly in Southern California are unavailable due to power plant mechanical failures However perhaps even more pertinent is a movement that I am seeing develop both within California and other states that arguably is a direct result of the problems weve seen on the West Coast This movement is founded on a platform that suggests deregulated energy markets should become regula ted once again and those states that havent adopted a restructuring plan should take a timeout and reconsider if competition truly offers more benefits than headaches Not surprisingly California lawmakers and consumer advocatesblaming deregulation for the high rates that customers of San Diego Gas Electric are now payin g suggested that the California market should become reregulated Proposals included imposing more governmental control over energy prices which led to the recent lowering of the price cap in the state to MW to having utility companies buy back all the power plants they were forced to sell only two years ago But the discussion of reregulation has not been limited to California The New York City Council for instance has posted a bill that would give the City authority to regulate the output of lead into the atmosphere As lead is a small part of the pollution generated by power plants if this bill passes the City would have a handle on power generation that it does not now have Even more striking is the coalition of lowcost energy states that have petitioned Congress to exempt them from participating in deregulation The LowCost Electricity States Initiative LCESI actually has been in existence for over a year but is gaining momentum again now that it can use California as an example of all that is wrong with deregulation Some of these states only want to open their wholesale markets to competition but not their retail markets Others want to avoid deregulation altogether As a lobbying group the LCESI has tried to convince Congress that any federal restructuring law should be secondary to state plans and that any mandate regarding state participation in deregulation will be appealed Other lowcost states have started to drag their heels regarding deregulati on even if they have not officially joined LCESI Iowa for instance recently decided that it wont even pursue the issue of deregulation during the session of its legislature upon the urging of the states largest utility MidAmerican Energy New Mexico which had previously approved a start date of Jan for electric competition now has delayed that start date until Jan to further investigate the impact that competition will have on the state On the other hand two states that are moving forward with their Jan start datesIllinois and Ohiocontinue to watch California closely bu t think such problems will be averted in their own states Ohio points to the fact that its rate freeze wont be lifted for five years which will protect residents from the kind of price spikes now hurting customers in San Diego Illinois customers also will benefit from a longer rate freeze and the fact that regulators in the statehaving watched problems regard ing supply materialize in Californiaallowed for incumbent utilities to dive st of their power plants but did not mandate it Thus importing power from the wholesale market wont be as necessary in Illinois as it is in Californ ia However between the members of LCESI and the approximately states that have adopted some form of a restructuring plan the United States is almost evenly divided with regard to states that would or would not be participating in deregulation But realistically would states even be allowed to optout from electric competition Perhaps this might work on the wholesale market but ultimately I cannot see half of the US state s retreating from retail competition if the other half is participating When educated properly about the true benefits of competition electric customersespecially industrial and commercial customerswill push fo r competition within their states or go to states where they can choose their energy provider In addition because of the way the nations transmission grid is structured it would be near impossible to transport power any great distance if states along the way refuse to grant access to their transmission lines Moreover perhaps it is not entirely wise to use California as a test examp le for how deregulation will work nationally as the LCESI is now attempting to do First California clearly made some mistakes in its own restructurin g plan not the least of which was the combination of mandating divestiture and not allowing new plants to be built ultimately leaving the state with power supply problems But other states are learning from these mistakes and developing better restructuring plans Second states such as Pennsylva nia have adopted longer periods for rate freezes and stranded cost recovery thus protecting customers from price spikes for a longer period Third deregulation in California has only been in effect for two and half years To write it off as a failure

BDeregulationB Aug Dow Jones Online News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc CHICAGO Dow Jones BElectricityB BderegulationB has suffered a setback in California as the state grapples with short supply and rising prices But other states are pushing ahead with opening their BpowerB markets to competition saying their approach should avoid the problems plaguing the state which led the nation down the BderegulationB path four years ago California has seen its BpowerB market roiled by heat waves that left the state scrambling to meet demand and by soaring prices in San Diego and southern Orange County the first region of the country to have its BpowerB market completely BderegulatedB California is giving deregulation a bad name said Texas state Sen David Sibley a Republican who helped craft the bill to deregulate that states power industry But I still feel good about the bill we passed I feel even better about it Deregulation backers outside of California said that states experience has been sullied by two basic shortcomings insufficient power generation to cover the states demand and the exposure of retail customers to market rates before a competitive retail market had emerged By contrast Texas expects to have plenty of power generation on hand when it opens its retail power markets to competition on Jan Unlike California where uncertain market conditions local opposition and until recently insufficient power prices have kept power plant developers waiting in the wings Texas has attracted billions of dollars in new powerplant investment More than megawatts will be added to the Texas grid before competition begins according to reports on new power plants Thats an increase of about over the states current generating capacity The bill they passed did not send the right signals to the market Sibley said of California a Texas legislators visited before addressing the issue in We learned from California what we did not want to do Like Texas Michigan hopes its success in attracting powerplant developers to the state will help it avoid Californias problems when it allows customers to start choosing their power providers on Jan According to Gary Kitts chief administrative officer at the Michigan Public Service Commission attracting independent power producers is a key element for creating healthy competition and prices at the retail level Michigan is only in the early stages of writing the rules that will restructure its power markets but major developers already have begun to show interest in building new plants in the state Only days after the state passed its restructuring bills this spring Dallasbased Panda Energy International Inc a privately held company announced plans to build a megawatt plant by late Two new merchant plants already have broken ground and three more are in the planning stage Kitts said Likewise Ohio regulators are hoping new power plant development will spark healthy competition at the wholesale and retail level when competition debuts Jan We have quite a bit of generation going in the next year said Ed Hess chief of the electricity division at the Ohio Public Utility Commission Ohio companies like Cinergy Corp CIN and FirstEnergy Corp FE are either planning new Ohio generators or have recently brought new plants on line Like Michigan Ohio companies wont have to sell off their plants as a condition of deregulation and expose themselves to wholesale price spikes as California utilities have had to do Also the state probably wont see wholesale price caps similar to a per megawatthour cap approved last week by Californias grid operator Hess said While caps can protect consumers from bloated wholesale power prices in the short term they can worsen the problem ultimately by deterring development of the new power plants needed to correct supply shortages said Sam Rendazzo a lawyer who represents an Ohio industrial users group Youre basically damping the pricing that developers are looking for he said California is perhaps the most dramatic evidence of a market thats not functioning In addition to counting on new generation deregulation advocates outside California also plan to insulate consumers from wholesale price swings until competitive retail markets exist Under the Texas restructuring law utility rates are frozen until the debut of competition At that time rates will drop and hold there for three years or until a utility has shed of its customers to competing retail suppliers There will be no authority to change rates until competition exists said a Texas Public Utilities Commission spokeswoman Michigan will also freeze its rates Kitts said for three or five years depending on the customer in hopes giving competitive markets time to develop Nevertheless Californias highprofile woes are making it harder to push deregulation elsewhere Oklahoma for example has set a target of mid for the start of retail competition But the state has yet to work out the details in legislation The Oklahoma House of Representatives defeated a bill in the final hour of this years session and a lawmaker said Californias problems will make deregulation a tougher sell in Compiled

bring an additional million funding to encourage energy conservation in our region said Edwin A Guiles president of SDGE This money can be used to help replace old inefficient appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators which will result in reduced electric bills and less strain on our states electricsupply system Of the million SDGE would allocate an additional million exclusively for lowincome energyefficiency assistance programs over the next two years Under the proposal filed Friday the lowincome assistance funds will be used to expand existing programs such as refrigerator and evaporative cooler replacements while introducing new programs including room airconditioner replacements and evaporative cooler maintenance and repair The program also includes incentives for landlords to replace refrigerators and air conditioners in rental units The rest of the money would go into other energyefficiency programs to provide incentives for removal and recycling of operating second refrigerators refrigerator and room airconditioner replacement replacement of inefficient pool pumps and increased incentives for a variety of programs to benefit small businesses Funds for these additional incentives come from programs that did not draw as much customer participation as expected For instance large customers requested less than half the amount budgeted for a program designed to provide energyefficiency incentives to them Details on the programs are still being developed but they should be in place in early September The CPUC is expected to act on SDGEs filing in late August In Californias newly created competitive energy marketplace SDGE is a deliveryservice provider For those customers who have not chosen another energy service provider SDGE buys electricity from the California Power Exchange CalPX and passes that cost directly onto its customers with no markup The price of power is now a function of supply and demand in the open market Over the last several weeks SDGE customers have seen their electric bills rise sharply due to the significant increase in commodity costs as a result of power demand in California and surrounding states Fridays proposal marks the latest in a series of actions SDGE has taken recently to help customers grapple with high electric prices On July SDGE and the CalPX proposed a new marketbased power bidding solution to the CPUC that would allow SDGE to procure power for customers with less price volatility over the next five to nine months On July SDGE filed a request with the CPUC to accelerate the return of million in customer money from a CPUCcontrolled account The CPUCs approval of SDGEs request would release of money acquired from powergenerating benefits of San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and other assets would decrease the August and September residential electric bills by or a month That proposal combined with the deregulationdividend checks most SDGE customers will receive next month will result in a total of about million benefit to them in August and September nearly for the typical residential customer helping to ease cashflow problems from higher electricity prices The company is actively promoting a levelpay program to all customers which enables them to even out their bill payments over the course of the year so they can manage better against their monthly household budget Those customers participating in the plan will see bills this summer that are comparable to last summers bills SDGE also has increased communications to both residential and business customers regarding the changes in the energy marketplace available energyefficiency funding and conservation tips for reducing electric bills Information about these programs is available by calling

Business Heats Up With Dereg Under FireEnron Calif Elec Business Heats Up By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones While federal regulators try to find a way to stabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California Enron Corp ENE has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities to sell them fixedprice power at a lower rate In the past month the Houstonbased electricity service provider entered into longterm fixedrate contracts with the city of Roseville and is negotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista Both of those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas Electric Co a unit of Sempra Energy Inc SRE and pay market rates for electricity Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels Resorts Worldwide Inc HOT one of the worlds largest hospitality companies to sell the company electricity at a fixed rate for the next years The company has four hotels in California three of which buy their power from SDGE Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel power at about cents per kilowatthour compared with the centsKWh Starwood said it was charged by SDGE in August Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal But Starwood said it expects to reduce its energy costs by more than million over the next years Enron the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the US will purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its experience to manage the risks while paying a fee to utilities like SDGE for use of their distribution networks That really is our core strength said Harold Buchanan chief operating officer for Enron Energy Services North America We understand how to manage those risks High Rates Driving Industrial Customers Cities To Switch The growing interest in fixedprice supply contracts is fueling a comeback of sorts for Enron The Houstonbased company had tried to break into Californias retail power market just after deregulation even spending nearly million to advertise the venture during the Super Bowl But Enron gave up trying to win residential customers in citing disappointing response and lowerthanexpected profits That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of promise Oddly enough now that deregulation is coming under attack in California soaring power prices are building demand for Enrons services The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are interested in signing longterm fixedrate contracts Buchanan said Overall what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego thats written in stone Buchanan said Its far cheaper than what theyre paying now with the utilities A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to comment The city of Roseville near Sacramento entered into a million contract with Enron last month to purchase megawatts of electricity for five years at per megawatthour Furthermore the city has started talks with Enron about building and operating a megawatt natural gasfired power plant that city officials expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price spikes that have plagued customers of SDGE since June San Marcos in San Diego County is proposing to switch electricity service for its residents to Enron from SDGE a move the City Council said could shave about million a year off the citys power bill Enron has said it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville An SDGE spokesman said last week that the utility supports such arrangements saying theyre one way deregulation is supposed to work Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDGE itself for four years at a fixed rate of centsKWh but the utility said the price was too high California Gov Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap electricity rates for SDGEs customers at centsKWh By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Folder Name Enron Energy

BDeregulationB Aug Dow Jones Online News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc CHICAGO Dow Jones BElectricityB BderegulationB has suffered a setback in California as the state grapples with short supply and rising prices But other states are pushing ahead with opening their BpowerB markets to competition saying their approach should avoid the problems plaguing the state which led the nation down the BderegulationB path four years ago California has seen its BpowerB market roiled by heat waves that left the state scrambling to meet demand and by soaring prices in San Diego and southern Orange County the first region of the country to have its BpowerB market completely BderegulatedB California is giving deregulation a bad name said Texas state Sen David Sibley a Republican who helped craft the bill to deregulate that states power industry But I still feel good about the bill we passed I feel even better about it Deregulation backers outside of California said that states experience has been sullied by two basic shortcomings insufficient power generation to cover the states demand and the exposure of retail customers to market rates before a competitive retail market had emerged By contrast Texas expects to have plenty of power generation on hand when it opens its retail power markets to competition on Jan Unlike California where uncertain market conditions local opposition and until recently insufficient power prices have kept power plant developers waiting in the wings Texas has attracted billions of dollars in new powerplant investment More than megawatts will be added to the Texas grid before competition begins according to reports on new power plants Thats an increase of about over the states current generating capacity The bill they passed did not send the right signals to the market Sibley said of California a Texas legislators visited before addressing the issue in We learned from California what we did not want to do Like Texas Michigan hopes its success in attracting powerplant developers to the state will help it avoid Californias problems when it allows customers to start choosing their power providers on Jan According to Gary Kitts chief administrative officer at the Michigan Public Service Commission attracting independent power producers is a key element for creating healthy competition and prices at the retail level Michigan is only in the early stages of writing the rules that will restructure its power markets but major developers already have begun to show interest in building new plants in the state Only days after the state passed its restructuring bills this spring Dallasbased Panda Energy International Inc a privately held company announced plans to build a megawatt plant by late Two new merchant plants already have broken ground and three more are in the planning stage Kitts said Likewise Ohio regulators are hoping new power plant development will spark healthy competition at the wholesale and retail level when competition debuts Jan We have quite a bit of generation going in the next year said Ed Hess chief of the electricity division at the Ohio Public Utility Commission Ohio companies like Cinergy Corp CIN and FirstEnergy Corp FE are either planning new Ohio generators or have recently brought new plants on line Like Michigan Ohio companies wont have to sell off their plants as a condition of deregulation and expose themselves to wholesale price spikes as California utilities have had to do Also the state probably wont see wholesale price caps similar to a per megawatthour cap approved last week by Californias grid operator Hess said While caps can protect consumers from bloated wholesale power prices in the short term they can worsen the problem ultimately by deterring development of the new power plants needed to correct supply shortages said Sam Rendazzo a lawyer who represents an Ohio industrial users group Youre basically damping the pricing that developers are looking for he said California is perhaps the most dramatic evidence of a market thats not functioning In addition to counting on new generation deregulation advocates outside California also plan to insulate consumers from wholesale price swings until competitive retail markets exist Under the Texas restructuring law utility rates are frozen until the debut of competition At that time rates will drop and hold there for three years or until a utility has shed of its customers to competing retail suppliers There will be no authority to change rates until competition exists said a Texas Public Utilities Commission spokeswoman Michigan will also freeze its rates Kitts said for three or five years depending on the customer in hopes giving competitive markets time to develop Nevertheless Californias highprofile woes are making it harder to push deregulation elsewhere Oklahoma for example has set a target of mid for the start of retail competition But the state has yet to work out the details in legislation The Oklahoma House of Representatives defeated a bill in the final hour of this years session and a lawmaker said Californias problems will make deregulation a tougher sell in Compiled

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDD ConsultRCIcom IssueAlert August A Return to Regulation California Problems Spark National Trend By Will McNamara DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDD With state power reserves falling below percent for the second straight day and the demand for electricity continuing to increase the California Independent System Operator CAISO issued a Stage Two electrical emergen cy on Tuesday A Stage Two Emergency is a serious occurrence as it signals that electric operating reserves in the state have fallen below percent The CalISO has issued over Stage Two emergencies this summer leaving little doubt that the power supply problem in California has reached disastrous proportions Other states and foreign countries such as Japan that have deregulated their energy marketsor are about to do sohave kept a cl ose eye on the problems in California These problems have sparked a national debate over whether returning to or maintaining a regulated energy market is a better option ANALYSIS Ive been tracking the chronic problems facing California in RCIs IssueAlerts for several months so for further background please visit our archives at the link offered below Yet generally speaking its fairly obvious that the promises of deregulation in California have not materialized Limited transmission lines the fact that no new power plants have been built in almost two decades and a percent increase in demand have driven costs up in California instead of down On Tuesday approximately MW of power was consumed topping Mondays peak of MW Exacerbating the already tight supplies is the fact that some MW of generation mostly in Southern California are unavailable due to power plant mechanical failures However perhaps even more pertinent is a movement that I am seeing develop both within California and other states that arguably is a direct result of the problems weve seen on the West Coast This movement is founded on a platform that suggests deregulated energy markets should become regula ted once again and those states that havent adopted a restructuring plan should take a timeout and reconsider if competition truly offers more benefits than headaches Not surprisingly California lawmakers and consumer advocatesblaming deregulation for the high rates that customers of San Diego Gas Electric are now payin g suggested that the California market should become reregulated Proposals included imposing more governmental control over energy prices which led to the recent lowering of the price cap in the state to MW to having utility companies buy back all the power plants they were forced to sell only two years ago But the discussion of reregulation has not been limited to California The New York City Council for instance has posted a bill that would give the City authority to regulate the output of lead into the atmosphere As lead is a small part of the pollution generated by power plants if this bill passes the City would have a handle on power generation that it does not now have Even more striking is the coalition of lowcost energy states that have petitioned Congress to exempt them from participating in deregulation The LowCost Electricity States Initiative LCESI actually has been in existence for over a year but is gaining momentum again now that it can use California as an example of all that is wrong with deregulation Some of these states only want to open their wholesale markets to competition but not their retail markets Others want to avoid deregulation altogether As a lobbying group the LCESI has tried to convince Congress that any federal restructuring law should be secondary to state plans and that any mandate regarding state participation in deregulation will be appealed Other lowcost states have started to drag their heels regarding deregulati on even if they have not officially joined LCESI Iowa for instance recently decided that it wont even pursue the issue of deregulation during the session of its legislature upon the urging of the states largest utility MidAmerican Energy New Mexico which had previously approved a start date of Jan for electric competition now has delayed that start date until Jan to further investigate the impact that competition will have on the state On the other hand two states that are moving forward with their Jan start datesIllinois and Ohiocontinue to watch California closely bu t think such problems will be averted in their own states Ohio points to the fact that its rate freeze wont be lifted for five years which will protect residents from the kind of price spikes now hurting customers in San Diego Illinois customers also will benefit from a longer rate freeze and the fact that regulators in the statehaving watched problems regard ing supply materialize in Californiaallowed for incumbent utilities to dive st of their power plants but did not mandate it Thus importing power from the wholesale market wont be as necessary in Illinois as it is in Californ ia However between the members of LCESI and the approximately states that have adopted some form of a restructuring plan the United States is almost evenly divided with regard to states that would or would not be participating in deregulation But realistically would states even be allowed to optout from electric competition Perhaps this might work on the wholesale market but ultimately I cannot see half of the US state s retreating from retail competition if the other half is participating When educated properly about the true benefits of competition electric customersespecially industrial and commercial customerswill push fo r competition within their states or go to states where they can choose their energy provider In addition because of the way the nations transmission grid is structured it would be near impossible to transport power any great distance if states along the way refuse to grant access to their transmission lines Moreover perhaps it is not entirely wise to use California as a test examp le for how deregulation will work nationally as the LCESI is now attempting to do First California clearly made some mistakes in its own restructurin g plan not the least of which was the combination of mandating divestiture and not allowing new plants to be built ultimately leaving the state with power supply problems But other states are learning from these mistakes and developing better restructuring plans Second states such as Pennsylva nia have adopted longer periods for rate freezes and stranded cost recovery thus protecting customers from price spikes for a longer period Third deregulation in California has only been in effect for two and half years To write it off as a failure

San Diego UnionTribune Page B B Copyright The current brouhaha surrounding San Diego BelectricityB bills is a poignant reminder of just how politicized an issue can become under the rubric of fostering the public good In this case Californias sevenyear BelectricB industry BderegulationB effort with complete support and crafting from the Democraticcontrolled state Legislature is being made the whipping boy for the current price spikes The truth is anything but Nevertheless facts have never stopped elected officials politically appointed regulators or consumer advocates as they try to elbow one another out of the way to be seen by consumers as their patron saint In the debate over this summers high power bills it is the very folks who are screaming the loudest who have contributed the most to the crisis Among the culprits Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon the Legislature Public Utilities Commission member Carl Wood and San Diego GasElectric Co each has contributed to the bills going through the roof But having said that it never has been nor does it need to be a crisis for the state or for San Diego County California will survive the current electrical bumps and grinds but it may not survive the political fallout It is now clear that two Gov Gray Davis appointees Wood and CPUC President Loretta Lynch want to reregulate the electric industry as does Sen Peace SDGE unfortunately was dumb enough to help establish the climate that has allowed them to demagogue the issue and escalate its importance way out of proportion Start with a recent assault by Wood to declare that a radical deregulation policy driven by ideology rather than economic soundness has created a crisis The cornerstone of the problem as Wood sees it is that there havent been any major power plants built in the state in more than a decade It is also true that when Californias electric restructuring law was unanimously passed four years ago there was an oversupply of generation capacity within the state Wood wants to turn that around by mandating utilitybuilt power plants Wood knows all too well that more than a dozen major generation plants are under construction or in the states lethargic approval process right now If magically they could all be built by next summer California would be awash in electrons They cant but there is the prospect for getting ahead of the curve by the summer of if the state Gov Davis most specifically does something to accelerate the current siting approval process Earlier this month the governor set in motion work to streamline the siting process Regulatory intervention some call it reregulation is what Peace has had on his mind at least since winter when at an energy discussion held in San Diego he sounded the drumbeat for the government to try to correct what he perceives as failings in the market At the same time he and his colleagues in the Legislature for the past couple of years have stymied CPUC moves to step up the deregulation process for both natural gas and electricity Most notably Peace engineered a bipartisan rider in this years budget bill that prevented the states utilities from buying some of their power supplies outside the statecreated power exchange That move and SDGEs passive financial management helped eliminate one means of lessening the current electric bill shock There are further design flaws in Californias restructured electricity market initiated by Peace to buffer San Diego from having the highest priced power in the state that have complicated the newly developing market and for which politicians take no responsibility Finally there is SDGE which clings to its own selfproclaimed fiction that it is only an energy delivery service and holds no responsibility for what has happened to the million households and businesses using the juice it delivers In fact however the utility company could have taken some steps in the spring in terms of financial riskmanagement instruments offered through the California power exchange that would have lowered the price spike It also could have been more aggressive in promoting conservation by customers Subsequently SDGE has been tripping all over itself making emergency filings to the CPUC seeking authorizations it could have aggressively pursued before the crisis The regulators granted everything it asked for finally on Aug But SDGE does have a generating role it still has a percent interest in the San Onofre nuclear plant and a corporate affiliate operates a new power plant in Nevada And guess where that plant sold all of its power

Consumers Grow More Anxious As They Are Cut Loose In BElectricitysB New Free Market By KIRK JOHNSON Aug New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Over the last years a dogma has taken root in America that says people would be happier and better off if they were all continually shopping for the best deals Consumers according to this theory should be empowered and freed from the old business monopolies and the dictates of fussy bureaucrats So airlines were deregulated and telephone service and then the Internet arrived giving people the ability to choose from different sellers of the same merchandise The bull market on Wall Street brought mutual funds begging for attention Having more choices became an end in itself But for millions of people especially in New York and California the doctrine of the sovereign consumer has come into question this summer around a commodity that most had taken completely for granted BelectricityB A recently deregulated BenergyB market which was supposed to increase choices and reduce prices has for most residents done nothing of the kind Many community leaders and politicians calling for investigations and caps on rising BelectricityB bills up percent to percent from those of last August in many areas have denounced BenergyB BderegulationB as either a failure or a fraud Some social scientists say that the anxiety over BenergyB is exposing something even deeper in the human wiring At a time when protesters have railed in Seattle and Washington against chain stores and global branding and prominent social critics have denounced the intrusion of endless choice into every corner of life a phenomenon that Barry Schwartz a psychologist at Swarthmore College calls the tyranny of freedom the publics worries about BelectricityB may say more about human nature than about kilowatts Perhaps this alternative theory says there is a point at which people no longer wish to be autonomous rational consumers at all Maybe they would just as soon delegate their decisions regarding some transactions as they did when Consolidated Edison was the only game in town and government was assigned to make sure that the company played by the rules Maybe when it comes to BelectricityB a mysterious and dangerous thing that is also the foundation of modern living Americans are just a little afraid to be alone In the past we trusted that state regulators who were appointed by our elected officials were watching out for us which may or may not have been true said Edward A Smeloff a former utility industry official who runs a research group on BelectricityB at Pace University The new model is Figure it out for yourself Some economists and BenergyB industry experts say the sense of powerlessness and confusion that many people feel is perhaps as much a source of anxiety and anger as higher BelectricityB bills The players have all changed and no one seems to be in charge The old Brooklyn Union Gas Company for example still remembered by many New York residents for the fuzzy feelgood images of its advertising has become the cool and metallicsounding KeySpan BEnergyB The old Con Ed on the other hand was like a crotchety grandfather who sometimes had to be prodded and yelled at but who nonetheless presided over the system The company now throws up its hands and says it is not responsible for recent price increases Con Eds wires are simply a delivery mechanism for the unregulated corporations that own generating plants Con Eds chairman said at a recent hearing at City Hall Opinion poll takers say anxiety about deregulation may also have something to do with a contradiction in the American psyche that they say has opened up in recent years a contradiction about what people really want Surveys conducted by Yankelovich Partners a research and consulting firm based in Norwalk Conn have said for example that a majority of people want more control over the details of their lives but a majority also want to simplify their lives a result that Barbara R Caplan a partner at the firm has called the paradox of our time Deregulated BenergyB arrived right in the middle of those conflicting goals because only a handful of BenergyB competitors have been attracted to the New York market most people still do not have much choice in their BelectricityB and yet it all seems more complicated than ever as well as more expensive Another factor some researchers say may be a result of timing People have had experience with deregulation and they have seen that it did not always unfold to their benefit The hubandspoke system developed by the airline industry for example has given airlines nearmonopoly power at many airports around the country resulting in less competition not more Consumers have also seen that although tools like the Internet have made buyers more powerful in getting good prices corporations on the other side of the transaction have become more powerful too in gathering information about them Years ago you went into an auto dealership and had to negotiate to buy a car but only the corporate side had knowledge of what the real costs were said Mark L Gillenson a professor of management information systems at the University of Memphis Now you go into the Internet and lots of places will give you that information for free On the other hand Professor Gillenson said the data that corporations are collecting about people are creating what the old car dealer could never have imagined knowledge about what people want before they even ask Lurking behind all those forces some psychologists say is the growing sense that people are simply being asked to decide too much Economic deregulation has accompanied what may be called social deregulation as issues that were not even considered decisions in the past have become issues of conscious choice whether to get married and have children or how to express oneself sexually as gay straight or somewhere in between And the more choices there are the more it can seem possible to achieve an ideal result in every case leading to a doomed treadmill kind of behavior often seen in people who continually change their longdistance telephone service as they endlessly seek an incremental price advantage Over what domains in life are you supposed to have control said Professor Schwartz the Swarthmore College psychologist Nobody gets depressed when you cant control the weather and years ago nobody got depressed because they couldnt control your telecommunications or BelectricityB either because those things couldnt be controlled he said But now you can or youre told that you can and so youre going to be continually frustrated And BelectricityB is also just different Unlike a telephone call or an airline ticket nobody ever really wants to buy BelectricityB itself rather people buy its expression and result a cold beer in the fridge a light to read by By the standards of American marketing it is barely a product at all People want to make choices about clothes and restaurants and what houses they live in but a lot of us would rather not be bothered with having to make a choice about BelectricityB said Wendy Kaminer a public policy fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Cambridge Mass Its not a desire to be disempowered Ms Kaminer added Its a desire not to be bothered Finally some experts think that the long bull market for stocks in which share prices mostly just go up has made people forget a fundamental truth about how markets work they are genuinely fair only over the long run while at any given time there are likely to be as many losers as winners Deregulation and privatization were sold implicitly on the assumption that everybody can win from this but Im hard pressed to find an example in the real world where that has happened said Willis Emmons a professor in the strategy public policy and ethics department at Georgetown Universitys business school Right now Professor Emmons added maybe somebody is winning but it isnt the consumer NYTF To view all headlines in the folder Industry News go to browsearticlesaspfolderid To go to the

illustrate flaws in the system As the states booming economy taxes the ability to meet electricity demands a federal investigation is underway CHRIS KRAUL TIMES STAFF WRITER Aug Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page A Copyright The Times Mirror Company With Southern Californians reeling from skyrocketing electric bills critics charge that fewer than a dozen power suppliers are reaping far greater profits than are justified by the recent surge in wholesale prices of the natural gas they use to create electricity Their behavior is a major focus of a formal investigation announced last week by federal regulators Among those under scrutiny are power merchants including BDukeB BEnergyB BDynegyB BReliantB BEnergyB Calpine Southern Co and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Critics say the companies are earning huge windfalls selling energy to the two state agencies charged with distributing power in California The power merchants themselves deny any profiteering describing their market moves as legal business practices and welcoming the investigation The underlying cause of Californias energy turmoil is a severe shortage of powergenerating capacity to meet the soaring energy demands of the states booming economy This summer the state at times has had to import more than of its energy needs a shortfall equal to the output of about mediumsize power plants No plants of any size have been built in the state in years But the problem goes beyond a supplyanddemand imbalance The socalled merchant power companies ability to bend the market to their advantageusing what appear to be legal strategiesillustrates what many say are serious flaws in the states deregulated energy market One major flaw is that sellers do not have to participate in the states main electricity auctionthe socalled day forward sale held one day before electricity is delivered to the states residences and businesses Instead generators are withholding power until the day of delivery when desperate state agencies are willing to pay steep prices to keep the power flowing The upshot has been a doubling of electric bills for the million customers in San Diego GasElectrics coverage area and Southern California Edison and Pacific GasElectric customers may be facing higher prices once their rates are unfrozen in There is little prospect for shortterm relief with no additional power generation due for a year the prices of natural gas and crude oil are still rising In fact state officials expect the market to become tighter over the next year as demand and fuel prices rise In pointing the finger at the power merchants Gov Gray Davis some academics and utility executives charge that California consumers are being victimized by sophisticated trading techniques that take advantage of the market system to extract huge profits Deregulation only works if people act responsibly It wont work if people say their only goal is to make as much money as humanly possible Davis said last week This brokering takes place on the California Power Exchange and the Independent System Operator two agencies created by the legislation that ostensibly opened up of the states power marketrepresented by the PGE SCE and SDGE service areasto competition To create that competition lawmakers ordered the utilities to sell power plants to independent companies which now are selling electricity to the state The Power Exchange is a clearinghouse for the bulk of energy trading that is completed a day in advance of delivery which normally fills most of the states energy needs The ISO the nominal traffic cop arranging deliveries over the power grid also has the authority to hold sameday power auctions for immediate delivery in the event of unexpectedly high demand The Power Exchange is subject to a price cap of per megawatthour a ceiling imposed earlier this summer as prices began to soar But the ISO has the authority to pay as much as it has to for supplementary power if the previousday purchases prove insufficient to keep the states lights on And it is the secondary ISO market where power suppliers leveraging a sellers market are holding sway By withholding their energy from the Power Exchange and opting instead to bid their supply to the ISO they are betting that sameday shortages will generate prices as close to the price cap as possible possibly even above it Its apparently working On some days the ISO has ended up buying onefifth of the states energy needs not the to maximum originally envisioned In the process desperate to meet demand the ISO is paying premium prices and those prices are being passed along to consumers The problem with the market apparently defies easy solutions At an emergency meeting Friday to discuss ways of dealing with the crisis the ISO board rejected a staff proposal to force energy merchants to allocate at least of the electricity they intend to sell in the day forward auction held by the Power Exchange instead of holding back until the day of delivery Although ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure would restore some market order the board rejected it on fears that it might create unforeseen ramifications possibly even power suppliers abandoning the state altogether As the market stands now independent power companies have been able to exploit the power shortages and the markets quirks to charge the state higher rates than the increases in the price of natural gas would seem to warrant said Severin Borenstein a UC Berkeley professor and energy specialist With fellow UC Berkeley professor James Bushnell and Stanfords Frank Wolak Borenstein studied the Power Exchange over a month period ended in September and found evidence of market power or the power generators ability to raise prices above competitive levels for sustained periods Unless there is collusion among two or more power providers the exercise of market power is not illegal experts say But if prolonged it is a symptom of a seriously dysfunctional market I think market power has probably gotten worse this year There are players big enough to move the price and move it a lot Prices are clearly way above their costs Borenstein said Edison CEO John Bryson and Stephen Baum head of SDGE parent Sempra Energy have similar criticisms Their claims will be investigated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the latest of five probes underway into Californias worsening energy predicament Well see whether there are alternative market rules that should be adopted to have a better functioning more efficient market said Daniel Larcamp FERCs director of market tariffs and rates Looking at market power issues is an important focus of our investigation Power suppliers Duke Energy and Calpine denied any market manipulation saying the bulk of their energy is sold on longterm contracts and is not used to unduly sway dayahead prices on the Power Exchange or sameday sales on the ISO No way are we manipulating the market and we have welcomed investigation into our business practices said Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energys California regional office in Morro Bay Its easy to point fingers at someone who controls only of the market much of which has already been sold in the forward market months ago Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander said the high prices are simply a case of demand far outstripping the states ability to meet it Ten years ago you had more supply than demand Now you have a skyrocketing demand from population growth a robust economy and Internetfed additions to demand Highlander said Charles Cicchetti a USC professor of government business and the economy agrees and said the market is performing exactly as expected given supply shortages He objects to the limited price ceilings opposed by state officials The choice should be to either regulate the whole thing go back to where we were or let the market work Cicchetti said This hybrid is causing problems to get worse But something appears to be worsening an already bad pricing situation and critics believe it is market manipulation In the FERC order initiating its investigation the agency noted that Californias wholesale electricity costs on June were milliona sevenfold increase over the same date in Over the same period natural gas prices only doubled FERC will look at other aspects of the states energy deregulation as wellat the fact that utilities have no choice but to purchase power from the central power exchange and have only limited power to hedge or make bilateral deals on their own with outside firms In an interview last week the FERCs Larcamp said his agency is reserving the right to roll back rates order refunds or even impose a new market framework to replace the Power Exchange and ISO Larcamp said the FERCs probe will contrast Californias troubled power market with the PennsylvaniaMarylandNew Jersey system which gives end users more freedom to cut their own deals with suppliers The result is that Pennsylvania has more than power suppliers competing for the states business versus no more than in California Times staff writers Nancy Vogel and Nancy Rivera Brooks

wholesale market have caused electric bills to soar for San Diego Gas Electric customers this summer Are power generators deliberately manipulating the market to obtain higher profits and if so should price caps be imposed to protect ratepayers WHAT IS THIS The Deregulation Watch Public Forum is a free interactive service provided by Energy Central Every three weeks we address an issue related to the deregulation and restructuring of the electric power industry It is designed to provide a platform for the intelligent examination of issues a forum where industry professionals can share their pro con and middleoftheroad views on a variety of issues SEE THE END OF THIS MESSAGE FOR SUBSCRIBEUNSUBSCRIBE INFORMATION SUBMITTING YOUR OPINION AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THIS SERVICE SELECTED RESPONSES I have been following the California story for some time I have consulted with CA utilities over the past years and have spent considerable time examining the recent events and their history I believe each and every person that reviewed and approved Californias deregulation should be required to go back to school and take Economics I dont believe the AG in California will find any manipulation unless the generators have figured a way to control the weather and raise temperatures degrees above normal There is no significant baseline power in California The consumers regulators and politicians in California that have been pushing for deregulation are experiencing first hand the effects the flawed legislation California enacted and the reality of economics The regulators in California the NE part of the country and elsewhere created imbalanced markets in the s and early s We now are asking the same agencies if not the same individuals that created the mess to fix it Talk about the fox watching the hen house but its even better The fox built a hen house and is being asked to fix the problem now that were noticing chickens are missing Spot market prices for ANY commodity will skyrocket when demand increases dramatically and supply is limited If you cap prices youll almost certainly create shortages I would have hoped we would have learned something from the seventy years of Communist rule in Russia Can you say RATIONING Almost everyone has been misled to believe electric prices will decline under competition without examining the underlying capital and operating realities of the electric industry compared to other deregulated industries If you want your power at prices below those a free market will support be prepared to go without your electricity at times After an accurate comparison of the electric industry to other deregulated industries you will discover that in a fully deregulated electric industry retail electric prices will average from to percent higher than existing prices And prices will reach from five to ten times above current prices at times during demand spikes David L Robbins NA NA David ellsFargoCOM The answer is Yes and No Tremendous price increases for the cost of energy over the last months have an inevitable impact on the cost of generating electricity However those price increases do not cover the full extent of the increased cost for electricity for San Diego Gas and Electric My sources tell me that there has been some collusion among the major IPPs servicing SDGE which accounts for some of the other increases SDGEs mismanagement accounts for the rest Carl R Clark President Energetech Corp Was any assistance offered recently when the price of gas increased Would any assistance be offered in any substantive way if the price of sugar or rice increased The increase in electricity prices is a function of a mismatch between supply and demand The consumers concerns about this issue should be heard by suppliers in the form of new peaking power units cogeneration combinedcycle technology or improvements to the efficiency of existing generating plants If local suppliers are unwilling or unable to address the issue new suppliers will do so Market forces work well enough in other sectors they will work in CA given time David Whitehead VP Sales GENTRACK Sanderson Computers The generators are closely following the rules set by the independent system operator The solution would be to have the consumers educated enough to demand and pay for a service that provides them consistent pricing this would be a niche for a service provider to go to the generators and capture enough generation capacity at a given rate to meet the customer demands One thing that is not discussed in any of these articles is the average price of electricity over a longer period say the entire year In addition as I recall during the transition period the ratepayers received quite a reduction in rates Gary Hilberg Vice President Business Development The PIC Energy Group Competition is as competition does usually with little thinking or planning involved Some of us in California tried to bring various forms of planning and scenario forecasting to management and public eyes on thoughts on the future But scenarios of belief in the growandbuild era of the ss tended to overforecast load growth for nuclear power a year just as it was logical for management to believe in low forecasts for the s a year in the deregulation era The reality of growth cycles is a bit like saying feet in ice and hand in fire ie the average temperature is pretty comfortable Was AB a good thing No value judgement it was a political deal for billion Remember Diablo Canyon Some CEOs and public officials made their careers on this sort of thinking Best wishes California hopefully there will be light in the night skies Place blame appropriately NA NA NA Is this question a joke Of course they are This behavior will continue as long as the PR fog that has been created by the IOUs shameful campaigns while they have had their hands in our pockets These managements know they will not be fit to compete in a competitive market and will do anything to keep the fat dumb and happy mindset promoted they think that blaming their shortage exploitation on deregulation Randy Castleberry CEO Tempulse Information Management Whether or not individual generators are trying to manipulate is not the question and price caps are certainly not the answer The main problem is that the press has been led to believe that the situation is the result of years of deregulation not the years of regulation that led to shortages of both generation and transmission In addition one must remember that the vast majority of generation remains under regulatory andor legislated prices only about is actually bid and cleared no wonder the market thinness has lead to volatility Second price auction certainly doesnt help since everybody gets paid whatever the one manipulating is the highest bidders bid Price caps will only stifle the construction of new supply and new supply is half of the answer to price volatility The other half is meaningful demand responsive behavior price caps will hide true costs from consumers and stifle that too A little more patience is whats needed Tom Tanton NA California Energy Commission Oh sure why not it worked for the phone companies right well didnt it Okay Admittedly theyre making over twentypercent returns on investments but youve never heard about a phone brownout have you David Draper Regulatory Analyst Florida Public Commission SCSTATEFLUS Power marketers and utilities with generating capacity to sell and traders to sell it are not manipulating the market just taking advantage of the opportunities it is offering Thats what a market unfettered by regulation is about The answer to your second question then is that price caps are clearly reregulation and antifree market We either deregulate or reregulate the electric industry Reginald Ankrom President EnNova Energy Solutions You reap what you sow CA rushed into deregulation without a complete review of the impact Market value means profit and any company to remain in business looks at the profit motive as the primary driving force Putting a cap on prices is going back to the old system of guaranteeing a profit without regard to efficiency and conservation The current system like all systems in the past will eventually self correct Users and suppliers will reach a common plateau It may take some time and may hurt financially but eventually we will work it out The United States has historically swung in large amplitudes in everything we have done From complete isolationism prior to WWII to complete globalization in the s and s from no environmental controls to what some people may consider excessive tight controls I wish us a happy future Signed Someone who has been in the power business longer than he would like to NA NA NA NA If coal is the least expensive fuel install two used coalfired steam generators boilers each capable of supplying turbo generators adequate for the entire San Diego County load As an alternative install used boilers capable of burning waste fuel to supply the turbogenerators free fuel is a very good price San Diego can surely issue the various permits Sell any surplus power so the residents of San Diego can enjoy free electricity ie generate for centsKWh and sell it for I understand a large quantity of used equipment is available Fifty years associated with power generation in USA and overseas NA NA NA Market manipulation no Taking advantage of a somewhat silly demandsupply imbalance situation yes The analogy that comes to mind is that of a farmer whose crops in the midst of a drought are doing okay so he can charge more for them We should remember that this same farmer at other times will suffer through lean times where supply exceeds demand A few additional points The current focus in the press is on summer price spikes What about the generally lower energy commodity prices that SDGE ratepayers got in the winter and spring Until a bunch of merchant plant capacity comes online to serve the California market things may get uglier before they get better Then again maybe Mr Greenspans interest rate hikes finally will begin to take effect Summer price spikes in California seem to be lower than spot market situations that occasionally occur in the Midwest and in the New York area How about getting the CEC off its duff and getting some additional generating and transmission capacity approved Dont count out DSM completely yet at least for peakshaving Phil Sisson NA Sisson and Associates Inc Price spikes in California as in other parts of the country are a sign of electricity markets that are not entirely efficient or competitive In the specific case of California the reasons for this can be found in the way that the state has deregulated the market and the subsequent actions they have taken in an attempt to control it CalISOs creation of the governmentgranted monopoly known as the PX or power exchange helped to ensure that Californias market could never truly be efficient Many of Californias generators are forced to buy and sell from this power pool which discourages the development of a true robust bilateral market for wholesale electricity The introduction of further price caps not only discourages power marketers from shortterm sales into the state in times of need but also creates an atmosphere that will discourage longterm entry as well as the development of independent generation California needs real robust competition not another step deeper into the regulatory morass that they have created Kevin ODonovan Director Government Affairs Industry Networks I live in the Pacific Northwest yet we are paying prices as high and at times higher than southern California Generators are withholding power until pricing reaches acceptable levels in markets where they can sell not in local service areas Why else would generation be reduced for economic reasons Once again opportunists have twisted a good idea into a profitable venture for a very small group The concept of deregulation was to enhance competition through freedom of choice of the end user NOT THE SUPPLIER We are a captive audience Try to get by for just one day without use of electricity When price controls were removed generators and marketers were allowed to set pricing at whatever level they wanted There is not one single fuel source used by medium to large generators that costs an equivalent of per MWh A solution would be to cap prices not at a fixed level but at a cost of service fuels maintenance labor etc plus a maximum allowable profit margin Also require generators to run regardless of economics Under the must run would be a requirement to satisfy native loads and contract obligations before selling power outside of local service territories Lets get away from pricing based on whatever the market will bear and get back to pricing based on cost of service Let the electric industry face the same economic problems as the rest of industry David Michaelson PE Electrical Engineer Industrial Energy Manager NA NA I believe that the current deregulated marketing infrastructure invites manipulation and artificially inflated rates simply because the new laissezfaire market has no real constraints The new arbitrage trading has created multiple layers of parasites who are living well by adding no value to the commodityonly extra cost to the end user The trend of abuse is clear and I think price ceilings are inevitable Roy Chip Burton Project Engineer MultiLevel Technologies Inc As a market moves up the supply curve on peak there is no doubt that there is more supplier concentration and the potential for market manipulation However price caps are not a satisfactory longterm solution to high prices They will inevitably lead to blackouts A better longterm solution will be encourage more competition by identifying and removing barriers to new peaking and base load generation particularly distributed generation that can be located in load centers to serve peak loads Peter Evans Senior Vice President Catalytica Combustion Systems The twopart question goes first to motive then to solution No one can prove THAT the generators are gaming the system versus the system is working as it should The fact is that the result of operating the open market system as presently designed is unacceptable It is totally unacceptable that the competitive market in California is supposed to and attempting to operate in a condition of supplydemandprice equilibrium that does not exist That Californians should pay many billions of extra dollars to support an ineffective market system imposed upon them by regulators and legislators in the name of lower costs is sane only to those currently lining their pockets That price caps are needed in this ineffective or as some people laughingly call it imperfect market goes without question That generators or marketers cannot make a buck at a per MWh cap is laughable This is five times more than consumers ever paid for energy The only issue that needs resolving is how long the price caps should remain in effect That answer should depend on when the promised marketinequilibrium can be brought to bear and when a workable western RTO can guarantee economic transmission rates for California consumers Otherwise reregulate At any cost it will be cheaper than where were heading Joe Bongiovanni General Manager Hardwick Electric Department I believe that the people in San Diego are not able to see the full picture regarding deregulation of electric rates They were proposed as a means of overall rate reduction because of competition and on a yearly basis this is still possible Electricity was already high in California because of the environmental controls and difficulty of building new plants Very few new plants are being built and a perfectly good plant at San Onofre Unit was shut down reducing our resource margins Californians were not told that price volatility will be high in a free market as the price charged will be the price of the most expensive unit on line Today no one is talking about what happens during the low demand periods when the competition for selling power will be very high driving the price down to the point that some plants will probably want to pay you to use power so that they can stay on line Thus the situation of a free market system for electricity is not good for either a public that wants consistent bills or the power producers that can make money only when demand is very high It will take several years of bumpy conditions to iron out the competitive market for electricity Bill Hannaman PE Senior Staff Engineer DSS Dont blame this situation on the market players a utility without generation is like a race car without tires Until investors customers and employees stand as one against utilities selling off all their generation this situation will continue to be one of simple market economics supply vs demand The only winners are the executives of these utilities as they get rewarded for the high sale prices of the plants while customers are exposed to higher prices and lower reliability and sadly employees lose jobs pay level and seniority that are hard if not impossible to replace Frank Richards Technical Sales Rep Austin Energy IF there is manipulation of prices price caps are not the way to penalize the criminals because price caps affect every single seller not the individual or handful of individuals who are restraining the market and acting against the public interest I do tend to believe that price runups in California today arent due to market manipulators so much as they are due to the regulatory neglect and complacency bordering on hubris CA has labored under for the past years with no new plants being built while domestic demand grew and regional available importable supply shrank Returning to price caps isnt it fairly simple to illustrate that the California caps have served to do the following normal sellers of power sell at x Lets say there are nefarious actors who withhold power to later sell it at artificially inflated prices of x rather than the market rate of x that would have arisen as demand increased and supply tightened This is crude but bear with me In high dudgeon the politicians intervene and impose a cap of x which captures the bad actors but also unfortunately penalizes all of the other actors in the market slam dunking them in order to stop the few bad actors Results All the investors who put money into the market in good faith that the rules would allow them to make an adequate return on their investment are now penalized by caps that shave off money from their profitmaking times in the market for what is so far an unproven allegation against other unspecified bad actors So how many will want to build in this market with this new and highly volatile form of risk And what California accomplished for fifteen years through regulatory neglect it will now persist to accomplish through political intemperance Putting caps onto the market will not solve shortages it will not solve price problems more plants will not be built transmission wont be built reliability will get worse California is in for many more years of problems if they dont put their energy problems in order What is with California and price controls First President Richard Nixon who imposed national wage and price controls which failed miserably had to be pulled off because they only hid not solved problems that continued to fester and contributed greatly to the inflation of the later s Now price caps which will do about the same William Jordahl Manager FederalState Relations Alliant Energy The Electric Wholesale Market and Deregulation in general is primarily in name only One of the regional issues is the allowance of existing monopolistic participants to divest wholesale production in their own service territory and to ultimately repurchase wholesale production under nonregulated entities in the same electrical region Allowing the same entities to have monopolistic ownership of the transportation and distribution of the product while also owning nonregulated regional wholesale production of the product begs for market problems Placing caps on the wholesale price of the product not only masks the real issues but also could prevent the entrance of new participants Anonymous Senior Domestic Marketing Manager NA NA Are power generators deliberately manipulating the market to obtain higher profits in San Diego Of course they are the bidding rules for selling power into the PX require that all producers receive the price asked for by the most expensive producer selected Thus there is a tremendous profitmaking incentive to withhold power until the price goes up But the bidding rules are only a part of the problem The whole premise that electric power can be delivered competitively is a big lie Why As economist Eugene Coyle explains in Price Discrimination Electronic Redlining And Price Fixing in Deregulated Electric Power Washington DC American Public Power Association a commodity product with high fixed costs will force producers to discriminate between customers to collude with each other to maintain profits and to merge to eliminate competitors The best examples are the airlines which charge different prices between leisure and business customers who collude through their ticketing computers and who have merged into four or so major carriers and they are exploring joint ventures to reduce it to about two or three The same is now happening in deregulated electricity Many will argue that electricity competition hasnt been given a fair chance However even if you believe that competition can somehow develop in a commodity market with high fixed costs who will have the political muscle to create more competitive wholesale markets which will require true open access to the transmission system Enron the loudest promoter of open access just got its butt kicked by the big investorowned utilities which have proved their strength on Capitol Hill by killing open access legislation And the big forprofit holding companies are very strong at the state level as well So just as we have been saying for more than four years deregulation will only lead to unregulated monopolies because of the physical and economic nature of the electric power itself and because no one has the political power to enact the structural reforms needed to overcome the power of the forprofit holding companies that still completely dominate this industry Charlie Higley Energy Research Director Public Citizen I believe the answer to the question is NO The problem is lack of supply during peak demand periods The cry for reregulation is ludicrous Part of what FERC intended with the implementation of wholesale deregulation was for the market to send accurate price signals to the supply side so they would be motivated to develop and innovate new forms of supply and demand side management And this is precisely what is occurring Politicians are ignoring the fact that the price of natural gas has at least doubled in the last several months the electric supply from the Pacific Northwest is reduced because of reduced summer runoffs that supply the extensive hydro system an unplanned nuclear plant outage as well as very hot weather covering the entire West Coast All of the combined events have contributed to the current problems faced in the West and more specifically southern California Is anyone complaining when during light load periods the price of power is low and at times almost zero Would regulation have changed any of this I fail to see how As long as consumption goes unchecked and the not in my backyard NIMBY prevails when companies propose additional new generation and transmission facilities we will continue to have high prices during peak demand While the above is a simplification of the problems being faced in the West these are some of the basic issues that need to be addressed whether wholesale deregulation had been implemented or not The opinions expressed above are my own and do not represent any official position of my company David F Perrino Director Market Development West Automated Power Exchange Grid Management Services Hot weather and lack of surplus capacity caused the price spikes and price caps now just prolong the pain The state of Californias actions in imposing wholesale price caps is a simple issue of politically motivated interference in the free market that will ultimately harm consumers The price caps tarnish the allure of investing in new generating capacity and the incentive for electricity buyers to plan ahead more effectively How many lotto tickets would a state sell if the politicos decided that a million prize is too extravagant Would reducing lotto winnings to make it a better producer of state revenue There are marketbased forwards derivatives and other mechanisms for buyers and retailers to protect themselves from price spikes caused by summer supply shortages The longterm answer is to let the market provide financial rewards To those who take risk to build generating capacity When enough new generators join in the market will reach equilibrium Eric C Williams Market Solutions Analyst EPRI Market Solutions Assuming that the excess demand in the wholesale market is based on capacity limits then capping market rates confuses the situation by encouraging consumption and discouraging conservation and the availability of alternative supply sources The de facto vertically integrated electric utility system with its comprehensive regulatory oversight has been in place since circa Transition to a restructured system is going to take more than a few years In the meantime dealing with system peak loads is where

Dereg Under FireEnron Calif Elec Business Heats Up FYI Forwarded by Christopher SmithHOUEES on AM on PM Please respond to To cc Subject Enron Energy Services With Dereg Under FireEnron Calif Elec Business Heats Up With Dereg Under FireEnron Calif Elec Business Heats Up By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones While federal regulators try to find a way to stabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California Enron Corp ENE has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities to sell them fixedprice power at a lower rate In the past month the Houstonbased electricity service provider entered into longterm fixedrate contracts with the city of Roseville and is negotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista Both of those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas Electric Co a unit of Sempra Energy Inc SRE and pay market rates for electricity Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels Resorts Worldwide Inc HOT one of the worlds largest hospitality companies to sell the company electricity at a fixed rate for the next years The company has four hotels in California three of which buy their power from SDGE Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel power at about cents per kilowatthour compared with the centsKWh Starwood said it was charged by SDGE in August Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal But Starwood said it expects to reduce its energy costs by more than million over the next years Enron the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the US will purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its experience to manage the risks while paying a fee to utilities like SDGE for use of their distribution networks That really is our core strength said Harold Buchanan chief operating officer for Enron Energy Services North America We understand how to manage those risks High Rates Driving Industrial Customers Cities To Switch The growing interest in fixedprice supply contracts is fueling a comeback of sorts for Enron The Houstonbased company had tried to break into Californias retail power market just after deregulation even spending nearly million to advertise the venture during the Super Bowl But Enron gave up trying to win residential customers in citing disappointing response and lowerthanexpected profits That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of promise Oddly enough now that deregulation is coming under attack in California soaring power prices are building demand for Enrons services The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are interested in signing longterm fixedrate contracts Buchanan said Overall what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego thats written in stone Buchanan said Its far cheaper than what theyre paying now with the utilities A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to comment The city of Roseville near Sacramento entered into a million contract with Enron last month to purchase megawatts of electricity for five years at per megawatthour Furthermore the city has started talks with Enron about building and operating a megawatt natural gasfired power plant that city officials expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price spikes that have plagued customers of SDGE since June San Marcos in San Diego County is proposing to switch electricity service for its residents to Enron from SDGE a move the City Council said could shave about million a year off the citys power bill Enron has said it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville An SDGE spokesman said last week that the utility supports such arrangements saying theyre one way deregulation is supposed to work Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDGE itself for four years at a fixed rate of centsKWh but the utility said the price was too high California Gov Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap electricity rates for SDGEs customers at centsKWh By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Folder Name Enron Energy

Assistance for Customers DATELINE SAN DIEGO July BODY To provide its customers with additional assistance this summer and next San Diego Gas Electric SDGE has requested from the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC million over the next two years to increase funding for energyefficiency programs Our customers need assistance today in lowering their energy costs and todays proposal will bring an additional million funding to encourage energy conservation in our region said Edwin A Guiles president of SDGE This money can be used to help replace old inefficient appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators which will result in reduced electric bills and less strain on our states electricsupply system Of the million SDGE would allocate an additional million exclusively for lowincome energyefficiency assistance programs over the next two years Under the proposal filed Friday the lowincome assistance funds will be used to expand existing programs such as refrigerator and evaporative cooler replacements while introducing new programs including room airconditioner replacements and evaporative cooler maintenance and repair The program also includes incentives for landlords to replace refrigerators and air conditioners in rental units The rest of the money would go into other energyefficiency programs to provide incentives for removal and recycling of operating second refrigerators refrigerator and room airconditioner replacement replacement of inefficient pool pumps and increased incentives for a variety of programs to benefit small businesses Funds for these additional incentives come from programs that did not draw as much customer participation as expected For instance large customers requested less than half the amount budgeted for a program designed to provide energyefficiency incentives to them Details on the programs are still being developed but they should be in place in early September The CPUC is expected to act on SDGEs filing in late August In Californias newly created competitive energy marketplace SDGE is a deliveryservice provider For those customers who have not chosen another energy service provider SDGE buys electricity from the California Power Exchange CalPX and passes that cost directly onto its customers with no markup The price of power is now a function of supply and demand in the open market Over the last several weeks SDGE customers have seen their electric bills rise sharply due to the significant increase in commodity costs as a result of power demand in California and surrounding states Fridays proposal marks the latest in a series of actions SDGE has taken recently to help customers grapple with high electric prices On July SDGE and the CalPX proposed a new marketbased power bidding solution to the CPUC that would allow SDGE to procure power for customers with less price volatility over the next five to nine months On July SDGE filed a request with the CPUC to accelerate the return of million in customer money from a CPUCcontrolled account The CPUCs approval of SDGEs request would release of money acquired from powergenerating benefits of San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and other assets would decrease the August and September residential electric bills by or a month That proposal combined with the deregulationdividend checks most SDGE customers will receive next month will result in a total of about million benefit to them in August and September nearly for the typical residential customer helping to ease cashflow problems from higher electricity prices The company is actively promoting a levelpay program to all customers which enables them to even out their bill payments over the course of the year so they can manage better against their monthly household budget Those customers participating in the plan will see bills this summer that are comparable to last summers bills SDGE also has increased communications to both residential and business customers regarding the changes in the energy marketplace available energyefficiency funding and conservation tips for reducing electric bills Information about these programs is available by calling

On Merger Partner Enrons Q By Christina Cheddar Dow Jones News Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones Dynegy Inc DYN declined Tuesday to comment on whether its merger with Enron Corp ENE would be affected by the contents of Enrons quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Monday In the Q which was filed five days past the SEC deadline Enron revised its thirdquarter earnings downward by cents a share and disclosed it may have to pay off a million note owed to an affiliated partnership because a clause in a financial agreement was triggered by the reduction in Enrons senior unsecured debt rating to tripleBminus by Standard Poors a week ago The amount will have to be paid by Nov if Enron doesnt find collateral to guarantee the debt the company said in the filing Enron is working to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt but didnt disclose who holds the note Enron used partnerships in order to hedge its investment risk and in some cases to keep the debt off its balance sheet The practice is being investigated by the SEC and by an internal committee Enron has named In the filing Enron also said it may have to take a million pretax charge to earnings for the declining value of assets held by another partnership Whitewing LLP When asked if Dynegy had known about the collateral call on the debt or about the decline in Whitewings value a Dynegy spokeswoman declined to comment We are referring all questions about the Enron Q to Enron said the spokeswoman Representatives of Enron werent immediately available for comment Dynegy agreed to buy Enron earlier this month Earlier Tuesday the deal was worth about billion in stock but Enron shares were trading at a discount to the offer price earlier Tuesday morning which is a sign of the uncertainty surrounding the transaction Enron shares were recently trading at down or while Dynegy shares changed hands at down cents or A ChevronTexaco Corp CVX official wasnt immediately available to comment on the matter ChevronTexaco San Francisco owns of Dynegy and is providing billion in cash to Dynegy as part of the buyout Last week an inital payment of billion was transferred to Dynegy and then to Enron to help meet Enrons immediate cash needs Dynegys merger agreement with Enron contains several provisions beyond the standard material adverse change provision that would allow the deal to be terminated Still some question whether Dynegy was able to fully assess Enrons liabilities prior to striking the deal Investors have expressed frustration with Enrons lack of disclosure and even marvelled at the fact that the Q included material that could have been mentioned in previous filings or company conference calls Energy Cos Limit Business With Enron After

that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month Its pretty well accepted in the industry that people are staying away for now said Charlie Sanchez energy market manager for Gelber Associates in Houston Traders at all of the major companies contacted said they couldnt sell to Enron Tuesday morning Several spokespeople for energy companies confirmed the situation but declined to say so on the record Nobody will take Enron one western electricity broker said After struggling however that broker eventually found a utility that was willing to sell to Enron Tuesday morning Calpine a prominent independent power producer and trader said it was willing to sell power to Enron We continue to sell power to Enron and are monitoring the situation closely spokeswoman Catherine Potter said The situation Tuesday morning was fluid One utility that refused to sell to Enron in the morning was willing to do so in the afternoon a person at the company said That companys trading however was still limited to the spot markets Credit concerns about the oncedominant energy trading company were heightened with Enrons filing of its third quarter annual report Monday evening with the US Securities Exchange Commission Enron may have to pay million on a note that became a demand obligation with the companys most recent creditrating downgrade Enron said in Mondays filing The company also warned that its profits in the fourth quarter could be hurt by credit concerns a decline in asset values and reduced trading activity The Q in and by itself is a document that could raise concerns Fitch analyst Ralph Pellecchia said We have a lot of questions outstanding relative to disclosures that were new to us and their strategies of how they are going to manage the situation Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer Reliant surprised by latest Enron disclosure HOUSTON Nov Reuters Reliant Resources Inc NYSERRI news a trading partner of beleaguered energy trading giant Enron CorpNYSEENE news said on Tuesday it was surprised by news that Enron could be forced to pay million in debt next week because of a credit rating downgrade Shahid Malik Reliants president of energy trading and marketing said his company was still evaluating the implications of the disclosure which Enron made in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on Monday Its another surprise to the industry We dont need any more surprises Malik told reporters at a press presentation of a new index devised by Houstonbased Reliant to track natural gas consumption Reliant is a big wholesale electricity and natural gas trader and as such both a competitor and trading counterparty of Enron Malik said Enron executives had not mentioned the potential payment of million during a conference call with analysts on Nov two days before the credit rating downgrade that triggered it on Nov Enron agreed to be acquired by smaller rival Dynegy IncNYSEDYN news for some billion in stock on Nov after a collapse in investor confidence and snowballing financial problems brought Enron to the brink of collapse Dynegy wrote clauses into its agreement with Enron that allow it to walk away from the deal if the problems at Enron turn out to be far worse than previously disclosed but Dynegy executives have said it is unlikely those clauses will be invoked Malik said that as a trading partner in wholesale energy markets Reliant will seek further clarification from Enron about its financial position My guess is that they are going to have a hard time coming up with the money he said Malik said Enrons bids and offers in the wholesale electricity and natural gas markets had become less competitive in recent weeks and that this had allowed Reliant and other companies to capture some market share from Enron Reliant continued to do business with Enron he said but was exercising heightened caution Malik said Reliant had not hired any traders away from Enron recently and was currently well staffed But you always look for good people you always look for talent he added

Interactive R Server Software Folder Industry News Headlines Consumers Grow More Anxious As They Are Cut Loose In BElectricitysB New Free Market Metropolitan Desk Section Feeling Powerless In Consumers Grow More Anxious As They Are Cut Loose In BElectricitysB New Free Market By KIRK JOHNSON Aug New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Over the last years a dogma has taken root in America that says people would be happier and better off if they were all continually shopping for the best deals Consumers according to this theory should be empowered and freed from the old business monopolies and the dictates of fussy bureaucrats So airlines were deregulated and telephone service and then the Internet arrived giving people the ability to choose from different sellers of the same merchandise The bull market on Wall Street brought mutual funds begging for attention Having more choices became an end in itself But for millions of people especially in New York and California the doctrine of the sovereign consumer has come into question this summer around a commodity that most had taken completely for granted BelectricityB A recently deregulated BenergyB market which was supposed to increase choices and reduce prices has for most residents done nothing of the kind Many community leaders and politicians calling for investigations and caps on rising BelectricityB bills up percent to percent from those of last August in many areas have denounced BenergyB BderegulationB as either a failure or a fraud Some social scientists say that the anxiety over BenergyB is exposing something even deeper in the human wiring At a time when protesters have railed in Seattle and Washington against chain stores and global branding and prominent social critics have denounced the intrusion of endless choice into every corner of life a phenomenon that Barry Schwartz a psychologist at Swarthmore College calls the tyranny of freedom the publics worries about BelectricityB may say more about human nature than about kilowatts Perhaps this alternative theory says there is a point at which people no longer wish to be autonomous rational consumers at all Maybe they would just as soon delegate their decisions regarding some transactions as they did when Consolidated Edison was the only game in town and government was assigned to make sure that the company played by the rules Maybe when it comes to BelectricityB a mysterious and dangerous thing that is also the foundation of modern living Americans are just a little afraid to be alone In the past we trusted that state regulators who were appointed by our elected officials were watching out for us which may or may not have been true said Edward A Smeloff a former utility industry official who runs a research group on BelectricityB at Pace University The new model is Figure it out for yourself Some economists and BenergyB industry experts say the sense of powerlessness and confusion that many people feel is perhaps as much a source of anxiety and anger as higher BelectricityB bills The players have all changed and no one seems to be in charge The old Brooklyn Union Gas Company for example still remembered by many New York residents for the fuzzy feelgood images of its advertising has become the cool and metallicsounding KeySpan BEnergyB The old Con Ed on the other hand was like a crotchety grandfather who sometimes had to be prodded and yelled at but who nonetheless presided over the system The company now throws up its hands and says it is not responsible for recent price increases Con Eds wires are simply a delivery mechanism for the unregulated corporations that own generating plants Con Eds chairman said at a recent hearing at City Hall Opinion poll takers say anxiety about deregulation may also have something to do with a contradiction in the American psyche that they say has opened up in recent years a contradiction about what people really want Surveys conducted by Yankelovich Partners a research and consulting firm based in Norwalk Conn have said for example that a majority of people want more control over the details of their lives but a majority also want to simplify their lives a result that Barbara R Caplan a partner at the firm has called the paradox of our time Deregulated BenergyB arrived right in the middle of those conflicting goals because only a handful of BenergyB competitors have been attracted to the New York market most people still do not have much choice in their BelectricityB and yet it all seems more complicated than ever as well as more expensive Another factor some researchers say may be a result of timing People have had experience with deregulation and they have seen that it did not always unfold to their benefit The hubandspoke system developed by the airline industry for example has given airlines nearmonopoly power at many airports around the country resulting in less competition not more Consumers have also seen that although tools like the Internet have made buyers more powerful in getting good prices corporations on the other side of the transaction have become more powerful too in gathering information about them Years ago you went into an auto dealership and had to negotiate to buy a car but only the corporate side had knowledge of what the real costs were said Mark L Gillenson a professor of management information systems at the University of Memphis Now you go into the Internet and lots of places will give you that information for free On the other hand Professor Gillenson said the data that corporations are collecting about people are creating what the old car dealer could never have imagined knowledge about what people want before they even ask Lurking behind all those forces some psychologists say is the growing sense that people are simply being asked to decide too much Economic deregulation has accompanied what may be called social deregulation as issues that were not even considered decisions in the past have become issues of conscious choice whether to get married and have children or how to express oneself sexually as gay straight or somewhere in between And the more choices there are the more it can seem possible to achieve an ideal result in every case leading to a doomed treadmill kind of behavior often seen in people who continually change their longdistance telephone service as they endlessly seek an incremental price advantage Over what domains in life are you supposed to have control said Professor Schwartz the Swarthmore College psychologist Nobody gets depressed when you cant control the weather and years ago nobody got depressed because they couldnt control your telecommunications or BelectricityB either because those things couldnt be controlled he said But now you can or youre told that you can and so youre going to be continually frustrated And BelectricityB is also just different Unlike a telephone call or an airline ticket nobody ever really wants to buy BelectricityB itself rather people buy its expression and result a cold beer in the fridge a light to read by By the standards of American marketing it is barely a product at all People want to make choices about clothes and restaurants and what houses they live in but a lot of us would rather not be bothered with having to make a choice about BelectricityB said Wendy Kaminer a public policy fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Cambridge Mass Its not a desire to be disempowered Ms Kaminer added Its a desire not to be bothered Finally some experts think that the long bull market for stocks in which share prices mostly just go up has made people forget a fundamental truth about how markets work they are genuinely fair only over the long run while at any given time there are likely to be as many losers as winners Deregulation and privatization were sold implicitly on the assumption that everybody can win from this but Im hard pressed to find an example in the real world where that has happened said Willis Emmons a professor in the strategy public policy and ethics department at Georgetown Universitys business school Right now Professor Emmons added maybe somebody is winning but it isnt the consumer NYTF To view all headlines in the folder Industry News go to browsearticlesaspfolderid To go to the

illustrate flaws in the system As the states booming economy taxes the ability to meet electricity demands a federal investigation is underway CHRIS KRAUL TIMES STAFF WRITER Aug Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page A Copyright The Times Mirror Company With Southern Californians reeling from skyrocketing electric bills critics charge that fewer than a dozen power suppliers are reaping far greater profits than are justified by the recent surge in wholesale prices of the natural gas they use to create electricity Their behavior is a major focus of a formal investigation announced last week by federal regulators Among those under scrutiny are power merchants including BDukeB BEnergyB BDynegyB BReliantB BEnergyB Calpine Southern Co and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Critics say the companies are earning huge windfalls selling energy to the two state agencies charged with distributing power in California The power merchants themselves deny any profiteering describing their market moves as legal business practices and welcoming the investigation The underlying cause of Californias energy turmoil is a severe shortage of powergenerating capacity to meet the soaring energy demands of the states booming economy This summer the state at times has had to import more than of its energy needs a shortfall equal to the output of about mediumsize power plants No plants of any size have been built in the state in years But the problem goes beyond a supplyanddemand imbalance The socalled merchant power companies ability to bend the market to their advantageusing what appear to be legal strategiesillustrates what many say are serious flaws in the states deregulated energy market One major flaw is that sellers do not have to participate in the states main electricity auctionthe socalled day forward sale held one day before electricity is delivered to the states residences and businesses Instead generators are withholding power until the day of delivery when desperate state agencies are willing to pay steep prices to keep the power flowing The upshot has been a doubling of electric bills for the million customers in San Diego GasElectrics coverage area and Southern California Edison and Pacific GasElectric customers may be facing higher prices once their rates are unfrozen in There is little prospect for shortterm relief with no additional power generation due for a year the prices of natural gas and crude oil are still rising In fact state officials expect the market to become tighter over the next year as demand and fuel prices rise In pointing the finger at the power merchants Gov Gray Davis some academics and utility executives charge that California consumers are being victimized by sophisticated trading techniques that take advantage of the market system to extract huge profits Deregulation only works if people act responsibly It wont work if people say their only goal is to make as much money as humanly possible Davis said last week This brokering takes place on the California Power Exchange and the Independent System Operator two agencies created by the legislation that ostensibly opened up of the states power marketrepresented by the PGE SCE and SDGE service areasto competition To create that competition lawmakers ordered the utilities to sell power plants to independent companies which now are selling electricity to the state The Power Exchange is a clearinghouse for the bulk of energy trading that is completed a day in advance of delivery which normally fills most of the states energy needs The ISO the nominal traffic cop arranging deliveries over the power grid also has the authority to hold sameday power auctions for immediate delivery in the event of unexpectedly high demand The Power Exchange is subject to a price cap of per megawatthour a ceiling imposed earlier this summer as prices began to soar But the ISO has the authority to pay as much as it has to for supplementary power if the previousday purchases prove insufficient to keep the states lights on And it is the secondary ISO market where power suppliers leveraging a sellers market are holding sway By withholding their energy from the Power Exchange and opting instead to bid their supply to the ISO they are betting that sameday shortages will generate prices as close to the price cap as possible possibly even above it Its apparently working On some days the ISO has ended up buying onefifth of the states energy needs not the to maximum originally envisioned In the process desperate to meet demand the ISO is paying premium prices and those prices are being passed along to consumers The problem with the market apparently defies easy solutions At an emergency meeting Friday to discuss ways of dealing with the crisis the ISO board rejected a staff proposal to force energy merchants to allocate at least of the electricity they intend to sell in the day forward auction held by the Power Exchange instead of holding back until the day of delivery Although ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure would restore some market order the board rejected it on fears that it might create unforeseen ramifications possibly even power suppliers abandoning the state altogether As the market stands now independent power companies have been able to exploit the power shortages and the markets quirks to charge the state higher rates than the increases in the price of natural gas would seem to warrant said Severin Borenstein a UC Berkeley professor and energy specialist With fellow UC Berkeley professor James Bushnell and Stanfords Frank Wolak Borenstein studied the Power Exchange over a month period ended in September and found evidence of market power or the power generators ability to raise prices above competitive levels for sustained periods Unless there is collusion among two or more power providers the exercise of market power is not illegal experts say But if prolonged it is a symptom of a seriously dysfunctional market I think market power has probably gotten worse this year There are players big enough to move the price and move it a lot Prices are clearly way above their costs Borenstein said Edison CEO John Bryson and Stephen Baum head of SDGE parent Sempra Energy have similar criticisms Their claims will be investigated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the latest of five probes underway into Californias worsening energy predicament Well see whether there are alternative market rules that should be adopted to have a better functioning more efficient market said Daniel Larcamp FERCs director of market tariffs and rates Looking at market power issues is an important focus of our investigation Power suppliers Duke Energy and Calpine denied any market manipulation saying the bulk of their energy is sold on longterm contracts and is not used to unduly sway dayahead prices on the Power Exchange or sameday sales on the ISO No way are we manipulating the market and we have welcomed investigation into our business practices said Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energys California regional office in Morro Bay Its easy to point fingers at someone who controls only of the market much of which has already been sold in the forward market months ago Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander said the high prices are simply a case of demand far outstripping the states ability to meet it Ten years ago you had more supply than demand Now you have a skyrocketing demand from population growth a robust economy and Internetfed additions to demand Highlander said Charles Cicchetti a USC professor of government business and the economy agrees and said the market is performing exactly as expected given supply shortages He objects to the limited price ceilings opposed by state officials The choice should be to either regulate the whole thing go back to where we were or let the market work Cicchetti said This hybrid is causing problems to get worse But something appears to be worsening an already bad pricing situation and critics believe it is market manipulation In the FERC order initiating its investigation the agency noted that Californias wholesale electricity costs on June were milliona sevenfold increase over the same date in Over the same period natural gas prices only doubled FERC will look at other aspects of the states energy deregulation as wellat the fact that utilities have no choice but to purchase power from the central power exchange and have only limited power to hedge or make bilateral deals on their own with outside firms In an interview last week the FERCs Larcamp said his agency is reserving the right to roll back rates order refunds or even impose a new market framework to replace the Power Exchange and ISO Larcamp said the FERCs probe will contrast Californias troubled power market with the PennsylvaniaMarylandNew Jersey system which gives end users more freedom to cut their own deals with suppliers The result is that Pennsylvania has more than power suppliers competing for the states business versus no more than in California Times staff writers Nancy Vogel and Nancy Rivera Brooks

responses short and to the point Selected responses will be published in the next Deregulation Public Forum email PREVIOUS QUESTION Responses published below Uncontrolled prices spikes in the wholesale market have caused electric bills to soar for San Diego Gas Electric customers this summer Are power generators deliberately manipulating the market to obtain higher profits and if so should price caps be imposed to protect ratepayers WHAT IS THIS The Deregulation Watch Public Forum is a free interactive service provided by Energy Central Every three weeks we address an issue related to the deregulation and restructuring of the electric power industry It is designed to provide a platform for the intelligent examination of issues a forum where industry professionals can share their pro con and middleoftheroad views on a variety of issues SEE THE END OF THIS MESSAGE FOR SUBSCRIBEUNSUBSCRIBE INFORMATION SUBMITTING YOUR OPINION AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THIS SERVICE SELECTED RESPONSES I have been following the California story for some time I have consulted with CA utilities over the past years and have spent considerable time examining the recent events and their history I believe each and every person that reviewed and approved Californias deregulation should be required to go back to school and take Economics I dont believe the AG in California will find any manipulation unless the generators have figured a way to control the weather and raise temperatures degrees above normal There is no significant baseline power in California The consumers regulators and politicians in California that have been pushing for deregulation are experiencing first hand the effects the flawed legislation California enacted and the reality of economics The regulators in California the NE part of the country and elsewhere created imbalanced markets in the s and early s We now are asking the same agencies if not the same individuals that created the mess to fix it Talk about the fox watching the hen house but its even better The fox built a hen house and is being asked to fix the problem now that were noticing chickens are missing Spot market prices for ANY commodity will skyrocket when demand increases dramatically and supply is limited If you cap prices youll almost certainly create shortages I would have hoped we would have learned something from the seventy years of Communist rule in Russia Can you say RATIONING Almost everyone has been misled to believe electric prices will decline under competition without examining the underlying capital and operating realities of the electric industry compared to other deregulated industries If you want your power at prices below those a free market will support be prepared to go without your electricity at times After an accurate comparison of the electric industry to other deregulated industries you will discover that in a fully deregulated electric industry retail electric prices will average from to percent higher than existing prices And prices will reach from five to ten times above current prices at times during demand spikes David L Robbins NA NA David ellsFargoCOM The answer is Yes and No Tremendous price increases for the cost of energy over the last months have an inevitable impact on the cost of generating electricity However those price increases do not cover the full extent of the increased cost for electricity for San Diego Gas and Electric My sources tell me that there has been some collusion among the major IPPs servicing SDGE which accounts for some of the other increases SDGEs mismanagement accounts for the rest Carl R Clark President Energetech Corp Was any assistance offered recently when the price of gas increased Would any assistance be offered in any substantive way if the price of sugar or rice increased The increase in electricity prices is a function of a mismatch between supply and demand The consumers concerns about this issue should be heard by suppliers in the form of new peaking power units cogeneration combinedcycle technology or improvements to the efficiency of existing generating plants If local suppliers are unwilling or unable to address the issue new suppliers will do so Market forces work well enough in other sectors they will work in CA given time David Whitehead VP Sales GENTRACK Sanderson Computers The generators are closely following the rules set by the independent system operator The solution would be to have the consumers educated enough to demand and pay for a service that provides them consistent pricing this would be a niche for a service provider to go to the generators and capture enough generation capacity at a given rate to meet the customer demands One thing that is not discussed in any of these articles is the average price of electricity over a longer period say the entire year In addition as I recall during the transition period the ratepayers received quite a reduction in rates Gary Hilberg Vice President Business Development The PIC Energy Group Competition is as competition does usually with little thinking or planning involved Some of us in California tried to bring various forms of planning and scenario forecasting to management and public eyes on thoughts on the future But scenarios of belief in the growandbuild era of the ss tended to overforecast load growth for nuclear power a year just as it was logical for management to believe in low forecasts for the s a year in the deregulation era The reality of growth cycles is a bit like saying feet in ice and hand in fire ie the average temperature is pretty comfortable Was AB a good thing No value judgement it was a political deal for billion Remember Diablo Canyon Some CEOs and public officials made their careers on this sort of thinking Best wishes California hopefully there will be light in the night skies Place blame appropriately NA NA NA Is this question a joke Of course they are This behavior will continue as long as the PR fog that has been created by the IOUs shameful campaigns while they have had their hands in our pockets These managements know they will not be fit to compete in a competitive market and will do anything to keep the fat dumb and happy mindset promoted they think that blaming their shortage exploitation on deregulation Randy Castleberry CEO Tempulse Information Management Whether or not individual generators are trying to manipulate is not the question and price caps are certainly not the answer The main problem is that the press has been led to believe that the situation is the result of years of deregulation not the years of regulation that led to shortages of both generation and transmission In addition one must remember that the vast majority of generation remains under regulatory andor legislated prices only about is actually bid and cleared no wonder the market thinness has lead to volatility Second price auction certainly doesnt help since everybody gets paid whatever the one manipulating is the highest bidders bid Price caps will only stifle the construction of new supply and new supply is half of the answer to price volatility The other half is meaningful demand responsive behavior price caps will hide true costs from consumers and stifle that too A little more patience is whats needed Tom Tanton NA California Energy Commission Oh sure why not it worked for the phone companies right well didnt it Okay Admittedly theyre making over twentypercent returns on investments but youve never heard about a phone brownout have you David Draper Regulatory Analyst Florida Public Commission SCSTATEFLUS Power marketers and utilities with generating capacity to sell and traders to sell it are not manipulating the market just taking advantage of the opportunities it is offering Thats what a market unfettered by regulation is about The answer to your second question then is that price caps are clearly reregulation and antifree market We either deregulate or reregulate the electric industry Reginald Ankrom President EnNova Energy Solutions You reap what you sow CA rushed into deregulation without a complete review of the impact Market value means profit and any company to remain in business looks at the profit motive as the primary driving force Putting a cap on prices is going back to the old system of guaranteeing a profit without regard to efficiency and conservation The current system like all systems in the past will eventually self correct Users and suppliers will reach a common plateau It may take some time and may hurt financially but eventually we will work it out The United States has historically swung in large amplitudes in everything we have done From complete isolationism prior to WWII to complete globalization in the s and s from no environmental controls to what some people may consider excessive tight controls I wish us a happy future Signed Someone who has been in the power business longer than he would like to NA NA NA NA If coal is the least expensive fuel install two used coalfired steam generators boilers each capable of supplying turbo generators adequate for the entire San Diego County load As an alternative install used boilers capable of burning waste fuel to supply the turbogenerators free fuel is a very good price San Diego can surely issue the various permits Sell any surplus power so the residents of San Diego can enjoy free electricity ie generate for centsKWh and sell it for I understand a large quantity of used equipment is available Fifty years associated with power generation in USA and overseas NA NA NA Market manipulation no Taking advantage of a somewhat silly demandsupply imbalance situation yes The analogy that comes to mind is that of a farmer whose crops in the midst of a drought are doing okay so he can charge more for them We should remember that this same farmer at other times will suffer through lean times where supply exceeds demand A few additional points The current focus in the press is on summer price spikes What about the generally lower energy commodity prices that SDGE ratepayers got in the winter and spring Until a bunch of merchant plant capacity comes online to serve the California market things may get uglier before they get better Then again maybe Mr Greenspans interest rate hikes finally will begin to take effect Summer price spikes in California seem to be lower than spot market situations that occasionally occur in the Midwest and in the New York area How about getting the CEC off its duff and getting some additional generating and transmission capacity approved Dont count out DSM completely yet at least for peakshaving Phil Sisson NA Sisson and Associates Inc Price spikes in California as in other parts of the country are a sign of electricity markets that are not entirely efficient or competitive In the specific case of California the reasons for this can be found in the way that the state has deregulated the market and the subsequent actions they have taken in an attempt to control it CalISOs creation of the governmentgranted monopoly known as the PX or power exchange helped to ensure that Californias market could never truly be efficient Many of Californias generators are forced to buy and sell from this power pool which discourages the development of a true robust bilateral market for wholesale electricity The introduction of further price caps not only discourages power marketers from shortterm sales into the state in times of need but also creates an atmosphere that will discourage longterm entry as well as the development of independent generation California needs real robust competition not another step deeper into the regulatory morass that they have created Kevin ODonovan Director Government Affairs Industry Networks I live in the Pacific Northwest yet we are paying prices as high and at times higher than southern California Generators are withholding power until pricing reaches acceptable levels in markets where they can sell not in local service areas Why else would generation be reduced for economic reasons Once again opportunists have twisted a good idea into a profitable venture for a very small group The concept of deregulation was to enhance competition through freedom of choice of the end user NOT THE SUPPLIER We are a captive audience Try to get by for just one day without use of electricity When price controls were removed generators and marketers were allowed to set pricing at whatever level they wanted There is not one single fuel source used by medium to large generators that costs an equivalent of per MWh A solution would be to cap prices not at a fixed level but at a cost of service fuels maintenance labor etc plus a maximum allowable profit margin Also require generators to run regardless of economics Under the must run would be a requirement to satisfy native loads and contract obligations before selling power outside of local service territories Lets get away from pricing based on whatever the market will bear and get back to pricing based on cost of service Let the electric industry face the same economic problems as the rest of industry David Michaelson PE Electrical Engineer Industrial Energy Manager NA NA I believe that the current deregulated marketing infrastructure invites manipulation and artificially inflated rates simply because the new laissezfaire market has no real constraints The new arbitrage trading has created multiple layers of parasites who are living well by adding no value to the commodityonly extra cost to the end user The trend of abuse is clear and I think price ceilings are inevitable Roy Chip Burton Project Engineer MultiLevel Technologies Inc As a market moves up the supply curve on peak there is no doubt that there is more supplier concentration and the potential for market manipulation However price caps are not a satisfactory longterm solution to high prices They will inevitably lead to blackouts A better longterm solution will be encourage more competition by identifying and removing barriers to new peaking and base load generation particularly distributed generation that can be located in load centers to serve peak loads Peter Evans Senior Vice President Catalytica Combustion Systems The twopart question goes first to motive then to solution No one can prove THAT the generators are gaming the system versus the system is working as it should The fact is that the result of operating the open market system as presently designed is unacceptable It is totally unacceptable that the competitive market in California is supposed to and attempting to operate in a condition of supplydemandprice equilibrium that does not exist That Californians should pay many billions of extra dollars to support an ineffective market system imposed upon them by regulators and legislators in the name of lower costs is sane only to those currently lining their pockets That price caps are needed in this ineffective or as some people laughingly call it imperfect market goes without question That generators or marketers cannot make a buck at a per MWh cap is laughable This is five times more than consumers ever paid for energy The only issue that needs resolving is how long the price caps should remain in effect That answer should depend on when the promised marketinequilibrium can be brought to bear and when a workable western RTO can guarantee economic transmission rates for California consumers Otherwise reregulate At any cost it will be cheaper than where were heading Joe Bongiovanni General Manager Hardwick Electric Department I believe that the people in San Diego are not able to see the full picture regarding deregulation of electric rates They were proposed as a means of overall rate reduction because of competition and on a yearly basis this is still possible Electricity was already high in California because of the environmental controls and difficulty of building new plants Very few new plants are being built and a perfectly good plant at San Onofre Unit was shut down reducing our resource margins Californians were not told that price volatility will be high in a free market as the price charged will be the price of the most expensive unit on line Today no one is talking about what happens during the low demand periods when the competition for selling power will be very high driving the price down to the point that some plants will probably want to pay you to use power so that they can stay on line Thus the situation of a free market system for electricity is not good for either a public that wants consistent bills or the power producers that can make money only when demand is very high It will take several years of bumpy conditions to iron out the competitive market for electricity Bill Hannaman PE Senior Staff Engineer DSS Dont blame this situation on the market players a utility without generation is like a race car without tires Until investors customers and employees stand as one against utilities selling off all their generation this situation will continue to be one of simple market economics supply vs demand The only winners are the executives of these utilities as they get rewarded for the high sale prices of the plants while customers are exposed to higher prices and lower reliability and sadly employees lose jobs pay level and seniority that are hard if not impossible to replace Frank Richards Technical Sales Rep Austin Energy IF there is manipulation of prices price caps are not the way to penalize the criminals because price caps affect every single seller not the individual or handful of individuals who are restraining the market and acting against the public interest I do tend to believe that price runups in California today arent due to market manipulators so much as they are due to the regulatory neglect and complacency bordering on hubris CA has labored under for the past years with no new plants being built while domestic demand grew and regional available importable supply shrank Returning to price caps isnt it fairly simple to illustrate that the California caps have served to do the following normal sellers of power sell at x Lets say there are nefarious actors who withhold power to later sell it at artificially inflated prices of x rather than the market rate of x that would have arisen as demand increased and supply tightened This is crude but bear with me In high dudgeon the politicians intervene and impose a cap of x which captures the bad actors but also unfortunately penalizes all of the other actors in the market slam dunking them in order to stop the few bad actors Results All the investors who put money into the market in good faith that the rules would allow them to make an adequate return on their investment are now penalized by caps that shave off money from their profitmaking times in the market for what is so far an unproven allegation against other unspecified bad actors So how many will want to build in this market with this new and highly volatile form of risk And what California accomplished for fifteen years through regulatory neglect it will now persist to accomplish through political intemperance Putting caps onto the market will not solve shortages it will not solve price problems more plants will not be built transmission wont be built reliability will get worse California is in for many more years of problems if they dont put their energy problems in order What is with California and price controls First President Richard Nixon who imposed national wage and price controls which failed miserably had to be pulled off because they only hid not solved problems that continued to fester and contributed greatly to the inflation of the later s Now price caps which will do about the same William Jordahl Manager FederalState Relations Alliant Energy The Electric Wholesale Market and Deregulation in general is primarily in name only One of the regional issues is the allowance of existing monopolistic participants to divest wholesale production in their own service territory and to ultimately repurchase wholesale production under nonregulated entities in the same electrical region Allowing the same entities to have monopolistic ownership of the transportation and distribution of the product while also owning nonregulated regional wholesale production of the product begs for market problems Placing caps on the wholesale price of the product not only masks the real issues but also could prevent the entrance of new participants Anonymous Senior Domestic Marketing Manager NA NA Are power generators deliberately manipulating the market to obtain higher profits in San Diego Of course they are the bidding rules for selling power into the PX require that all producers receive the price asked for by the most expensive producer selected Thus there is a tremendous profitmaking incentive to withhold power until the price goes up But the bidding rules are only a part of the problem The whole premise that electric power can be delivered competitively is a big lie Why As economist Eugene Coyle explains in Price Discrimination Electronic Redlining And Price Fixing in Deregulated Electric Power Washington DC American Public Power Association a commodity product with high fixed costs will force producers to discriminate between customers to collude with each other to maintain profits and to merge to eliminate competitors The best examples are the airlines which charge different prices between leisure and business customers who collude through their ticketing computers and who have merged into four or so major carriers and they are exploring joint ventures to reduce it to about two or three The same is now happening in deregulated electricity Many will argue that electricity competition hasnt been given a fair chance However even if you believe that competition can somehow develop in a commodity market with high fixed costs who will have the political muscle to create more competitive wholesale markets which will require true open access to the transmission system Enron the loudest promoter of open access just got its butt kicked by the big investorowned utilities which have proved their strength on Capitol Hill by killing open access legislation And the big forprofit holding companies are very strong at the state level as well So just as we have been saying for more than four years deregulation will only lead to unregulated monopolies because of the physical and economic nature of the electric power itself and because no one has the political power to enact the structural reforms needed to overcome the power of the forprofit holding companies that still completely dominate this industry Charlie Higley Energy Research Director Public Citizen I believe the answer to the question is NO The problem is lack of supply during peak demand periods The cry for reregulation is ludicrous Part of what FERC intended with the implementation of wholesale deregulation was for the market to send accurate price signals to the supply side so they would be motivated to develop and innovate new forms of supply and demand side management And this is precisely what is occurring Politicians are ignoring the fact that the price of natural gas has at least doubled in the last several months the electric supply from the Pacific Northwest is reduced because of reduced summer runoffs that supply the extensive hydro system an unplanned nuclear plant outage as well as very hot weather covering the entire West Coast All of the combined events have contributed to the current problems faced in the West and more specifically southern California Is anyone complaining when during light load periods the price of power is low and at times almost zero Would regulation have changed any of this I fail to see how As long as consumption goes unchecked and the not in my backyard NIMBY prevails when companies propose additional new generation and transmission facilities we will continue to have high prices during peak demand While the above is a simplification of the problems being faced in the West these are some of the basic issues that need to be addressed whether wholesale deregulation had been implemented or not The opinions expressed above are my own and do not represent any official position of my company David F Perrino Director Market Development West Automated Power Exchange Grid Management Services Hot weather and lack of surplus capacity caused the price spikes and price caps now just prolong the pain The state of Californias actions in imposing wholesale price caps is a simple issue of politically motivated interference in the free market that will ultimately harm consumers The price caps tarnish the allure of investing in new generating capacity and the incentive for electricity buyers to plan ahead more effectively How many lotto tickets would a state sell if the politicos decided that a million prize is too extravagant Would reducing lotto winnings to make it a better producer of state revenue There are marketbased forwards derivatives and other mechanisms for buyers and retailers to protect themselves from price spikes caused by summer supply shortages The longterm answer is to let the market provide financial rewards To those who take risk to build generating capacity When enough new generators join in the market will reach equilibrium Eric C Williams Market Solutions Analyst EPRI Market Solutions Assuming that the excess demand in the wholesale market is based on capacity limits then capping market rates confuses the situation by encouraging consumption and discouraging conservation and the availability of alternative supply sources The de facto vertically integrated electric utility system with its comprehensive regulatory oversight has been in place since circa Transition to a restructured system is going to take more than a few years In the meantime dealing with system peak loads is where attention should be focused Reregulation and wholesale market caps on prices harken back to the old system Its time to begin figuring out how to deal with these system peaks more creatively Ken

Business Heats Up With Dereg Under FireEnron Calif Elec Business Heats Up By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones While federal regulators try to find a way to stabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California Enron Corp ENE has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities to sell them fixedprice power at a lower rate In the past month the Houstonbased electricity service provider entered into longterm fixedrate contracts with the city of Roseville and is negotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista Both of those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas Electric Co a unit of Sempra Energy Inc SRE and pay market rates for electricity Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels Resorts Worldwide Inc HOT one of the worlds largest hospitality companies to sell the company electricity at a fixed rate for the next years The company has four hotels in California three of which buy their power from SDGE Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel power at about cents per kilowatthour compared with the centsKWh Starwood said it was charged by SDGE in August Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal But Starwood said it expects to reduce its energy costs by more than million over the next years Enron the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the US will purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its experience to manage the risks while paying a fee to utilities like SDGE for use of their distribution networks That really is our core strength said Harold Buchanan chief operating officer for Enron Energy Services North America We understand how to manage those risks High Rates Driving Industrial Customers Cities To Switch The growing interest in fixedprice supply contracts is fueling a comeback of sorts for Enron The Houstonbased company had tried to break into Californias retail power market just after deregulation even spending nearly million to advertise the venture during the Super Bowl But Enron gave up trying to win residential customers in citing disappointing response and lowerthanexpected profits That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of promise Oddly enough now that deregulation is coming under attack in California soaring power prices are building demand for Enrons services The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are interested in signing longterm fixedrate contracts Buchanan said Overall what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego thats written in stone Buchanan said Its far cheaper than what theyre paying now with the utilities A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to comment The city of Roseville near Sacramento entered into a million contract with Enron last month to purchase megawatts of electricity for five years at per megawatthour Furthermore the city has started talks with Enron about building and operating a megawatt natural gasfired power plant that city officials expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price spikes that have plagued customers of SDGE since June San Marcos in San Diego County is proposing to switch electricity service for its residents to Enron from SDGE a move the City Council said could shave about million a year off the citys power bill Enron has said it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville An SDGE spokesman said last week that the utility supports such arrangements saying theyre one way deregulation is supposed to work Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDGE itself for four years at a fixed rate of centsKWh but the utility said the price was too high California Gov Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap electricity rates for SDGEs customers at centsKWh By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Folder Name Enron Energy

Assistance for Customers DATELINE SAN DIEGO July BODY To provide its customers with additional assistance this summer and next San Diego Gas Electric SDGE has requested from the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC million over the next two years to increase funding for energyefficiency programs Our customers need assistance today in lowering their energy costs and todays proposal will bring an additional million funding to encourage energy conservation in our region said Edwin A Guiles president of SDGE This money can be used to help replace old inefficient appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators which will result in reduced electric bills and less strain on our states electricsupply system Of the million SDGE would allocate an additional million exclusively for lowincome energyefficiency assistance programs over the next two years Under the proposal filed Friday the lowincome assistance funds will be used to expand existing programs such as refrigerator and evaporative cooler replacements while introducing new programs including room airconditioner replacements and evaporative cooler maintenance and repair The program also includes incentives for landlords to replace refrigerators and air conditioners in rental units The rest of the money would go into other energyefficiency programs to provide incentives for removal and recycling of operating second refrigerators refrigerator and room airconditioner replacement replacement of inefficient pool pumps and increased incentives for a variety of programs to benefit small businesses Funds for these additional incentives come from programs that did not draw as much customer participation as expected For instance large customers requested less than half the amount budgeted for a program designed to provide energyefficiency incentives to them Details on the programs are still being developed but they should be in place in early September The CPUC is expected to act on SDGEs filing in late August In Californias newly created competitive energy marketplace SDGE is a deliveryservice provider For those customers who have not chosen another energy service provider SDGE buys electricity from the California Power Exchange CalPX and passes that cost directly onto its customers with no markup The price of power is now a function of supply and demand in the open market Over the last several weeks SDGE customers have seen their electric bills rise sharply due to the significant increase in commodity costs as a result of power demand in California and surrounding states Fridays proposal marks the latest in a series of actions SDGE has taken recently to help customers grapple with high electric prices On July SDGE and the CalPX proposed a new marketbased power bidding solution to the CPUC that would allow SDGE to procure power for customers with less price volatility over the next five to nine months On July SDGE filed a request with the CPUC to accelerate the return of million in customer money from a CPUCcontrolled account The CPUCs approval of SDGEs request would release of money acquired from powergenerating benefits of San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and other assets would decrease the August and September residential electric bills by or a month That proposal combined with the deregulationdividend checks most SDGE customers will receive next month will result in a total of about million benefit to them in August and September nearly for the typical residential customer helping to ease cashflow problems from higher electricity prices The company is actively promoting a levelpay program to all customers which enables them to even out their bill payments over the course of the year so they can manage better against their monthly household budget Those customers participating in the plan will see bills this summer that are comparable to last summers bills SDGE also has increased communications to both residential and business customers regarding the changes in the energy marketplace available energyefficiency funding and conservation tips for reducing electric bills Information about these programs is available by calling

BDeregulationB Aug Dow Jones Online News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc CHICAGO Dow Jones BElectricityB BderegulationB has suffered a setback in California as the state grapples with short supply and rising prices But other states are pushing ahead with opening their BpowerB markets to competition saying their approach should avoid the problems plaguing the state which led the nation down the BderegulationB path four years ago California has seen its BpowerB market roiled by heat waves that left the state scrambling to meet demand and by soaring prices in San Diego and southern Orange County the first region of the country to have its BpowerB market completely BderegulatedB California is giving deregulation a bad name said Texas state Sen David Sibley a Republican who helped craft the bill to deregulate that states power industry But I still feel good about the bill we passed I feel even better about it Deregulation backers outside of California said that states experience has been sullied by two basic shortcomings insufficient power generation to cover the states demand and the exposure of retail customers to market rates before a competitive retail market had emerged By contrast Texas expects to have plenty of power generation on hand when it opens its retail power markets to competition on Jan Unlike California where uncertain market conditions local opposition and until recently insufficient power prices have kept power plant developers waiting in the wings Texas has attracted billions of dollars in new powerplant investment More than megawatts will be added to the Texas grid before competition begins according to reports on new power plants Thats an increase of about over the states current generating capacity The bill they passed did not send the right signals to the market Sibley said of California a Texas legislators visited before addressing the issue in We learned from California what we did not want to do Like Texas Michigan hopes its success in attracting powerplant developers to the state will help it avoid Californias problems when it allows customers to start choosing their power providers on Jan According to Gary Kitts chief administrative officer at the Michigan Public Service Commission attracting independent power producers is a key element for creating healthy competition and prices at the retail level Michigan is only in the early stages of writing the rules that will restructure its power markets but major developers already have begun to show interest in building new plants in the state Only days after the state passed its restructuring bills this spring Dallasbased Panda Energy International Inc a privately held company announced plans to build a megawatt plant by late Two new merchant plants already have broken ground and three more are in the planning stage Kitts said Likewise Ohio regulators are hoping new power plant development will spark healthy competition at the wholesale and retail level when competition debuts Jan We have quite a bit of generation going in the next year said Ed Hess chief of the electricity division at the Ohio Public Utility Commission Ohio companies like Cinergy Corp CIN and FirstEnergy Corp FE are either planning new Ohio generators or have recently brought new plants on line Like Michigan Ohio companies wont have to sell off their plants as a condition of deregulation and expose themselves to wholesale price spikes as California utilities have had to do Also the state probably wont see wholesale price caps similar to a per megawatthour cap approved last week by Californias grid operator Hess said While caps can protect consumers from bloated wholesale power prices in the short term they can worsen the problem ultimately by deterring development of the new power plants needed to correct supply shortages said Sam Rendazzo a lawyer who represents an Ohio industrial users group Youre basically damping the pricing that developers are looking for he said California is perhaps the most dramatic evidence of a market thats not functioning In addition to counting on new generation deregulation advocates outside California also plan to insulate consumers from wholesale price swings until competitive retail markets exist Under the Texas restructuring law utility rates are frozen until the debut of competition At that time rates will drop and hold there for three years or until a utility has shed of its customers to competing retail suppliers There will be no authority to change rates until competition exists said a Texas Public Utilities Commission spokeswoman Michigan will also freeze its rates Kitts said for three or five years depending on the customer in hopes giving competitive markets time to develop Nevertheless Californias highprofile woes are making it harder to push deregulation elsewhere Oklahoma for example has set a target of mid for the start of retail competition But the state has yet to work out the details in legislation The Oklahoma House of Representatives defeated a bill in the final hour of this years session and a lawmaker said Californias problems will make deregulation a tougher sell in Compiled

With state power reserves falling below percent for the second straight day and the demand for electricity continuing to increase the California Independent System Operator CAISO issued a Stage Two electrical emergen cy on Tuesday A Stage Two Emergency is a serious occurrence as it signals that electric operating reserves in the state have fallen below percent The CalISO has issued over Stage Two emergencies this summer leaving little doubt that the power supply problem in California has reached disastrous proportions Other states and foreign countries such as Japan that have deregulated their energy marketsor are about to do sohave kept a cl ose eye on the problems in California These problems have sparked a national debate over whether returning to or maintaining a regulated energy market is a better option ANALYSIS Ive been tracking the chronic problems facing California in RCIs IssueAlerts for several months so for further background please visit our archives at the link offered below Yet generally speaking its fairly obvious that the promises of deregulation in California have not materialized Limited transmission lines the fact that no new power plants have been built in almost two decades and a percent increase in demand have driven costs up in California instead of down On Tuesday approximately MW of power was consumed topping Mondays peak of MW Exacerbating the already tight supplies is the fact that some MW of generation mostly in Southern California are unavailable due to power plant mechanical failures However perhaps even more pertinent is a movement that I am seeing develop both within California and other states that arguably is a direct result of the problems weve seen on the West Coast This movement is founded on a platform that suggests deregulated energy markets should become regula ted once again and those states that havent adopted a restructuring plan should take a timeout and reconsider if competition truly offers more benefits than headaches Not surprisingly California lawmakers and consumer advocatesblaming deregulation for the high rates that customers of San Diego Gas Electric are now payin g suggested that the California market should become reregulated Proposals included imposing more governmental control over energy prices which led to the recent lowering of the price cap in the state to MW to having utility companies buy back all the power plants they were forced to sell only two years ago But the discussion of reregulation has not been limited to California The New York City Council for instance has posted a bill that would give the City authority to regulate the output of lead into the atmosphere As lead is a small part of the pollution generated by power plants if this bill passes the City would have a handle on power generation that it does not now have Even more striking is the coalition of lowcost energy states that have petitioned Congress to exempt them from participating in deregulation The LowCost Electricity States Initiative LCESI actually has been in existence for over a year but is gaining momentum again now that it can use California as an example of all that is wrong with deregulation Some of these states only want to open their wholesale markets to competition but not their retail markets Others want to avoid deregulation altogether As a lobbying group the LCESI has tried to convince Congress that any federal restructuring law should be secondary to state plans and that any mandate regarding state participation in deregulation will be appealed Other lowcost states have started to drag their heels regarding deregulati on even if they have not officially joined LCESI Iowa for instance recently decided that it wont even pursue the issue of deregulation during the session of its legislature upon the urging of the states largest utility MidAmerican Energy New Mexico which had previously approved a start date of Jan for electric competition now has delayed that start date until Jan to further investigate the impact that competition will have on the state On the other hand two states that are moving forward with their Jan start datesIllinois and Ohiocontinue to watch California closely bu t think such problems will be averted in their own states Ohio points to the fact that its rate freeze wont be lifted for five years which will protect residents from the kind of price spikes now hurting customers in San Diego Illinois customers also will benefit from a longer rate freeze and the fact that regulators in the statehaving watched problems regard ing supply materialize in Californiaallowed for incumbent utilities to dive st of their power plants but did not mandate it Thus importing power from the wholesale market wont be as necessary in Illinois as it is in Californ ia However between the members of LCESI and the approximately states that have adopted some form of a restructuring plan the United States is almost evenly divided with regard to states that would or would not be participating in deregulation But realistically would states even be allowed to optout from electric competition Perhaps this might work on the wholesale market but ultimately I cannot see half of the US state s retreating from retail competition if the other half is participating When educated properly about the true benefits of competition electric customersespecially industrial and commercial customerswill push fo r competition within their states or go to states where they can choose their energy provider In addition because of the way the nations transmission grid is structured it would be near impossible to transport power any great distance if states along the way refuse to grant access to their transmission lines Moreover perhaps it is not entirely wise to use California as a test examp le for how deregulation will work nationally as the LCESI is now attempting to do First California clearly made some mistakes in its own restructurin g plan not the least of which was the combination of mandating divestiture and not allowing new plants to be built ultimately leaving the state with power supply problems But other states are learning from these mistakes and developing better restructuring plans Second states such as Pennsylva nia have adopted longer periods for rate freezes and stranded cost recovery thus protecting customers from price spikes for a longer period Third deregulation in California has only been in effect for two and half years To write it off as a failure

San Diego UnionTribune Page B B Copyright The current brouhaha surrounding San Diego BelectricityB bills is a poignant reminder of just how politicized an issue can become under the rubric of fostering the public good In this case Californias sevenyear BelectricB industry BderegulationB effort with complete support and crafting from the Democraticcontrolled state Legislature is being made the whipping boy for the current price spikes The truth is anything but Nevertheless facts have never stopped elected officials politically appointed regulators or consumer advocates as they try to elbow one another out of the way to be seen by consumers as their patron saint In the debate over this summers high power bills it is the very folks who are screaming the loudest who have contributed the most to the crisis Among the culprits Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon the Legislature Public Utilities Commission member Carl Wood and San Diego GasElectric Co each has contributed to the bills going through the roof But having said that it never has been nor does it need to be a crisis for the state or for San Diego County California will survive the current electrical bumps and grinds but it may not survive the political fallout It is now clear that two Gov Gray Davis appointees Wood and CPUC President Loretta Lynch want to reregulate the electric industry as does Sen Peace SDGE unfortunately was dumb enough to help establish the climate that has allowed them to demagogue the issue and escalate its importance way out of proportion Start with a recent assault by Wood to declare that a radical deregulation policy driven by ideology rather than economic soundness has created a crisis The cornerstone of the problem as Wood sees it is that there havent been any major power plants built in the state in more than a decade It is also true that when Californias electric restructuring law was unanimously passed four years ago there was an oversupply of generation capacity within the state Wood wants to turn that around by mandating utilitybuilt power plants Wood knows all too well that more than a dozen major generation plants are under construction or in the states lethargic approval process right now If magically they could all be built by next summer California would be awash in electrons They cant but there is the prospect for getting ahead of the curve by the summer of if the state Gov Davis most specifically does something to accelerate the current siting approval process Earlier this month the governor set in motion work to streamline the siting process Regulatory intervention some call it reregulation is what Peace has had on his mind at least since winter when at an energy discussion held in San Diego he sounded the drumbeat for the government to try to correct what he perceives as failings in the market At the same time he and his colleagues in the Legislature for the past couple of years have stymied CPUC moves to step up the deregulation process for both natural gas and electricity Most notably Peace engineered a bipartisan rider in this years budget bill that prevented the states utilities from buying some of their power supplies outside the statecreated power exchange That move and SDGEs passive financial management helped eliminate one means of lessening the current electric bill shock There are further design flaws in Californias restructured electricity market initiated by Peace to buffer San Diego from having the highest priced power in the state that have complicated the newly developing market and for which politicians take no responsibility Finally there is SDGE which clings to its own selfproclaimed fiction that it is only an energy delivery service and holds no responsibility for what has happened to the million households and businesses using the juice it delivers In fact however the utility company could have taken some steps in the spring in terms of financial riskmanagement instruments offered through the California power exchange that would have lowered the price spike It also could have been more aggressive in promoting conservation by customers Subsequently SDGE has been tripping all over itself making emergency filings to the CPUC seeking authorizations it could have aggressively pursued before the crisis The regulators granted everything it asked for finally on Aug But SDGE does have a generating role it still has a percent interest in the San Onofre nuclear plant and a corporate affiliate operates a new power plant in Nevada And guess where that plant sold all of its power

Business Heats Up With Dereg Under FireEnron Calif Elec Business Heats Up By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones While federal regulators try to find a way to stabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California Enron Corp ENE has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities to sell them fixedprice power at a lower rate In the past month the Houstonbased electricity service provider entered into longterm fixedrate contracts with the city of Roseville and is negotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista Both of those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas Electric Co a unit of Sempra Energy Inc SRE and pay market rates for electricity Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels Resorts Worldwide Inc HOT one of the worlds largest hospitality companies to sell the company electricity at a fixed rate for the next years The company has four hotels in California three of which buy their power from SDGE Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel power at about cents per kilowatthour compared with the centsKWh Starwood said it was charged by SDGE in August Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal But Starwood said it expects to reduce its energy costs by more than million over the next years Enron the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the US will purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its experience to manage the risks while paying a fee to utilities like SDGE for use of their distribution networks That really is our core strength said Harold Buchanan chief operating officer for Enron Energy Services North America We understand how to manage those risks High Rates Driving Industrial Customers Cities To Switch The growing interest in fixedprice supply contracts is fueling a comeback of sorts for Enron The Houstonbased company had tried to break into Californias retail power market just after deregulation even spending nearly million to advertise the venture during the Super Bowl But Enron gave up trying to win residential customers in citing disappointing response and lowerthanexpected profits That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of promise Oddly enough now that deregulation is coming under attack in California soaring power prices are building demand for Enrons services The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are interested in signing longterm fixedrate contracts Buchanan said Overall what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego thats written in stone Buchanan said Its far cheaper than what theyre paying now with the utilities A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to comment The city of Roseville near Sacramento entered into a million contract with Enron last month to purchase megawatts of electricity for five years at per megawatthour Furthermore the city has started talks with Enron about building and operating a megawatt natural gasfired power plant that city officials expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price spikes that have plagued customers of SDGE since June San Marcos in San Diego County is proposing to switch electricity service for its residents to Enron from SDGE a move the City Council said could shave about million a year off the citys power bill Enron has said it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville An SDGE spokesman said last week that the utility supports such arrangements saying theyre one way deregulation is supposed to work Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDGE itself for four years at a fixed rate of centsKWh but the utility said the price was too high California Gov Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap electricity rates for SDGEs customers at centsKWh By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Folder Name Enron Energy

wholesale market have caused electric bills to soar for San Diego Gas Electric customers this summer Are power generators deliberately manipulating the market to obtain higher profits and if so should price caps be imposed to protect ratepayers WHAT IS THIS The Deregulation Watch Public Forum is a free interactive service provided by Energy Central Every three weeks we address an issue related to the deregulation and restructuring of the electric power industry It is designed to provide a platform for the intelligent examination of issues a forum where industry professionals can share their pro con and middleoftheroad views on a variety of issues SEE THE END OF THIS MESSAGE FOR SUBSCRIBEUNSUBSCRIBE INFORMATION SUBMITTING YOUR OPINION AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THIS SERVICE SELECTED RESPONSES I have been following the California story for some time I have consulted with CA utilities over the past years and have spent considerable time examining the recent events and their history I believe each and every person that reviewed and approved Californias deregulation should be required to go back to school and take Economics I dont believe the AG in California will find any manipulation unless the generators have figured a way to control the weather and raise temperatures degrees above normal There is no significant baseline power in California The consumers regulators and politicians in California that have been pushing for deregulation are experiencing first hand the effects the flawed legislation California enacted and the reality of economics The regulators in California the NE part of the country and elsewhere created imbalanced markets in the s and early s We now are asking the same agencies if not the same individuals that created the mess to fix it Talk about the fox watching the hen house but its even better The fox built a hen house and is being asked to fix the problem now that were noticing chickens are missing Spot market prices for ANY commodity will skyrocket when demand increases dramatically and supply is limited If you cap prices youll almost certainly create shortages I would have hoped we would have learned something from the seventy years of Communist rule in Russia Can you say RATIONING Almost everyone has been misled to believe electric prices will decline under competition without examining the underlying capital and operating realities of the electric industry compared to other deregulated industries If you want your power at prices below those a free market will support be prepared to go without your electricity at times After an accurate comparison of the electric industry to other deregulated industries you will discover that in a fully deregulated electric industry retail electric prices will average from to percent higher than existing prices And prices will reach from five to ten times above current prices at times during demand spikes David L Robbins NA NA David ellsFargoCOM The answer is Yes and No Tremendous price increases for the cost of energy over the last months have an inevitable impact on the cost of generating electricity However those price increases do not cover the full extent of the increased cost for electricity for San Diego Gas and Electric My sources tell me that there has been some collusion among the major IPPs servicing SDGE which accounts for some of the other increases SDGEs mismanagement accounts for the rest Carl R Clark President Energetech Corp Was any assistance offered recently when the price of gas increased Would any assistance be offered in any substantive way if the price of sugar or rice increased The increase in electricity prices is a function of a mismatch between supply and demand The consumers concerns about this issue should be heard by suppliers in the form of new peaking power units cogeneration combinedcycle technology or improvements to the efficiency of existing generating plants If local suppliers are unwilling or unable to address the issue new suppliers will do so Market forces work well enough in other sectors they will work in CA given time David Whitehead VP Sales GENTRACK Sanderson Computers The generators are closely following the rules set by the independent system operator The solution would be to have the consumers educated enough to demand and pay for a service that provides them consistent pricing this would be a niche for a service provider to go to the generators and capture enough generation capacity at a given rate to meet the customer demands One thing that is not discussed in any of these articles is the average price of electricity over a longer period say the entire year In addition as I recall during the transition period the ratepayers received quite a reduction in rates Gary Hilberg Vice President Business Development The PIC Energy Group Competition is as competition does usually with little thinking or planning involved Some of us in California tried to bring various forms of planning and scenario forecasting to management and public eyes on thoughts on the future But scenarios of belief in the growandbuild era of the ss tended to overforecast load growth for nuclear power a year just as it was logical for management to believe in low forecasts for the s a year in the deregulation era The reality of growth cycles is a bit like saying feet in ice and hand in fire ie the average temperature is pretty comfortable Was AB a good thing No value judgement it was a political deal for billion Remember Diablo Canyon Some CEOs and public officials made their careers on this sort of thinking Best wishes California hopefully there will be light in the night skies Place blame appropriately NA NA NA Is this question a joke Of course they are This behavior will continue as long as the PR fog that has been created by the IOUs shameful campaigns while they have had their hands in our pockets These managements know they will not be fit to compete in a competitive market and will do anything to keep the fat dumb and happy mindset promoted they think that blaming their shortage exploitation on deregulation Randy Castleberry CEO Tempulse Information Management Whether or not individual generators are trying to manipulate is not the question and price caps are certainly not the answer The main problem is that the press has been led to believe that the situation is the result of years of deregulation not the years of regulation that led to shortages of both generation and transmission In addition one must remember that the vast majority of generation remains under regulatory andor legislated prices only about is actually bid and cleared no wonder the market thinness has lead to volatility Second price auction certainly doesnt help since everybody gets paid whatever the one manipulating is the highest bidders bid Price caps will only stifle the construction of new supply and new supply is half of the answer to price volatility The other half is meaningful demand responsive behavior price caps will hide true costs from consumers and stifle that too A little more patience is whats needed Tom Tanton NA California Energy Commission Oh sure why not it worked for the phone companies right well didnt it Okay Admittedly theyre making over twentypercent returns on investments but youve never heard about a phone brownout have you David Draper Regulatory Analyst Florida Public Commission SCSTATEFLUS Power marketers and utilities with generating capacity to sell and traders to sell it are not manipulating the market just taking advantage of the opportunities it is offering Thats what a market unfettered by regulation is about The answer to your second question then is that price caps are clearly reregulation and antifree market We either deregulate or reregulate the electric industry Reginald Ankrom President EnNova Energy Solutions You reap what you sow CA rushed into deregulation without a complete review of the impact Market value means profit and any company to remain in business looks at the profit motive as the primary driving force Putting a cap on prices is going back to the old system of guaranteeing a profit without regard to efficiency and conservation The current system like all systems in the past will eventually self correct Users and suppliers will reach a common plateau It may take some time and may hurt financially but eventually we will work it out The United States has historically swung in large amplitudes in everything we have done From complete isolationism prior to WWII to complete globalization in the s and s from no environmental controls to what some people may consider excessive tight controls I wish us a happy future Signed Someone who has been in the power business longer than he would like to NA NA NA NA If coal is the least expensive fuel install two used coalfired steam generators boilers each capable of supplying turbo generators adequate for the entire San Diego County load As an alternative install used boilers capable of burning waste fuel to supply the turbogenerators free fuel is a very good price San Diego can surely issue the various permits Sell any surplus power so the residents of San Diego can enjoy free electricity ie generate for centsKWh and sell it for I understand a large quantity of used equipment is available Fifty years associated with power generation in USA and overseas NA NA NA Market manipulation no Taking advantage of a somewhat silly demandsupply imbalance situation yes The analogy that comes to mind is that of a farmer whose crops in the midst of a drought are doing okay so he can charge more for them We should remember that this same farmer at other times will suffer through lean times where supply exceeds demand A few additional points The current focus in the press is on summer price spikes What about the generally lower energy commodity prices that SDGE ratepayers got in the winter and spring Until a bunch of merchant plant capacity comes online to serve the California market things may get uglier before they get better Then again maybe Mr Greenspans interest rate hikes finally will begin to take effect Summer price spikes in California seem to be lower than spot market situations that occasionally occur in the Midwest and in the New York area How about getting the CEC off its duff and getting some additional generating and transmission capacity approved Dont count out DSM completely yet at least for peakshaving Phil Sisson NA Sisson and Associates Inc Price spikes in California as in other parts of the country are a sign of electricity markets that are not entirely efficient or competitive In the specific case of California the reasons for this can be found in the way that the state has deregulated the market and the subsequent actions they have taken in an attempt to control it CalISOs creation of the governmentgranted monopoly known as the PX or power exchange helped to ensure that Californias market could never truly be efficient Many of Californias generators are forced to buy and sell from this power pool which discourages the development of a true robust bilateral market for wholesale electricity The introduction of further price caps not only discourages power marketers from shortterm sales into the state in times of need but also creates an atmosphere that will discourage longterm entry as well as the development of independent generation California needs real robust competition not another step deeper into the regulatory morass that they have created Kevin ODonovan Director Government Affairs Industry Networks I live in the Pacific Northwest yet we are paying prices as high and at times higher than southern California Generators are withholding power until pricing reaches acceptable levels in markets where they can sell not in local service areas Why else would generation be reduced for economic reasons Once again opportunists have twisted a good idea into a profitable venture for a very small group The concept of deregulation was to enhance competition through freedom of choice of the end user NOT THE SUPPLIER We are a captive audience Try to get by for just one day without use of electricity When price controls were removed generators and marketers were allowed to set pricing at whatever level they wanted There is not one single fuel source used by medium to large generators that costs an equivalent of per MWh A solution would be to cap prices not at a fixed level but at a cost of service fuels maintenance labor etc plus a maximum allowable profit margin Also require generators to run regardless of economics Under the must run would be a requirement to satisfy native loads and contract obligations before selling power outside of local service territories Lets get away from pricing based on whatever the market will bear and get back to pricing based on cost of service Let the electric industry face the same economic problems as the rest of industry David Michaelson PE Electrical Engineer Industrial Energy Manager NA NA I believe that the current deregulated marketing infrastructure invites manipulation and artificially inflated rates simply because the new laissezfaire market has no real constraints The new arbitrage trading has created multiple layers of parasites who are living well by adding no value to the commodityonly extra cost to the end user The trend of abuse is clear and I think price ceilings are inevitable Roy Chip Burton Project Engineer MultiLevel Technologies Inc As a market moves up the supply curve on peak there is no doubt that there is more supplier concentration and the potential for market manipulation However price caps are not a satisfactory longterm solution to high prices They will inevitably lead to blackouts A better longterm solution will be encourage more competition by identifying and removing barriers to new peaking and base load generation particularly distributed generation that can be located in load centers to serve peak loads Peter Evans Senior Vice President Catalytica Combustion Systems The twopart question goes first to motive then to solution No one can prove THAT the generators are gaming the system versus the system is working as it should The fact is that the result of operating the open market system as presently designed is unacceptable It is totally unacceptable that the competitive market in California is supposed to and attempting to operate in a condition of supplydemandprice equilibrium that does not exist That Californians should pay many billions of extra dollars to support an ineffective market system imposed upon them by regulators and legislators in the name of lower costs is sane only to those currently lining their pockets That price caps are needed in this ineffective or as some people laughingly call it imperfect market goes without question That generators or marketers cannot make a buck at a per MWh cap is laughable This is five times more than consumers ever paid for energy The only issue that needs resolving is how long the price caps should remain in effect That answer should depend on when the promised marketinequilibrium can be brought to bear and when a workable western RTO can guarantee economic transmission rates for California consumers Otherwise reregulate At any cost it will be cheaper than where were heading Joe Bongiovanni General Manager Hardwick Electric Department I believe that the people in San Diego are not able to see the full picture regarding deregulation of electric rates They were proposed as a means of overall rate reduction because of competition and on a yearly basis this is still possible Electricity was already high in California because of the environmental controls and difficulty of building new plants Very few new plants are being built and a perfectly good plant at San Onofre Unit was shut down reducing our resource margins Californians were not told that price volatility will be high in a free market as the price charged will be the price of the most expensive unit on line Today no one is talking about what happens during the low demand periods when the competition for selling power will be very high driving the price down to the point that some plants will probably want to pay you to use power so that they can stay on line Thus the situation of a free market system for electricity is not good for either a public that wants consistent bills or the power producers that can make money only when demand is very high It will take several years of bumpy conditions to iron out the competitive market for electricity Bill Hannaman PE Senior Staff Engineer DSS Dont blame this situation on the market players a utility without generation is like a race car without tires Until investors customers and employees stand as one against utilities selling off all their generation this situation will continue to be one of simple market economics supply vs demand The only winners are the executives of these utilities as they get rewarded for the high sale prices of the plants while customers are exposed to higher prices and lower reliability and sadly employees lose jobs pay level and seniority that are hard if not impossible to replace Frank Richards Technical Sales Rep Austin Energy IF there is manipulation of prices price caps are not the way to penalize the criminals because price caps affect every single seller not the individual or handful of individuals who are restraining the market and acting against the public interest I do tend to believe that price runups in California today arent due to market manipulators so much as they are due to the regulatory neglect and complacency bordering on hubris CA has labored under for the past years with no new plants being built while domestic demand grew and regional available importable supply shrank Returning to price caps isnt it fairly simple to illustrate that the California caps have served to do the following normal sellers of power sell at x Lets say there are nefarious actors who withhold power to later sell it at artificially inflated prices of x rather than the market rate of x that would have arisen as demand increased and supply tightened This is crude but bear with me In high dudgeon the politicians intervene and impose a cap of x which captures the bad actors but also unfortunately penalizes all of the other actors in the market slam dunking them in order to stop the few bad actors Results All the investors who put money into the market in good faith that the rules would allow them to make an adequate return on their investment are now penalized by caps that shave off money from their profitmaking times in the market for what is so far an unproven allegation against other unspecified bad actors So how many will want to build in this market with this new and highly volatile form of risk And what California accomplished for fifteen years through regulatory neglect it will now persist to accomplish through political intemperance Putting caps onto the market will not solve shortages it will not solve price problems more plants will not be built transmission wont be built reliability will get worse California is in for many more years of problems if they dont put their energy problems in order What is with California and price controls First President Richard Nixon who imposed national wage and price controls which failed miserably had to be pulled off because they only hid not solved problems that continued to fester and contributed greatly to the inflation of the later s Now price caps which will do about the same William Jordahl Manager FederalState Relations Alliant Energy The Electric Wholesale Market and Deregulation in general is primarily in name only One of the regional issues is the allowance of existing monopolistic participants to divest wholesale production in their own service territory and to ultimately repurchase wholesale production under nonregulated entities in the same electrical region Allowing the same entities to have monopolistic ownership of the transportation and distribution of the product while also owning nonregulated regional wholesale production of the product begs for market problems Placing caps on the wholesale price of the product not only masks the real issues but also could prevent the entrance of new participants Anonymous Senior Domestic Marketing Manager NA NA Are power generators deliberately manipulating the market to obtain higher profits in San Diego Of course they are the bidding rules for selling power into the PX require that all producers receive the price asked for by the most expensive producer selected Thus there is a tremendous profitmaking incentive to withhold power until the price goes up But the bidding rules are only a part of the problem The whole premise that electric power can be delivered competitively is a big lie Why As economist Eugene Coyle explains in Price Discrimination Electronic Redlining And Price Fixing in Deregulated Electric Power Washington DC American Public Power Association a commodity product with high fixed costs will force producers to discriminate between customers to collude with each other to maintain profits and to merge to eliminate competitors The best examples are the airlines which charge different prices between leisure and business customers who collude through their ticketing computers and who have merged into four or so major carriers and they are exploring joint ventures to reduce it to about two or three The same is now happening in deregulated electricity Many will argue that electricity competition hasnt been given a fair chance However even if you believe that competition can somehow develop in a commodity market with high fixed costs who will have the political muscle to create more competitive wholesale markets which will require true open access to the transmission system Enron the loudest promoter of open access just got its butt kicked by the big investorowned utilities which have proved their strength on Capitol Hill by killing open access legislation And the big forprofit holding companies are very strong at the state level as well So just as we have been saying for more than four years deregulation will only lead to unregulated monopolies because of the physical and economic nature of the electric power itself and because no one has the political power to enact the structural reforms needed to overcome the power of the forprofit holding companies that still completely dominate this industry Charlie Higley Energy Research Director Public Citizen I believe the answer to the question is NO The problem is lack of supply during peak demand periods The cry for reregulation is ludicrous Part of what FERC intended with the implementation of wholesale deregulation was for the market to send accurate price signals to the supply side so they would be motivated to develop and innovate new forms of supply and demand side management And this is precisely what is occurring Politicians are ignoring the fact that the price of natural gas has at least doubled in the last several months the electric supply from the Pacific Northwest is reduced because of reduced summer runoffs that supply the extensive hydro system an unplanned nuclear plant outage as well as very hot weather covering the entire West Coast All of the combined events have contributed to the current problems faced in the West and more specifically southern California Is anyone complaining when during light load periods the price of power is low and at times almost zero Would regulation have changed any of this I fail to see how As long as consumption goes unchecked and the not in my backyard NIMBY prevails when companies propose additional new generation and transmission facilities we will continue to have high prices during peak demand While the above is a simplification of the problems being faced in the West these are some of the basic issues that need to be addressed whether wholesale deregulation had been implemented or not The opinions expressed above are my own and do not represent any official position of my company David F Perrino Director Market Development West Automated Power Exchange Grid Management Services Hot weather and lack of surplus capacity caused the price spikes and price caps now just prolong the pain The state of Californias actions in imposing wholesale price caps is a simple issue of politically motivated interference in the free market that will ultimately harm consumers The price caps tarnish the allure of investing in new generating capacity and the incentive for electricity buyers to plan ahead more effectively How many lotto tickets would a state sell if the politicos decided that a million prize is too extravagant Would reducing lotto winnings to make it a better producer of state revenue There are marketbased forwards derivatives and other mechanisms for buyers and retailers to protect themselves from price spikes caused by summer supply shortages The longterm answer is to let the market provide financial rewards To those who take risk to build generating capacity When enough new generators join in the market will reach equilibrium Eric C Williams Market Solutions Analyst EPRI Market Solutions Assuming that the excess demand in the wholesale market is based on capacity limits then capping market rates confuses the situation by encouraging consumption and discouraging conservation and the availability of alternative supply sources The de facto vertically integrated electric utility system with its comprehensive regulatory oversight has been in place since circa Transition to a restructured system is going to take more than a few years In the meantime dealing with system peak loads is where attention should be focused Reregulation and wholesale market caps on prices harken back to the old system Its time to begin figuring out how to deal with these system peaks more creatively Ken

illustrate flaws in the system As the states booming economy taxes the ability to meet electricity demands a federal investigation is underway CHRIS KRAUL TIMES STAFF WRITER Aug Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page A Copyright The Times Mirror Company With Southern Californians reeling from skyrocketing electric bills critics charge that fewer than a dozen power suppliers are reaping far greater profits than are justified by the recent surge in wholesale prices of the natural gas they use to create electricity Their behavior is a major focus of a formal investigation announced last week by federal regulators Among those under scrutiny are power merchants including BDukeB BEnergyB BDynegyB BReliantB BEnergyB Calpine Southern Co and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Critics say the companies are earning huge windfalls selling energy to the two state agencies charged with distributing power in California The power merchants themselves deny any profiteering describing their market moves as legal business practices and welcoming the investigation The underlying cause of Californias energy turmoil is a severe shortage of powergenerating capacity to meet the soaring energy demands of the states booming economy This summer the state at times has had to import more than of its energy needs a shortfall equal to the output of about mediumsize power plants No plants of any size have been built in the state in years But the problem goes beyond a supplyanddemand imbalance The socalled merchant power companies ability to bend the market to their advantageusing what appear to be legal strategiesillustrates what many say are serious flaws in the states deregulated energy market One major flaw is that sellers do not have to participate in the states main electricity auctionthe socalled day forward sale held one day before electricity is delivered to the states residences and businesses Instead generators are withholding power until the day of delivery when desperate state agencies are willing to pay steep prices to keep the power flowing The upshot has been a doubling of electric bills for the million customers in San Diego GasElectrics coverage area and Southern California Edison and Pacific GasElectric customers may be facing higher prices once their rates are unfrozen in There is little prospect for shortterm relief with no additional power generation due for a year the prices of natural gas and crude oil are still rising In fact state officials expect the market to become tighter over the next year as demand and fuel prices rise In pointing the finger at the power merchants Gov Gray Davis some academics and utility executives charge that California consumers are being victimized by sophisticated trading techniques that take advantage of the market system to extract huge profits Deregulation only works if people act responsibly It wont work if people say their only goal is to make as much money as humanly possible Davis said last week This brokering takes place on the California Power Exchange and the Independent System Operator two agencies created by the legislation that ostensibly opened up of the states power marketrepresented by the PGE SCE and SDGE service areasto competition To create that competition lawmakers ordered the utilities to sell power plants to independent companies which now are selling electricity to the state The Power Exchange is a clearinghouse for the bulk of energy trading that is completed a day in advance of delivery which normally fills most of the states energy needs The ISO the nominal traffic cop arranging deliveries over the power grid also has the authority to hold sameday power auctions for immediate delivery in the event of unexpectedly high demand The Power Exchange is subject to a price cap of per megawatthour a ceiling imposed earlier this summer as prices began to soar But the ISO has the authority to pay as much as it has to for supplementary power if the previousday purchases prove insufficient to keep the states lights on And it is the secondary ISO market where power suppliers leveraging a sellers market are holding sway By withholding their energy from the Power Exchange and opting instead to bid their supply to the ISO they are betting that sameday shortages will generate prices as close to the price cap as possible possibly even above it Its apparently working On some days the ISO has ended up buying onefifth of the states energy needs not the to maximum originally envisioned In the process desperate to meet demand the ISO is paying premium prices and those prices are being passed along to consumers The problem with the market apparently defies easy solutions At an emergency meeting Friday to discuss ways of dealing with the crisis the ISO board rejected a staff proposal to force energy merchants to allocate at least of the electricity they intend to sell in the day forward auction held by the Power Exchange instead of holding back until the day of delivery Although ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure would restore some market order the board rejected it on fears that it might create unforeseen ramifications possibly even power suppliers abandoning the state altogether As the market stands now independent power companies have been able to exploit the power shortages and the markets quirks to charge the state higher rates than the increases in the price of natural gas would seem to warrant said Severin Borenstein a UC Berkeley professor and energy specialist With fellow UC Berkeley professor James Bushnell and Stanfords Frank Wolak Borenstein studied the Power Exchange over a month period ended in September and found evidence of market power or the power generators ability to raise prices above competitive levels for sustained periods Unless there is collusion among two or more power providers the exercise of market power is not illegal experts say But if prolonged it is a symptom of a seriously dysfunctional market I think market power has probably gotten worse this year There are players big enough to move the price and move it a lot Prices are clearly way above their costs Borenstein said Edison CEO John Bryson and Stephen Baum head of SDGE parent Sempra Energy have similar criticisms Their claims will be investigated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the latest of five probes underway into Californias worsening energy predicament Well see whether there are alternative market rules that should be adopted to have a better functioning more efficient market said Daniel Larcamp FERCs director of market tariffs and rates Looking at market power issues is an important focus of our investigation Power suppliers Duke Energy and Calpine denied any market manipulation saying the bulk of their energy is sold on longterm contracts and is not used to unduly sway dayahead prices on the Power Exchange or sameday sales on the ISO No way are we manipulating the market and we have welcomed investigation into our business practices said Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energys California regional office in Morro Bay Its easy to point fingers at someone who controls only of the market much of which has already been sold in the forward market months ago Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander said the high prices are simply a case of demand far outstripping the states ability to meet it Ten years ago you had more supply than demand Now you have a skyrocketing demand from population growth a robust economy and Internetfed additions to demand Highlander said Charles Cicchetti a USC professor of government business and the economy agrees and said the market is performing exactly as expected given supply shortages He objects to the limited price ceilings opposed by state officials The choice should be to either regulate the whole thing go back to where we were or let the market work Cicchetti said This hybrid is causing problems to get worse But something appears to be worsening an already bad pricing situation and critics believe it is market manipulation In the FERC order initiating its investigation the agency noted that Californias wholesale electricity costs on June were milliona sevenfold increase over the same date in Over the same period natural gas prices only doubled FERC will look at other aspects of the states energy deregulation as wellat the fact that utilities have no choice but to purchase power from the central power exchange and have only limited power to hedge or make bilateral deals on their own with outside firms In an interview last week the FERCs Larcamp said his agency is reserving the right to roll back rates order refunds or even impose a new market framework to replace the Power Exchange and ISO Larcamp said the FERCs probe will contrast Californias troubled power market with the PennsylvaniaMarylandNew Jersey system which gives end users more freedom to cut their own deals with suppliers The result is that Pennsylvania has more than power suppliers competing for the states business versus no more than in California Times staff writers Nancy Vogel and Nancy Rivera Brooks

Interactive R Server Software Folder Industry News Headlines Consumers Grow More Anxious As They Are Cut Loose In BElectricitysB New Free Market Metropolitan Desk Section Feeling Powerless In Consumers Grow More Anxious As They Are Cut Loose In BElectricitysB New Free Market By KIRK JOHNSON Aug New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Over the last years a dogma has taken root in America that says people would be happier and better off if they were all continually shopping for the best deals Consumers according to this theory should be empowered and freed from the old business monopolies and the dictates of fussy bureaucrats So airlines were deregulated and telephone service and then the Internet arrived giving people the ability to choose from different sellers of the same merchandise The bull market on Wall Street brought mutual funds begging for attention Having more choices became an end in itself But for millions of people especially in New York and California the doctrine of the sovereign consumer has come into question this summer around a commodity that most had taken completely for granted BelectricityB A recently deregulated BenergyB market which was supposed to increase choices and reduce prices has for most residents done nothing of the kind Many community leaders and politicians calling for investigations and caps on rising BelectricityB bills up percent to percent from those of last August in many areas have denounced BenergyB BderegulationB as either a failure or a fraud Some social scientists say that the anxiety over BenergyB is exposing something even deeper in the human wiring At a time when protesters have railed in Seattle and Washington against chain stores and global branding and prominent social critics have denounced the intrusion of endless choice into every corner of life a phenomenon that Barry Schwartz a psychologist at Swarthmore College calls the tyranny of freedom the publics worries about BelectricityB may say more about human nature than about kilowatts Perhaps this alternative theory says there is a point at which people no longer wish to be autonomous rational consumers at all Maybe they would just as soon delegate their decisions regarding some transactions as they did when Consolidated Edison was the only game in town and government was assigned to make sure that the company played by the rules Maybe when it comes to BelectricityB a mysterious and dangerous thing that is also the foundation of modern living Americans are just a little afraid to be alone In the past we trusted that state regulators who were appointed by our elected officials were watching out for us which may or may not have been true said Edward A Smeloff a former utility industry official who runs a research group on BelectricityB at Pace University The new model is Figure it out for yourself Some economists and BenergyB industry experts say the sense of powerlessness and confusion that many people feel is perhaps as much a source of anxiety and anger as higher BelectricityB bills The players have all changed and no one seems to be in charge The old Brooklyn Union Gas Company for example still remembered by many New York residents for the fuzzy feelgood images of its advertising has become the cool and metallicsounding KeySpan BEnergyB The old Con Ed on the other hand was like a crotchety grandfather who sometimes had to be prodded and yelled at but who nonetheless presided over the system The company now throws up its hands and says it is not responsible for recent price increases Con Eds wires are simply a delivery mechanism for the unregulated corporations that own generating plants Con Eds chairman said at a recent hearing at City Hall Opinion poll takers say anxiety about deregulation may also have something to do with a contradiction in the American psyche that they say has opened up in recent years a contradiction about what people really want Surveys conducted by Yankelovich Partners a research and consulting firm based in Norwalk Conn have said for example that a majority of people want more control over the details of their lives but a majority also want to simplify their lives a result that Barbara R Caplan a partner at the firm has called the paradox of our time Deregulated BenergyB arrived right in the middle of those conflicting goals because only a handful of BenergyB competitors have been attracted to the New York market most people still do not have much choice in their BelectricityB and yet it all seems more complicated than ever as well as more expensive Another factor some researchers say may be a result of timing People have had experience with deregulation and they have seen that it did not always unfold to their benefit The hubandspoke system developed by the airline industry for example has given airlines nearmonopoly power at many airports around the country resulting in less competition not more Consumers have also seen that although tools like the Internet have made buyers more powerful in getting good prices corporations on the other side of the transaction have become more powerful too in gathering information about them Years ago you went into an auto dealership and had to negotiate to buy a car but only the corporate side had knowledge of what the real costs were said Mark L Gillenson a professor of management information systems at the University of Memphis Now you go into the Internet and lots of places will give you that information for free On the other hand Professor Gillenson said the data that corporations are collecting about people are creating what the old car dealer could never have imagined knowledge about what people want before they even ask Lurking behind all those forces some psychologists say is the growing sense that people are simply being asked to decide too much Economic deregulation has accompanied what may be called social deregulation as issues that were not even considered decisions in the past have become issues of conscious choice whether to get married and have children or how to express oneself sexually as gay straight or somewhere in between And the more choices there are the more it can seem possible to achieve an ideal result in every case leading to a doomed treadmill kind of behavior often seen in people who continually change their longdistance telephone service as they endlessly seek an incremental price advantage Over what domains in life are you supposed to have control said Professor Schwartz the Swarthmore College psychologist Nobody gets depressed when you cant control the weather and years ago nobody got depressed because they couldnt control your telecommunications or BelectricityB either because those things couldnt be controlled he said But now you can or youre told that you can and so youre going to be continually frustrated And BelectricityB is also just different Unlike a telephone call or an airline ticket nobody ever really wants to buy BelectricityB itself rather people buy its expression and result a cold beer in the fridge a light to read by By the standards of American marketing it is barely a product at all People want to make choices about clothes and restaurants and what houses they live in but a lot of us would rather not be bothered with having to make a choice about BelectricityB said Wendy Kaminer a public policy fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Cambridge Mass Its not a desire to be disempowered Ms Kaminer added Its a desire not to be bothered Finally some experts think that the long bull market for stocks in which share prices mostly just go up has made people forget a fundamental truth about how markets work they are genuinely fair only over the long run while at any given time there are likely to be as many losers as winners Deregulation and privatization were sold implicitly on the assumption that everybody can win from this but Im hard pressed to find an example in the real world where that has happened said Willis Emmons a professor in the strategy public policy and ethics department at Georgetown Universitys business school Right now Professor Emmons added maybe somebody is winning but it isnt the consumer NYTF To view all headlines in the folder Industry News go to browsearticlesaspfolderid To go to the

Industry News Headlines Duplicity and demagoguery on electricity OPINION Duplicity and demagoguery on electricity Richard Nemec Nemec is a Los Angelesbased writer who covers the energy industry Aug San Diego UnionTribune Page B B Copyright The current brouhaha surrounding San Diego BelectricityB bills is a poignant reminder of just how politicized an issue can become under the rubric of fostering the public good In this case Californias sevenyear BelectricB industry BderegulationB effort with complete support and crafting from the Democraticcontrolled state Legislature is being made the whipping boy for the current price spikes The truth is anything but Nevertheless facts have never stopped elected officials politically appointed regulators or consumer advocates as they try to elbow one another out of the way to be seen by consumers as their patron saint In the debate over this summers high power bills it is the very folks who are screaming the loudest who have contributed the most to the crisis Among the culprits Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon the Legislature Public Utilities Commission member Carl Wood and San Diego GasElectric Co each has contributed to the bills going through the roof But having said that it never has been nor does it need to be a crisis for the state or for San Diego County California will survive the current electrical bumps and grinds but it may not survive the political fallout It is now clear that two Gov Gray Davis appointees Wood and CPUC President Loretta Lynch want to reregulate the electric industry as does Sen Peace SDGE unfortunately was dumb enough to help establish the climate that has allowed them to demagogue the issue and escalate its importance way out of proportion Start with a recent assault by Wood to declare that a radical deregulation policy driven by ideology rather than economic soundness has created a crisis The cornerstone of the problem as Wood sees it is that there havent been any major power plants built in the state in more than a decade It is also true that when Californias electric restructuring law was unanimously passed four years ago there was an oversupply of generation capacity within the state Wood wants to turn that around by mandating utilitybuilt power plants Wood knows all too well that more than a dozen major generation plants are under construction or in the states lethargic approval process right now If magically they could all be built by next summer California would be awash in electrons They cant but there is the prospect for getting ahead of the curve by the summer of if the state Gov Davis most specifically does something to accelerate the current siting approval process Earlier this month the governor set in motion work to streamline the siting process Regulatory intervention some call it reregulation is what Peace has had on his mind at least since winter when at an energy discussion held in San Diego he sounded the drumbeat for the government to try to correct what he perceives as failings in the market At the same time he and his colleagues in the Legislature for the past couple of years have stymied CPUC moves to step up the deregulation process for both natural gas and electricity Most notably Peace engineered a bipartisan rider in this years budget bill that prevented the states utilities from buying some of their power supplies outside the statecreated power exchange That move and SDGEs passive financial management helped eliminate one means of lessening the current electric bill shock There are further design flaws in Californias restructured electricity market initiated by Peace to buffer San Diego from having the highest priced power in the state that have complicated the newly developing market and for which politicians take no responsibility Finally there is SDGE which clings to its own selfproclaimed fiction that it is only an energy delivery service and holds no responsibility for what has happened to the million households and businesses using the juice it delivers In fact however the utility company could have taken some steps in the spring in terms of financial riskmanagement instruments offered through the California power exchange that would have lowered the price spike It also could have been more aggressive in promoting conservation by customers Subsequently SDGE has been tripping all over itself making emergency filings to the CPUC seeking authorizations it could have aggressively pursued before the crisis The regulators granted everything it asked for finally on Aug But SDGE does have a generating role it still has a percent interest in the San Onofre nuclear plant and a corporate affiliate operates a new power plant in Nevada And guess where that plant sold all of its power

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDD ConsultRCIcom IssueAlert August A Return to Regulation California Problems Spark National Trend By Will McNamara DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDD With state power reserves falling below percent for the second straight day and the demand for electricity continuing to increase the California Independent System Operator CAISO issued a Stage Two electrical emergen cy on Tuesday A Stage Two Emergency is a serious occurrence as it signals that electric operating reserves in the state have fallen below percent The CalISO has issued over Stage Two emergencies this summer leaving little doubt that the power supply problem in California has reached disastrous proportions Other states and foreign countries such as Japan that have deregulated their energy marketsor are about to do sohave kept a cl ose eye on the problems in California These problems have sparked a national debate over whether returning to or maintaining a regulated energy market is a better option ANALYSIS Ive been tracking the chronic problems facing California in RCIs IssueAlerts for several months so for further background please visit our archives at the link offered below Yet generally speaking its fairly obvious that the promises of deregulation in California have not materialized Limited transmission lines the fact that no new power plants have been built in almost two decades and a percent increase in demand have driven costs up in California instead of down On Tuesday approximately MW of power was consumed topping Mondays peak of MW Exacerbating the already tight supplies is the fact that some MW of generation mostly in Southern California are unavailable due to power plant mechanical failures However perhaps even more pertinent is a movement that I am seeing develop both within California and other states that arguably is a direct result of the problems weve seen on the West Coast This movement is founded on a platform that suggests deregulated energy markets should become regula ted once again and those states that havent adopted a restructuring plan should take a timeout and reconsider if competition truly offers more benefits than headaches Not surprisingly California lawmakers and consumer advocatesblaming deregulation for the high rates that customers of San Diego Gas Electric are now payin g suggested that the California market should become reregulated Proposals included imposing more governmental control over energy prices which led to the recent lowering of the price cap in the state to MW to having utility companies buy back all the power plants they were forced to sell only two years ago But the discussion of reregulation has not been limited to California The New York City Council for instance has posted a bill that would give the City authority to regulate the output of lead into the atmosphere As lead is a small part of the pollution generated by power plants if this bill passes the City would have a handle on power generation that it does not now have Even more striking is the coalition of lowcost energy states that have petitioned Congress to exempt them from participating in deregulation The LowCost Electricity States Initiative LCESI actually has been in existence for over a year but is gaining momentum again now that it can use California as an example of all that is wrong with deregulation Some of these states only want to open their wholesale markets to competition but not their retail markets Others want to avoid deregulation altogether As a lobbying group the LCESI has tried to convince Congress that any federal restructuring law should be secondary to state plans and that any mandate regarding state participation in deregulation will be appealed Other lowcost states have started to drag their heels regarding deregulati on even if they have not officially joined LCESI Iowa for instance recently decided that it wont even pursue the issue of deregulation during the session of its legislature upon the urging of the states largest utility MidAmerican Energy New Mexico which had previously approved a start date of Jan for electric competition now has delayed that start date until Jan to further investigate the impact that competition will have on the state On the other hand two states that are moving forward with their Jan start datesIllinois and Ohiocontinue to watch California closely bu t think such problems will be averted in their own states Ohio points to the fact that its rate freeze wont be lifted for five years which will protect residents from the kind of price spikes now hurting customers in San Diego Illinois customers also will benefit from a longer rate freeze and the fact that regulators in the statehaving watched problems regard ing supply materialize in Californiaallowed for incumbent utilities to dive st of their power plants but did not mandate it Thus importing power from the wholesale market wont be as necessary in Illinois as it is in Californ ia However between the members of LCESI and the approximately states that have adopted some form of a restructuring plan the United States is almost evenly divided with regard to states that would or would not be participating in deregulation But realistically would states even be allowed to optout from electric competition Perhaps this might work on the wholesale market but ultimately I cannot see half of the US state s retreating from retail competition if the other half is participating When educated properly about the true benefits of competition electric customersespecially industrial and commercial customerswill push fo r competition within their states or go to states where they can choose their energy provider In addition because of the way the nations transmission grid is structured it would be near impossible to transport power any great distance if states along the way refuse to grant access to their transmission lines Moreover perhaps it is not entirely wise to use California as a test examp le for how deregulation will work nationally as the LCESI is now attempting to do First California clearly made some mistakes in its own restructurin g plan not the least of which was the combination of mandating divestiture and not allowing new plants to be built ultimately leaving the state with power supply problems But other states are learning from these mistakes and developing better restructuring plans Second states such as Pennsylva nia have adopted longer periods for rate freezes and stranded cost recovery thus protecting customers from price spikes for a longer period Third deregulation in California has only been in effect for two and half years To write it off as a failure

the bill to deregulate that states power industry But I still feel good about the bill we passed I feel even better about it Deregulation backers outside of California said that states experience has been sullied by two basic shortcomings insufficient power generation to cover the states demand and the exposure of retail customers to market rates before a competitive retail market had emerged By contrast Texas expects to have plenty of power generation on hand when it opens its retail power markets to competition on Jan Unlike California where uncertain market conditions local opposition and until recently insufficient power prices have kept power plant developers waiting in the wings Texas has attracted billions of dollars in new powerplant investment More than megawatts will be added to the Texas grid before competition begins according to reports on new power plants Thats an increase of about over the states current generating capacity The bill they passed did not send the right signals to the market Sibley said of California a Texas legislators visited before addressing the issue in We learned from California what we did not want to do Like Texas Michigan hopes its success in attracting powerplant developers to the state will help it avoid Californias problems when it allows customers to start choosing their power providers on Jan According to Gary Kitts chief administrative officer at the Michigan Public Service Commission attracting independent power producers is a key element for creating healthy competition and prices at the retail level Michigan is only in the early stages of writing the rules that will restructure its power markets but major developers already have begun to show interest in building new plants in the state Only days after the state passed its restructuring bills this spring Dallasbased Panda Energy International Inc a privately held company announced plans to build a megawatt plant by late Two new merchant plants already have broken ground and three more are in the planning stage Kitts said Likewise Ohio regulators are hoping new power plant development will spark healthy competition at the wholesale and retail level when competition debuts Jan We have quite a bit of generation going in the next year said Ed Hess chief of the electricity division at the Ohio Public Utility Commission Ohio companies like Cinergy Corp CIN and FirstEnergy Corp FE are either planning new Ohio generators or have recently brought new plants on line Like Michigan Ohio companies wont have to sell off their plants as a condition of deregulation and expose themselves to wholesale price spikes as California utilities have had to do Also the state probably wont see wholesale price caps similar to a per megawatthour cap approved last week by Californias grid operator Hess said While caps can protect consumers from bloated wholesale power prices in the short term they can worsen the problem ultimately by deterring development of the new power plants needed to correct supply shortages said Sam Rendazzo a lawyer who represents an Ohio industrial users group Youre basically damping the pricing that developers are looking for he said California is perhaps the most dramatic evidence of a market thats not functioning In addition to counting on new generation deregulation advocates outside California also plan to insulate consumers from wholesale price swings until competitive retail markets exist Under the Texas restructuring law utility rates are frozen until the debut of competition At that time rates will drop and hold there for three years or until a utility has shed of its customers to competing retail suppliers There will be no authority to change rates until competition exists said a Texas Public Utilities Commission spokeswoman Michigan will also freeze its rates Kitts said for three or five years depending on the customer in hopes giving competitive markets time to develop Nevertheless Californias highprofile woes are making it harder to push deregulation elsewhere Oklahoma for example has set a target of mid for the start of retail competition But the state has yet to work out the details in legislation The Oklahoma House of Representatives defeated a bill in the final hour of this years session and a lawmaker said Californias problems will make deregulation a tougher sell in Compiled

He is working with their PR vp to determine how far they can go publically In case you missed DISTRIBUTION Business EditorsEnergy Writers LENGTH words HEADLINE SDGE Seeks Million for EnergyEfficiency Assistance for Customers DATELINE SAN DIEGO July BODY To provide its customers with additional assistance this summer and next San Diego Gas Electric SDGE has requested from the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC million over the next two years to increase funding for energyefficiency programs Our customers need assistance today in lowering their energy costs and todays proposal will bring an additional million funding to encourage energy conservation in our region said Edwin A Guiles president of SDGE This money can be used to help replace old inefficient appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators which will result in reduced electric bills and less strain on our states electricsupply system Of the million SDGE would allocate an additional million exclusively for lowincome energyefficiency assistance programs over the next two years Under the proposal filed Friday the lowincome assistance funds will be used to expand existing programs such as refrigerator and evaporative cooler replacements while introducing new programs including room airconditioner replacements and evaporative cooler maintenance and repair The program also includes incentives for landlords to replace refrigerators and air conditioners in rental units The rest of the money would go into other energyefficiency programs to provide incentives for removal and recycling of operating second refrigerators refrigerator and room airconditioner replacement replacement of inefficient pool pumps and increased incentives for a variety of programs to benefit small businesses Funds for these additional incentives come from programs that did not draw as much customer participation as expected For instance large customers requested less than half the amount budgeted for a program designed to provide energyefficiency incentives to them Details on the programs are still being developed but they should be in place in early September The CPUC is expected to act on SDGEs filing in late August In Californias newly created competitive energy marketplace SDGE is a deliveryservice provider For those customers who have not chosen another energy service provider SDGE buys electricity from the California Power Exchange CalPX and passes that cost directly onto its customers with no markup The price of power is now a function of supply and demand in the open market Over the last several weeks SDGE customers have seen their electric bills rise sharply due to the significant increase in commodity costs as a result of power demand in California and surrounding states Fridays proposal marks the latest in a series of actions SDGE has taken recently to help customers grapple with high electric prices On July SDGE and the CalPX proposed a new marketbased power bidding solution to the CPUC that would allow SDGE to procure power for customers with less price volatility over the next five to nine months On July SDGE filed a request with the CPUC to accelerate the return of million in customer money from a CPUCcontrolled account The CPUCs approval of SDGEs request would release of money acquired from powergenerating benefits of San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and other assets would decrease the August and September residential electric bills by or a month That proposal combined with the deregulationdividend checks most SDGE customers will receive next month will result in a total of about million benefit to them in August and September nearly for the typical residential customer helping to ease cashflow problems from higher electricity prices The company is actively promoting a levelpay program to all customers which enables them to even out their bill payments over the course of the year so they can manage better against their monthly household budget Those customers participating in the plan will see bills this summer that are comparable to last summers bills SDGE also has increased communications to both residential and business customers regarding the changes in the energy marketplace available energyefficiency funding and conservation tips for reducing electric bills Information about these programs is available by calling

By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This is a rough era for American business icons Subject to the vagaries of age Jack Welch product failure FordFirestone tires competition Lucent ATT technology HewlettPackard and Compaq and dotbomb bubbles CMGI managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business The latest example is Enron whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy Once considered one of the countrys most innovative companies Enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest The journalistic accounts of Enrons struggles drip with schadenfreude hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is needed High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revelations emerge Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value Deregulation and market competition Enron envisioned gas and electric power industries in the US where prices are set in an open market of bidding by customers and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit Enron was the leader in pioneering this business Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the US and is spreading to Europe Latin America and Asia The winners have been consumers who have paid lower prices and investors who have seen competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient The contrary experience of California the poster child of those who would reregulate the power industry is an example of not enough deregulation Innovation and the deintegration of power contracts Under the old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity customers were offered a onesizefitsall contract For many customers this system was inflexible and inefficient like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure by the truckload Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer To do this Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent parts starting with price and volume location time etc and offered customers choices on each one Again consumers won Enrons investors did too because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors Arguably Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the process of Creative Destruction But creative destroyers are not necessarily likable pleasant folks which may be part of Enrons problem today Minimization of transaction costs and frictions Enron extended the logic of deintegration to other industries An integrated paper company for instance owns forests mills pulp factories and paper plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate activities better than smaller specialized firms Enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of customers and suppliers Enron envisioned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the bet that the freemarket terms would be better than those of the internal operations The development of freemarket benchmarks for the terms by which divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the economy Exploiting the optionality in networks In the old regulated environment natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pipeline Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a number of possible sources opening the customer to the benefits of competition and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network so that they could nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons This policy picked up by others in the industry created tremendous value for both customers and suppliers Rigorous risk assessment The strategy of tailored contracts could easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the trading risks that the firm assumed and of very strong internal controls Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among the best anywhere Particularly with the advent of Enron Online where Enron made new positions valued at over billion each day it became essential to have uptothesecond information on companywide positions prices and ability to deliver The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by the firm but with fears among trading partners about Enrons ability to finance its trading activity In a world where contracts and trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance It was the erosion in equity rather than trading risk that destroyed the firm A culture of urgency innovation and high expectations Enrons corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all The Hollywood stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic hierarchical formal slow and full of excuses And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company Enron only years ago is even duller and slower Enron became bumptious impatient lean fast innovative and demanding It bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses create markets and transfer within the firm Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion and an openoffice design fostered brainstorming The firms organization and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs This was a lightning rod for the firms detractors And yet it could serve as a model for more hidebound enterprises to emulate Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformation of American business It created a ruckus in oncequiet corners of the business economy It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in which it did business It thrived on volatility The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major RD establishment especially given Dynegys track record as a second mover following Enrons lead Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and timeconsuming antitrust review Dynegys greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enrons spirit of innovation its own Or so we all should hope because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake their industries Messrs Bodily and Bruner are professors at the University of Virginias Graduate School of Business Administration

Under FireEnron Calif Elec Business Heats Up With Dereg Under FireEnron Calif Elec Business Heats Up By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones While federal regulators try to find a way to stabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California Enron Corp ENE has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities to sell them fixedprice power at a lower rate In the past month the Houstonbased electricity service provider entered into longterm fixedrate contracts with the city of Roseville and is negotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista Both of those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas Electric Co a unit of Sempra Energy Inc SRE and pay market rates for electricity Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels Resorts Worldwide Inc HOT one of the worlds largest hospitality companies to sell the company electricity at a fixed rate for the next years The company has four hotels in California three of which buy their power from SDGE Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel power at about cents per kilowatthour compared with the centsKWh Starwood said it was charged by SDGE in August Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal But Starwood said it expects to reduce its energy costs by more than million over the next years Enron the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the US will purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its experience to manage the risks while paying a fee to utilities like SDGE for use of their distribution networks That really is our core strength said Harold Buchanan chief operating officer for Enron Energy Services North America We understand how to manage those risks High Rates Driving Industrial Customers Cities To Switch The growing interest in fixedprice supply contracts is fueling a comeback of sorts for Enron The Houstonbased company had tried to break into Californias retail power market just after deregulation even spending nearly million to advertise the venture during the Super Bowl But Enron gave up trying to win residential customers in citing disappointing response and lowerthanexpected profits That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of promise Oddly enough now that deregulation is coming under attack in California soaring power prices are building demand for Enrons services The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are interested in signing longterm fixedrate contracts Buchanan said Overall what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego thats written in stone Buchanan said Its far cheaper than what theyre paying now with the utilities A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to comment The city of Roseville near Sacramento entered into a million contract with Enron last month to purchase megawatts of electricity for five years at per megawatthour Furthermore the city has started talks with Enron about building and operating a megawatt natural gasfired power plant that city officials expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price spikes that have plagued customers of SDGE since June San Marcos in San Diego County is proposing to switch electricity service for its residents to Enron from SDGE a move the City Council said could shave about million a year off the citys power bill Enron has said it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville An SDGE spokesman said last week that the utility supports such arrangements saying theyre one way deregulation is supposed to work Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDGE itself for four years at a fixed rate of centsKWh but the utility said the price was too high California Gov Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap electricity rates for SDGEs customers at centsKWh By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires

Earnings in California Enron Dynegy Report Huge Profits By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD As energy companies report third quarter earnings many active as wholesale providers are announcing huge profits For instance Enron Corp and Dynegy have both reported overthetop earnings for the third quarter reaping the benefits of skyrocketing energy prices and a continued focus on asset expansion Both companies benefited from high energy prices this summer especially in California where electricity prices soared to record levels resulting in a doubling and tripling of the generation part of power bills for San Diego Gas Electric Co SDGE customers At the same time that these companies are reporting huge earnings accusations have been leveled that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices ANALYSIS First let me say that I am not picking on Enron and Dynegy They just happened to release their Q earnings comparatively early openin g themselves up for evaluation According to the California Energy Commission other nonutility owners or traders of power in California include Calpine Destec Duke Reliant Southern and Williams who altogether own about percent of the generation in the state compared to the percent owned by Californias three investorowned utility companies As additional Q financial statements are released I would expect any company that is active on the wholesale market to report a significant increase in earnings reflective of the summer price volatility Even a midsize utility like the Public Service Company of New Mexico PNM has posted whopping profits for Q which it attributed directly to the scalding wholesale electric market in the Western United States With that said lets take a look at the numbers that we have for the big players which are startling Enrons recurring net income up percent rose to million or cents a share compared with third quarter earnings of million or cents a share By its own admission sales in Enrons four business unitswholesale energy operations and services retail energy services transportation and distribution and broadband servicesgrew nearly billion in the third quarter alone The income before interest minority interests and taxes IBIT reported by Enrons wholesale group increased percent in Q to million from millio n a year ago The commodity sales and services business increased IBIT to million in Q compared to million last year CEO Kenneth Lay says he is very optimistic about the continued strong growth of the compa ny Over at Dynegy they are singing the same happy tune Dynegy reported recurring net income of million or cents a share compared with Dynegy Illinova pro forma recurring net income of million or cents per share for the same period last year Much of this growth is coming from Dynegy Marketing and Trade whose reported net income increased to million percent of the companys consolidated net income While neither Enron nor Dynegy has mentioned California in their explanatio ns of the strong Q earnings clearly the high prices in the state must have played a large role in the companies profits I think most everyone was expecting any company active in wholesale trading to show strong numbers in the third quarter based on the high prices in California alone but the extent of the increase is really stunning The short answer for the price spikes has been that demand in the state increased to unanticipated highs while supply became stretched to meet the power needs Going a step further limited transmission lines the fact that no new significant power plants have been built in almost two decades and a percent increase in demand drove costs up in California instead of down Exacerbating the already tight supplies was the fact that some MW of generation mostly in Southern California was unavailable during the summer months due to power plant mechanical failures Plus growing demand in Arizona and lower hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest also contributed to the squeeze in supplies on which California could rely Customers of SDGE were hit hardest of all as the utility had paid off its stranded costs removing a rate freeze and exposing customers to marketbased prices Customers of the other two California IOUsSCE and PGEwere protected because they were still under a rate freeze However the utilities themsel ves claim to have also suffered from the price spikes as they buy a great deal of their power on the wholesale market Due to limited supplies PGE and SCE were forced to pay market prices for power but yet were unable to incre ase their customers rates For instance PGE claims it was paying KWh for energy when by law it could only charge customers KWh leaving it with an estimated billion debt that it is petitioning the CPUC to bill back to customers All of this has been characterized as the fiasco in California leaving many to conclude that the market in the state is not workably competitive The only clear winners in the situation were the wholesale providers who appeared to simply benefit from the low supply and high demand cycles that drove California this summer The California Power Exchange the states power auction through which all power is traded issued a recent report acknowledging that while the states electricity market is severely flawed it could find no patter n of abuse by any group individual or company participating in the states main electricity auction Rather the California PX maintains that the price spikes were caused by the high demand for electricity a lack of new generation higher naturalgas prices and a drop in outofstate electricity imports Yet a new report initiated by a group of utilities in the Pacific Northwes t casts doubt on this and suggests that wholesale providers actually caused the high energy prices A Portlandbased firm that conducted a private investigation of the California market asserts that the state had plenty of electricity generation this summer and that wholesale providers withhel d power to create artificially high prices Specifically the reportwritt en by economist and utility industry consultant Robert McColloughsays Cali fornia in fact had a percent reserve margin despite the high prices and the fact that the California ISO issued repeated power emergencies all summer claiming that the state was in a critical power shortage In addition McCollough claims that demand in California was actually lower than what was forecast by the Western Systems Coordinating Council Using EPA data to suggest that power plants ran below full capacity during peak times last summer McCollough accuses generators of voluntarily lowering their production to drive up pricesessentially creating a market power situat ion in which energy buyers are left with little choice but to pay exorbitant prices The report cites Dynegy as an example Dynegy and NRG Energy Inc are invol ved in a joint venture called Cabrillo Power which oversees the operation of the Encina power plant in Carlsbad Calif McCollough reports that the Encina plant operated at well below its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale prices were well above the generating plants cost of production A representative from Cabrillo Power denied that the Encina plant had been used to game the system in this way and stated that in fact the plant was often in danger of being shut down last summer due to heavy output The response to both McColloughs and the PXs report has been very mixed One camp remains steadfast in claiming that western states did indeed have a supply shortage this summer which was the primary reason for the high prices People in this camp also claim that data from the EPA about power plant emissions are questionable On the other hand other investigations continue following the same claim that generators have gamed the system The central question to be answered is whether or not companies that genera te andor trade power held back power from the California PX in order to force heavier use of realtime markets at higher prices Certainly wholesale providers knew that their power had to be dispatched and understandably they were pleased by the high price of power this summer Yet this is not the same thing as purposeful manipulation which has not been officially determined FERC and the CPUC have been examining these claims since July and the California attorney general also has initiated an investigation At this point there is no clear answeronly a lot of questions and one independent report that has made questionable assertions DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

services retail energy services transportation and distribution and broadband servicesgrew nearly billion in the third quarter alone The income before interest minority interests and taxes IBIT reported by Enrons wholesale group increased percent in Q to million from millio n a year ago The commodity sales and services business increased IBIT to million in Q compared to million last year CEO Kenneth Lay says he is very optimistic about the continued strong growth of the compa ny Over at Dynegy they are singing the same happy tune Dynegy reported recurring net income of million or cents a share compared with Dynegy Illinova pro forma recurring net income of million or cents per share for the same period last year Much of this growth is coming from Dynegy Marketing and Trade whose reported net income increased to million percent of the companys consolidated net income While neither Enron nor Dynegy has mentioned California in their explanatio ns of the strong Q earnings clearly the high prices in the state must have played a large role in the companies profits I think most everyone was expecting any company active in wholesale trading to show strong numbers in the third quarter based on the high prices in California alone but the extent of the increase is really stunning The short answer for the price spikes has been that demand in the state increased to unanticipated highs while supply became stretched to meet the power needs Going a step further limited transmission lines the fact that no new significant power plants have been built in almost two decades and a percent increase in demand drove costs up in California instead of down Exacerbating the already tight supplies was the fact that some MW of generation mostly in Southern California was unavailable during the summer months due to power plant mechanical failures Plus growing demand in Arizona and lower hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest also contributed to the squeeze in supplies on which California could rely Customers of SDGE were hit hardest of all as the utility had paid off its stranded costs removing a rate freeze and exposing customers to marketbased prices Customers of the other two California IOUsSCE and PGEwere protected because they were still under a rate freeze However the utilities themsel ves claim to have also suffered from the price spikes as they buy a great deal of their power on the wholesale market Due to limited supplies PGE and SCE were forced to pay market prices for power but yet were unable to incre ase their customers rates For instance PGE claims it was paying KWh for energy when by law it could only charge customers KWh leaving it with an estimated billion debt that it is petitioning the CPUC to bill back to customers All of this has been characterized as the fiasco in California leaving many to conclude that the market in the state is not workably competitive The only clear winners in the situation were the wholesale providers who appeared to simply benefit from the low supply and high demand cycles that drove California this summer The California Power Exchange the states power auction through which all power is traded issued a recent report acknowledging that while the states electricity market is severely flawed it could find no patter n of abuse by any group individual or company participating in the states main electricity auction Rather the California PX maintains that the price spikes were caused by the high demand for electricity a lack of new generation higher naturalgas prices and a drop in outofstate electricity imports Yet a new report initiated by a group of utilities in the Pacific Northwes t casts doubt on this and suggests that wholesale providers actually caused the high energy prices A Portlandbased firm that conducted a private investigation of the California market asserts that the state had plenty of electricity generation this summer and that wholesale providers withhel d power to create artificially high prices Specifically the reportwritt en by economist and utility industry consultant Robert McColloughsays Cali fornia in fact had a percent reserve margin despite the high prices and the fact that the California ISO issued repeated power emergencies all summer claiming that the state was in a critical power shortage In addition McCollough claims that demand in California was actually lower than what was forecast by the Western Systems Coordinating Council Using EPA data to suggest that power plants ran below full capacity during peak times last summer McCollough accuses generators of voluntarily lowering their production to drive up pricesessentially creating a market power situat ion in which energy buyers are left with little choice but to pay exorbitant prices The report cites Dynegy as an example Dynegy and NRG Energy Inc are invol ved in a joint venture called Cabrillo Power which oversees the operation of the Encina power plant in Carlsbad Calif McCollough reports that the Encina plant operated at well below its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale prices were well above the generating plants cost of production A representative from Cabrillo Power denied that the Encina plant had been used to game the system in this way and stated that in fact the plant was often in danger of being shut down last summer due to heavy output The response to both McColloughs and the PXs report has been very mixed One camp remains steadfast in claiming that western states did indeed have a supply shortage this summer which was the primary reason for the high prices People in this camp also claim that data from the EPA about power plant emissions are questionable On the other hand other investigations continue following the same claim that generators have gamed the system The central question to be answered is whether or not companies that genera te andor trade power held back power from the California PX in order to force heavier use of realtime markets at higher prices Certainly wholesale providers knew that their power had to be dispatched and understandably they were pleased by the high price of power this summer Yet this is not the same thing as purposeful manipulation which has not been officially determined FERC and the CPUC have been examining these claims since July and the California attorney general also has initiated an investigation At this point there is no clear answeronly a lot of questions and one independent report that has made questionable assertions DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

Under FireEnron Calif Elec Business Heats Up With Dereg Under FireEnron Calif Elec Business Heats Up By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow Jones While federal regulators try to find a way to stabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California Enron Corp ENE has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities to sell them fixedprice power at a lower rate In the past month the Houstonbased electricity service provider entered into longterm fixedrate contracts with the city of Roseville and is negotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista Both of those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas Electric Co a unit of Sempra Energy Inc SRE and pay market rates for electricity Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels Resorts Worldwide Inc HOT one of the worlds largest hospitality companies to sell the company electricity at a fixed rate for the next years The company has four hotels in California three of which buy their power from SDGE Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel power at about cents per kilowatthour compared with the centsKWh Starwood said it was charged by SDGE in August Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal But Starwood said it expects to reduce its energy costs by more than million over the next years Enron the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the US will purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its experience to manage the risks while paying a fee to utilities like SDGE for use of their distribution networks That really is our core strength said Harold Buchanan chief operating officer for Enron Energy Services North America We understand how to manage those risks High Rates Driving Industrial Customers Cities To Switch The growing interest in fixedprice supply contracts is fueling a comeback of sorts for Enron The Houstonbased company had tried to break into Californias retail power market just after deregulation even spending nearly million to advertise the venture during the Super Bowl But Enron gave up trying to win residential customers in citing disappointing response and lowerthanexpected profits That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of promise Oddly enough now that deregulation is coming under attack in California soaring power prices are building demand for Enrons services The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are interested in signing longterm fixedrate contracts Buchanan said Overall what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego thats written in stone Buchanan said Its far cheaper than what theyre paying now with the utilities A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to comment The city of Roseville near Sacramento entered into a million contract with Enron last month to purchase megawatts of electricity for five years at per megawatthour Furthermore the city has started talks with Enron about building and operating a megawatt natural gasfired power plant that city officials expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price spikes that have plagued customers of SDGE since June San Marcos in San Diego County is proposing to switch electricity service for its residents to Enron from SDGE a move the City Council said could shave about million a year off the citys power bill Enron has said it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville An SDGE spokesman said last week that the utility supports such arrangements saying theyre one way deregulation is supposed to work Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDGE itself for four years at a fixed rate of centsKWh but the utility said the price was too high California Gov Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap electricity rates for SDGEs customers at centsKWh By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires
