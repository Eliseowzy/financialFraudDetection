turquoise the Turkish stoneis highly prized throughout Asia and Africa not for its particular hoe of blue a beautiful robins egg or sky blue but more important for its supposed prophylactic and therapeutic qualities The Arabs consider it a lucky stone and have great confidence in its benevolent action Used in rings earrings necklaces head ornaments and amulets it protects the wearer from poison reptile bites eye diseases and the evil eye It was also believed capable of warning of impending death by changing color Buddhists revere the turquoise because it is associated with a legend in which a turquoise enabled Buddha to destroy a monster Even today it is considered a symbol of courage success and love It has also long been associated American Indian jewelry and art Turquoise is an opaque light to dark blue or blue green stone The finest color is an intense blue with poorer qualities tending toward yellowish green The famous Persian turquoise which can be very intense and pleasing blue is considered a very rare and valuable gem The United States Arizona and New Mexico is also an important source of fine turquoise and is now the major source of turquoise used in jewelry worldwide All turquoises are susceptible to aging and may turn greenish or possibly darker with age Also care must be taken when wearing both to avoid contact with soap grease or other materials that might discolor it and to protect it from abuse since turquoise scratches fairly easily But exercise caution when buying turquoise This is a frequently simulated gem Very fine glass imitations are produced that are difficult to distinguish from the genuine Very fine adulterated stones and reconstructed stones from turquoise powder bonded in plastic saturate the marketplace as does synthetic turquoise Make sure you are buying genuine natural turquoise THE DRESDEN DIAMOND GREEN GLORY The legendary carat Dresden green diamond is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC right next to the Hope diamond until January th of next yearthanks to Ronald Winston son of the th centurys most famous jewel merchant Harry Winston Today the Dresden is to green diamonds what the Hope is to blues the most famous gem of its kind Estimated to have lost at least percent of its original caratplus weight during cutting this green giant takes the prize for size as well as beauty Keep in mind that beauty in green diamonds is nothing like beauty in emerald jade or green grossular garnet Natural green diamonds are extremely uncommon occurrences the result of irradiation deep within the earth And when they are found most are pale in color and light in tone running a hue spectrum from apple to algae green Dont expect these diamonds to sport stop light or shampoogreen colors Nevertheless the Dresden is a marvelfrom a standpoint of both shading and size True there are green diamonds without the vibrancy muting gray of the Dresden but their far smaller size makes them seem tiny in comparison The Dresden is such a behemoth at least as far as green diamonds go that it sets a standard that will likely never be challenged let alone beat Photo dresdenhtm DO YOU WANT A COLORED GEMSTONE If you have ever wanted a gorgeous colored gemstone but never knew how to find one this is your chance to have one hand picked for you In Tucson Arizona during the first weekend of February the countrys largest colored gem trade show brings gem wholesalers from all over the world We will be attending the show to hand select the nicest gems possible for our customers There are hundreds of booths of gems including ruby emerald sapphire garnet amethyst tourmaline jade peridot spinel and tanzanite If you would like us to add your name to our shopping list give us a call and tell us what you are looking for Every year we make many customers dreams come true as we find terrific values on the highest quality gemstones in the world MENS WEDDING BANDS While there are hundreds if not thousands of womens wedding ring style there are relatively few common style of mens rings The vast majority of men prefer some type of comfort fit wedding band The term comfort fit comes from the rounded inside of the ring that helps eliminate the sharp edges Comfort bands come in a variety of finishes including polished two tone hand craved and milgrain edges For men the choice seems to focus more on the width of the band which can range from millimeters wide alll the way up to millimeters Sometimes couples decide to get matching bands andor rings but generally each will pick what they think looks best and is most comfortable to them While the current trend is for the use of platinum in womens wedding rings men are often surprised how heavy and expensive a wide mans band is if it is done in platinum Yellow andor white gold is still the preferred metal for men Because men tend to wear their rings all the time the rings tend to take much more abuse than a womens ring A women will take her ring off to wash her hands do the dishes or fix dinner Men leave their rings on to mow the yard fix the car or participate in sports This is probably why you dont see many diamonds in mens wedding bands plus the fact that men learn early that most families can only afford one jewelry lover Note Many of our newsletter subscribers did not receive the October issue so we are including those articles below DIAMOND DISTRICT DANGERS When we visit with customers we often hear that they are contemplating making a trip to the diamond district in New York to shop for a diamond Many people have heard of the major diamond trading center located on th Street in New York and the myth is that you can get a good deal there In reality the wholesale trading takes place high above the street in highsecurity offices hidden from the public The vendors on the street are more skilled at taking your money than anyone you will find in your community They are fast taking high pressure salesman who specialize in letting tourist think they are getting a deal They often sell uncertified diamonds and reply on the difficulty of customers returning to the Diamond District as part of their sales strategy We recommend you never buy from anyone in the Diamond District in New York unless you are there with a trusted retailer who takes you to the true dealers who are not at street level Dont become another statistic of one who got ripped off while trying to get a good deal in the Diamond District ONLY BUY THE CLARITY YOU NEED We see more and more customers being told they need VVS clarity or they will be able to see inclusions in the their diamond Why pay for something you can not see For all shapes except emerald we suggest VS or SI as your minimum clarity requirement since with an SI you can not see anything with your naked eye The truth is that you can not see the difference between SI and all the higher clarity grades except with a microscope Higher clarity than SI does not add to beauty of the diamond only the rarity and therefore the price By starting with an SI clarity you will get a bigger diamond and have a better selection for getting a great cut The highest clarity grades cost more but are not necessarily going to appreciate as much as the grades in most demand such as VS and SI as explained at investmenthtm on our web site The reality is that the first speck of dust that settles on the diamond has much more visual impact on the beauty of the diamond than anything in a diamond that is at least a certified SI clarity grade OFF SALE You have all seen the billboards and newspaper ads advertising half off sale at your local jeweler It is not uncommon for stores to mark up items so they can mark them halfprice during a sale Its no great deal if you are paying let alone over wholesale Dont fall for sales of any kind If a dealer can afford to mark it down then they marked it up too high at the start PRICE CALCULATOR Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape color grade clarity grade and carat weight to determine an estimate of our price for that type of diamond If you havent tried it yet check it out at costhtmcalc FAMOUS DIAMONDS Name The Star of Sierra Leone Weight carats rough Valentines Day A routine workday at the diamond mine in Sierra Leone Suddenly a company engineer and a plant security officer spot something big on the grease table grease sticks to diamonds and is used to separate diamonds from ore At first neither man could believe what they saw There trapped by the grease is a huge diamond the size of a hens egg When the stone is first offered for sale none of the sealed bids reaches the minimum price of more than million set by the government Finally months later Harry Winston makes a deal for the Star Winston wants a worldclass diamond from his rough A carat emerald cut is fashioned but upon close examination it reveals inclusions Winston changes his mind deciding that flawlessness is more important than size The big diamond is recut into seven smaller stones the largest of which weighs carats Besides these the rough yields other stones ranging from to carats All told Winston recovers only carats a staggering loss of almost percent But of the finished stones are reportedly flawless GEM OF THE DAY Keep smiling Even when life knocks you flat on your back you are still in a good position to look up BEWARE OF FRACTIONS The FTC Federal Trade Commission allows jewelers to round off diamond weights For example a diamond labeled carat in weight might actually weigh anywhere between and carat While these are small weights the price difference can be significant For instance if you bought earrings with G color SI clarity and carat in each ear for you might have over paid by if they really weight carats Note Jewelers are also allowed to be off one color and one clarity grade If you dont purchase a certified diamond you could find yourself at the short end on weight color clarity and therefore value INTERNET SALES Internet shoppers are expected to spend almost billion online during the holiday season nearly double last years total of billion according to a recent survey by the Gartner Interactive Firm About half that revenue is expected to go to US and Canadian etailers with the rest distributed among firms in Europe and Asia Robert Labatt principal analyst for Gartners eBusiness Services Unit credits the increased willingness to do business online to the etailers extensive efforts in increasing the customers comfort level Chat rooms and opportunities to interact with the internet firms are encouraging more people to try this form of commerce DIAMOND GRADING TIPS FLUORESCENCE Fluorescence if present in a diamond will be indicated on a diamond grading report It will be graded very faint faint medium strong or very strong Some reports indicate the color of fluorescence as blue yellow white and so on A stone with yellow fluorescence should sell less since it will appear yellower than it really is when worn in daylight or fluorescent lighting The presence of blue fluorescence will not detract and in some cases may be considered a bonus since it may make the stone appear whiter than it really is in daylight or fluorescent lighting However if there is very strong fluorescence there may be an oily or milky appearance to the diamond We recommend avoiding medium or strong fluorescence since it is just not worth taking the chance of lower value BOW TIE One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie or butterfly effect a darkened area across the center or widest part of the stone depending upon the cut The bow tie is commonly seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any fancy shape Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will exhibit some minimal bow tie effect Nonetheless the presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper proportioning In poorly proportioned stones there is a pronounced bow tie the more pronounced the poorer the proportioning The less pronounced the bow tie the better the proportioning The degree to which the bow tie is evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make cut DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS One of the best ways to be a better shopper for diamonds and fine

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Wouldbe thieves crashed a bulldozer into Londons Millennium Dome on Nov hoping to snatch million worth of diamondsincluding the spectacular ct De Beers Millennium Star The robbers planned to make their getaway in a speedboat waiting on the Thames River It would have been the worlds largest robbery but the diamonds were already gone from their tented exhibition arena and Scotland Yard was waiting Officers disguised as cleaners overpowered the robbers and a dozen men were arrested without a shot fired Tipped off by police dome officials had replaced the gems with crystal fakes De Beers officials say the pearshaped Millennium Star is arguably the most perfect large diamond in the world Four men were arrested after trapping themselves in the vault that usually houses the diamonds Police picked up another near a speedboat on the river and a sixth man on the opposite shore Six others were apprehended later in southeastern England Representatives of the New Millennium Experience Co which operates the dome said the diamonds are displayed in an exhibition area of the facility called the money zone and are closely guarded The Millennium Star is displayed in a reinforced glass cylinder and the area has alarms and security cameras The collection also features large diamonds of a distinctive vivid blue color Police said the robbers apparently disguised as workmen crashed through a perimeter fence and drove the bulldozer past security guards at around am shortly after the attraction opened for the day As they entered the building they donned gas masks before unleashing smoke bombs Fortunately none of the estimated visitors in the tent were nearby Disguised police were positioned around the inside of the dome After the robbers went into the vaults and became trapped they were ordered to come out at gunpoint by the officers The intruders were captured as they bashed at the display cases with hammers and sledgehammers PLATINUM PRICES HAVE SOARED DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD For the past ten years platinum prices have fluctuated between per troy ounce on the commodity markets In the second half of the prices start a climb that saw prices move from to almost per ounce at the start of this year This increase is mostly due to the big increase in demand in platinum jewelry while supplies have not been able to keep up Check out the price chart at prairielinksPLM that plots this trend Note how there are some weeks where the price has swings The impact on you the consumer is two fold the prices you pay today are almost twice what they were a year ago and the supply of parts for mountings and jewelry can sometimes take weeks to restock The other impact is that if you bought jewelry with significant platinum content it is now worth more and would cost more to replace If your appraisal is more than one year old you might want to consider having it reappraised for insurance purposes CLARITY GRADING DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDD Undoubtedly size is an important factor in determining the clarity grade The more difficult it is to see an inclusion particularly faceup the less it will influence the clarity grade Almost as a part of size the number of inclusions must be considered Clarity grading does not however consist of merely counting inclusions but rather judging how readily that number can be seen A stone could for example have a number of minute pinpoints and still be graded high on the scale Usually one or two of the largest inclusions will establish the grade Additional inclusions if small or minute will have little or no effect on the grade The position of an inclusion affects how readily it can be seen Cutters call the area seen through the table the heart of the stone and make every effort to orient rough stones so that inclusions are not visible through the table of the finished stone The preferred position for inclusions is under the bezel facets or near the girdle because they are less noticeable there Sometimes inclusions are located where they cause multiple reflections in the pavilion facets when you look at the stone in the faceup position Such reflectors lower the clarity grade more than similar nonreflecting inclusions The type of inclusion can sometimes influence the clarity grade Most inclusions do not threaten a diamonds durability Remember long before a stone ever reaches the consumer it has already been subjected to considerable heat and stress in both the cutting and manufacturing processes It is unlikely to get rougher treatment simply by being worn But large cleavages or feathers particularly when they reach the table or extend from the crown through the girdle are potentially hazardous since they could be extended by a severe blow Most inclusions are white or colorless but sometimes they are black brown dark red or green These or course are easier to see and lower the clarity grade more than a colorless inclusion However curiously enough a dark inclusion dead center under the table is often surprisingly inconspicuous Most inclusions have little impact on the beauty of the diamond since they are not visible with the naked eye The high price associated with high clarity has more to do with rarity than beauty If most diamonds were flawless it is likely that included diamonds would command the greatest interest and price OCTAHEDRON DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DD The octahedron is the most common form of gem quality diamond crystals The octahedron is shaped like two pyramids one upside down and fastened at the bases Perfectly formed octahedrons called glassies are among the most striking of all mineral crystals Rough crystals with this shape are well suited to be cut into the popular round and princess shapes WHERE DIAMONDS FORM DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Diamonds form only under certain chemical temperature and pressure conditions Scientists estimate that the necessary conditions of temperature and pressure can exist in parts of the Earths mantle inside the crust between and miles beneath the Earths surface Almost all diamonds are carried to the surface by a specific type of peridotite rock called kimberlite The Australian diamonds were carried by a similar type of rock called lamproite For billions of years kimberlites have periodically carried diamonds to the Earths surface We call diamond deposits in kimberlite pipes primary deposits The kimberlite itself is not very tough so it breaks down with sunlight heat and cold wind and rain and other environmental forces The diamonds often get washed out of the pipe and into the beds of rivers where they gather in potholes and eddies These are called alluvial deposits If the river currents are strong enough they may carry their diamonds all the way to the sea There the stones either settle to the bottom or are washed back onto the beach These diamond rich areas are called marine deposits Diamonds found in alluvial and marine deposits and in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks are said to be from secondary deposits DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD One

variety of the mineral beryl One of the rarest members of the beryl familyonly the red variety sometimes called red emerald is rarerit is one of the most highly prized of all the gems Aside from being the birthstone for May it was historically believed to bestow on its wearer faithfulness and unchanging love and was thought to enable the wearer to forecast events The highestquality emerald has the color of fresh young green grassan almost pure spectral green possibly with a very faint tint of blue as in the finest emerald from Columbia which is considered by connoisseurs to be the worlds finest Other sources include Brazil Zambia Pakistan Afghanistan Russia and India Flawless emeralds are rare so their flaws have come to serve almost as fingerprints while flawless emeralds are immediately suspect Although a hard stone emerald will chip easily since it tends to be somewhat brittle so special care should be given in wearing and handling Techniques to enhance color and reduce the visibility of flaws are also frequently used A common practice is to fill surfacereaching cracks with oil sometimes tinted green a practice that goes back to early Greek times Todays emeralds are oiled using a vacuumheat technology This is a widely accepted trade practice since it is actually good for the stone in light of its fragile nature Oiling hides some of the whitish flaws which are actually cracks filling the cracks so they become less visible The oil becomes an integral part of the emerald unless it is subjected to some type of degreasing procedure The development and use of the ultrasonic cleaner has brought to light the extensive ness of this practice Never clean emeralds in an ultrasonic cleaner While oiling is considered an acceptable practice be sure the price reflects the actual quality of the stone If necessary most emeralds can be reoiled FAMOUS DIAMONDS Name Uncle Sam Weight carats rough and carats cut Color M very light brown ClarityVVS Shape Emerald Cut The Uncle Sam diamond which was discovered in the Crater of diamonds in Arkansas in is the largest yet found in the United States Peiken Jewelers of New York City owned the Uncle Sam for many years For a while it was on loan to the American Museum of Natural History In Sidney de Young a dealer from Boston bought the diamond and then sold it to an unnamed collector SEA DIAMONDS An enterprising Texan called Sammy Collins drew worldwide attention in when he announced that hed recovered carats of diamonds worth million from the seabed off the treacherous Diamond Coast of South West Africa Collins figured that since diamonds had been found in abundant amounts along the coast most likely carried there by the Vaal and Orange rivers from some far inland deposit they also ought to be found under the ocean Over a period of three years Collins used the equivalent of huge vacuum sweepers to suck some carats of diamonds from the seabed His adventures set off a minirush by others to try this new type of exploration but terrible working conditions and uncertain diamond deposits sent most into early obscurity Today with improved technology De Beers and others are once again probing the waters of the South Atlantic bringing closer the prospect of viable undersea diamond recovery LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL We will be attending the annual JCK Jewelry Show in Las

While we recommend at least SI clarity for most diamonds to ensure they are eye clean many consumers think that SI means nothing visible with the naked eye The following comments define the official GIA position SI stones contain noticeable inclusions which are easy SI or very easy SI for a trained grader to see under X Typical inclusions are included crystals clouds and feathers normally centrally located and noticed immediately A stone with an eye visible inclusion can still be graded SI You must consider the size nature position number and color or relief of the inclusion The size and shape of the stone are important too Characteristics in the SI grade usually are not visible to the unaided eye faceup Characteristics in some SI stones can be seen with the unaided eye We find that over half of the SI stones have visible inclusions to the naked eye Note the above comments say visible to the unaided eye faceup With most shapes of diamonds inclusions are often easily visible from the side where there are few if any facets to hide them We just sent a VS clarity princess back to the wholesaler because the inclusion while not visible faceup was easily visible with the naked eye from the side You can imagine what the SI diamonds look like from the side if they are visible faceup If the mounting hides the side of the diamond these side visible inclusions are not a problem But most mountings show off the side of a diamond and make them easy to see INSURANCE QUESTIONS Most people do not realize that insurers differ widely in what they offer regarding coverage and reimbursement or replacement Many insurance companies will not reimburse the full value provided in the policy but rather exercise a replacement optionand will offer a sum in cash less than the amount for which the jewelry is insured or offer to replace it for you Therefore it is important to ask some very specific questions to determine the precise coverage offered We recommend asking the insurer at least the following How do you satisfy claims Do you reimburse the insured amount in cash If not how is the amount of the cash settlement determined Or do you replace the jewelry What involvements do I have in the replacement of an item What assurance do I have that the replacement will be of comparable quality and value What is your coverage on articles that cannot be replaced Exactly what risks does my policy coverall risks Mysterious disappearance Am I covered in all geographic areas At all times Are their any exemptions or exclusions What if the loss involves negligence What happens if the diamond falls out What are the deductibles if any What documentation do you expect me to provide Every week we hear yet another story of a customer who paid insurance premiums for years and were shocked to discover how little protection they really had when they did have a claim Check the small print before you need it FOUR CS Diamond quality and value are determined by four factors These factors are called the Four Cs If we were to rank them based on their importance in determining the value of a diamond we would list them as follows Color Clarity Cut and proportion Carat weight In terms of determining beauty however we would rank them in a different order Cut and proportion Color Clarity Carat weight When diamond shopping it pays to put your focus on cut and proportion since this is where you get the most impact on beauty while paying little premium in price We recommend investing your dollars in beauty you see rather than rarity and higher quality not visible to your eye BOW TIE One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie or butterfly effect a darkened area across the center or widest part of the stone depending upon the cut The bow tie is commonly seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any fancy shape Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will exhibit some minimal bow tie effect Nonetheless the

affection aid to sweetness of disposition and birthstone of November is one of natures most wonderful and leastknown gemstone families The true topaz is rarely seen in jewelry stores Unfortunately most people know only the quartz citrine topaz In the past almost any yellow stone was called topaz Topaz occurs not only in the transparent yellow yellow brown orangy brown and pinky brown colors most popularly associated with it but also in light to medium red light to medium blue very light green violet and colorless Blue topaz has become very popular in recent years although most of it is treated and there is no way to determine which is treated and which is natural Some of the deeper blue treated topazes have been found to be radioactive and possibly a health hazard In the United States all blue topaz must be tested for radiation levels However be very careful when buying blue topaz outside the United States since it probably has not been tested GIRDLE The girdle is the diamonds setting edge It needs to be just thick enough to let the stone be set securely If it is too thin it is vulnerable to chipping too thick and it can be unattractive and difficult to set A thick girdle often creates large fuzzy gray reflections in the stone especially if as is often the case it accumulates dirt and grime On a step cut like an emerald the girdle should be uniform in thickness around the stone On a round oval or cushionshape brilliant it should undulate slightly between pairs of mains and girdle facets and be thicker between the points of opposing mains The girdle of a marquise pear or heart is often slightly thicker at the points to reduce the possibility of chipping Hearts have thicker girdles in their clefts Although slight variations in girdle thickness are usually disregarded sizable variations can pose setting problems DIAMONDS AND GREASE If you wear a diamond you probably have been surprised how quickly a dirty film collects on the surface This is due in large part to the fact that diamonds adhere to grease Put your hands in dishwater and the grease quickly coats your diamond The same thing happens with hand cream body oils and any other form of grease The fact that diamonds adhere to grease led to the invention of the grease table in the late s to separate diamonds for the ore they are mined in The concentrate recovered from the washing pans pulsators or heavy media separators is washed over tables coated with thick grease The diamonds will adhere to the table and then the resulting mixture is periodically scraped off and melted down to remove the diamonds Today the grease belt is more common Grease is automatically applied at one end of a conveyor belt the concentrates are washed across it and the resulting diamondstudded grease is scraped off at the other end The amount of blueground diamond orewhich has to be processed is enormous Although figures differ for each mine it takes about tons of blueground to produce a single onecarat polished stone NATURAL A natural may not be a fault Its actually a piece of the natural surface of the diamond crystal In cutting a cutter may decide to leave part of the natural rough surface in order to get as large a diamond as possible from the rough stone If this natural is no thicker than the thickness of the girdle and does not distort the circumference of the stone most dealers consider it a minor defect at worst if it extends into the crown or pavilion of the stone it is a serious fault Sometimes if the natural is somewhat large but slightly below the girdle it will be polished off This produces an extra facet FAMOUS DIAMONDS Name The Lesotho Weight carats rough Color Brown Lesotho is an isolated landlocked mountain kingdom poor in natural resources and entirely surrounded by South Africa Lesotho was considered too remote to allow profitable diamond mining In when the government opened squarefoot claims there was no shortage of local prospectors seeking a big

Harry Winston who had the diamond flown to New York and invited the Ramaboas as his guests On March on live TV the stone was cleaved at the precise point where nature left a crack in the surface It was eventually cut into polished stones totaling carats the largest a carat emerald cut THE GREAT DIAMOND HUNT Diamonds have been found in India for at least years For centuries in fact India was the worlds only major source although there is no record of systematic mining before about AD The Indian mines are no longer significant producers Through the ages however new sources are constantly discovered as older ones are depleted In the s gold miners in Brazil began finding shiny pebbles which they tended to keep because they were beautiful Most had no idea of what they were worth and betterinformed prospectors bought them for pocket change Over a hundred years later diamonds were discovered in South Africa where the first alluvial water carriedfinds let prospectors to the kimberlite pipes which had originally brought these treasures to the surface This in tern led to greater understanding of the geology of diamonds and transformed prospecting from a haphazard venture into a scientific enterprise Today diamonds have been found on every continent although not everywhere in commercially viable quantities and qualities It is becoming clear that diamonds are much more widely distributed over the entire globe than people once thought Prospecting technology is also increasingly sophisticatedthe independent prospector with his shovel and pan is being replaced by electromagnetic mapping techniques and helicoptermounted infrared cameras As a result three out of five of todays major sources have been discovered in the last quartercentury There is no likelihood of running out of gem quality diamonds in the foreseeable future ROUNDNESS A round diamond is not perfectly round and its roundness will affect value The measurements of a round diamond include the highest diameter the lowest diameter and the depth Recognizing the rarity of truly round diamonds some deviation is permitted and the stone will not be considered outof round unless it deviates by more than the established norm approximately millimeter onetenth of a millimeter in a onecarat stone In other words the difference between the two diameters should be less than millimeters for a one carat diamond millimeters for a two carat and millimeters for a three carat AGS INTRODUCES LASER INSCRIPTIONS The American Gem Society lab is now offering a laser inscription servicesimilar to that

turquoise the Turkish stoneis highly prized throughout Asia and Africa not for its particular hoe of blue a beautiful robins egg or sky blue but more important for its supposed prophylactic and therapeutic qualities The Arabs consider it a lucky stone and have great confidence in its benevolent action Used in rings earrings necklaces head ornaments and amulets it protects the wearer from poison reptile bites eye diseases and the evil eye It was also believed capable of warning of impending death by changing color Buddhists revere the turquoise because it is associated with a legend in which a turquoise enabled Buddha to destroy a monster Even today it is considered a symbol of courage success and love It has also long been associated American Indian jewelry and art Turquoise is an opaque light to dark blue or blue green stone The finest color is an intense blue with poorer qualities tending toward yellowish green The famous Persian turquoise which can be very intense and pleasing blue is considered a very rare and valuable gem The United States Arizona and New Mexico is also an important source of fine turquoise and is now the major source of turquoise used in jewelry worldwide All turquoises are susceptible to aging and may turn greenish or possibly darker with age Also care must be taken when wearing both to avoid contact with soap grease or other materials that might discolor it and to protect it from abuse since turquoise scratches fairly easily But exercise caution when buying turquoise This is a frequently simulated gem Very fine glass imitations are produced that are difficult to distinguish from the genuine Very fine adulterated stones and reconstructed stones from turquoise powder bonded in plastic saturate the marketplace as does synthetic

right next to the Hope diamond until January th of next yearthanks to Ronald Winston son of the th centurys most famous jewel merchant Harry Winston Today the Dresden is to green diamonds what the Hope is to blues the most famous gem of its kind Estimated to have lost at least percent of its original caratplus weight during cutting this green giant takes the prize for size as well as beauty Keep in mind that beauty in green diamonds is nothing like beauty in emerald jade or green grossular garnet Natural green diamonds are extremely uncommon occurrences the result of irradiation deep within the earth And when they are found most are pale in color and light in tone running a hue spectrum from apple to algae green Dont expect these diamonds to sport stop light or shampoogreen colors Nevertheless the Dresden is a marvelfrom a standpoint of both shading and size True there are green diamonds without the vibrancy muting gray of the Dresden but their far smaller size makes them seem tiny in comparison The Dresden is such a behemoth at least as far as green diamonds go that it sets a standard that will likely never be challenged let alone beat Photo dresdenhtm DO YOU WANT A COLORED GEMSTONE If you have ever wanted a gorgeous colored gemstone but never knew how to find one this is your chance to have one hand picked for you In Tucson Arizona during the first weekend of February the countrys largest colored gem trade show brings gem wholesalers from all over the world We will be attending the show to hand select the nicest gems possible for our customers There are hundreds of booths of gems including ruby emerald sapphire garnet amethyst tourmaline jade peridot spinel and tanzanite If you would like us to add your name to our shopping list give us a call and tell us what you are looking for Every year we make many customers dreams come true as we find terrific values on the highest quality gemstones in the world MENS WEDDING BANDS While there are hundreds if not thousands of womens wedding ring style there are relatively few common style of mens rings The vast majority of men prefer some type of comfort fit wedding band The term comfort fit comes from the rounded inside of the ring that helps eliminate the sharp edges Comfort bands come in a variety of finishes including polished two tone hand craved and milgrain edges For men the choice seems to focus more on the width of the band which can range from millimeters wide alll the way up to millimeters Sometimes couples decide to get matching bands andor rings but generally each will pick what they think looks best and is most comfortable to them While the current trend is for the use of platinum in womens wedding rings men are often surprised how heavy and expensive a wide mans band is if it is done in platinum Yellow andor white gold is still the preferred metal for men Because men tend to wear their rings all the time the rings tend to take much more abuse than a womens ring A women will take her ring off to wash her hands do the dishes or fix dinner Men leave their rings on to mow the yard fix the car or participate in sports This is probably why you dont see many diamonds in mens wedding bands plus the fact that men learn early that most families can only afford one jewelry lover Note Many of our newsletter subscribers did not receive the October issue so we are including those articles below DIAMOND DISTRICT DANGERS When we visit with customers we often hear that they are contemplating making a trip to the diamond district in New York to shop for a diamond Many people have heard of the major diamond trading center located on th Street in New York and the myth is that you can get a good deal there In reality the wholesale trading takes place high above the street in highsecurity offices hidden from the public The vendors on the street are more skilled at taking your money than anyone you will find in your community They are fast taking high pressure salesman who specialize in letting tourist think they are getting a deal They often sell uncertified diamonds and reply on the difficulty of customers returning to the Diamond District as part of their sales strategy We recommend you never buy from anyone in the Diamond District in New York unless you are there with a trusted retailer who takes you to the true dealers who are not at street level Dont become another statistic of one who got ripped off while trying to get a good deal in the Diamond District ONLY BUY THE CLARITY YOU NEED We see more and more customers being told they need VVS clarity or they will be able to see inclusions in the their diamond Why pay for something you can not see For all shapes except emerald we suggest VS or SI as your minimum clarity requirement since with an SI you can not see anything with your naked eye The truth is that you can not see the difference between SI and all the higher clarity grades except with a microscope Higher clarity than SI does not add to beauty of the diamond only the rarity and therefore the price By starting with an SI clarity you will get a bigger diamond and have a better selection for getting a great cut The highest clarity grades cost more but are not necessarily going to appreciate as much as the grades in most demand such as VS and SI as explained at investmenthtm on our web site The reality is that the first speck of dust that settles on the diamond has much more visual impact on the beauty of the diamond than anything in a diamond that is at least a certified SI clarity grade OFF SALE You have all seen the billboards and newspaper ads advertising half off sale at your local jeweler It is not uncommon for stores to mark up items so they can mark them halfprice during a sale Its no great deal if you are paying let alone over wholesale Dont fall for sales of any kind If a dealer can afford to mark it down then they marked it up too high at the start PRICE CALCULATOR Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape color grade clarity grade and carat weight to determine an estimate of our price for that type of diamond If you havent tried it yet check it out at costhtmcalc FAMOUS DIAMONDS Name The Star of Sierra Leone Weight carats rough Valentines Day A routine workday at the diamond mine in Sierra Leone Suddenly a company engineer and a plant security officer spot something big on the grease table grease sticks to diamonds and is used to separate diamonds from ore At first neither man could believe what they saw There trapped by the grease is a huge diamond the size of a hens egg When the stone is first offered for sale none of the sealed bids reaches the minimum price of more than million set by the government Finally months later Harry Winston makes a deal for the Star Winston wants a worldclass diamond from his rough A carat emerald cut is fashioned but upon close examination it reveals inclusions Winston changes his mind deciding that flawlessness is more important than size The big diamond is recut into seven smaller stones the largest of which weighs carats Besides these the rough yields other stones ranging from to carats All told Winston recovers only carats a staggering loss of almost percent But of the finished stones are reportedly flawless GEM OF THE DAY Keep smiling Even when life knocks you flat on your back you are still in a good position to look up BEWARE OF FRACTIONS The FTC Federal Trade Commission allows jewelers to round off diamond weights For example a diamond labeled carat in weight might actually weigh anywhere between and carat While these are small weights the price difference can be significant For instance if you bought earrings with G color SI clarity and carat in each ear for you might have over paid by if they really weight carats Note Jewelers are also allowed to be off one color and one clarity grade If you dont purchase a certified diamond you could find yourself at the short end on weight color clarity and therefore value INTERNET SALES Internet shoppers are expected to spend almost billion online during the holiday season nearly double last years total of billion according to a recent survey by the Gartner Interactive Firm About half that revenue is expected to go to US and Canadian etailers with the rest distributed among firms in Europe and Asia Robert Labatt principal analyst for Gartners eBusiness Services Unit credits the increased willingness to do business online to the etailers extensive efforts in increasing the customers comfort level Chat rooms and opportunities to interact with the internet firms are encouraging more people to try this form of commerce DIAMOND GRADING TIPS FLUORESCENCE Fluorescence if present in a diamond will be indicated on a diamond grading report It will be graded very faint faint medium strong or very strong Some reports indicate the color of fluorescence as blue yellow white and so on A stone with yellow fluorescence should sell less since it will appear yellower than it really is when worn in daylight or fluorescent lighting The presence of blue fluorescence will not detract and in some cases may be considered a bonus since it may make the stone appear whiter than it really is in daylight or fluorescent lighting However if there is very strong fluorescence there may be an oily or milky appearance to the diamond We recommend avoiding medium or strong fluorescence since it is just not worth taking the chance of lower value BOW TIE One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie or butterfly effect a darkened area across the center or widest part of the stone depending upon the cut The bow tie is commonly seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any fancy shape Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will exhibit some minimal bow tie effect Nonetheless the presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper proportioning In poorly proportioned stones there is a pronounced bow tie the more pronounced the poorer the proportioning The less pronounced the bow tie the better the proportioning The degree to which the bow tie is evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make cut DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS One of the best ways to be a better shopper for diamonds and fine

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Wouldbe thieves crashed a bulldozer into Londons Millennium Dome on Nov hoping to snatch million worth of diamondsincluding the spectacular ct De Beers Millennium Star The robbers planned to make their getaway in a speedboat waiting on the Thames River It would have been the worlds largest robbery but the diamonds were already gone from their tented exhibition arena and Scotland Yard was waiting Officers disguised as cleaners overpowered the robbers and a dozen men were arrested without a shot fired Tipped off by police dome officials had replaced the gems with crystal fakes De Beers officials say the pearshaped Millennium Star is arguably the most perfect large diamond in the world Four men were arrested after trapping themselves in the vault that usually houses the diamonds Police picked up another near a speedboat on the river and a sixth man on the opposite shore Six others were apprehended later in southeastern England Representatives of the New Millennium Experience Co which operates the dome said the diamonds are displayed in an exhibition area of the facility called the money zone and are closely guarded The Millennium Star is displayed in a reinforced glass cylinder and the area has alarms and security cameras The collection also features large diamonds of a distinctive vivid blue color Police said the robbers apparently disguised as workmen crashed through a perimeter fence and drove the bulldozer past security guards at around am shortly after the attraction opened for the day As they entered the building they donned gas masks before unleashing smoke bombs Fortunately none of the estimated visitors in the tent were nearby Disguised police were positioned around the inside of the dome After the robbers went into the vaults and became trapped they were ordered to come out at gunpoint by the officers The intruders were captured as they bashed at the display cases with hammers and sledgehammers PLATINUM PRICES HAVE SOARED DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD For the past ten years platinum prices have fluctuated between per troy ounce on the commodity markets In the second half of the prices start a climb that saw prices move from to almost per ounce at the start of this year This increase is mostly due to the big increase in demand in platinum jewelry while supplies have not been able to keep up Check out the price chart at prairielinksPLM that plots this trend Note how there are some weeks where the price has swings The impact on you the consumer is two fold the prices you pay today are almost twice what they were a year ago and the supply of parts for mountings and jewelry can sometimes take weeks to restock The other impact is that if you bought jewelry with significant platinum content it is now worth more and would cost more to replace If your appraisal is more than one year old you might want to consider having it reappraised for insurance purposes CLARITY GRADING DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDD Undoubtedly size is an important factor in determining the clarity grade The more difficult it is to see an inclusion particularly faceup the less it will influence the clarity grade Almost as a part of size the number of inclusions must be considered Clarity grading does not however consist of merely counting inclusions but rather judging how readily that number can be seen A stone could for example have a number of minute pinpoints and still be graded high on the scale Usually one or two of the largest inclusions will establish the grade Additional inclusions if small or minute will have little or no effect on the grade The position of an inclusion affects how readily it can be seen Cutters call the area seen through the table the heart of the stone and make every effort to orient rough stones so that inclusions are not visible through the table of the finished stone The preferred position for inclusions is under the bezel facets or near the girdle because they are less noticeable there Sometimes inclusions are located where they cause multiple reflections in the pavilion facets when you look at the stone in the faceup position Such reflectors lower the clarity grade more than similar nonreflecting inclusions The type of inclusion can sometimes influence the clarity grade Most inclusions do not threaten a diamonds durability Remember long before a stone ever reaches the consumer it has already been subjected to considerable heat and stress in both the cutting and manufacturing processes It is unlikely to get rougher treatment simply by being worn But large cleavages or feathers particularly when they reach the table or extend from the crown through the girdle are potentially hazardous since they could be extended by a severe blow Most inclusions are white or colorless but sometimes they are black brown dark red or green These or course are easier to see and lower the clarity grade more than a colorless inclusion However curiously enough a dark inclusion dead center under the table is often surprisingly inconspicuous Most inclusions have little impact on the beauty of the diamond since they are not visible with the naked eye The high price associated with high clarity has more to do with rarity than beauty If most diamonds were flawless it is likely that included diamonds would command the greatest interest and price OCTAHEDRON DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DD The octahedron is the most common form of gem quality diamond crystals The octahedron is shaped like two pyramids one upside down and fastened at the bases Perfectly formed octahedrons called glassies are among the most striking of all mineral crystals Rough crystals with this shape are well suited to be cut into the popular round and princess shapes WHERE DIAMONDS FORM DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD Diamonds form only under certain chemical temperature and pressure conditions Scientists estimate that the necessary conditions of temperature and pressure can exist in parts of the Earths mantle inside the crust between and miles beneath the Earths surface Almost all diamonds are carried to the surface by a specific type of peridotite rock called kimberlite The Australian diamonds were carried by a similar type of rock called lamproite For billions of years kimberlites have periodically carried diamonds to the Earths surface We call diamond deposits in kimberlite pipes primary deposits The kimberlite itself is not very tough so it breaks down with sunlight heat and cold wind and rain and other environmental forces The diamonds often get washed out of the pipe and into the beds of rivers where they gather in potholes and eddies These are called alluvial deposits If the river currents are strong enough they may carry their diamonds all the way to the sea There the stones either settle to the bottom or are washed back onto the beach These diamond rich areas are called marine deposits Diamonds found in alluvial and marine deposits and in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks are said to be from secondary deposits DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD One

variety of the mineral beryl One of the rarest members of the beryl familyonly the red variety sometimes called red emerald is rarerit is one of the most highly prized of all the gems Aside from being the birthstone for May it was historically believed to bestow on its wearer faithfulness and unchanging love and was thought to enable the wearer to forecast events The highestquality emerald has the color of fresh young green grassan almost pure spectral green possibly with a very faint tint of blue as in the finest emerald from Columbia which is considered by connoisseurs to be the worlds finest Other sources include Brazil Zambia Pakistan Afghanistan Russia and India Flawless emeralds are rare so their flaws have come to serve almost as fingerprints while flawless emeralds are immediately suspect Although a hard stone emerald will chip easily since it tends to be somewhat brittle so special care should be given in wearing and handling Techniques to enhance color and reduce the visibility of flaws are also frequently used A common practice is to fill surfacereaching cracks with oil sometimes tinted green a practice that goes back to early Greek times Todays emeralds are oiled using a vacuumheat technology This is a widely accepted trade practice since it is actually good for the stone in light of its fragile nature Oiling hides some of the whitish flaws which are actually cracks filling the cracks so they become less visible The oil becomes an integral part of the emerald unless it is subjected to some type of degreasing procedure The development and use of the ultrasonic cleaner has brought to light the extensive ness of this practice Never clean emeralds in an ultrasonic cleaner While oiling is considered an acceptable practice be sure the price

years For a while it was on loan to the American Museum of Natural History In Sidney de Young a dealer from Boston bought the diamond and then sold it to an unnamed collector SEA DIAMONDS An enterprising Texan called Sammy Collins drew worldwide attention in when he announced that hed recovered carats of diamonds worth million from the seabed off the treacherous Diamond Coast of South West Africa Collins figured that since diamonds had been found in abundant amounts along the coast most likely carried there by the Vaal and Orange rivers from some far inland deposit they also ought to be found under the ocean Over a period of three years Collins used the equivalent of huge vacuum sweepers to suck some carats of diamonds from the seabed His adventures set off a minirush by others to try this new type of exploration but terrible working conditions and uncertain diamond deposits sent most into early obscurity Today with improved technology De Beers and others are once again

While we recommend at least SI clarity for most diamonds to ensure they are eye clean many consumers think that SI means nothing visible with the naked eye The following comments define the official GIA position SI stones contain noticeable inclusions which are easy SI or very easy SI for a trained grader to see under X Typical inclusions are included crystals clouds and feathers normally centrally located and noticed immediately A stone with an eye visible inclusion can still be graded SI You must consider the size nature position number and color or relief of the inclusion The size and shape of the stone are important too Characteristics in the SI grade usually are not visible to the unaided eye faceup Characteristics in some SI stones can be seen with the unaided eye We find that over half of the SI stones have visible inclusions to the naked eye Note the above comments say visible to the unaided eye faceup With most shapes of diamonds inclusions are often easily visible from the side where there are few if any facets to hide them We just sent a VS clarity princess back to the wholesaler because the inclusion while not visible faceup was easily visible with the naked eye from the side You can imagine what the SI diamonds look like from the side if they are visible faceup If the mounting hides the side of the diamond these side visible inclusions are not a problem But most mountings show off the side of a diamond and make them easy to see INSURANCE QUESTIONS Most people do not realize that insurers differ widely in what they offer regarding coverage and reimbursement or replacement Many insurance companies will not reimburse the full value provided in the policy but rather exercise a replacement optionand will offer a sum in cash less than the amount for which the jewelry is insured or offer to replace it for you Therefore it is important to ask some very specific questions to determine the precise coverage offered We recommend asking the insurer at least the following How do you satisfy claims Do you reimburse the insured amount in cash If not how is the amount of the cash settlement determined Or do you replace the jewelry What involvements do I have in the replacement of an item What assurance do I have that the replacement will be of comparable quality and value What is your coverage on articles that cannot be replaced Exactly what risks does my policy coverall risks Mysterious disappearance Am I covered in all geographic areas At all times Are their any exemptions or exclusions What if the loss involves negligence What happens if the diamond falls out What are the deductibles if any What documentation do you expect me to provide Every week we hear yet another story of a customer who paid insurance premiums for years and were shocked to discover how little protection they really had when they did have a claim Check the small print before you need it FOUR CS Diamond quality and value are determined by four factors These factors are called the Four Cs If we were to rank them based on their importance in determining the value of a diamond we would list them as follows Color Clarity Cut and proportion Carat weight In terms of determining beauty however we would rank them in a different order Cut and proportion Color Clarity Carat weight When diamond shopping it pays to put your focus on cut and proportion since this is where you get the most impact on beauty while paying little premium in price We recommend investing your dollars in beauty you see rather than rarity and higher quality not visible to your eye BOW TIE One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie or butterfly effect a darkened area across the center or widest part of the stone depending upon the cut The bow tie is commonly seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any fancy shape Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will exhibit some minimal bow tie effect Nonetheless the

affection aid to sweetness of disposition and birthstone of November is one of natures most wonderful and leastknown gemstone families The true topaz is rarely seen in jewelry stores Unfortunately most people know only the quartz citrine topaz In the past almost any yellow stone was called topaz Topaz occurs not only in the transparent yellow yellow brown orangy brown and pinky brown colors most popularly associated with it but also in light to medium red light to medium blue very light green violet and colorless Blue topaz has become very popular in recent years although most of it is treated and there is no way to determine which is treated and which is natural Some of the deeper blue treated topazes have been found to be radioactive and possibly a health hazard In the United States all blue topaz must be tested for radiation levels However be very careful when buying blue topaz outside the United States since it probably has not been tested GIRDLE The girdle is the diamonds setting edge It needs to be just thick enough to let the stone be set securely If it is too thin it is vulnerable to chipping too thick and it can be unattractive and difficult to set A thick girdle often creates large fuzzy gray reflections in the stone especially if as is often the case it accumulates dirt and grime On a step cut like an emerald the girdle should be uniform in thickness around the stone On a round oval or cushionshape brilliant it should undulate slightly between pairs of mains and girdle facets and be thicker between the points of opposing mains The girdle of a marquise pear or heart is often slightly thicker at the points to reduce the possibility of chipping Hearts have thicker girdles in their clefts Although slight variations in girdle thickness are usually disregarded sizable variations can pose setting problems DIAMONDS AND GREASE If you wear a diamond you probably have been surprised how quickly a dirty film collects on the surface This is due in large part to the fact that diamonds adhere to grease Put your hands in dishwater and the grease quickly coats your diamond The same thing happens with hand cream body oils and any other form of grease The fact that diamonds adhere to grease led to the invention of the grease table in the late s to separate diamonds for the ore they are mined in The concentrate recovered from the washing pans pulsators or heavy media separators is washed over tables coated with thick grease The diamonds will adhere to the table and then the resulting mixture is periodically scraped off and melted down to remove the diamonds Today the grease belt is more common Grease is automatically applied at one end of a conveyor belt the concentrates are washed across it and the resulting diamondstudded grease is scraped off at the other end The amount of blueground diamond orewhich has to be processed is enormous Although figures differ for each mine it takes about tons of blueground to produce a single onecarat polished stone NATURAL A natural may not be a fault Its actually a piece of the natural surface of the diamond crystal In cutting a cutter may decide to leave part of the natural rough surface in order to get as large a diamond as possible from the rough stone If this natural is no thicker than the thickness of the girdle and does not distort the circumference of the stone most dealers consider it a minor defect at worst if it extends into the crown or pavilion of the stone it is a serious fault Sometimes if the natural is somewhat large but slightly below the girdle it will be polished off This produces an extra facet FAMOUS DIAMONDS Name The Lesotho Weight carats rough Color Brown Lesotho is an isolated landlocked mountain kingdom poor in natural resources and entirely surrounded by South Africa Lesotho was considered too remote to allow profitable diamond mining In when the government opened squarefoot claims there was no shortage of local prospectors seeking a big strike On May Ernestine Ramaboa working the claim she shared with her husband Petrus discovered a brown diamond of extraordinary size The diamond weighing carats caused a sensation Eventually sold to Harry Winston who had the diamond flown to New York and invited the Ramaboas as his guests On March on live TV the stone was cleaved at the precise point where nature left a crack in the surface It was eventually cut into polished stones totaling carats the largest a carat emerald cut THE GREAT DIAMOND HUNT Diamonds have been found in India for at least years For centuries in fact India was the worlds only major source although there is no record of systematic mining before about AD The Indian mines are no longer significant producers Through the ages however new sources are constantly discovered as older ones are depleted In the s gold miners in Brazil began finding shiny pebbles which they tended to keep because they were beautiful Most had no idea of what they were worth and betterinformed prospectors bought them for pocket change Over a hundred years later diamonds were discovered in South Africa where the first alluvial water carriedfinds let prospectors to the kimberlite pipes which had originally brought these treasures to the surface This in tern led to greater understanding of the geology of diamonds and transformed prospecting from a haphazard venture into a scientific enterprise Today diamonds have been found on every continent although not everywhere in commercially viable quantities and qualities It is becoming clear that diamonds are much more widely distributed over the entire globe than people once thought Prospecting technology is also increasingly sophisticatedthe independent prospector with his shovel and pan is being replaced by electromagnetic mapping techniques and helicoptermounted infrared cameras As a result three out of five of todays major sources have been discovered in the last quartercentury There is no likelihood of running out of gem quality diamonds in the foreseeable future ROUNDNESS A round diamond is not perfectly round and its roundness will affect value The measurements of a round diamond include the highest diameter the lowest diameter and the depth Recognizing the rarity of truly round diamonds some deviation is permitted and the stone will not be considered outof round unless it deviates by more than the established norm approximately millimeter onetenth of a millimeter in a onecarat stone In other words the difference between the two diameters should be less than millimeters for a one carat diamond millimeters for a two carat and millimeters for a three carat AGS INTRODUCES LASER INSCRIPTIONS The American Gem Society lab is now offering a laser inscription servicesimilar to that

religious emotion and prayer It was believed to have a strong therapeutic value for diseases of the eye and worn as an amulet it would make the wearer immune from them as well as increase the powers of the eyes and the mind When we describe the opal we realize how insufficient the English language is It is unique among the gems displaying an array of very brilliant miniature rainbow effects all mixed together Its most outstanding characteristic is this unusual intense display of many colors flashing out like minirainbows This effect is created by opals formation process which is very different from that of other gems Opal is composed of hydrated silica spheres The mini rainbows seen in most opals result from light interference created by these spheres The arrangement of the spheres which vary in size and pattern is responsible for the different colors Opal is usually cut flat or in cabochon since there is no additional brilliance to be captured by faceting In opals color is everything The more brilliant the color the more valuable the gem It is probably truer of opal than any other stone that the more beautiful the stone and its color the more it will cost One word of caution must be offered Opals require special care because some tend to dry and crack Avoid exposure to anything that is potentially drying And believe it or not rubbing it periodically with an oilmoistened clothsuch as olive oilwill help preserve it Do not soak it soaking some opals for only a few hours can cause them to lose some or nearly all of their fire DIAMOND HORSESHOE PENDANT Check

platinum declined by last year due to weakness in the Japanese market In the US demand for platinum jumped because of the fashion trend towards white metal jewelry The report notes there was particularly strong growth in platinum wedding bands Manufacturers also introduced lightweight platinum rings to meet massmarket price points The outlook for platinum in the US in is mixed the report

examined faceup under normal lighting conditions with the unaided eyes The significance of the bowtie is usually noted as slight noticeable or obvious For these oblong fancy shaped diamonds we find a

to follow COLOR BRILLIANCE AND FIRE What at first glance looks like the color of a diamond is really a combination of bodycolor brilliance and dispersion Each is affected by both the basic nature of the diamond crystal and the cutting proportions selected by the cutter When gem professionals speak of color they usually mean bodycolor the basic color of an object It results from selective absorption which causes most of what we normally think of color This is how it works All white light is a balanced blend of different colors of light When white light is reflected by or passes through an object the object may absorb or subtract some of the colors we see the remaining blend as the objects bodycolor Bodycolor in a diamond can best be seen looking at the diamond sideways against a white piece of paper Brilliance is the total amount of light returned to the eye by reflections from within the stone and from the surface When light strikes the surface of a gem part of it is reflected immediately and part of it enters the stone The part reflected from the surface is the external component of brilliance Cutter try to fashion gems so the back facets create an internal mirror effect reflecting light that comes in from above to bounce back out through the top of the stone This is the internal component of brilliance that is largely responsible for the brightness and life of the stone Dispersion or fire is a spreading and separating of white light into its component spectral hues Prisms produce the most familiar examples of dispersion Diamonds are more dispersive than most gems While a D color diamond will have no bodycolor it can show a great deal of color due to brilliance and dispersion Because of the mirror effect a diamond will reflect the colors of its mountings as well as the walls lights and anything else around Likewise the bright flashes of color in a diamond are likely the rainbow colors resulting from the dispersion CODE OF LOVE For those who want to keep their private life private to declare their love covertly Glasgow Scotland jeweler Eric N Smith has the answer a range of bespoke luxury jewelry embedded with round and rectangular diamonds which like dots and dashes spell out messages in Morse code the Financial Times FT reports Morse code invented by American Samuel Morse in and for years the international language for distress at sea has been replaced by satellite technology But an estimated million people worldwide are still familiar with it and Smith thinks theres a lot of mileage in his brainchild A keen amateur yachtsman qualified in Morse Smith had the idea while doing sketches for a new collection last year It struck him that the sequence of round and rectangular stones bore a striking similarity to Morse codes dots and dashes Experimenting on a ring with the Morse equivalent of the word Always he found it possible to fit the required number of diamonds on the gold band and the covert collection was born Smith generally embeds diamonds in yellow and white gold to create unique rings bangles pendants earrings and cufflinks Because each piece is made to order any precious stone and metal combination is possible A copy of the Morse translation is also provided with each piece so the recipient gets the message There are people for whom even Morse is not obscure enough One client from Los Angeles has a wife who loves unraveling ciphers secret messages and that sort of thing says Smith He was on the internet looking for a gift saw our website and ordered a ring with a message part of the surprise being that she has to work out what the symbols are in the first place and then what they mean Prices start at US If you want to cut the expense its best to pick phrases heavy on the

grade or another Because every diamond is unique and there is an endless variety of clarity pictures just like every snowflake is different each stone must be judged on its own merits The more

most inclusions so the cleaner the stone the easier it is to see the inclusions Examine the stone face up with a x magnification and preferably with a microscope with darkfield illumination Note your first impression of the severity of its inclusions The first call is usually the most accurate Examine the stone from the side around the girdle and through the crown and pavilion Note all characteristics including size number position nature color and relief Review the stone faceup and assign a general clarity classification If you have to look for quite a while with x magnification to find any inclusions consider VVS If it takes a few seconds to find the inclusions it is probably VS If you notice them immediately SI seems likely If they are obviously eyevisible the stone probably merits an I grade Make the distinction between VVSVVS VSVS SISI or III as needed Call the grade If you study too much your intial gut feel which is usually right tends to get clouded by analysis PRICE

laboratory in the s and Swarovski Co began producing it for mass consumption in the s As it became more widely available CZ quickly became popular with jewelry designers New developments have led to a sparkling array of CZ in every color imaginable Though cubic zirconia looks like diamond there are some noticeable differences CZ has slightly less brilliance than diamond and a hardness of on the Mohs scale diamond is CZ is heavier and because its grown in a controlled environment a crystal isnt used if its not perfect Moissanite was discovered in when Nobelprizewinning scientist Henri Moissan uncovered minute quantities of a new mineral from a meteorite that crashed thousands of years before In the late s Cree Research Durham NC developed a way to produce moissanite crystals in a lab In a

refractive index of diamond is dispersion of diamond is and specific gravity of diamond is IDEAL CUT An Ideal Cut round brilliant diamond is one which is cut to a specific range of proportions Ideal proportions and also has an Ideal grade for both polish and symmetry This has been defined by the American Gem Society Labs as the top or zero grade in their grading system Diamonds attaining this grade are sometimes referred to as AGS AGS triple zeros The proper grade however is simply AGS AGS zero This cut grade has also come to be called the American Ideal Cut based on its acceptance in this country A true AGS triple zero or triple ideal is a diamond where the proportion cut polish and symmetry are all at the top zero grade Unfortunately the Gemological Institute of America GIA does not provide a cut grade in its grading report They provide only the table and total depth for the stone Therefore it is not possible to determine the individual contributions of the crown girdle and pavilion to the total depth and no crown or pavilion angles are given In order to determine if a GIAgraded diamond meets the AGS Ideal grade for proportion it is necessary to measure the stone for all the missing data Fortunately this can be done quite quickly and easily using an automated proportion analyzer called a SARIN after the Co which produces it whose s oftware can be programmed to AGS specifications Thus since GIA grades of Excellent for polish and symmetry are considered equivalent to the AGS Ideal grades a GIAgraded diamond can with a Sarin analysis give as much information as an AGS grading report This information is important in making an informed buying decision FANCY COLORED DIAMONDS The GIA grades the saturation of color by different verbal categories They are Faint Very Light Light Fancy Light Fancy Fancy Dark Fancy Intense Fancy Deep and Fancy Vivid Normally Faint Very Light and Light in sizes under three carats are not considered exceptional enough to pay premiums for To collect or mount in jewelry these stones will often trade in the same ranges as nice white diamonds Often mounting a stone in these saturation categories will kill the color Light pink and blue in a larger stone may be desirable if and only if the stone doesnt turn white when mounted Diamond dealers often refer to these color categories as those you have to read the certificate to find the color Generally avoid these stones unless you are looking at eye clean carat light pinks or blues They will be expensive stones The rarest and most valuable colored diamonds are vibrant reds In fact one of the highest percarat prices ever paid for a diamond was for a purplish red stone weighing just over carats Sold at auction in this fiery beauty brought an astounding per carat More recently a carat red diamond is rumored to have sold privately for million However not all fancy colored diamonds sell for such colorful prices please excuse the pun PLATINUM AS A JEWELRY METAL Throughout the world platinum jewelry is made in a purity of at least per cent platinum and in Europe and the USA per cent is the norm Other platinum group metals palladium ruthenium and iridium and copper and cobalt are commonly alloyed with platinum to optimize its working characteristics and wear properties One of the main advantages of platinum for jewelry fabrication is its strength and resistance to tarnish It can be repeatedly heated and cooled without hardening and oxidation effects while even the most slender sections of platinum permanently retain their shape providing a secure setting for diamonds and giving jewelry designers a freedom of invention not always possible with other materials Perhaps the best example of platinums technical virtuosity is the tension ring in which a gemstone is held in place by the tensile strength of the platinum ring shank alone Platinum does make certain demands on the jewelers skills It requires high temperature melting and casting equipment pure platinum melts at C and a scrupulously clean working environment Careful attention to polishing technique is needed to achieve the highly reflective finish which shows a diamond or other precious stone at its best ONLINE SPENDING TRENDS Though Internet users are spending more time at retail sites online spending is down Forrester Research reported online spending fell to billion in June from

typically opaque very heavily included often with surface reaching inclusions and fractures that mar desirability They are also very difficult to cut so you often find them in poor makes Buyers need to be aware that most of the black diamonds currently being used in jewelry is treated and not natural There is nothing wrong with using treated black diamonds as long as you are told they are treated and you pay the appropriate price as opposed to the more expensive natural black diamonds Since the natural black diamonds are so hard to cut melee sizes used in pave work is almost always treated Here are some simple test for determining natural versus treated Under strong light treated diamonds have edges that appear deep brown rather than black When the surface is examined with a x loupe treated diamonds seem spotty or the color is uneven When tested with a electronic diamond tester treated black diamonds generally are indicated as not diamond While the treated black diamond is in fact a diamond the electronic diamond tester indicates it is not because during the treatment the material becomes very electrically conductive PRICE CALCULATOR Probably the most popular feature of

turquoise the Turkish stoneis highly prized throughout Asia and Africa not for its particular hoe of blue a beautiful robins egg or sky blue but more important for its supposed prophylactic and therapeutic qualities The Arabs consider it a lucky stone and have great confidence in its benevolent action Used in rings earrings necklaces head ornaments and amulets it protects the wearer from poison reptile bites eye diseases and the evil eye It was also believed capable of warning of impending death by changing color Buddhists revere the turquoise because it is associated with a legend in which a turquoise enabled Buddha to destroy a monster Even today it is considered a symbol of courage success and love It has also long been associated American Indian jewelry and art Turquoise is an opaque light to dark blue or blue green stone The finest color is an intense blue with poorer qualities tending toward yellowish green The famous Persian turquoise which can be very intense and pleasing blue is considered a very rare and valuable gem The United States Arizona and New Mexico is also an important source of fine turquoise and is now the major source of turquoise used in jewelry worldwide All turquoises are susceptible to aging and may turn greenish or possibly darker with age Also care must be taken when wearing both to avoid contact with soap grease or other materials that might discolor it and to protect it from abuse since turquoise scratches fairly easily But exercise caution when buying turquoise This is a frequently simulated gem Very fine glass imitations are produced that are difficult to distinguish from the genuine Very fine adulterated stones and reconstructed stones from turquoise powder bonded in plastic saturate the marketplace as does synthetic turquoise Make sure you are buying genuine natural turquoise THE DRESDEN DIAMOND GREEN GLORY The legendary carat Dresden green diamond is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC right next to the Hope diamond until January th of next yearthanks to Ronald Winston son of the th centurys most famous jewel merchant Harry Winston Today the Dresden is to green diamonds what the Hope is to blues the most famous gem of its kind Estimated to have lost at least percent of its original caratplus weight during cutting this green giant takes the prize for size as well as beauty Keep in mind that beauty in green diamonds is nothing like beauty in emerald jade or green grossular garnet Natural green diamonds are extremely uncommon occurrences the result of irradiation deep within the earth And when they are found most are pale in color and light in tone running a hue spectrum from apple to algae green Dont expect these diamonds to sport stop light or shampoogreen colors Nevertheless the Dresden is a marvelfrom a standpoint of both shading and size True there are green diamonds without the vibrancy muting gray of the Dresden but their far smaller size makes them seem tiny in comparison The Dresden is such a behemoth at least as far as green diamonds go that it sets a standard that will likely never be challenged let alone beat Photo dresdenhtm DO YOU WANT A COLORED GEMSTONE If you have ever wanted a gorgeous colored gemstone but never knew how to find one this is your chance to have one hand picked for you In Tucson Arizona during the first weekend of February the countrys largest colored gem trade show brings gem wholesalers from all over the world We will be attending the show to hand select the nicest gems possible for our customers There are hundreds of booths of gems including ruby emerald sapphire garnet amethyst tourmaline jade peridot spinel and tanzanite If you would like us to add your name to our shopping list give us a call and tell us what you are looking for Every year we make many customers dreams come true as we find terrific values on the highest quality gemstones in the world MENS WEDDING BANDS While there are hundreds if not thousands of womens wedding ring style there are relatively few common style of mens rings The vast majority of men prefer some type of comfort fit wedding band The term comfort fit comes from the rounded inside of the ring that helps eliminate the sharp edges Comfort bands come in a variety of finishes including polished two tone hand craved and milgrain edges For men the choice seems to focus more on the width of the band which can range from millimeters wide alll the way up to millimeters Sometimes couples decide to get matching bands andor rings but generally each will pick what they think looks best and is most comfortable to them While the current trend is for the use of platinum in womens wedding rings men are often surprised how heavy and expensive a wide mans band is if it is done in platinum Yellow andor white gold is still the preferred metal for men Because men tend to wear their rings all the time the rings tend to take much more abuse than a womens ring A women will take her ring off to wash her hands do the dishes or fix dinner Men leave their rings on to mow the yard fix the car or participate in sports This is probably why you dont see many diamonds in mens wedding bands plus the fact that men learn early that most families can only afford one jewelry lover Note Many of our newsletter subscribers did not receive the October issue so we are including those articles below DIAMOND DISTRICT DANGERS When we visit with customers we often hear that they are contemplating making a trip to the diamond district in New York to shop for a diamond Many people have heard of the major diamond trading center located on th Street in New York and the myth is that you can get a good deal there In reality the wholesale trading takes place high above the street in highsecurity offices hidden from the public The vendors on the street are more skilled at taking your money than anyone you will find in your community They are fast taking high pressure salesman who specialize in letting tourist think they are getting a deal They often sell uncertified diamonds and reply on the difficulty of customers returning to the Diamond District as part of their sales strategy We recommend you never buy from anyone in the Diamond District in New York unless you are there with a trusted retailer who takes you to the true dealers who are not at street level Dont become another statistic of one who got ripped off while trying to get a good deal in the Diamond District ONLY BUY THE CLARITY YOU NEED We see more and more customers being told they need VVS clarity or they will be able to see inclusions in the their diamond Why pay for something you can not see For all shapes except emerald we suggest VS or SI as your minimum clarity requirement since with an SI you can not see anything with your naked eye The truth is that you can not see the difference between SI and all the higher clarity grades except with a microscope Higher clarity than SI does not add to beauty of the diamond only the rarity and therefore the price By starting with an SI clarity you will get a bigger diamond and have a better selection for getting a great cut The highest clarity grades cost more but are not necessarily going to appreciate as much as the grades in most demand such as VS and SI as explained at investmenthtm on our web site The reality is that the first speck of dust that settles on the diamond has much more visual impact on the beauty of the diamond than anything in a diamond that is at least a certified SI clarity grade OFF SALE You have all seen the billboards and newspaper ads advertising half off sale at your local jeweler It is not uncommon for stores to mark up items so they can mark them halfprice during a sale Its no great deal if you are paying let alone over wholesale Dont fall for sales of any kind If a dealer can afford to mark it down then they marked it up too high at the start PRICE CALCULATOR Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape color grade clarity grade and carat weight to determine an estimate of our price for that type of diamond If you havent tried it yet check it out at costhtmcalc FAMOUS DIAMONDS Name The Star of Sierra Leone Weight carats rough Valentines Day A routine workday at the diamond mine in Sierra Leone Suddenly a company engineer and a plant security officer spot something big on the grease table grease sticks to diamonds and is used to separate diamonds from ore At first neither man could believe what they saw There trapped by the grease is a huge diamond the size of a hens egg When the stone is first offered for sale none of the sealed bids reaches the minimum price of more than million set by the government Finally months later Harry Winston makes a deal for the Star Winston wants a worldclass diamond from his rough A carat emerald cut is fashioned but upon close examination it reveals inclusions Winston changes his mind deciding that flawlessness is more important than size The big diamond is recut into seven smaller stones the largest of which weighs carats Besides these the rough yields other stones ranging from to carats All told Winston recovers only carats a staggering loss of almost percent But of the finished stones are reportedly flawless GEM OF THE DAY Keep smiling Even when life knocks you flat on your back you are still in a good position to look up BEWARE OF FRACTIONS The FTC Federal Trade Commission allows jewelers to round off diamond weights For example a diamond labeled carat in weight might actually weigh anywhere between and carat While these are small weights the price difference can be significant For instance if you bought earrings with G color SI clarity and carat in each ear for you might have over paid by if they really weight carats Note Jewelers are also allowed to be off one color and one clarity grade If you dont purchase a certified diamond you could find yourself at the short end on weight color clarity and therefore value INTERNET SALES Internet shoppers are expected to spend almost billion online during the holiday season nearly double last years total of billion according to a recent survey by the Gartner Interactive Firm About half that revenue is expected to go to US and Canadian etailers with the rest distributed among firms in Europe and Asia Robert Labatt principal analyst for Gartners eBusiness Services Unit credits the increased willingness to do business online to the etailers extensive efforts in increasing the customers comfort level Chat rooms and opportunities to interact with the internet firms are encouraging more people to try this form of commerce DIAMOND GRADING TIPS FLUORESCENCE Fluorescence if present in a diamond will be indicated on a diamond grading report It will be graded very faint faint medium strong or very strong Some reports indicate the color of fluorescence as blue yellow white and so on A stone with yellow fluorescence should sell less since it will appear yellower than it really is when worn in daylight or fluorescent lighting The presence of blue fluorescence will not detract and in some cases may be considered a bonus since it may make the stone appear whiter than it really is in daylight or fluorescent lighting However if there is very strong fluorescence there may be an oily or milky appearance to the diamond We recommend avoiding medium or strong fluorescence since it is just not worth taking the chance of lower value BOW TIE One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie or butterfly effect a darkened area across the center or widest part of the stone depending upon the cut The bow tie is commonly seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any fancy shape Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will exhibit some minimal bow tie effect Nonetheless the presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper proportioning In poorly proportioned stones there is a pronounced bow tie the more pronounced the poorer the proportioning The less pronounced the bow tie the better the proportioning The degree to which the bow tie is evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make cut DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS One of the best ways to be a better shopper for diamonds and fine

Diamonds Looking For Something Really Special SI Clarity Insurance Questions Four Cs Bow Tie Price Calculator Diamond and Jewelry Books Internet Marketing EMERALD MAY BIRTHSTONE Emerald is a green variety of the mineral beryl One of the rarest members of the beryl familyonly the red variety sometimes called red emerald is rarerit is one of the most highly prized of all the gems Aside from being the birthstone for May it was historically believed to bestow on its wearer faithfulness and unchanging love and was thought to enable the wearer to forecast events The highestquality emerald has the color of fresh young green grassan almost pure spectral green possibly with a very faint tint of blue as in the finest emerald from Columbia which is considered by connoisseurs to be the worlds finest Other sources include Brazil Zambia Pakistan Afghanistan Russia and India Flawless emeralds are rare so their flaws have come to serve almost as fingerprints while flawless emeralds are immediately suspect Although a hard stone emerald will chip easily since it tends to be somewhat brittle so special care should be given in wearing and handling Techniques to enhance color and reduce the visibility of flaws are also frequently used A common practice is to fill surfacereaching cracks with oil sometimes tinted green a practice that goes back to early Greek times Todays emeralds are oiled using a vacuumheat technology This is a widely accepted trade practice since it is actually good for the stone in light of its fragile nature Oiling hides some of the whitish flaws which are actually cracks filling the cracks so they become less visible The oil becomes an integral part of the emerald unless it is subjected to some type of degreasing procedure The development and use of the ultrasonic cleaner has brought to light the extensive ness of this practice Never clean emeralds in an ultrasonic cleaner While oiling is considered an acceptable practice be sure the price reflects the actual quality of the stone If necessary most emeralds can be reoiled FAMOUS DIAMONDS Name Uncle Sam Weight carats rough and carats cut Color M very light brown ClarityVVS Shape Emerald Cut The Uncle Sam diamond which was discovered in the Crater of diamonds in Arkansas in is the largest yet found in the United States Peiken Jewelers of New York City owned the Uncle Sam for many years For a while it was on loan to the American Museum of Natural History In Sidney de Young a dealer from Boston bought the diamond and then sold it to an unnamed collector SEA DIAMONDS An enterprising Texan called Sammy Collins drew worldwide attention in when he announced that hed recovered carats of diamonds worth million from the seabed off the treacherous Diamond Coast of South West Africa Collins figured that since diamonds had been found in abundant amounts along the coast most likely carried there by the Vaal and Orange rivers from some far inland deposit they also ought to be found under the ocean Over a period of three years Collins used the equivalent of huge vacuum sweepers to suck some carats of diamonds from the seabed His adventures set off a minirush by others to try this new type of exploration but terrible working conditions and uncertain diamond deposits sent most into early obscurity Today with improved technology De Beers and others are once again probing the waters of the South Atlantic bringing closer the prospect of viable undersea diamond recovery LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL We will be attending the annual JCK Jewelry Show in Las

While we recommend at least SI clarity for most diamonds to ensure they are eye clean many consumers think that SI means nothing visible with the naked eye The following comments define the official GIA position SI stones contain noticeable inclusions which are easy SI or very easy SI for a trained grader to see under X Typical inclusions are included crystals clouds and feathers normally centrally located and noticed immediately A stone with an eye visible inclusion can still be graded SI You must consider the size nature position number and color or relief of the inclusion The size and shape of the stone are important too Characteristics in the SI grade usually are not visible to the unaided eye faceup Characteristics in some SI stones can be seen with the unaided eye We find that over half of the SI stones have visible inclusions to the naked eye Note the above comments say visible to the unaided eye faceup With most shapes of diamonds inclusions are often easily visible from the side where there are few if any facets to hide them We just sent a VS clarity princess back to the wholesaler because the inclusion while not visible faceup was easily visible with the naked eye from the side You can imagine what the SI diamonds look like from the side if they are visible faceup If the mounting hides the side of the diamond these side visible inclusions are not a problem But most mountings show off the side of a diamond and make them easy to see INSURANCE QUESTIONS Most people do not realize that insurers differ widely in what they offer regarding coverage and reimbursement or replacement Many insurance companies will not reimburse the full value provided in the policy but rather exercise a replacement optionand will offer a sum in cash less than the amount for which the jewelry is insured or offer to replace it for you Therefore it is important to ask some very specific questions to determine the precise coverage offered We recommend asking the insurer at least the following How do you satisfy claims Do you reimburse the insured amount in cash If not how is the amount of the cash settlement determined Or do you replace the jewelry What involvements do I have in the replacement of an item What assurance do I have that the replacement will be of comparable quality and value What is your coverage on articles that cannot be replaced Exactly what risks does my policy coverall risks Mysterious disappearance Am I covered in all geographic areas At all times Are their any exemptions or exclusions What if the loss involves negligence What happens if the diamond falls out What are the deductibles if any What documentation do you expect me to provide Every week we hear yet another story of a customer who paid insurance premiums for years and were shocked to discover how little protection they really had when they did have a claim Check the small print before you need it FOUR CS Diamond quality and value are determined by four factors These factors are called the Four Cs If we were to rank them based on their importance in determining the value of a diamond we would list them as follows Color Clarity Cut and proportion Carat weight In terms of determining beauty however we would rank them in a different order Cut and proportion Color Clarity Carat weight When diamond shopping it pays to put your focus on cut and proportion since this is where you get the most impact on beauty while paying little premium in price We recommend investing your dollars in beauty you see rather than rarity and higher quality not visible to your eye BOW TIE One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie or butterfly effect a darkened area across the center or widest part of the stone depending upon the cut The bow tie is commonly seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any fancy shape Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will exhibit some minimal bow tie effect Nonetheless the
