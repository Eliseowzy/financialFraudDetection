we collect it in fuel sales through After I calculated an adjustment to add to the historical rates assuming that we would recapture some of the value of the spread in the rate and it made the rate greater than the max tariff rate Davis and I discussed that we didnt think we should assume anything in the models over max rate so Davis said he would use the max rate after All of this is just pertaining to the West rates The historical average West rate is The historical West rate with fuel adjustment added is The max rate is Its the same thing someone commented below in blue in response to the question if we are at average rates we would be able to get it back fuel overretention up to the max rate number Original Message From Geaccone Tracy Sent Monday February AM To Donoho Lindy

AM To Hayslett Rod Saunders James Geaccone Tracy Howard Kevin A Cc Ratner Michael Subject RE TW model Attached is the model incorporating the changes have implemented undivided interest concept Cash flow detail is as follows a mm in operating cash flow b mm net from release of ENE receivablepayable c mm equity infusion d mm debt repayment e mm in new debt to bring debt to target levels f mm equity dividend to bring equity to target levels Ive used the income detail tab to ratio taxes appropriately Ive made reg amort mm per Bob Regulatory asset remains on books thru Not including interest expense proforma ROE is in the to range Rod debt capital was not invested in a project with returns exceeding cost of debt therefore ROE dropped with leverage Agreed this is backwards from intuitive result Davis File TWmodelrdxls Original Message From Hayslett Rod Sent Monday February AM To Thames Davis Saunders James Cc Geaccone Tracy Howard Kevin A Subject RE TW model See below Jim see Original Message From Thames Davis Sent Monday February AM To Hayslett Rod Howard Kevin A Cc Geaccone Tracy Subject RE TW model Please see comments below We should probably show TransPecos as an undivided ownership interest as opposed to an investment in JV That way the revenues and costs will be picked up above the line and can be analyzed with the other revenues Looks like we are properly picking up the capex from TransPecos in our capex additions already I might be missing something but I only see two accounting ways to handle TransPecos equity method investment as shown or consolidated with minority interests In the former case our debt holdings are understated and in the latter theyre overstated My guess is that the JV will be accounted for as shown In terms of capex currently I have TW picking up of the capex starting equity basis Not to be flip but Im not sure which accounting method would let us pick up half the revenues and half the costs If we had an undivided interest we would have of the deal on our books debt and all Please let me know which method I should use The equity balance did not seem to change for the equity infusion Was this treated as equity in to repay or just an extinguishment There was mm in excess cash that was dividended back out The model had to increase borrowings and pay a dividend to get the debtequity ratio to after the infusion It would seem to me that if there was coming in that it needed to be paid to reduce the corresponding debt so where did the excess cash come from Lets grow Other Taxes by Should grow by the same percentage as either revenues or net plant For most pipes these are propertyearnings dependent and are derived from the uitlity operating income line on the form for the most part I need to fix the model to make other taxes a function of ppe Ill make it a constant rate based on year Rod reminds me that part of that is probably gross receipts Ill go back to the planning models and try to figure out a relative proportion Also a part is payroll taxes Tracy could probably break it apart for you Question for TG Reg Am was only million in but million going forward All Reg Am should disappear with the new rate case thats why we had to increase it so much so that it amortizes to zero by Note that it is noncash nontax but it represents a large reduction in equity Then there must be a problem elsewhere since it is supposed to be gone by itself Question for LDSH on the drop in revenues by approx million Detail schedules show why just want to make sure it makes sense Thats an item that Lindys following up on but probably the whole group needs to consider Our fuel retention goes away after the question is whether max rates should add in the revenues that we derived from fuel retention or not The interpretation in the model is that max rates means our max published reservation fee only meaning that we lose mm of fuel retention after If we are at max rates then that would be the result however if we are at average rates we would be able to get it back up to the max rate number ROE questionscases Lets show after ROE the ROE without the effect of the additional debt that was added in Nov This obviously dropped the ROE from to If Cooper is successfully in coming out with no debt on TW it should not have been there in the first place the ROE will be much higher In addition reducing equity by the should also improve the ROE substantially Ill run a line that adds back taxadjusted interest expense in the ROE calc the mm was handled as above This is not intuitive The ROE should be bigger with debt unless the ROE is less than the cost of debt Debt up equity down ROE up

cc AM Subject RE ECS Contract Review New Idea Dave If possible I would like for you to sit down with Lindy and a few folks from our group who have been looking at this I want to make sure that it would be an efficient use of your time and that we would not be duplicating anything I will have Lindy contact you so we can set something up and then move forward as necessary Thanks Steve Original Message From ENRON Sent Tuesday October AM To Harris Steven Subject ECS Contract Review New Idea Steve I worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my time hour normal rate is I would like to send you an engagement letter this week for up to weeks or hours k I think we can get it done in less time but the hours provides some flexibility if we decide to go deeper on something we would only charge you for the hours we use I am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring options as well as the NPV Income and operational effect for each To the extent time allows I will be able to help negotiate and close whatever option you choose In order for me to offer our preferred rate it is important to note that I would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis eg Friday meetings emails and phone vs being onsite weeks fulltime Even with this flexible structure I feel confident that we can have the deliverable complete by mid December Please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with these terms As for the new idea I have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset positionmarket intelligence It occurred to me that there is an analogy here that relates to pipelines Pipelines have operational events that may have market effects Unplanned outage majorminordurationnotice Planned outages over a certain volume Operation flow order SOLs Key Plants backed in Takes over schedule volumes key points Linepack levels Pressure drops at key points Since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through gas needed for operational purchases it is rationale that these phenomena would be studied and acted read traded upon in order to minimize TWs market risk read generate income TW can setup a risk management group to execute this idea It is not unusual for a pipeline to have a risk management function Duke Pipeline for example has a VP of Risk Management for Pipelines These events would be studied in the follow way Determine whether there is a correlation between an event and gas pricesbasis differentials based on historical data For those events that have a strong correlations develop a trading strategy around the relationship Backtest the trading strategy against historical data determine profitability For operational events that are applicable setup a system to execute program trading that is directly linked to SCADA Secondary benefits of this risk management trading strategy would be developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of selling the capacity physical vs through basis derivatives or some combination of both Steve if you are interested in this idea I can start drawing up a workplan for this study Dave David A Foti Accenture Allen Parkway Suite Houston Texas Forwarded by David A FotiInternalAccenture on AM David A Foti To PM cc Subject Contract Review MM RCM Steve I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options If your team is available I could come by next Friday midmorning or later to start discussing with them On the administrative side I am working to nail down the lowest hourly rate I can get for you I would probably propose something like hours rate in the engagement letter This amount of time should be adequate to put together a short study on your different options I will send you a engagement letter this week I would just need to get that signed by you before Friday Also please let me know if you need any other information on the

Steven Subject TW Earnings Idea Twist on ECS Deals Hello Steve Havent talked to you in a while hope all is well A quick update I moved over from EES to Accentures Energy group about six months ago and have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management Pipeline Optimization projects I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting Accenture has a strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability Centered Maintenance RCM basically an advanced methodology technology for making maintenance decisions They are the standard for electric TD companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment This is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal TW hires Accenture to implement RCM RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project weeks Accenture pays TW upfront for years of projected benefits from RCM say MM as part of our guarantee TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over the next years which will flow into the next rate case I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante so I am around the Enron building Let me know if you would like to get together to discuss further Hope all is well Dave mobile David A

SubjectRE Two proceeding changes Christi I dont think it changes the requirement to file by October e ither and we are proceeding under the same schedule Several rehearing re quests were submitted including one for ENAEES However note the follow ing which I sent out in an earlier message to the ENAEES western commercia l and government affairs folks I noted you deleted your message without re ading it I consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this O MB ruling a good sign As detailed in the attached FERC notice the Office of Management and Budge t OMB has approved FERCs Information Collection Request for Reporting o f Natural Gas Sales to the California Market through the sixmonth emergen cy period that will expire on Emergency reporting requirements a re automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations Howev er it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the re porting requirements could be extended OMB has advised FERC that if it decides to request renewal of the Informat ion Collection Request after that date it must address certain issues as p art of its supporting statement more specifically include an explicit di scussion As you may remember in addition to requesting rehearing of th e FERC order ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems with FERCs estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed co llection of information We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements much less keep o ur records in that manner We manage our business on an aggregated basis and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significan t manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale We stated that we might even have to hire fulltime staff to dedicate to the task The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requir es FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the repo rting requirements past FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through to coincide w ith the end date of its mitigation plan OMB questioned the practical uti lity of requiring disaggregated data when commenters reported that they d id not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant d ata manipulation in order to respond and the resulting disaggregation woul d likely be artificial OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden esti mates after consulting with respondents and it must provide a list of th e names affiliates and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request While we would not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely it may be that the OMB action will affect their final decision At the least it sen ds a signal

on with Maria concerning East of CA customers right to release capacity to the CA border Original Message From Pavlou Maria Sent Monday September PM To Donoho Lindy Cc Watson Kimberly Harris Steven Subject RE Global Settlement Question Your memo raises a lot of good questions In analyzing this issue it would be helpful to know what type of rates we have agreed to with the shippers that have primary delivery points East of California Are they all negotiated rates Are any max rates In addition I think we need to review what rights we have provided Citizens and other EOC shippers Im assuming they cannot release their capacity to California Have we let them use California delivery points on an alternate basis If so for what term on a limited basis or throughout the term of their contract Lets also review the situation whereby we let PGE use Ignacio as an alternate receipt point My recollection is that we do not let them release Ignacio because it is not part of their primary path I think it would be helpful to have Elizabeth in these discussions I reviewed the language in the Docket No RP settlement and it is not specifically limited to Citizens It provides that we would establish an EOC rate for deliveries from ThoreauSan Juan point to East of California points The Maximum FTS rate was cents less than the maximum FTS rates otherwise applicable to shippers in the WOT area That settlement also prohibited capacity releases by shippers paying the lower EOC rate to California delivery points The rates in this settlement were locked in under the Global Settlement Tariff sheet no A has a footnote that provides that the max reservation charge is applicable to all delivery points west of the ThoreauSan Juan Point except for deliveries to California Pls let me know when we can discuss this further Thanks Maria Original Message From Donoho Lindy Sent Monday September AM To Pavlou Maria Cc Watson Kimberly Harris Steven Subject Global Settlement Question Now that were going to have new East of CA shippers with Red Rock I wanted to know if customers with primary DPs in East of CA were precluded from releasing capacity to the CA border like Citizens I didnt know if this applied to anyone paying an East of CA rate or if it was particular to Citizens in the settlement If they are precluded from releasing to the CA border what if they agreed to pay the CA border reservation rate when they released to the border Even then Im not sure what the East of CA customers traded for their reservation discount because its not like theyd be paying the greater reservation all the time for the right to release to the border Let me know when you have a chance to discuss Its not urgent but I thought we should be sure to communicate this correctly to our new
