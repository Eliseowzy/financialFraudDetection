from last nights recap we thought that based on the fundamentals of Sun Micro systems we would see more down ward pressure on both markets today And we sure DID Morgan stanley and Lemann both down graded the whole tech sector today on comments that the second half of the year looking for recovery in the techs was wish full thinking This along with reports from Radio shack and fundamental news of potential problems of US travelers in the middle east added more overall pressure to the Indices Sun Micro alone was down another The Nasdaq cash composite was off This was viewed as very bearish Where do we go from here We think that the wave and Fib players were thrown off track today and now the top level is at the area Tomorow we think will see a more of a violent push down to take out todays lows within the first hour But to smooth out and trade sideways for the rest of the day I dont expect to see more than a pt range Based on the time factor that we have been in this trade I do see a high probability factor that we might be long some time tomorow due to the fact that the down side is running out of steam at least for now We might need to be long for a short time inorder to get short so we can see another big push down to the levels We are very pleased that the third week in May recovered all of its pull back in equity since its high of We will show all trades that were closed out in May on tomorrows recap The Month of May marked to the market is now up aprox MTD for the full size SP For those potential clients that are following us one very important aspect of our

firms both equitys and futures have there own platforms and there own systems Its been proven that as long as one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year Human intervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did today but whats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame This is the secret for long term success Until Tomorrow On the Email that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting Single Stock futures This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be one of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models The large firms will have access to this market first then the retail public will begin As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our

aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues For example IBM will have a contract that will have shares in a contract And that will have a life of days just like the

cst they were May Again anything below is viewed as bearish Also employment numbers were weaker as expected The market had these numbers built in so the bearish posture had no impact today Our view on todays trading was more of the fact that we have for now hit a VERY short term technical bottom The wave and Fib traders were looking at and a break above in order for a stab at Well I sure as heck hope the crowd is right since we are long However we have never been fans of the wave or Fib methodology only due to the fact that its very tough to figure entries And as we have always stated due to

Now this time around the Bonds took off to the moon on a flight to quality and the Equities sold off very quickly We did go down to retest and try and take out yesterdays low of but this just proved

S open trade b close trade B open trade open equity at close trade still open No Bonds today Commentary Today price action was a nice show of follow through from our forecast of yesterdayWe were able to see that the Technical chart formations confirmed what the System saw intradayToday In the face of a lot of bearish economic data out the market pushed forward as a counter trend move We did have Productivity numbers revised down for the first quarter showing this was the largest change since On the technical side we had a update on the VIX index showing down this was still bearish but showing signs of stabilizing The volume today was much stronger today in the cash market And the chip sector saw a big boost in the Nasdaq and that helped propel the high tech market Fed futures are now showing a chance of another rate cut at the next FOMC meeting and another chance of rate cut again in July Where do we go from here The Wave and Fib traders were off on there timing but they did get to the area today This was viewed as the top end of the market Some of them now are looking at a break above on a closing bases as bullish This may propel to and then to All I can say is since we are long from GOD I HOPE THERE RIGHT All this will do is lock in a higher profit on our long What was very interesting to us today was that we had two trend change signals to go short after we took out and both were moved to higher levels before being cancelled all together then the system just went flat However on the last up date at cst we did get a signal to reverse however that was not hit We think based on the technical and cash data that the system was calculating the last thirty min of the cash market there is a high probability factor that we have hit a top and we will be short tomorrow on the open We do think by no means that going to these higher levels we are on a new bull run We are and have been for a long time a bear on the long term picture And its just a matter of time we think will see some ugly moves to the down side However in the mean time In Rome do what the Romans do For those of you who know me and we have spoken before Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my montra about trading systems that are available to the retail public Since I was introduced to SYSTEM TRADING back in and have never looked back I am more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success However I also feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program and that if its going to have any real

us one very important aspect of our system is that it feeds on a great deal of data that is transmitted from the cash market And both technical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend

has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equitys and futures have there own platforms and there own systems Its been proven that as long as one has a sound trading methodology that is coded

S open trade b close trade B open trade open equity at close trade still open No Bonds today Commentary Today price action was a nice show of follow through from our forecast of yesterdayWe were able to see that the Technical chart formations confirmed what the System saw intradayToday In the face of a lot of bearish economic data out the market pushed forward as a counter trend move We did have Productivity numbers revised down for the first quarter showing this was the largest change since On the technical side we had a update on the VIX index showing down this was still bearish but showing signs of stabilizing The volume today was much stronger today in the cash market And the chip sector saw a big boost in the Nasdaq and that helped propel the high tech market Fed futures are now showing a chance of another rate cut at the next FOMC meeting and another chance of rate cut again in July Where do we go from here The Wave and Fib traders were off on there timing but they did get to the area today This was viewed as the top end of the market Some of them now are looking at a break above on a closing bases bullish This may propel to and then to All I can say is since we are long from GOD I HOPE THERE RIGHT All this will do is lock in a higher profit on our long What was very interesting to us today was that we had two trend change signals to go short after we took out and both were moved to higher levels before being cancelled all together then the system just went flat However on the last up date at cst we did get a signal to reverse however that was not hit We think based on the technical and cash data that the system was calculating the last thirty min of the cash market there is a high probibility that we have hit a top and we will be short tomorrow on the open We do think by no means that going to these higher levels we are on a new bull run We are and have been for a long time a bear on the long term picture And its just a matter of time we think will see some ugly moves to the down side However in the mean time In Rome do what the Romans do For those of you who know me and we have spoken before Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my montra about trading systems that are available to the retail public Since I was introduced to SYSTEM TRADING back in and have never looked back I am more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success However I also feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program and that if its going to have any real long term life to it then why would any one sell it The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is I found this section in the

into the last thirty min of the cash market yesterday was right on the marker We did infact get short on the open Its very rare that we do have trend change orders on the open but they do happen every sixty days or so If we had a open above that would of been our new entry But we did have a slight gap down that was below that level so the computer showed the entry at the first print We now off set our long with a respectable profit and show a real sweet open short going into the close Today in the cash market we found out that a great deal of calls were sold at the CBOE by market makers The bias is now that the Dow from the open has a pt upside and a max pt down side at this time frame As of the close we think that we may see the levels of before a bounce If we can break then we have a chance to This is the area that may show signs of a temp bottom Where do we go from here Based on four up days in the Dow the Market is showing signs of getting tired and as we move into the bal of the week we think that the cash market prefers not to be long over this weekend coming up I am leaning to seeing those first support levels before any bullish activity before the market tells us

B open trade s close trade S open trade open equity at close trade still open No bonds today Commentary Todays price action was right on the money The calculations that our computer model was reading into the last thirty min of the cash market yesterday was right on the marker We did infact get short on the open Its very rare that we do have trend change orders on the open of the bell but they do happen every sixty days or so If we had a open above that would of been our new entry But we did have a slight gap down that was below that level so the computer showed the entry at the first print We now off set our long with a respectable profit and show a real sweet open short going into the close Today in the cash market we found out that a great deal of calls were sold at the CBOE by market makers The bias is now that the Dow from the open has a pt upside and a max pt down side at this time frame As of the close we think that we may see the levels of before a bounce If we can break then we have a chance to This is the area that may show signs of a temp bottom Where do we go from here Based on four up days in the Dow The Market is showing signs of getting tired and as we move into the bal of the week we think that the cash market prefers not to be long over this weekend coming up I am leaning to seeing those first levels of support before any bullish activity then we wait and let the market tell us where its going next Until tomorrow Jerry For those of you who know me and we have spoken before Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my montra about trading systems that are

SEPT Commentary Todays price action was roll over day and anything can happen when converting to a new contract month I am rushing to get this recap out so todays commentary will be very brief We did get jobless claims numbers out and they were bearish up much more than expected This data was the largest gain in claims since When rolling contracts in our system it will always create a second trade in the same day However todays move on the bullish side in the Sept contract has proven to be a very nice move As we write this Globex is at and the nasdaq is Sept Intel came out with news that was on a positve note and its up in the night market Until tomorrow For those of you who know me and we have spoken before Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my montra about trading systems that are available to the retail public Since I was introduced to SYSTEM TRADING back in and have never looked back I am more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success However I also feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program and that if its going to have any real long term longevity to it then why would anyone sell it The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is I found this section in the June edition of Futures magazine go to page in the middle of the page is a observation from them on tracking systems And I quote ALMOST ALL SUCCESSFUL SYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORTTERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS THE CONSISTENT SHORTTERM SWING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED Un quote Well folks the fact is yes it has been developed its just not for sale I guess traders will just half to settle for being part of a managed acct with us that has shown to make money For those potential clients that are following us one very important aspect of our system is that it feeds on a great deal of data that is transmitted from the cash market And both technical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changesWe have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes have been violated regardless of where the futures are What most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equitys and futures have there own platforms and there own systems Its been proven that as long as one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year Human intervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did today but whats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame This is the secret for long term success On the Email that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting Single Stock futures This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be one of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models The large firms will have access to this market first then the retail public will begin As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the
