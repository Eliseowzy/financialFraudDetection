<15798741.1075847342277.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,greg.johnston@enron.com,2001-04-03 04:27:00,Re Cash Collateral Cc I wanted to get back to you on your questions and also give a little more detail of the analysis As you know we have issues in Canada about taking cash collateral which issues have been clearly identified and communicated by Peter previously see his emails of March However as opposed to cash it appears clear under our personal property registration legislation that a certified cheque and a bank draft would fall under the definition of instruments Under such legislation as Peter has indicated below a security interest in instruments can be perfected by possession thus eliminating the need to register the security interest at the personal property registry which requirement to register creates the perfection and priority concerns we have with holding cash collateral Therefore at first blush it seems that a counterparty providing a certified cheque or bank draft to us in lieu of cash collateral or a letter of credit which certified cheque or bank draft would be held by us in the same manner as we hold LCs might solve our cash collateral concerns and make another credit instrument available to us for use in Canada There are a few concerns which I think are raised by your questions The first is that if we take the instrument and immediately convert it to cash and place the cash in an account we run into the exact same issues as we have with taking cash collateral in the first place The personal property security legislation specifically indicates that proceeds realized from dealing with the original collateral need to be perfected in the same manner as original collateral of the same kind ie where the proceeds from the bank draft are cash we need to then perfect our security interest in the cash as if the original collateral was cash meaning we have the exact same issues as we currently have with perfecting a security interest in cash collateral Therefore we would need to deal with the instrument bank draft or certified cheque in the same manner as we deal with LCs That is we would cash the instrument in payment of outstanding accounts at the time that we become entitled under the contract to apply our collateral against amounts owing to us from the counterparty We would have to actually hold the certified cheque or bank draft until such entitlement arose The requirement to hold the bank draft or certified cheque for a potentially extended period of time raises another concern about how long such an instrument can remain outstanding before it becomes stale dated and thus undrawable In other words it may well be that a bank will only allow such instruments to be drawable if they are presented for payment within a reasonable time of their issuance This is one point that would require further research if we are going to consider utlizing such instruments as collateral since the answer could obviously make the use of such instruments a solution for only very short term transactions if at all The final point I would make is also raised by your second question below My understanding is that the law in Canada has been somewhat grey in the past with respect to whether a person who issues a certified cheque or the bank on which the certified cheque is drawn can stop payment on such a cheque after it has been issued I believe that there may have been some recent Ontario decisions indicating that a cheque once certified must be honoured upon presentment and if the bank upon which the certified cheque is drawn refuses to pay it will be liable for the amount However we would need to look into this point further as any risk that a certified cheque can be withdrawn by the payor at any time after it has been issued obviously eliminates the benefit of the collateral I do not believe that the same concern exists for a bank draft as I believe it represents a fully funded obligation of the bank to pay which is irrevocable If we wish to consider using such instruments as an alternate form of collateral I would suggest that we have such use vetted by outside counsel and obtain an opinion as to the viability and risks associated with such use Since Stikeman Elliott provided our opinion with respect to cash collateral I would suggest that we use them to provide the advice on these points as well Please let me know if you would like me to instruct outside counsel to proceed Thanks Greg From Mark Taylor on AM CDT To Peter CT cc Brent nron Carol St CT Chris CT Greg CT Mark CT Mary CT Russell nronXGate Sara CT Tana CT Tanya nronXGate William S nronXGate Subject Re Cash Collateral Sounds like a great idea a couple of questions Can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest If not can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the customers draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashiers check Peter Keohane PM To Mark CT Sara CT Brent nron Mary CT Carol St CT Tana CT William S BradfordHOUECT Russell DiamondHOUECT Tanya RohauerHOUECT cc Greg CT Mark CT Chris CT Subject Cash Collateral Greg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cash collateral Without getting into detail a security interest in an instrument can be perfected by possession under the Personal Property Security Act and an instrument includes a bank draft If counterparties were to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we could rely on perfection by possession Is this something we should investigate further Peter

<14896906.1075847109785.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,greg.johnston@enron.com,2000-09-20 04:22:00,Re Alberta PPA Financing Cc I have considered your issue in point three below and further to our discussion I believe that the issue is addressed in Paragraph d of the credit support annex That paragraph indicates that upon termination where no amounts are payable by Pledgor the party that has posted collateral to Secured Party the party holding the posted collateral the Secured Party will transfer all posted collateral plus interest if the posted collateral is cash to the Pledgor Therefore although in your third example Bow Valley would be required to post a letter of credit for the million upon termination ECC would owe the million to Bow Valley and Paragraph d would kick in such that ECC would be required to return the letter of credit to Bow Valley and pay the million The mechanism set forth in Paragraph d clearly makes sense in a multitransaction situation but doesnt really make sense in this situation since in your third example ECC could call for a letter of credit from Bow Valley knowing full well that it will never be able to actually use it thereby simply making Bow Valley incur the cost of posting the letter of credit However I think this is a point that we should leave for the bank to raise if they are concerned about it Practically speaking I would think that given these facts ECC would simply not call for the letter of credit from Bow Valley in your third example as it provides no real protection I guess the only other point to be made is that if the index were to go to a price of less than per GJ such that the amount owed to Bow Valley under Swap was reduced from million to less than million ECC holding the letter of credit would make sense Greg Enron Capital Trade Resources Canada Corp From Peter Keohane AM To Greg CT Sara CT William S CT Tana CT cc Brian CT Soma CT Derek CT Sharon CT Subject Alberta PPA Financing I want to get a handle on how termination payments are handled vis a vis the collateral obligations particularly where the Index moves down relative to the forward price and its effect on Swap assuming example forward price there is no issue There is no collateral obligation and Swap settles at MM and Swap settles at assuming example forward price there is MM collateral obligation of ECC to Swapco on Swap and MM collateral obligation of RBC to ECC on Swap each with MM collateral threshold as Swap settles at MM due from ECC to Swapco and Swap settles at MM due from RBC to ECC This seems to make sense Swapco has a claim against ECC for MM with Enron Corp Guarantee and MM of collateral ECC has a claim against RBC for MM with MM of collateral assuming example forward price there is MM collateral obligation of Swapco to ECC on Swap and MM collateral obligation of ECC to RBC on Swap each with MM collateral threshold as Swap settles at MM due from ECC to Swapco and Swap settles at MM due from ECC to RBC This is where I get lost Swapco has a claim against ECC for MM with Enron Corp Guarantee but has given MM of collateral when it owes nothing How is the collateral applied when it owes nothing RBC has a claim against ECC for MM with Enron Corp Guarantee and MM of collateral This part seems to make sense Somebody smarter than me needs to explain

indicated below a security interest in instruments can be perfected by possession thus eliminating the need to register the security interest at the personal property registry which requirement to register creates the perfection and priority concerns we have with holding cash collateral Therefore at first blush it seems that a counterparty providing a certified cheque or bank draft to us in lieu of cash collateral or a letter of credit which certified cheque or bank draft would be held by us in the same manner as we hold LCs might solve our cash collateral concerns and make another credit instrument available to us for use in Canada There are a few concerns which I think are raised by your questions The first is that if we take the instrument and immediately convert it to cash and place the cash in an account we run into the exact same issues as we have with taking cash collateral in the first place The personal property security legislation specifically indicates that proceeds realized from dealing with the original collateral need to be perfected in the same manner as original collateral of the same kind ie where the proceeds from the bank draft are cash we need to then perfect our security interest in the cash as if the original collateral was cash meaning we have the exact same issues as we currently have with perfecting a security interest in cash collateral Therefore we would need to deal with the instrument bank draft or certified cheque in the same manner as we deal with LCs That is we would cash the instrument in payment of outstanding accounts at the time that we become entitled under the contract to apply our collateral against amounts owing to us from the counterparty We would have to actually hold the certified cheque or bank draft until such entitlement arose The requirement to hold the bank draft or certified cheque for a potentially extended period of time raises another concern about how long such an instrument can remain outstanding before it becomes stale dated and thus undrawable In other words it may well be that a bank will only allow such instruments to be drawable if they are presented for payment within a reasonable time of their issuance This is one point that would require further research if we are going to consider utlizing such instruments as collateral since the answer could obviously make the use of such instruments a solution for only very short term transactions if at all The final point I would make is also raised by your second question below My understanding is that the law in Canada has been somewhat grey in the past with respect to whether a person who issues a certified cheque or the bank on which the certified cheque is drawn can stop payment on such a cheque after it has been issued I believe that there may have been some recent Ontario decisions indicating that a cheque once certified must be honoured upon presentment and if the bank upon which the certified cheque is drawn refuses to pay it will be liable for the amount However we would need to look into this point further as any risk that a certified cheque can be withdrawn by the payor at any time after it has been issued obviously eliminates the benefit of the collateral I do not believe that the same concern exists for a bank draft as I believe it represents a fully funded obligation of the bank to pay which is irrevocable If we wish to consider using such instruments as an alternate form of collateral I would suggest that we have such use vetted by outside counsel and obtain an opinion as to the viability and risks associated with such use Since Stikeman Elliott provided our opinion with respect to cash collateral I would suggest that we use them to provide the advice on these points as well Please let me know if you would like me to instruct outside counsel to proceed Thanks Greg From Mark Taylor on AM CDT To Peter CT cc Brent nron Carol St CT Chris CT Greg CT Mark CT Mary CT Russell nronXGate Sara CT Tana CT Tanya nronXGate William S nronXGate Subject Re Cash Collateral Sounds like a great idea a couple of questions Can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest If not can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the customers draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashiers check Peter Keohane PM To Mark CT Sara CT Brent nron Mary CT Carol St CT Tana CT William S BradfordHOUECT Russell DiamondHOUECT Tanya RohauerHOUECT cc Greg CT Mark CT Chris CT Subject Cash Collateral Greg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cash collateral Without getting into detail a security interest in an instrument can be perfected by possession under the Personal Property Security Act and an instrument includes a bank draft If counterparties were to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we could rely on perfection by possession Is this something we should investigate further Peter

cash it appears clear under our personal property registration legislation that a certified cheque and a bank draft would fall under the definition of instruments Under such legislation as Peter has indicated below a security interest in instruments can be perfected by possession thus eliminating the need to register the security interest at the personal property registry which requirement to

lieu of cash collateral or a letter of credit which certified cheque or bank draft would be held by us in the same manner as we hold LCs might solve our cash collateral concerns and make another credit instrument available to us for use in Canada There are a few concerns which I think are raised by your questions The first is that if we take the instrument and immediately convert it to cash and place the cash in an account we run into the exact same issues as we have with taking cash collateral in the first place The personal property security legislation specifically indicates that proceeds realized from dealing with the original collateral need to be perfected in the same manner as original collateral of the same kind ie where the proceeds from the bank draft are cash we need to then perfect our security interest in the cash as if the original collateral was cash meaning we have the exact same issues as we currently have with perfecting a security interest in cash collateral Therefore we would need to deal with the instrument bank draft or certified cheque in the same manner as we deal with LCs That is we would cash the instrument in payment of outstanding accounts at the time that we become entitled under the contract to apply our collateral against amounts owing to us from the counterparty We would have to actually hold the certified cheque or bank draft until such entitlement arose The requirement to hold the bank draft or certified cheque for a potentially extended period of time raises another concern about how long such an instrument can remain outstanding before it becomes stale dated and thus undrawable In other words it may well be that a bank will only allow such instruments to be drawable if they are presented for payment within a reasonable time of their issuance This is one point that would require further research if we are going to consider utlizing such instruments as collateral since the answer could obviously make the use of such instruments a solution for only very short term transactions if at all The final point I would make is also raised by your second question below My understanding is that the law in Canada has been somewhat grey in the past with respect to whether a person who issues a certified cheque or the bank on which the certified cheque is drawn can stop payment on such a cheque after it has been issued I believe that there may have been some recent Ontario decisions indicating that a cheque once certified must be honoured upon presentment and if the bank upon which the certified cheque is drawn refuses to pay it will be liable for the amount However we would need to look into this point further as any risk that a certified cheque can be withdrawn by the payor at any time after it has been issued obviously eliminates the benefit of the collateral I do not believe that the same concern exists for a bank draft as I believe it represents a fully funded obligation of the bank to pay which is irrevocable If we wish to consider using such instruments as an alternate form of collateral I would suggest that we have such use vetted by outside counsel and obtain an opinion as to the

<16418930.1075860201439.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,greg.johnston@enron.com,2001-04-03 04:27:00,Re Cash Collateral Cc I wanted to get back to you on your questions and also give a little more detail of the analysis As you know we have issues in Canada about taking cash collateral which issues have been clearly identified and communicated by Peter previously see his emails of March However as opposed to cash it appears clear under our personal property registration legislation that a certified cheque and a bank draft would fall under the definition of instruments Under such legislation as Peter has indicated below a security interest in instruments can be perfected by possession thus eliminating the need to register the security interest at the personal property registry which requirement to register creates the perfection and priority concerns we have with holding cash collateral Therefore at first blush it seems that a counterparty providing a certified cheque or bank draft to us in lieu of cash collateral or a letter of credit which certified cheque or bank draft would be held by us in the same manner as we hold LCs might solve our cash collateral concerns and make another credit instrument available to us for use in Canada There are a few concerns which I think are raised by your questions The first is that if we take the instrument and immediately convert it to cash and place the cash in an account we run into the exact same issues as we have with taking cash collateral in the first place The personal property security legislation specifically indicates that proceeds realized from dealing with the original collateral need to be perfected in the same manner as original collateral of the same kind ie where the proceeds from the bank draft are cash we need to then perfect our security interest in the cash as if the original collateral was cash meaning we have the exact same issues as we currently have with perfecting a security interest in cash collateral Therefore we would need to deal with the instrument bank draft or certified cheque in the same manner as we deal with LCs That is we would cash the instrument in payment of outstanding accounts at the time that we become entitled under the contract to apply our collateral against amounts owing to us from the counterparty We would have to actually hold the certified cheque or bank draft until such entitlement arose The requirement to hold the bank draft or certified cheque for a potentially extended period of time raises another concern about how long such an instrument can remain outstanding before it becomes stale dated and thus undrawable In other words it may well be that a bank will only allow such instruments to be drawable if they are presented for payment within a reasonable time of their issuance This is one point that would require further research if we are going to consider utlizing such instruments as collateral since the answer could obviously make the use of such instruments a solution for only very short term transactions if at all The final point I would make is also raised by your second question below My understanding is that the law in Canada has been somewhat grey in the past with respect to whether a person who issues a certified cheque or the bank on which the certified cheque is drawn can stop payment on such a cheque after it has been issued I believe that there may have been some recent Ontario decisions indicating that a cheque once certified must be honoured upon presentment and if the bank upon which the certified cheque is drawn refuses to pay it will be liable for the amount However we would need to look into this point further as any risk that a certified cheque can be withdrawn by the payor at any time after it has been issued obviously eliminates the benefit of the collateral I do not believe that the same concern exists for a bank draft as I believe it represents a fully funded obligation of the bank to pay which is irrevocable If we wish to consider using such instruments as an alternate form of collateral I would suggest that we have such use vetted by outside counsel and obtain an opinion as to the viability and risks associated with such use Since Stikeman Elliott provided our opinion with respect to cash collateral I would suggest that we use them to provide the advice on these points as well Please let me know if you would like me to instruct outside counsel to proceed Thanks Greg From Mark Taylor on AM CDT To Peter CT cc Brent nron Carol St CT Chris CT Greg CT Mark CT Mary CT Russell nronXGate Sara CT Tana CT Tanya nronXGate William S nronXGate Subject Re Cash Collateral Sounds like a great idea a couple of questions Can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest If not can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the customers draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashiers check Peter Keohane PM To Mark CT Sara CT Brent nron Mary CT Carol St CT Tana CT William S BradfordHOUECT Russell DiamondHOUECT Tanya RohauerHOUECT cc Greg CT Mark CT Chris CT Subject Cash Collateral Greg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cash collateral Without getting into detail a security interest in an instrument can be perfected by possession under the Personal Property Security Act and an instrument includes a bank draft If counterparties were to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we could rely on perfection by possession Is this something we should investigate further Peter

index I have some thoughts on the discussion below The first point that should be kept in mind is that the Index language provided to you originally by Dianne Seib which I have reproduced again below is the language currently used in ECCs physical and financial power transactions in Alberta and has widespread industry acceptance I do not believe that rewriting it is in the best interests of ECC even if it is just for transactions between ECC and RMT as inconsistency particularly what could be significant inconsistency between the calculation of pricing could cause problems with ECCs ability to properly manage its position as well as regarding accounting and operational matters Also I am unclear as to how the original language provided to you by Dianne Seib is not specific enough to get someone to the specific pricing reference In Alberta we have always referenced the ActualForecast pricing table as opposed to the Historical pricing table and if the URL that is referenced in the original description provided to you by Dianne Seib is inserted into your internet browser it takes you directly to the ActualForecast table Then the column and row references set forth in the original description take you to the specific price point Therefore I am unclear as to how the previous description provided by Dianne Seib is not specific enough to get you to the actual price point As far as using the ActualForecast table as opposed to the Historical table I believe that both tables get you to the same point given that by the end of each day the ActualForecast table sets forth the actual pricing for each hour of that day In addition I do not believe that it is correct to use a price averaged over the day as opposed to the actual price for each hour during the day as is contemplated in the original description Perhaps it is different when using the index for weather derivatives but when entering into power swaps or physical power buysells it is essential to use the actual price for each hour rather than an average because a the determination period is each hour not each day and b more importantly it is very common to have a power product that only relates to certain hours of a day ie nonpeak hours or peak hours or has a term of less than one day in which case a daily average would be unacceptable Finally it is necessary to include the language provided that the Floating Price shall be corrected to reflect any Pool Price Errors as may be posted on such web page or otherwise communicated from time to time by the Power Pool of Alberta at the end of the description to deal with any pricing errors posted by the Power Pool Just to ensure we are talking about the same language the current language in use in Alberta for the Alberta Power Pool Index is as

<8442419.1075860246885.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,greg.johnston@enron.com,2001-04-03 04:27:00,Re Cash Collateral Cc I wanted to get back to you on your questions and also give a little more detail of the analysis As you know we have issues in Canada about taking cash collateral which issues have been clearly identified and communicated by Peter previously see his emails of March However as opposed to cash it appears clear under our personal property registration legislation that a certified cheque and a bank draft would fall under the definition of instruments Under such legislation as Peter has indicated below a security interest in instruments can be perfected by possession thus eliminating the need to register the security interest at the personal property registry which requirement to register creates the perfection and priority concerns we have with holding cash collateral Therefore at first blush it seems that a counterparty providing a certified cheque or bank draft to us in lieu of cash collateral or a letter of credit which certified cheque or bank draft would be held by us in the same manner as we hold LCs might solve our cash collateral concerns and make another credit instrument available to us for use in Canada There are a few concerns which I think are raised by your questions The first is that if we take the instrument and immediately convert it to cash and place the cash in an account we run into the exact same issues as we have with taking cash collateral in the first place The personal property security legislation specifically indicates that proceeds realized from dealing with the original collateral need to be perfected in the same manner as original collateral of the same kind ie where the proceeds from the bank draft are cash we need to then perfect our security interest in the cash as if the original collateral was cash meaning we have the exact same issues as we currently have with perfecting a security interest in cash collateral Therefore we would need to deal with the instrument bank draft or certified cheque in the same manner as we deal with LCs That is we would cash the instrument in payment of outstanding accounts at the time that we become entitled under the contract to apply our collateral against amounts owing to us from the counterparty We would have to actually hold the certified cheque or bank draft until such entitlement arose The requirement to hold the bank draft or certified cheque for a potentially extended period of time raises another concern about how long such an instrument can remain outstanding before it becomes stale dated and thus undrawable In other words it may well be that a bank will only allow such instruments to be drawable if they are presented for payment within a reasonable time of their issuance This is one point that would require further research if we are going to consider utlizing such instruments as collateral since the answer could obviously make the use of such instruments a solution for only very short term transactions if at all The final point I would make is also raised by your second question below My understanding is that the law in Canada has been somewhat grey in the past with respect to whether a person who issues a certified cheque or the bank on which the certified cheque is drawn can stop payment on such a cheque after it has been issued I believe that there may have been some recent Ontario decisions indicating that a cheque once certified must be honoured upon presentment and if the bank upon which the certified cheque is drawn refuses to pay it will be liable for the amount However we would need to look into this point further as any risk that a certified cheque can be withdrawn by the payor at any time after it has been issued obviously eliminates the benefit of the collateral I do not believe that the same concern exists for a bank draft as I believe it represents a fully funded obligation of the bank to pay which is irrevocable If we wish to consider using such instruments as an alternate form of collateral I would suggest that we have such use vetted by outside counsel and obtain an opinion as to the viability and risks associated with such use Since Stikeman Elliott provided our opinion with respect to cash collateral I would suggest that we use them to provide the advice on these points as well Please let me know if you would like me to instruct outside counsel to proceed Thanks Greg From Mark Taylor on AM CDT To Peter CT cc Brent nron Carol St CT Chris CT Greg CT Mark CT Mary CT Russell nronXGate Sara CT Tana CT Tanya nronXGate William S nronXGate Subject Re Cash Collateral Sounds like a great idea a couple of questions Can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest If not can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the customers draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashiers check Peter Keohane PM To Mark CT Sara CT Brent nron Mary CT Carol St CT Tana CT William S BradfordHOUECT Russell DiamondHOUECT Tanya RohauerHOUECT cc Greg CT Mark CT Chris CT Subject Cash Collateral Greg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cash collateral Without getting into detail a security interest in an instrument can be perfected by possession under the Personal Property Security Act and an instrument includes a bank draft If counterparties were to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we could rely on perfection by possession Is this something we should investigate further Peter
