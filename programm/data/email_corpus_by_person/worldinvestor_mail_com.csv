falling tech se ctor has led many to look at portfolio diversification In this volatile m arket diversification does not necessarily mean capital appreciation but capital preservation A diversified portfolio can increase your total return while decreasing yo ur total risk Get a system and follow it Gold stocks can be used effectively to diversify your portfolio since they tend to move in opposite directions than most other investments Gold sto cks are traditionally considered a safe haven Buying Gold stocks has proven a tried and true strategy in times of crisis When armed conflict erupts when inflation looms when the stock market pl unges investors often turn to gold for capital preservation Gold stocks tend to have a beta of one to two which means they are one to two times as volatile as gold itself The attraction of a high beta stock is that in a rising gold bullion market gold stocks out perform bullion Gold also has a mystique a psychological allure that keeps the stocks at oftenhigh multiples So far gold has not become an integral part of US institutional portfolio s while in Europe institutions have held percent to percent of their portfolios in gold for many decades US Institutional interest in Gold conferences in recent months and the i ncrease in the Gold and Metal indexes allows us speculate that the demand for Gold stocks is starting to rise and demand is greater than the supply of Gold stocks for sale World Investor October Profile Silverado Gold Mines Silverado Traded for years on NASDAQ Silverado became a fully regist ered SEC corporation in and traded on Nasdaq from until In due to declining gold prices and the advent of the US rule the company moved from NASDAQ to the OTC BB IMAGE Investors should be watching the new NASD ruling pertaining to the suspe nsion of the Dollar Rule until January and possible removal of the Dollar Rule in which case previously NASDAQ listed companies like S ilverado may be able to regain their full listing status if the dollar rul e is waved altogether Recently over percent of the companies on NASDAQ trade below or about issues Under the temporary relief provided b y the new rules companies will not be citied for bidprice or marketvalu eofpublicfloat deficiencies NASDAQ rules dictate that a company whose stock price falls below the mini mum bid price for consecutive trading days is given days to reach co mpliance If a company fails to meet those requirements once that period e xpires it is notified by NASDAQ and delisted and generally is eligible fo r trading on the overthecounter bulletin board If the dollar rule is waved altogether perhaps Silverado can apply for F ULL NASDAQ listing status once again Consolidation within the Gold Industry This year there has been some consolidation in the Gold Industry among the big players In June Barrick Gold of Canada said it would pay billio n for Homestake Mining of the US Recently South Africas AngloGold bid billion for Australias Normandy Mining Ltd Also South Africas Ha rmony Gold Mining has been on an acquisition trail buying up small mines a nd companies With consolidation in the Gold Industry taking place the number of public ly traded Gold stocks with PERCENT working interest in properties with RESERVES is becoming RARE The main asset of a gold mining company are its gold reserves Companies l ike Silverado have already outlined a deposit and are looking to develop i t The value of proven gold reserve depends on whether a property is an ec onomic ore body which means that the cost of production is low enough and that the price of gold is high enough so that a profitable mine can be bu ilt The main question for the junior gold companies is How will the company r aise the money to proceed to production There are basically three ways in which to raise money The company can issue new shares A joint venture partner can fund the cost of the entire project for a ri ght to earn a certain interest in the property which is antidelusive to current shareholders The company may be able to arrange debt financing In Silverados case they have expended US on their Nolan gold property alone have taken in gold during development work an d are working on closing needed to complete development to beco me a year round profitable producer on its owned mile by mile property North of Faribanks Alaska Past speculation in Silverado shares has spawned two Silverado share ralli es in recent months with the share price shooting up to cents in April and up to cents in April The chart tells us the stock shoul d be accumulated during periods of lower volume and low volatility IMAGE Chart provided by TradePortalcom Silverados Gold Properties Taken from Silverados press release dated Oc tober th Despite the past

combined total of ounces of gold THE NOLAN GOLD PROPERTY is located in the Koyukuk Mining District mil es north of Fairbanks and is a large tract of land six square miles in siz e During the last

test phase by the Company The President of Silverado Gary Anselmo gave his views on the current go ld market The last Fed interest rate drop of basis points to locks the cou ntry firmly into negative real interest rates which in the medium and lon g term should extrapolate into higher gold prices as the opportunity cost of holding gold relative to interest bearing notes decreases It appears t his trend has already begun We also find it noteworthy that when the Bank of England auctions gold it is always oversubscribed up to times Thi s tells us there is considerable excess physical demand that should begin to push spot prices higher IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION PLEASE VISIT THE COMPANY WEBSITE AND LEAVE YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION AT WWWSILVERADOCOM O R CALL MR BILL
