Jeanette Winholtz Barbara Cooper Bridgette Sartain Travis George Joe Tarbox Marcie Yazel Terri Peters Blaise Pearce Jessie Crow Rhonda Maidment Stephanie Flynn Jeffrey Alderman Larry Subject FW Stand Proud America This is absolutely riveting I have never heard it put this way before I was in tears as I sat here and thought about the thousands of people whose lives have changed forever A TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES This from a Canadian newspaper is worth sharing America The Good Neighbor Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair a Canadian television commentator What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth Germany Japan and to a lesser extent Britain and Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts None of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States When France was in danger of collapsing in it was the Americans who propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris I was there I saw it When earthquakes hit distant cities it is the United States that hurries in to help This spring American communities were flattened by tornadoes Nobody helped The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged countries Now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent warmongering Americans Id like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet the Lockheed TriStar or the Douglas DC If so why dont they fly them Why do all the International lines except Russia fly American Planes Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon You talk about Japanese technocracy and you get radios You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon not once but several times and safely home again You talk about scandals and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at Even their draftdodgers are not pursued and hounded They are here on our streets and most of them unless they are breaking Canadian laws are getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here When the railways of France Germany and India were breaking down through age it was the Americans who rebuilt them When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke nobody loaned them an old caboose Both are still broke I can name you times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble I dont think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake Our neighbors have faced it alone and Im one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around They will come out of this thing with their flag high And when they do they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles I hope Canada is not one of those Stand proud America This is one of the best editorials that I have ever read regarding the United States It is nice that one man realizes it I only wish that the rest of the world would realize it We are always blamed for everything and never even get a thank you for the things we do I would hope that each of you would send this to as many people as you can and emphasize that they should send it to as many of their friends until this letter is sent to every person on the web I am just a single American that has read this I SURE HOPE THAT A LOT MORE READ IT SOON

insights into afganistan From Date Tue Sep EDT To Subject Fwd insights into afganistan Hey Mom and Dad Noah sent me this and I think it is very important to read Love Brett From noah tevye warner Date Tuesday September AM To Dave chwabcom Subject Fwd insights into afganistan Hello everyone The following was posted here by a coworker on our companies internal It comes from her friend Tamim a writer and columnist in San Francisco who is also originally from afghanistan In light of Tuesdays tragedy and the unthinkable idea of what is yet to come I thought I should share this with as many people as possible Ive been hearing a lot of talk about bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Ronn Owens on KGO Talk Radio today allowed that this would mean killing innocent people people who had nothing to do with this atrocity but were at war we have to accept collateral damage What else can we do Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether we have the belly to do what must be done And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I from Afghanistan and even though Ive lived here for years Ive never lost track of whats going on there So I want to tell anyone who will listen how it all looks from where Im standing I speak as one who deeply hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden My hatred comes from first hand experience There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in New York I agree that something must be done about those monsters But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan Theyre not even the government of Afghanistan The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan When you think Taliban think Nazis When you think Bin Laden think Hitler And when you think the people of Afghanistan think the Jews in the concentration camps Its not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity They were the first victims of the perpetrators They would exult if someone would come in there take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country Some say why dont the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban The answer is theyre starved exhausted hurt incapacitated suffering A few years ago the United Nations estimated that there are disabled orphans in Afghanistana country with no economy no food There are millions of widows And the Taliban has been burying these widows alive in mass graves The soil is littered with land mines the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets These are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Trouble is thats been done The Soviets took care of it already Make the Afghans suffer Theyre already suffering Level their houses Done Turn their schools into piles of rubble Done Eradicate their hospitals Done Destroy their infrastructure Cut them off from medicine and health care Too late Someone already did all that New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs Would they at least get the Taliban Not likely In todays Afghanistan only the Taliban eat only they have the means to move around Theyd slip away and hide Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans they dont move too fast they dont even have wheelchairs But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs would not really be a strike against the criminals who did this horrific thing Actually it would only be making common cause with the Talibanby raping once again the people theyve been raping all this time So what else is there What can be done then Let me now speak with true fear and trembling The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops When people speak of having the belly to do what needs to be done theyre thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent people Lets pull our heads out of the sand Whats actually on the table is Americans dying And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Ladens hideout Its much bigger than that folks Because to get any troops to Afghanistan wed have to go through Pakistan Would they let us Not likely The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first Will other Muslim nations just stand by You see where Im going Were flirting with a world war between Islam and the West And guess what thats Bin Ladens program Thats exactly what he wants Thats why he did this Read his speeches and statements Its all right there He really believes Islam would beat the west It might seem ridiculous but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam and the West hes got a billion soldiers If the west wreaks a holocaust in those lands thats a billion people with nothing left to lose thats even better from Bin Ladens point of view Hes probably wrong in the end the West would win whatever that would mean but the war would last for years and millions would die not just theirs but ours Who has the belly for that Unfortunately Bin Laden does Anyone else In Peace Tamim
