Energy Situation February HOUSTON Feb PRNewswire El Paso Corporation NYSE EPG reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties involved to help improve Californias energy situation We are surprised to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning El Pasos involvement in California said Norma Dunn senior vice president of Corporate Communications and External Affairs at El Paso Corporation We would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record The significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power which has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate electricity High natural gas prices are therefore an effect rather than a cause of the power shortage Allegations that natural gas prices were deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue It is not possible for any holder of capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline to cause a significant increase in California gas prices by refusing to use that capacity The El Paso Natural Gas pipeline is required by law to post the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate found to be just and reasonable by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission All capacity held by El Paso Merchant Energy on the El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to serve California and other Western markets Allegations that there was a conspiracy in to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into California are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge The facts show that all new pipelines considered during the s were either built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer support to justify their construction For example despite years of marketing efforts by Tenneco not a single potential customer could be induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed Altamont project to proceed For that reason alone it was ultimately dropped In according to estimates there were between one and two billion cubic feet per day Bcfd of excess natural gas transportation capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving California Indeed it was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess capacity that prompted the California Public Utilities Commission to encourage PGE SoCal Edison and SoCal Gas beginning in and continuing into to relinquish over Bcfd of firm transportation capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline Processes are now under way to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity into California and El Paso intends to do its part to help satisfy whatever needs may be established today As recently as last year there were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands at that time Notwithstanding its availability this capacity was not used by shippers to California to fill in state natural gas storage facilities for future use If California had taken advantage of the opportunity in to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in prices at the California border could have been substantially mitigated or avoided It is now widely recognized that the California energy crisis was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in California to keep pace with the states economy and increased demand A combination of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices First the construction of new power plants in California is a slow difficult and heavily regulated process As a result the growing demand has far outstripped instate generating capabilities Second unfavorable precipitation and increased outofstate demand caused some of the hydroelectric power normally relied on by California to become unavailable Third increased demand for power in the western United States drove up prices that California had to pay to outofstate generators Fourth state policies deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their costs Fifth because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased costs to consumers the utilities creditworthiness was impaired causing supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and expensive to purchase Sixth the early and greaterthannormal use of peaking unitsplants that are designed to only operate under peak demand conditionsnecessitated unscheduled maintenance rendering them unavailable at critical times Seventh during the final months of some power plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air emissions credits Eighth a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold weather further drove up demand for power Finally the

Spot Power Prices Rise Spot power prices in the Pacific Northwest continued higher yesterday amid unit outages and strong natural gas prices A projected weekend outage at the MW Diablo Canyon Unit nuclear power plant and a day outage at the MW IPP Unit coal power plant should keep supplies scarce heading into next week At COB power for today rose over to Power sold at MidColumbia for today was up at Concern is mounting about the possibility of a dry year in the Pacific Northwest which could keep prices high into the spring In the Southwest power prices declined amid lower dayahead demand According to the California PX demand will peak at MW today Palo Verde slipped to per MWh while Mead traded down at per MWh Alliance Begins Commercial Operations Alliance pipeline is finally ready to begin commercial shipment of Canadian natural gas to Chicago from northern British Columbia today and operators are already talking about expanding the system Originally scheduled to begin flowing in October the delayed opening is set for the pipeline to begin transporting today The addition of the billion Alliance pipelines capacity curbed price increases at Chicago yesterday relative to spikes in the Northeast Cold weather headed for the East Coast triggered a price jump in the regions prices yesterday Prices at the New York City gate surged per MMBtu to a record high of while Chicago prices were only Up at per MMBtu Canada supplies about of US natural gas Alliance is one of two new pipelines beginning operations this week BC Gas C million Southern Crossing Pipeline from eastern British Columbia to the West Coast began pumping MMcf per day on Thursday in competition with Westcoast Energy For its part the Alliance system is seen by some as a key link in the eventual transport of Arctic natural gas to market BP Amoco has assumed the transportation responsibilities of eight shippers on the pipeline whose volumes total more than MMcf per day and plans to increase that amount Alliance partners include Westcoast Energy Enbridge Fort Chicago Energy Partners Williams and Coastal We will be adding Southern Crossing to the next base case Also some corrections are needed in our Alliance model Further research shows that the maximum receipt capacity from BC to be about day month and from AB to be day Alliance receives no supplies in the Northwest Territories and has no plans for doing so The only existing connection to NWT is into Westcoast I would change its capacity to day month increasing to day in Nova TCPL Alberta System is considering an extension into NWT in the future The current base case shows a need for more than day starting in So Ive set up a supply link from NWT into Nova at day starting in Pollution Credits Shutting Down California Power Plants AES says output from three of its power plants in southern California has been cut in half due to a shortage of pollution credits AES Pacific has curtailed MW of a total capacity of MW at its three naturalgas fired plants in the Los Angeles area Alamitos Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach The move followed the filing of a petition by the South Coast Air Quality Management District related to its Alamitos plant which had exceeded its NOX emission allocation Both Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach were close to reaching their NOX allocations The plants could operate if the California ISO declared a power emergency An arbitration board is due to rule in late December on the air quality districts petition California has been struggling to meet surging demand for power this year There have also been few power plants built during the last decade and the California ISO has had to issue numerous power alerts this year as operating reserves dropped to critical levels The California ISO says a number of other plants are also running out of pollution credits Coastal to Buy Pipe for Gulfstream Coastal has agreed to buy steel pipe for the Gulfstream natural gas pipeline from Berg Steel Pipe Corp for million Coastals mile pipeline will run from Mobile AL across the Gulf of Mexico to Tampa Duke and Williams which had been developing a competing project agreed earlier this month to buy Coastals pipeline Terms were not disclosed Coastals purchase was for the inch diameter pipeline to run through the Gulf of Mexico and the inch and inch pipe for Florida Pipe production will start immediately with delivery starting early next year in Port Manatee Florida and Mobile All of the pipe is scheduled for delivery by September and the pipeline is scheduled to start by June Coastal plans to complete the sale of the Gulfstream system this quarter According to Williams Buccaneer website upon closure of the purchase of Gulfstream by Williams Duke Gulfstream will be built in lieu of Buccaneer Our next base case database will reflect this change Power Marketers Accused of Manipulating Prices Enron PGE Energy Trading Duke Energy Trading and Marketing Sempra Energy Trading and Dynegy Power Marketing are among a dozen energy companies accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to manipulate California wholesale electricity prices The lawsuit claims companies selling electricity in California intentionally limited supply to drive up prices The suit seeks certification as a class action covering all electricity consumers in California estimates damages in excess of billion The allegations in the lawsuit are based on a number of studies of the states electricity market that concluded it was not functioning normally Southern California Edison and PGEs Pacific Gas Electric filed suit against state officials separately last month for permission to charge customers billions of dollars for losses from openmarket power purchases Bob Brooks GPCM Natural Gas Market

Energy Situation February HOUSTON Feb PRNewswire El Paso Corporation NYSE EPG reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties involved to help improve Californias energy situation We are surprised to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning El Pasos involvement in California said Norma Dunn senior vice president of Corporate Communications and External Affairs at El Paso Corporation We would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record The significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power which has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate electricity High natural gas prices are therefore an effect rather than a cause of the power shortage Allegations that natural gas prices were deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue It is not possible for any holder of capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline to cause a significant increase in California gas prices by refusing to use that capacity The El Paso Natural Gas pipeline is required by law to post the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate found to be just and reasonable by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission All capacity held by El Paso Merchant Energy on the El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to serve California and other Western markets Allegations that there was a conspiracy in to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into California are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge The facts show that all new pipelines considered during the s were either built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer support to justify their construction For example despite years of marketing efforts by Tenneco not a single potential customer could be induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed Altamont project to proceed For that reason alone it was ultimately dropped In according to estimates there were between one and two billion cubic feet per day Bcfd of excess natural gas transportation capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving California Indeed it was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess capacity that prompted the California Public Utilities Commission to encourage PGE SoCal Edison and SoCal Gas beginning in and continuing into to relinquish over Bcfd of firm transportation capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline Processes are now under way to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity into California and El Paso intends to do its part to help satisfy whatever needs may be established today As recently as last year there were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands at that time Notwithstanding its availability this capacity was not used by shippers to California to fill in state natural gas storage facilities for future use If California had taken advantage of the opportunity in to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in prices at the California border could have been substantially mitigated or avoided It is now widely recognized that the California energy crisis was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in California to keep pace with the states economy and increased demand A combination of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices First the construction of new power plants in California is a slow difficult and heavily regulated process As a result the growing demand has far outstripped instate generating capabilities Second unfavorable precipitation and increased outofstate demand caused some of the hydroelectric power normally relied on by California to become unavailable Third increased demand for power in the western United States drove up prices that California had to pay to outofstate generators Fourth state policies deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their costs Fifth because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased costs to consumers the utilities creditworthiness was impaired causing supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and expensive to purchase Sixth the early and greaterthannormal use of peaking unitsplants that are designed to only operate under peak demand conditionsnecessitated unscheduled maintenance rendering them unavailable at critical times Seventh during the final months of some power plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air emissions credits Eighth a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold weather further drove up demand for power Finally the increased power costs in California could have been substantially mitigated through longterm power contracts and less reliance on the volatile shortterm power market California is currently in a difficult position but now has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a longterm energy policy said Dunn El Paso has been one of the largest suppliers of energy to California for more than years and we are actively participating with all parties in California to be a part of a longterm stable solution to Californias energy needs El Paso Corporation the largest and most broadly based natural gas company in the world spans the energy value chain from wellhead to electron With an enterprise value in excess of billion El Paso is a leader in every phase of the natural gas industry The company owns and operates a significant portion of the North American natural gas delivery grid operates the fastest growing most sophisticated energy merchant group and is the nations
